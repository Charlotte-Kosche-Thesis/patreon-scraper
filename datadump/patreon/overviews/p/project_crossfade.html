Now a broken woman, she struggles to make it through each day, haunted by memories that won\u0027t leave her be\u2014until one day, she receives a message that her children might still be out there, somewhere, somehow, trying to make contact... and they need her help\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowdy! Thanks for visiting my Patreon! My name\u0027s Rob Cain\u2014known as \"Arcane\" on Twitch and Deviant Art. Creating video games has been my lifelong dream, and the more I play these amazing indie games, the more I find myself inspired to stop wishing on a star and finally step into the arena and chase that dream down. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCrossfade\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is the ship I intend to sail towards that bright horizon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2ilswNd.gif\" style=\"float: right; width: 266px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCrossfade \u003c/em\u003e(game as yet untitled)\u00a0is an adventure game that puts you in the role of Kimberly Coombs, a writer whose children have died, leaving her barely able to function, struggling to make it through each day. It\u0027s only when she\u0027s contacted by her children\u00a0from beyond the grave that she is galvanized into action, which is where the game begins proper. \u003cstrong\u003eNow you must solve a strange and otherworldly mystery to find Kimmy\u0027s children.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout the game you will interact with many of the people of Kim\u0027s city home,\u00a0including \u003cstrong\u003ea diverse cast of engaging main characters\u003c/strong\u003e, including Kim\u0027s gay best friend Jen, her trans brother Chris, black reverend Bill Carter, and more. You\u0027ll investigate both material and contextual clues and put together the pieces of the mystery. Along the way, the choices you make and the puzzles you solve will alter the course of Kimmy\u0027s life forever, challenging her faith, her sanity, and even her life. You\u0027ll experience and explore a living world expressed in a unique, hand-drawn environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruthfully, I\u0027ve made attempts before to tackle creating a game, but they\u0027ve all run into the same problem: I couldn\u0027t accomplish it alone, and I couldn\u0027t assemble a functioning team. That\u0027s why this time,\u00a0I designed this project to be something that I can do entirely myself. From the art style to the music to the game genre, I have experience and skill in every aspect of the game\u0027s design. \u003cstrong\u003eThis time,\u003cem\u003e I\u003c/em\u003e can make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn this earliest part of the project, my goal is simply to create a proof of concept that I can use to launch a Kickstarter. \u003cstrong\u003eThis is where I could use your help.\u003c/strong\u003e I would love to be able to focus on this project, but I also have to pay room and board. Right now, I work on the game in my free time; but with a little financial support, I can focus on it and get this ship launched sooner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this page you\u0027ll find an assortment of rewards for your support and milestone goals as my way of saying thank you, and to give you a chance be a part of the creation of something wonderful. It\u0027s not much, but I want to do a little something for you. If you would like to pledge your support, all I can say is thank you. \u003cstrong\u003eFrom the bottom of my heart, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e~Rob \"Arcane\" Cain\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
