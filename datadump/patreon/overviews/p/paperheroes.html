We are constantly humbled and amazed that you guys want to hear us goofing around. A simple \"Thank you\" seems paltry and inadequate, but what else can we say? Thank you! Thank you so much! You guys are amazing, and we are extremely humbled by your patronage!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have tons of episodes in the works - more giggles, chills, horrible sound effects, and great stories! But, we need your help! We are simple working class nerds who have to spend our hard earned cash on things that \u003cem\u003earen\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e server space, new microphones, and a dedicated soundboard - all of which help keep the podcast going. With your help, we will be able to update our equipment, bringing a much more consistent and listenable sound quality to our episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and it buys us snacks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd beer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know... the staples of a good D\u0026amp;D game.\u003cbr\u003e"
