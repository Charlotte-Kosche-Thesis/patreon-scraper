    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027d like to\nintroduce myself and the Pigrow; I\u0027m a life-long computer\nenthusiast, maker and also a gardening fanatic who was\nbrought up on the produce of our small garden. I\u0027ve been\nworking on designing and making devices to increase the efficiency\nand productivity of our garden and to help others experience the same\npleasures and health benefits home grown produce can provide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Pigrow Project has grown and evolved massively since I started it almost two years ago, since then we\u0027ve developed many new features, refined the system and started to grow the community of users and volunteers - hopefully this is only the start for the Pigrow, we\u0027ve got big ideas and huge dreams for it\u0027s continued development....\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis video introduces the Pigrow2 which was the first release version, since then lots has happened and developed...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/177886384?title=0\u0026amp;byline=0\u0026amp;portrait=0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/177886384\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePiGrow2 Introduction\u003c/a\u003e from \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/user9960711\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTimeTrav Prag\u003c/a\u003e on \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eVimeo\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Pigrow is an\nincredibly simple yet highly effective device for controlling an\nindoor grow-room. Using the brilliant Raspberry Pi Zero, a couple of\neasily available and inexpensive components plus of course the\nsoftware written by me it\u0027s able to automate and monitor the Lights,\nHeating and Air-Extractors so as to perfectly maintain the ideal\nconditions for growth. No larger than a regular plug-board and simple\nto set up using a phone, laptop or home computer via a wifi link\nit\u0027ll allow you to view graphs of the temperature and humidity in\nyour grow and receive status-updates and warnings wherever you are. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e#Why you should support the Pigrow\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll the designs,\ncode and comprehensive documentation will be shared freely to enable\nanyone to make their own as cheaply as possible or to modify the\ndesigns to their own requirements. I\u0027d like to  help people not only\ngrow the best possible produce thanks to the Pigrow but also to help\nthem learn about both gardening and automation. I\u0027d like to help Shepard the project into being a fully active community of users working together to improve, upgrade and expand the pigrow so we can all grow the best produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe real aim of this\nproject isn\u0027t to make money because to be honest I\u0027m not really a\nmoney person \u2013 as Voltaire said the best life is one spent tending\nones garden with friends. I want to help increase the quality of produce people consume, their interest in plants and nature and to allow everyone to have home grown food all\nyear round -- of course my main aim was and still is to develop the tools that I personally need\nto efficiently and affordably live a halcyon life of sylvanian\nbliss... I love plants and gardening, it\u0027s a real pleasure to be able to be involved in this project and I hope it\u0027s something I\u0027ll be able to continue to grow and develop.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney of course is unfortunately as ever much needed, I only work part-time so a little help to pay my rent and feed my while I\u0027m working on the pigrow would be much appreciated and undoubtedly help keep me and the project going, but most importantly it allows me to buy the hardware and tools I need to develop the Pigrow hardware - more sponsors means more sensors...\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e#Future of the Project\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently the remote GUI is being finalised and perfect for it\u0027s first full and proper release, this is a wonderful tool which makes using a pigrow really easy - still plenty of features left to add into it but already it\u0027s a really useful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe Pigrow is designed to use interchangeable scripts making it easy to add in support for new sensors, devices or advanced features, not only are we constantly developing new scripts but we\u0027re currently working on perfecting and documenting this system and writing guides to help novice or expert coders modify or create scripts for the pigrow, hopefully this will allow people to introduce some really interesting and cool features.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also going to be using the Timelapse feature to make some videos demonstrating the effects various things have on plant grown, Timelapse is a great way to monitor and\ndiagnose your plants by actually watching them respond to stimulus\nwith various forms of tropism and growth bias,\nit can really help open up a whole new way of looking at vegetation and I\u0027d like to make some video guides so people know what to look for and can understand what\u0027s happening when they use the pigrows timelapse features.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to create\u00a0a range of videos and educational resources including games and learning toys which help people understand the fascinating and beautiful world of plants, using dual grow cabinets and a range of time-lapse, microscopy, thermal imaging techniques, sensor data and etc i\u0027d like to create a series of comparison videos which really help demonstrate the effects various conditions have on the growth of plants and to help people understand the best ways to look after their garden.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Beyond this I\u0027d like to create various other\ndevices from water-butt cleaning to vertical wall garden systems all\nusing highly modern automation to aid natural growing processes and\nenable even the busiest people to have productive home gardens.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e---\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your interests and good luck with your garden!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThanks and any questions, comments or ideas please message me here or at calvineurof@yahoo.com."
