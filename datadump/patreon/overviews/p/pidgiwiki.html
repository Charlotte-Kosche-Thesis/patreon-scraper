    "summary": "Hello! My name is Matthew Verive. I\u0027m a student in Chicago, Illinois studying Information Technology with a minor in Music Studies. With any spare time that I\u0027ve got, I run\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.pidgi.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePidgiNet\u003c/a\u003e, home of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.pidgi.net/wiki/Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePidgiWiki\u003c/a\u003e, one of the largest video game media sites on the Internet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I was eight years old, I discovered Pok\u00e9mon. My first game was LeafGreen, the newest game at the time, and I got hooked immediately. Before I was even at the Elite Four, I started a Pok\u00e9mon fan site on Geocities called Pok\u00e9mon Regions (\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.pidgi.net/old/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u0027s a backup of the site I found on a floppy disc\u003c/a\u003e). Over the years, Pok\u00e9mon Regions evolved into Mew\u0027s Playhouse, Route One, and eventually PidgiNet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPidgiWiki itself started in 2008 as Pok\u00e9mon Resolution, a crude directory-listing style website that hosted several dozen pieces of official artwork from various Pok\u00e9mon games. After other Pok\u00e9mon fans contacted me wanting to contribute, I set up a wiki in early 2010 that was dubbed \"PidgiWiki\". Since then, PidgiWiki has expanded to over 12,000 pieces of official video game media, including artwork, logos, box images, and sales documents. And not only is PidgiWiki not just Pok\u00e9mon anymore, but any and all video game assets are part of the site\u0027s goal.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Ir2g8gP.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027ve never visited PidgiWiki,\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.pidgi.net/wiki/Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003echeck it out\u003c/a\u003e - I still get amazed by the sheer amount of content every time I look for images on the site. Looking for artwork for the latest Super Smash Bros. title? PidgiWiki has\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.pidgi.net/wiki/Category:Super_Smash_Bros._for_Nintendo_3DS_and_Wii_U\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eover 250 images\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u0027ve still got more in the backlog to upload.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks to dozens of partners, ranging from game developers to journalists to fans and everywhere in-between, PidgiWiki is expanding more than ever. However, the site does take a whole lot of time, and server costs are increasing as the site becomes more popular. I want to continue making PidgiWiki the best resource for video game media, and I hope you want this to happen, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAny donations through Patreon will go directly towards the website, whether that be to help cover server costs, work to obtain additional sources, or purchase rare asset discs. A previous fundraiser through GoFundMe helped me obtain three Nintendo asset discs, the contents of which were never before publicly available."
