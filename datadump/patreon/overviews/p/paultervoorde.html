Hi Paul! What brings you here? Begging for moneeey?! Heh heh heh!!\u003c/h3\u003eI want to make \u003cstrong\u003ea brand new animated show\u003c/strong\u003e! But for that I need your help!\u003cbr\u003eThese days it\u0027s getting harder and harder for me to find the time to do work of my own.\u003cbr\u003eI keep getting busier and busier with work, which is great! But it has a down side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs great as some of these projects are, I don\u0027t always get compensated for the time I spend making \u003cbr\u003ethese cartoons. Some times I work 14 hour days, just so I can make enough money to pay the bills \u003cbr\u003efor the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich I don\u0027t always mind, since I love animating so much! But this has turned into a endless cycle \u003cbr\u003ewhere I hop from one freelance job to another. This has been happening for the last 5 years.\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have free time anymore to bring you something original, something that I know some of \u003cbr\u003eyou guys would like to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027ve came up with this idea. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set up two goals on my patreon for (the) two different show(s) that I want to make.\u003cbr\u003eMy first goal is for \u003cstrong\u003eSkeff\u003c/strong\u003e. For \u003cstrong\u003e2000 dollars per month\u003c/strong\u003e I will start making a series of Skeff shorts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hsjm5tNZBdA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat! 2000 dollars?! That is so much money! Are you insane?!\u003c/h3\u003eYou would think that, but it\u0027s not as crazy as you think. Tax takes a big chunk out of that and with \u003cbr\u003ethe remaining money I will have just enough to get by each month. Meaning, I can stop freelancing \u003cbr\u003efor a little while and dedicate my time to bring you a \u003cstrong\u003ewhole bunch of Skeff cartoons\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow here is where it gets a little crazier. My second goal is \u003cstrong\u003e5000 dollars per month\u003c/strong\u003e so I can start \u003cbr\u003eworking on a show I really want to animate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s called \u0027 \u003cstrong\u003eJasper and Ted \u003c/strong\u003e\u0027. This is a big one and I need full support for this. I would defenitely \u003cbr\u003eneed a extra bit of money for this so I can hire a extra pair of hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/0e7fddda5bf8ab754620246e88037ed9/tumblr_msloebxcIZ1rcw6seo1_r1_1280.jpg\" style=\"width: 536px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMan, 5000 dollars?! You are out of your mind! \u003cbr\u003eWhy ask for so much each month! I am getting out of here!!\u003c/h3\u003eMaking cartoons (\u003cstrong\u003eEddsworld \u003c/strong\u003efor example) is a hell lot different from creating regular YouTube \u003cbr\u003evideo content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I\u0027m real passionate about making a good looking cartoon, it usually takes me up to a month \u003cbr\u003eor some times 2 to make one of these.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI take care of every drawing, I make sure the backgrounds look great and I simply enjoy it when a \u003cbr\u003ecartoon looks like something that could be shown on TV.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, it\u0027s a lot of work. I will follow up with a time-lapse video shortly so you can see it for \u003cbr\u003eyourself.

But what if you can\u0027t reach your first goal?\u003c/h3\u003eWell, I am expecting it to be less. Reality is a bitch! \u003cbr\u003eIf that happens, I unfortunately won\u0027t be able to start animating a new show just yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I would still really apreciate your support! A lot of artists see Patreon as a tipping jar. Any\u003cbr\u003emoney you donate will help me get through the struggle of animation. \u003cbr\u003eSo yea, see it as a tipping jar until I reach one of these goals. Then I will get serious!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t help out money wise, that is completely fine! \u003cbr\u003eOne other thing you could do is \u003cstrong\u003eshare this page with your friends\u003c/strong\u003e and let them know I want to \u003cbr\u003emake a new show, that will help out just as much! =)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWill I get something out of this when you reach one of your goal?\u003c/h3\u003eYour money won\u0027t just help bring quality animation, in return you will get unique behind the scenes content. Screenshots, storyboards and animatics will only be available to you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExclusively for Patreon Supporters!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven rough animations will be shown on the spot, I usually publish these other after a final release. \u003cbr\u003eBut these will be available \u003cstrong\u003eright away for Patreon supporters!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo give you a \u003cstrong\u003eexample,\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI have an \u003cstrong\u003eanimatic available for you right now\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4q8QqrGnbM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you start supporting me right now.
