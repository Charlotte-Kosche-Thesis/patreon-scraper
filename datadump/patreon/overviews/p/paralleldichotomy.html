    "summary": "ParallelDichotomy is a mental health blog. I\u0027m Sheila, owner and operator. Nice to meet you! I worked in the direct service mental health field for five years and am one semester short of my Bachelor\u0027s Degree in Social Work. I left the professional mental health arena in January of this year after a psychiatric hospitalization. Turns out I have fairly severe Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Bipolar Affective Disorder. Despite having to take a step back from my career, my passion for mental health advocacy, making a positive impact, and breaking down stigma has not lessened at all. After a few friends prodded me, I started blogging about my experiences, as well as sharing resources and coping skills that others can use in their own recovery. Since starting this project, I have also contributed to The Mighty, been a guest on the Sarah Fader Podcast (with the CEO and Founder of Stigma Fighters) and the \"Do Not Listen to This Podcast Podcast\", which is a Podcast made and produced by some local high school students and their teacher. Through joining projects like this, I am helping to not only joining the conversation with other advocates, but also helping to cultivate a conversation among people who may not be having it otherwise. I use honesty and humor to engage with people and have productive, respectful, and interesting conversations on mental health and mental wellness in our society.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParallelDichotomy is growing, with upcoming podcast appearances scheduled, further contributions to The Mighty and other sites, and a few other really exciting collaborations coming up!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m looking forward to being able to continue to grow this project to increase the impact it has and to continue the overall fight to end stigma, educate, and advocate for acceptance, understanding, and quality care to facilitate recovery.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u00a0"

     "about": "Hello! My name is Sheila and I am a mental health blogger and advocate, doing my part to fight stigma!\u00a0I\u0027m in a fairly unique position to help challenge stigma as I spent 5 years working direct service mental health and 3.5 years studying social work prior to being hospitalized for my own symptoms\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve since been diagnosed with PTSD and Bipolar Affective Disorder. This experience made me even more passionate about contributing to the mental health conversation, which is so desperately needed. I believe that through sharing stories of successes and struggles, and exchanging resources, we can all make a positive impact on the way our society views those of us living with mental health diagnoses. By becoming a Patron, you are enabling me to continue to help cultivate conversations on mental health, trauma, trauma informed care, and what it is to live with co-occurring mental health diagnoses. Together, we can fight back stigma through education, celebration our successes, and much needed advocacy. Thank you for your time!\u00a0",
