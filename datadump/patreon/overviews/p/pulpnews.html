You are helping us say what\u2019s important, both in print and online. You are helping us say what\u2019s important in Colorado. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n7 Amazing Reasons to Support PULP.\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSupport independent, unbiased journalism.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAmazing people don\u0027t work for free.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProviding opportunities to young, intrepid reporters.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFight the brain-drain in Southern Colorado.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eKeep PULP affordable for small business advertisers.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMore patrons mean more PULP content.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBuilding a better community\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy Patreon?\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause we get asked all the time, \u201cI love what you all do, how do I support the PULP?\u201d This is how. Plus we get to communicate with you in a different way. We can give you early updates of what we are working on and send you Colorado-themed amazing things and updates. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eThe long version...\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhy support PULP?\u003c/h1\u003e\nSupport independent and unbiased journalism. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u2019s really that simple. We don\u2019t have a political agenda to push. And we aren\u2019t owned by a media corporation who only cares about shilling advertising. We care about our readers, our advertisers, and our staff. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAmazing isn\u2019t free.\u003c/h3\u003e\nOur content will always be 100% free but the amazing people that create our content don\u2019t work for free.  We are committed to paying our staff and freelancers what they are worth. \n\u003ch3\u003eProviding opportunities to journalists.\u003c/h3\u003e\nEvery supporter is personally helping young journalists do what they love because we give oppurtunities others don\u2019t. You are creating opportunities to young journalists.\n\u003ch3\u003eFight the brain drain.\u003c/h3\u003e\nWhen PULP sees talent it can publish; we bring that reporter, designer or artist on board. Now you can help fight the brain too.\n\u003ch3\u003eKeeping PULP advertising affordable for small businesses.\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe may be crazy but we don\u2019t believe that we should take advantage of advertisers just for a buck. Help businesses gain more customers the responsible way.\n\u003ch3\u003eMore PULP content.\u003c/h3\u003e\n Simply, patrons will allow us to do; more content, more publications, more print and digital stories. And more super secret projects.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA better community\u003c/h3\u003e\nPeople who love the PULP aren\u2019t strangers so let\u2019s have some fun building a better community.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eQ/A\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf I give you a ton of money, will you write whatever I want?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nUm, no. This goes against everything we believe in. Members can always suggest stories, provide feedback and tell us how you think we are doing. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIs this a subscription?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYes and no. Our content will be free as always. This is just another way for people who love the PULP to support what we are doing and help us produce more of it. And we\u2019ll keep you up-to-date on what we are working on. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSeriously though, why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPULP has doubled its growth by 120% each of the last two years. We aren\u2019t hurting. The old model of journalism is broken and evil. The old model was rich corporations pay their journalists so poorly off such expensive advertisements. For it to succeed it needs to take advantage of your sensibilities just to gain a few ad bucks. We aren\u2019t here to fix that model but to eradicate it from the face of the earth. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
