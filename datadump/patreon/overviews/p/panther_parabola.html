Sara has begun to realize that her physical changes are just the surface of a new world of experience she must face. Karen continues her journey deeper into their family, following Sara down a rich and creamy path destined for \u0027growth\u0027. And Andrew, our young and small adventurer, does everything he can to protect the people he loves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTani\u0027m, the guardian of the forest, discovers that there are things she may fear more than the wolf, and while the true nature of her pain has yet to be realized the depth of it cannot be avoided.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapter 18 is nearing completion. Part 3 will be posted soon, concluding Tani\u0027m\u0027s portion of this chapter, and setting the stage for her path towards a difficult recovery. There will be at least two more sections, and while they will likely be smaller than the ones that have come before, they should be just as enlightening, and full of fun moments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eAbout My Story\u003c/h4\u003eAndrew is a small and frustrated young man, who finds himself dragged to an unfamiliar place. His parents service in the military has meant a lonely existance, constantly trying to make a life for himself, just to be pulled to some place new the moment he begins to make progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Pacific Northwest was not what Andrew expected, and what would have been a normal and difficult year quickly becomes... something magical. A chance encounter with a local woman changes the course of Andrew\u0027s life, and the late teen soon finds himself fighting more than the local bullies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h4\u003eI have created this site in response to requests from a few of my fans on Literotica, where my stories seem to be gaining some popularity.
