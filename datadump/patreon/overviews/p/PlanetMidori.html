    "summary": "I\u0027m a creative, artist, educator and author. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art genre would be best described as \u003cem\u003eSocial Practice\u003c/em\u003e. What exactly is this? I create situations where people get to be part of the creation and expression of complex emotions. My official art bio on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ranshin.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy portfolio site\u003c/a\u003e says:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Midori is a multidisciplinary artist fascinated with giving shape and texture to emotion, memory, desire, beauty, repulsion, collective memory and subconscious revisions of experience....\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003eMy work is mostly about experiences and interaction. You can see my work at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ranshin.com\"\u003ewww.Ranshin.com\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much of my work isn\u0027t \"things\" that people can buy and hang on the wall. It takes a lot of work behind the scenes, then it\u0027s done in one night. Much of this I\u0027ve been funding myself... Yes, this is nuts and not smart. \u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027m possessed by an irrational desire to create these. And the results have been received really well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe good news is that more and more of the creative spaces and organizations are giving me the space to engage and create.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHowever, funding and making time to create between the money scramble is still a problem.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor my other work, I\u00a0create unique learning experiences for grown-ups to seek joy, creativity and pleasure. \u00a0This comes in the form of workshops and books about sexuality, relationships, culture, communication, spirit of play, BDSM, and personal development. I travel far and wide, taking my classes to people so they can learn in the unique environment of in-person workshops. I love teaching and meeting people in person!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, this means my bandwidth become seriously limited for art and creative work. Over the past decade, I\u0027ve tried to figure out how to carve out more time out of the day. \u00a0I\u0027ve been building fantastic teams for projects. This has been a blessing. But still I\u0027m facing the truth of physics. Time is finite - and so is my creative bandwidth in this time line.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn order to realize the amazing new things I have planned, I need to be more sustainable. If not, either these projects will never be created for you to enjoy, or I will burn out trying to make something possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeither option is good. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need help. \u00a0Your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBOOKS:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a couple of books I\u0027ve wanted to write for some time. \u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I haven\u0027t been able to make the time to write this. \u00a0I\u0027ve tried writing on planes, in cars, in hotels and during events.
