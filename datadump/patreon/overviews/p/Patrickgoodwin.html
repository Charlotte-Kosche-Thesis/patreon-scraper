    "summary": "Hey everyone. Obviously I\u0027m an artist and am much better at turning my thoughts into art than into words, but bear with me.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 My name is Patrick Goodwin, I\u0027m a tattoo artist out of Raleigh, North Carolina, originally from the midwest. I\u0027m what, in the industry, is referred to as a \"new school\" tattoo artist. Though it hasn\u0027t been \"new\" for some time.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0As a tattoo artist I\u0027m lucky enough to be able to share my art with people on a permanent level and meet some awesome people while doing it. Through patron I\u0027d like to be able to expand my audience. There\u0027s a lot of people that enjoy my artwork, but wouldn\u0027t wear it for the rest of their life lol. I\u0027d like to reach out to them and also the people away from where I am that maybe do want me to tattoo them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 I hope to use patreon as a platform and income to help me achieve a few thing. I\u0027d like to publish a sketchbook first and foremost. I\u0027ve done it before on a very very small scale (ashcan) and was happy with it, but would love to have a much more finished book. I would also like to be able to travel more places and do more conventions, tattoo conventions, anime and comic conventions. Giving people from elsewhere an opportunity to commission me to draw or tattoo them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 To some people their art is very personal to them. For me, it\u0027s very public. I want people to see my art and I want people to enjoy my art. I hope when people do see it, that they enjoy look at it, as much as I did making it. And for some, I can only hope, that it inspires them to draw the way so many inspire me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
