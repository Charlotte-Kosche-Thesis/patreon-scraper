In the past, I\u0027ve been an art teacher, run my own\nart courses for adults and even re-enacted the lives of great artists for children. For the last few years I\u2019ve been creating art videos.\n My aim is to help people to draw and\npaint, learn about great artists and art in general. YouTube is a great vehicle\nfor doing this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI work full time creating my videos and with your support, I\ncan continually strive to improve the quality of my videos by upgrading the software, sound\u00a0 and video equipment required for producing them. In return, you could get cool rewards such as a personal critique of your art\nwork, your name displayed as a sponsor on the video description and access to exclusive\nbehind the scenes action (dependent on your pledge amount, tier descriptions\nare in the right-hand column). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLets work together\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can feel proud that by joining our\nselect group, you are indirectly helping the art education of lots of people around the\nworld. Many, probably, may not have access to the art\neducation, I was lucky enough to enjoy here in England. Together, let\u2019s help people\nbecome the artists they want to be, to learn about art, feel confident in what they do,\nand be proud of the fact that no one in the world draws and paints like they do. Hopefully, my art videos can make a small contribution towards the achievement of their goals.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, if you want to help me by becoming one\nof my patrons, it will be very much appreciated. Any contribution will be\ngreatly valued and please be aware, you can cancel at anytime should you so\nwish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for your time. Paul\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I\nstarted teaching way back in the \u201970\u2019s, became a Head of Art at a Grammar\nSchool in the UK for a number of years, before joining the senior management\nteam of that school. In 2000 I left teaching to explore new pastures, setting\nup my own arts business providing art courses and interactive art events for\nthe corporate world. I also found time to develop my own painting. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2008 I came up with the idea of running art workshops in school, but I\nneeded something to make my workshops stand out from the crowd. I came up with\nthe idea of running art workshops as a great artist such as Picasso, Monet etc..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nrecreated the lives of 12 artist\u2019s in total with workshops to match and by 2016\nI could not cope with the demand from schools. I am lucky enough to have my own\nstudio, so the solution to the problem was obvious, to create my recreations of\nartist\u2019s lives as videos. I also produce \u2018How to Draw and Paint videos too all\naimed at beginners and those at the beginning of their journey into art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt history videos:\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtube.com/artistinschoolcouk\"\u003eYoutube.com/artistinschool\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHow to Draw and Paint videos:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtube.com/paulpriestleyart\"\u003eYoutube.com/paulpriestleyart\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
