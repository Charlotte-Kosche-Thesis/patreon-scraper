    "summary": "The Planet Chili series of tutorial videos takes you from zero programming experience to the level of a skilled C++ programmer with close-to-the-metal knowledge and a strong grounding in graphics theory. Whether your goal be to create a custom engine based on Direct3D or OpenGL, or to create a game using a pre-made engine like Unreal Engine 4, this tutorial series\u0027 focus on fundamental skills will give you the tools you need to succeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more information about Planet Chili and the video series, visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ChiliTomatoNoodle\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy YouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e or check out the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://forum.planetchili.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePlanet Chili forums\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe tutorial videos will always be made available free of charge.\u003c/strong\u003e However, I have routinely been asked by people in the community about how they can donate to support my videos further, and so I\u0027ve made this Patreon. The money you pledge will go to pay for equipment and software, and if there is enough support, to enable me to reduce the hours at my day job by a day or two a month so that I can devote that time to creating more content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reward system I\u0027m using for this Patreon is a little different than usual. Instead of giving one-off rewards like a T-shirt or some other goods for supporting at a certain tier, I\u0027ve decided to keep track of how much you have pledged, and allow you to select rewards based on that amount. \u00a0Each $1 USD you pledge in total will earn you $1 in ChiliBucks you can redeem for perks and rewards. This is a little more flexible, in that you can support at the amount you want to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e get whatever rewards you want. Pledges are processed monthly to keep things nice and simple.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition ChiliBucks I will release periodic bonus content that all active Patrons will get links to. This won\u0027t be tutorial content, as I do not want to lock that stuff away behind a pay wall. Expect things like unedited long form videos of me just doing some programming or other tech stuff, maybe some gaming stuff, or just some unscripted/unedited talks about technology/science subjects. There may also be Patreon-only livestreams or hangouts to discuss things like what content you would like to see for Patreon videos etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a tentative list of rewards and their redeem value in ChiliBucks:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnlocking previous Patreon videos: $2 / video (see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wiki.planetchili.net/index.php?title=Patreon_Exclusive_Content\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethis page\u003c/a\u003e for a list of unlockable videos)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShout-out and have a short message/question read out in a v-log video: $8\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrivate Skype session (programming help or whatever): $1 / minute (min. 15 minutes)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCommission custom tutorial video: $3~$6 per minute (min. 10 minutes)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings like the custom videos are of course subject to my skill in the area and my interest level in the topic. If you have any ideas for other rewards you\u0027d like to see on this list, let me know! I\u0027m always looking for better ways to reward my Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for all your support!\u003cbr\u003e- Chili\u003cbr\u003e"
