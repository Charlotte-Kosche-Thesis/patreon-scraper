    "summary": "Hi there! My name is Phoe, and I\u0027m a former Let\u0027s Player, current Speedrunner, and coming in the near future I hope to be adding long form game review and discussion videos to my repertoire. I love what I do and want to continue to put as much effort as possible into learning how to get better at it. You can find my stream at twitch.tv/phoekun, or my youtube archive at youtube.com/phoekun\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll notice this page is pretty spartan, and that\u0027s on purpose for the moment. Opening a Patreon account is one of the most requested features by my followers looking to support me, and I\u0027ve waffled on having one for a long time. For now, I am not offering any rewards for people who pledge money; you\u0027ll have to make do with the warm feeling of helping better someone\u0027s life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, you\u0027re not offering rewards!? What\u0027s the point?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI know it sucks, and there\u0027s nothing more I\u0027d like than to give back to you guys for being so awesome. But after thinking long and hard about it, I realized that at this point in my life I don\u0027t have anything sustainable I can offer that\u0027s in keeping with the principles of fair play for all my viewers I try to uphold. In the future I hope I can find a stable, cool perk I can toss at you all as a thank you for your amazing support and patience, but at the moment I think it\u0027s best to be honest about the level of commitment I can offer. For now, think of it like a big, futuristic tip jar.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of it this way. If you enjoy my stream, this is one way you can tell me that you want to see more. The more stable my income gets the less I have to worry about life and the easier it will get for me to dedicate more of myself to offering more and better content. If that\u0027s not your cup of tea, or if you just plain can\u0027t afford to hand out money without seeing a concrete return on investment, then no worries! I completely understand and hope to see you on stream days all the same.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time, understanding, and support!"
