    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHi! My name is Przemek K\u0142osin. For several years I\u0027ve been working as a professional comic book artist. My main employer is a Dutch publisher Don Lawrence Collection, but I\u0027ve also done few projects for Zenescope Entertainmen. My own projects haven\u0027t been implemented for many years, because I have to take many different jobs, not related with comic, because without that I would not be able to provide for my family. Now Patreon gives me hope that this could change. Only with your help, I can bring one of my characters to life and tell you his story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-bru2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/20265041_10210210027749132_2206293903571334201_n.jpg?oh=25186fd624322bf0859a14ebc4614f6d\u0026amp;oe=59EC4F64\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my characters is Adam. He is the protagonist of Comer. Comer is\nthe oldest of my projects, which spent almost 10 years on the shelf. All\nthese years the character and the story has been evolving. Comer is not supposed to be a never ending story, it\u0027s a closed\nstory and I\u0027m confident that now thanks to you, it will\nsucceed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-bru2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/20265049_10210210057629879_3111574078020313680_n.jpg?oh=7271f4a0b91de0907663c5ac483884f3\u0026amp;oe=5A0857BD\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDescription:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDue to a tragic turn of events Adam is leaving his hometown, and moves to new  place, totally strange to him. After he sails across the ocean, he gets to a place which at first sight seems very peaceful and with great perspectives, but reality is not so bright. It turns out that someone in the city kills immigrants. Adam decides to do something about it. With the skills, taught to him by his father, he goes to the streets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHarbor Police is dealing with the case as well. It\u0027s a special unit dedicated to removal of illegal immigrants, coming on ships from all of the world. Among the policemen is David, called The Cop.
