Hence, an early-release is a good thing for me, first off I am able to get much more feedbacks from fans, hear out the new contents they wish for, and be able to ammend whatever necessary. Secondly, it also helps in funding the game, with much more resources, I might be able to invest in more in hiring people to work along, and benefits more to the players in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon Donation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an Indie Developer, and not many people know how struggle it is to actually deliver a good game, it involves designs, gameplay balancing, experimental with feasible features, bugs resolving, graphics \u0026amp; physics optimization, arts polishing, music production, and many more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom time to time, I worked freelance to feed myself and as well to support my family financially, and I got distracted and exhausted coming back to creating my own game, it requires so much efforts and inspiration for creative works. It is really thankful if you could make a little donation support in any sorts of form, sharing in twitters, facebook, talk alittle about the game to friends, but most practically a little donation to help me getting full time development and focus on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMuch Loves,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePapaonn.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
