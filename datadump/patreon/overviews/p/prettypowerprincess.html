Well, it\u0027s a long story that I don\u0027t feel like writing down. Let\u0027s just say it involves squids and powdered milk, and leave it at that. But you\u0027re not here to read about that dark part of my childhood. If you\u0027re reading this, you\u0027re either a fan of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.prettypowerprincess.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePretty Power Princess\u003c/a\u003e, or you\u0027re browsing the dark side of Patreon. Now that I have you here, let me lay out the business.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/394a68ed5c0e92acaa8ce90ecec8aba8/tumblr_ndpstfYXzb1qaszh0o1_250.gif\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWeb comics are not near as valuable as selling battle-squids on the black market. Web comics just don\u0027t make a lot, if any, money. Especially mine. It\u0027s basically me working an extra job and doing it all for free. But since I love the job, it\u0027s worth it. (Insert: Aw here.) I will continue to do the comic for free, but if I want it to grow, I need some help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/m7FO0p9hTc59e/giphy.gif\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou probably know how this works. If you don\u0027t, let me tell you.\u003c/strong\u003e Basically, you give and you get. Simple, right?  Supporting me will get you involved in the process. It will allow you a chance to talk to me as a creator. It will give you behind-the-scenes insight into my creative process. You\u0027ll be the first to know about upcoming events and my future plans. I\u0027ll email out bonus images as they come about. And I will get on social media and promote the shit out of anything you\u0027re making. If you\u0027re not making anything, I will promote the shit out of you as a person. Because you\u0027re clearly awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/19319eef3aab848f6b9313dfcbd24d60/tumblr_n4yxgfej4Z1qf9mevo1_500.gif\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I DO with your money?\u003c/strong\u003e That\u0027s a good question. I will put it back into artistic creation, production, and exposure. That\u0027s great, but isn\u0027t that what \u003cem\u003eALL\u003c/em\u003e the artists say? What\u0027s it mean for you? It means I will use your support to purchase supplies. I will use it to print graphic novels, banners, shirts, and all sorts of swag. Finally, I will use it to go to conventions where I can meet all of you, and spread the love of PPP.*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Thoughts:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eYou won\u0027t be paying for the roof over my head, or for me to have a meal. Literally every dime will be going back into my art one way or another. So supporting me will just give you more to love. I believe in Patreon and how it\u0027s helping support artists. I think this communal approach is the way art should be. I also believe you should be getting the most out of this relationship. If you are looking for more or feel like you\u0027re not getting your money\u0027s worth, let me know. I want this to be worth it for you, whether it\u0027s $1.00 or $50.00, you have my ear.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading all this and your support.

That doesn\u0027t mean I won\u0027t throw in some other art and fun things. \n  \nSo what is Pretty Power Princess? What\u0027s it all about? Those are good questions. It is a web comic featuring a video game princess who decides she\u0027s had enough. She\u0027s done waiting on some hero to rescue her. She breaks out of the dungeon and in doing so, breaks the game. Follow her as she makes her way home to level one, fighting enemies trying to bring her back and the heroes trying to rescue her.\n  \nSo if you like what you see, want to give a little bit, and get a little bit in return, please support Pretty Power Princess.\u003cbr\u003e",
