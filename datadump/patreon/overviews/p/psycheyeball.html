    "summary": "Hello everyone. I\u0027m Psychedelic Eyeball and I\u0027m some weirdo on the Internet with an even weirder voice. I\u0027ve been creating Video Let\u0027s Plays of many games since 2007, covering a bunch of games nobody quite knows or remembers anymore (The Prince of Persia trilogy by Broderbund Software in the 90s, Rise of the Triad, Puddle) and some better known stuff (Super Meat Boy, System Shock 2). I also like to showcase other old MS-DOS games and Commodore 64 titles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately, I\u0027ve been streaming games (mainly of the old-school variety) that I either like or find intriguing. I played on stream the early Grand Theft Auto games, the Fallout series, Deus Ex 1 and 2, just to name a few. I especially like platformers and first-person shooters, but I sometimes cover games in other styles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to expand my efforts making more in-depth Let\u0027s Plays and adventure out of my comfort zone by covering older games I missed out on but want to explore. Additionally, I make music that few people listened to, but enjoyed and I\u0027d also want to create more. Of course, all these adventures require time and resources I don\u0027t have access to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. If you really enjoy my content and feel like supporting me, I\u0027ll be able to provide content you like while also helping me pay my bills. Pledging will allow you access to my Discord channel and talk to me and other fans of my work about anything you want, vote on games you\u0027d like me to play or stream for you and who knows... I could even make music for you and you could use it for whatever video/project you had in mind! However you wanna help me out, it\u0027ll be fun."
