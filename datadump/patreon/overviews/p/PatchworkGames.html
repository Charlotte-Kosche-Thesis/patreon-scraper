    "summary": "Howdy! I\u0027m Patrick Rodriguez. I make\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thelightaesthetic.com/games\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egames and funny internet art\u003c/a\u003e. I love creating things, learning new things, and experimenting with weird and silly ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m currently working on several independent game projects, and hope to use Patreon to allow me to devote more time and resources into making them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow this works: If you like the games I make and are interested in seeing more, you can become my patron on here, and pledge to give an amount of money every time I release a game. You can set that amount at whatever you like, and set a monthly limit that you won\u0027t go over (although it is unlikely that I\u0027ll release more than one game a month at this time). In exchange, I\u0027ll be able to continue making games in my spare time, and you\u0027ll be able to get the scoop on my work before everyone else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOne of the biggest projects I\u0027m working on right now is called\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://8bittygames.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e8 Bitty Games\u003c/a\u003e. It is a series of 8 games for the original Game Boy system. The first game, Yarn Ball, was recently released. It is a puzzle game where you play as a ball of yarn rolling around a series of caves. It is currently available for download at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://patchworkgames.itch.io/yarnball\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eitch.io\u003c/a\u003e or in-browser at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://8bittygames.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e8bittygames.com\u003c/a\u003e. The second game is a rhythm game called Tiny Dancer, where you must learn and follow a series of dance steps that gets faster and more complicated every round!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m also working on some non-digital games, and would love to share those with you, too. One of them is a storytelling card game called Legends of Beforia that is currently being finished up and getting ready for publication hopefully Spring 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe funds raised through Patreon will help offset the costs of hardware, e.g., extra Game Boys and flash carts (and batteries!), and any software I might need, as well as prototypes and publication for non-digital games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for contributing! If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/lightaesthetic\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@LightAesthetic\u003c/a\u003e on Twitter or email me at patrick@patchworkgam.es."
