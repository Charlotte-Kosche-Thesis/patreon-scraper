    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eArtists are very pensive people. At\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.postmortemmag.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePostmortem Mag\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, we believe that if you are an artist, you are never finished. Even if you finish a creation and then move on to the next project, that last one can linger. Just because you close the book on one aspect of your life doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s actually over. We want to explore that, provide a platform for people to reflect on their past works, figure out how that experience shaped them, what they\u0027ve learned, and what advice they can give to those looking into similar pursuits. Because everyone already knows how you got there, but nobody tells the story of where you\u0027re going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThat\u0027s the description on our site, and the basic premise of our little publication. We love the creative process and want to get people\u0027s thoughts on their own experiences, whether it\u0027s something they learned while publishing software, or an emotional trip they went through publishing their first novel, or even expressions of random thoughts that can occur while creating something (this happens to us all the time). Anything is up for grabs as long as it celebrates the art of creation and reflection. The term \"postmortem,\" usually used to describe pieces that present the aftermath of a work, sums that up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal for creating Postmortem Mag was to give artists a new space to discuss their creative processes. Each new experience has the potential to provide a new way of thinking about the world and about art and industry and I want to give those pieces a platform. These are things you find on individual blogs, but never all in one place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur fourth issue,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.postmortemmag.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eReflection\u003c/a\u003e, is up on our site if you want to take a look. It features pieces from writers, filmmakers, and artists who decided to take a risk with their work in 2015. Ever wonder if it\u0027s possible to write 12 novels in a year? Or if you can get over negativity in your life through filmmaking? Check it out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this Patreon for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePostmortem Mag\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/i\u003eis a budding publication and we want to get the ball rolling. We\u0027re looking to publish issues quarterly while also providing a space for guest posts and other content throughout the year. Currently our issues feature writing, but we\u0027d like to expand into other forms of media as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPlus, and I\u0027ll put this frankly, we would like to pay our authors. This is so important to us and we want to be fair. Our goal is $50 per piece to start, and we\u0027re there right now, but we hope to increase it as time goes on and maybe bring on more authors per issue because $50 is an \u003cem\u003eokay \u003c/em\u003estart. I would also like to commission an artist to do some work each issue, and maybe one day bring on an editor to help me with the workload. Every amount that goes above the goal will go towards paying contributors more per submission and to making the site more functional. Any amount that goes to the editor will also go into upkeep costs for the website itself and to adding more content and features.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour subscription will ensure that the contributors will be compensated and will support unique essays and other works that, no matter how sad or funny, talk about the art of creation. And that in itself is pretty cool. We hope that you enjoy our little mag!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegards,\u003cbr\u003eCarli Velocci - Founder of Postmortem Mag.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
