     "about": "Paper Panda started in 2010 with Louise Firchau making lyrical papercuts from recycled paper.\u003cbr\u003eSince then it has grown and now has three very distinct styles and a multitude of merchandise so that everyone can have a piece of the original bear.\u003cbr\u003eThe Bird \u0026amp; Bunny series of papercuts have been hand drawn and hand cut by Louise. They are inspired by Quarwood, where the Panda family lived in a little cottage in the Cotswolds surrounded by animals and woodland life. They now live in sunny Bourton on the Water, but it\u0027s okay because Bunny \u0026amp; Bird like it here, too.\u003cbr\u003eThe Storybook series (and other gothic darkness) is a cute collaboration between Mr \u0026amp; Mrs Panda. Louise tells Ryan what to draw with a waggy, pointy finger over his shoulder and only when he gets it perfectly right she cuts it out of paper. It\u0027s a good bit of teamwork.\u003cbr\u003eThe typographical pieces are created using digital software. Louise studied typography at university and it became an obsession. \"There is nothing more satisfying than creating a piece of graphic art using amazing fonts and hand cutting it so perfectly that no matter what the size it looks like it\u0027s been printed.\"\u003cbr\u003eLouise \u0026amp; Ryan have recently joined forces to create sketches and coloured aceo\u0027s and prints of the Woodland Friends.\u003cbr\u003eNow Paper Panda has it\u0027s own range of giftware, kits, supplies and guest artists that can be found in the online shop. Everything that has been created is made by small UK businesses wherever possible.",
