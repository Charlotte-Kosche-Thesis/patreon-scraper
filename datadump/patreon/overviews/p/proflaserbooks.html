Enjoy!!!!(!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m raising money on Patreon to work toward publishing some of the books and games I have in development. When I reach my first goal here, I\u0027ll be able to publish one of my longer works, be it a science fiction novel, game sourcebook, a board game, or a comic fantasy novel. Why not just mention one? Because I am still in the process of completing each, and regular patrons will have a bit of input in which of my projects get my attention.
