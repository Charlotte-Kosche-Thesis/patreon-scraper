I\u0027m Pitchfork Cosplay and I\u0027m creating creating sewing and cosplay-related content for anyone who can benefit from it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout this Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e! Think of it like a blog. In it, I hope to share any long-form tutorials and compilations of content from my other social media channels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a full-time grade school teacher who builds cosplays and cosplay-related content in my spare time and this Patreon\u0027s schedule will likely reflect that but you are welcome to whatever you can find of use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in seeing the chaos in pseudo-realtime (and considerably less organized), you can follow me on Instagram at:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/edit/%E2%80%8Bhttps://instagram.com/pitchforkcosplay\"\u003ehttps://instagram.com/pitchforkcosplay\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy intention is to provide creative content for anyone interested in consuming it. I can\u0027t even count the number of times I\u0027ve had projects saved by the incredibly generous communities found on social media. As someone who was not particularly invested in any platform, Patreon offered the best balance of technical platform, stability of the business model, reach into the creative community, and opportunities for growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have any particular plans to \u003cem\u003ego pro\u003c/em\u003e but I also want to be honest: being a full-time creative or creative instructor would be a dream. If an opportunity presented itself for me to make regular creative content supported by patrons then I want to keep that door open and (ideally) keep all the content I produce in one place. That said...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e... the content released as Free will always be Free!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf some life change happens that later has me adding rewards or tiers, you can bet you\u0027ll know about it, with some significant warning and with a complete explanation of how I intend to change operations of this Patreon (hopefully, for the better!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, it\u0027s just enough to hit the \u003cstrong\u003eFollow\u003c/strong\u003e button!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood luck and happy making!\u003cbr\u003e"
