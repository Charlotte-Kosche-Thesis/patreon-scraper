From painting, airbrushing, drawing, photography and the digital arts, he just simply enjoys it all. His goal is to create images that grab you and say, \u0027I have a story to tell...\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJeremy W. Martinson was born June 23rd 1971, in the town of Horton, Kansas. Much of his childhood was spent in the mountains of Colorado. However, he returned...\u003cbr\u003eJeremy is... a bit like a rock star... Except he has no fame, fortune, groupies, and well, even a band! Also known as Ponie\u00c2\u009d in certain circles Jeremy continues to have a dream, (or a vision if you will), of pursuing art as a career. However dark forces, so dark that they can not even be seen, tend to ground him in this world commonly known as reality. Attending Fort Hays State University, Jeremy studied Art and Art Education but stumbled into a medical career. Still living in the waste lands of Kansas he works nights in a sleep center as a LPN/RPSGT. Also he served two terms as Mayor of Gorham, KS.\u003cbr\u003e",
