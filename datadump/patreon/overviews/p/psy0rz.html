    "summary": "Currently i\u0027m working on the continuation of the ESPEasy project. The founder of the project (Martinus) asked for a successor, since he didnt had the time to do it anymore. A few months later i discovered ESPEasy stepped in and took over management and further development of the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome things I already did:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMerged a backlog of changes from the stable version into the new major release Martinus was working on. (called \"mega\")\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAllowed users to contribute more easy by streamlining the development process on git.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreated a central issue tracker to get grip on all the bug and features users need.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIntegration with Travis to automaticly verify contributions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreated separate development tracks for cutting edge and stable releases. (\"mega\" and v2.0)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAutomated nightly releases by creating a build bot.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSetup slack to communicate better with other developers and wiki maintainers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStarted working on a automated test suite.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCountless hours of debugging, bug-fixing and coding.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eGetting the next stable release out (v2.0). Its a bumpy road but we\u0027re getting there.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuilding an automated regression test suite and a hardware platform called \"The Rig\". This will allow us to automaticly test our code with actual hardware.  Testing is one of the most difficult things to do with a project like this: We have over 70 hardware plugins and over 10 controller plugins. To test every big change with all the plugins is virtually impossible, unless its automated.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore info about ESPEasy:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.letscontrolit.com/wiki/index.php/ESPEasy\"\u003ehttps://www.letscontrolit.com/wiki/index.php/ESPEa...\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDevelopment activity:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy/pulse/monthly\"\u003ehttps://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy/pulse/mon...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther opensource stuff i\u0027ve created: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/psy0rz\"\u003ehttps://github.com/psy0rz\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003ePaypal link for direct one-time donations:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/psy0rz\"\u003ehttps://www.paypal.me/psy0rz\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to thank everyone that contributes to this project: It wouldn\u0027t be possible without you!\u003cbr\u003e"
