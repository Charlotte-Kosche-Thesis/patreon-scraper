    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi! My name is Ronda Wood and this my Passion!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile this page was originally created just for my PlayfulDead Productionz comicz, it has now evolved! I would like to share my creativity on all planes. I will share creationz from my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PlayfulDeadCreationz\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePlayfulDead Creationz FB Page\u003c/a\u003e, and occasionally writings from my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RainbowRealmsBlog\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eR.K. Wood Author FB Page\u003c/a\u003e. There are many forms of creativity I am drawn to, and I hope to share them all with you here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI will share, at random, sketches and drawings to non-Patrons but the bulk of my work here will be for those supporting me. I will be showing any free content or previews for paid only content through\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://playfuldeadinc.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy DeviantART Page\u003c/a\u003e but want YOU to see it all here, and before anyone else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dream big, and hope you will all help me to see those come true. We all have to start somewhere, right? And while I love my Facebook, Etsy, and\u00a0DeviantART pages and their interaction, I\u0027ve decided to approach something new. It never hurts to try! I hope you will join me on this new journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Can You Help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA small pledge each month will start this dream rolling. The small amount of money, far and few between, I get through selling physical pieces unfortunately goes straight to the long list of overdue bills and living expenses. I\u0027m not looking to bleed hearts, but we all know how the economy works these days. I am a full time college student and no longer able to fund the clay and tools I need to create stock before being able to sell. My energy is also sadly stretched to it\u0027s max at the end of the day/week, leaving me with little time to create. I\u0027m still small, and working hard to build myself up but it is certainly an uphill battle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a lot like Kickstarter, but instead of one larger donation, you can pledge a little every month. I hope this will help with some consistency to pull back from a full-time day job once I graduate, and do what I really love.\u003cbr\u003eYou should not feel obligated to contribute. Whether you\u0027re able to pledge or not, I will keep releasing pieces through my\u00a0DeviantART page\u00a0for free, along with clay items up for sale when I can! If you want to help in another way, consider sharing your favorite things I\u0027ve made with your friends on social medias. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Does It Mean For You?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do choose to become a patron, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. It will give me more time and supplies to create! You will also get some fun rewards; like being the first to see a new works, Patron Only work, and maybe even a personalized piece to call your own!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Does It Mean For Me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt means I can continue to do what I love, without the stress of the everyday. I can continue to build my skills, and share with an audience who loves what they see! While I, of course, love to create for myself; seeing someone else fall in love with something I\u0027ve made is the most exciting feeling in the world for me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am coming back from a hiatus with my traditional arts, so I hope to start out with a bi-monthly comic for Patrons only, and will upload other free pieces at random. As I reach my Goals, this will increase, as well as other added fun stuff! I hope you will help me get there!\u003cbr\u003e"
