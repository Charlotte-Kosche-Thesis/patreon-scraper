She is one of many such relationships springing out of the Phidippus Project.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhat is unique about Genifer is not only her seeming awareness of intent, it is her reciprocal curiosity. \u00a0It is her evident recognition of the part of me that recognizes her.

And an opportunity to show another being the best of ourselves and the world around us.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHer continuing series has value beyond entertainment.
