I appreciate that you\u0027re even reading this, but before we go on, there\u0027s something you have to know. This Patreon account is special and unlike most, will \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eCHARGE YOU UPFRONT!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eMost accounts will charge you at the end of the month. This one takes money before it lets you see the content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is because my account was targeted by a \"scraper\" bot, coded by an idiot. Scraper bots make fake accounts to steal art from Patron pages without any intent for paying for it. Then they upload the art to their shitty, virus laden image boards. The bot that attacked me was created by a paint huffing spaz, so it would make a new account \u003cem\u003eevery time I uploaded\u00a0something. \u003c/em\u003eIt would always go for the highest tier rewards and quickly became a problem dispite the account being very obvious. This meant Patreon let me on their beta program to charge upfront. As December\u0027s debacle that almost sunk the site showed, they had no interest in expanding this, so I\u0027m extremely lucky. So thank you bottom feeding script kiddie! Your mad github copying skills has bagged me a rare account!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what you can do is pledge then withdraw immediately if you so desire. This is a dick move to most Patreon users, but it\u0027s fine for me as I still get paid. Once you pay, you have access to the content until end of the month, so there\u0027s no need to wait until the last day to pull your pledge and screw my estimates\u00a0up.\u003cbr\u003e"
