It has been my lifelong dream to make my living doing comics ever since I was a wee lad who heard that you actually can be paid for doing something so awesome as telling stories and illustrating what you imagine up in your mind. It sounded the best thing ever and my mind has not changed since!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComics to me have always been most fascinating form of art, they tell a story and bring entire worlds to life, they are manageable way to portray the most fantastic things without multi-million budget and the freedom involved in comics is not limited just to funding but the subjects you explore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you pledge to me some cash you help me to focus more on my art and worry less about keeping myself fed and clothed. I want to give my life to the creation of comics and have many great ideas and stories in my mind, and only thing that truly frightens me is that I would have to go to grave one day without having told all and every one of them to other people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me to tell my stories! Sit down by the fire and join me for a tale of high adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003eAll PayPal transactions are subject to the PayPal Privacy Policy.\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e"
