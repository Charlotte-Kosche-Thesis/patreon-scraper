Whether it is the social determinants of health, local economy, sustainable urban development, local food or a myriad of other social goodnesses, this community-led and hosted third space creates life in the space between organizations and silos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will host and narrate a Summit on the initiative of your choice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Collective Impact Partner we would like to offer you up to five seats in any dialogue we host. Feel free to pass those along to team or community members. You will also be invited to a Collective Impact Partner\u0027s Working Circle where we will serve what is coming to life in the space between our organizations. There are big wins to be had in that space. (It\u0027s kinda liberating, and so surprisingly smooth and easy.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will also receive a 20% discount on seats in our training events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease note: Funds in USD.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
