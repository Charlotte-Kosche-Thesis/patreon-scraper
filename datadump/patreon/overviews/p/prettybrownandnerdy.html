The channel\u2019s inception back in 2014 was born out of us finding a hole in the youtube community we knew we could fill with our combined passion and knowledge for all things nerdy. You know that expression, \u2018Be the change you want to see in the world\u2019? Well we adopted that as our mission on Youtube so other nerds of color could find channel and geek out over the latest thing happening in our world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVsjqgxPdLA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eSo what is Pretty Brown and Nerdy\u0027s Patreon all about?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWe basically set this patreon up so you could help us deliver more of that content you love! Our mission is to create great content and have fun while doing it, and (believe it or not) maintaining all of this takes work! Everything comes from our brains, our pockets, our time\u2014and keeping our content coming consistently takes *drum rolls*\u2026you guessed it $MONEY$ We need more of that green in order to keep this machine running. Your support really helps all of the magic happen.\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAlthough to some our lives may look awesome on camera, in reality we work extremely hard to make this kick-ass nerd life happen! Everything we do from making merchandise, promoted content on social media, traveling to conventions, maintaining our website, updating video equipment, and more comes from us. The three of us all work hard to make this happen. Not only do we do this through creating videos, but outside of our productions we work full time jobs that (sadly) don\u2019t have to do with Youtube. Making these hobbies that we share with you our main priority,\u00a0my friends, is the end goal!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eIt would be amazing to have fan funded support to keep up this gig and make it bigger, better and more consistent for everyone! \u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhat exactly will we use this patreon support for?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nVideo \u0026amp; Streaming Equipment\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eBeing a content creator is EXPENSIVE fam. Here are just a few things we have to fork up cash for in order to keep the show on the road: SD cards, tripods, camera lenses, editing software, and more. ISSA LOT. We want to always be able to dish out the best quality for you the viewer whether it be on Youtube, Twitch or Facebook. Right now, we are pretty limited as far as equitment goes, we all have cameras and that is how we have been able to get your videos so far but there\u0027s so much else involved...who would have thought? Game capture software and webcams are our next venture because we want to have high quality streams for you to enjoy.\u00a0On top of that the three of us are separated, living in different cities with very different schedules which makes everything even more difficult. We are really aiming for our content quality to be CONSISTENT and high quality no matter who is uploading a video. It\u2019s important to us that everything we post to come out with the same kind of look and finish!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nWebsite\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eDid you know we have a website?\u003ca href=\"http://www.prettybrownandnerdy.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Pretty Brown and Nerdy\u003c/a\u003e is a lovely little site ran by just the three of us. We have big things planned for it, but right now the most we can do is keep it running because it takes $$$ to keep a website up to date and interesting. It\u2019s just us writing articles for the site (something we\u2019d really like to do more often, but there\u2019s that thing called time) and on top of that it takes money just to keep the site up! We want to have credibility and a place for people to find us outside of Youtube so having that website stay up is IMPORTANT!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nTravel\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWe cannot even begin to tell you how many times we get comments on our social media asking when are we coming to this con or that city. In order to travel, host panels, and conduct interviews for all of you, we need to be able to get there! Filming videos, planning panels, and hosting events costs time and money (there seems to be a theme here eh?). In order to have more cons invite us as press or guests we must build rapport and part of that is maintaining our brand and making sure our voices are heard! We really would love to be able to travel to all types of events across the US, (and beyond) to be up on the latest and greatest in nerd culture, and most importantly MEET YOU NERDS!\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAs we said before we all live in different cities but we are still a unit and want to bring you videos that incorporate all of us as much as possible! Making videos that involve the three of us can be hard to do at times with travel expenses, hectic schedules, and lives to live. We are still making it work, but with the help you provide we can truly bring Pretty Brown and Nerdy to the next level!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to hear us our and for all of your support! Your generosity is greatly appreciated if you end up choosing to help us out on our journey!
