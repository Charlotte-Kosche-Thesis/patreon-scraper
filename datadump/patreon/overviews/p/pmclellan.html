    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Patrick McLellan, the famous European Train Thief here to talk to you about the danger of bats moving into your garage. I\u2019m a comedian and host of the premiere Houston Astros podcast Lima Time Time, as well as a handful of other shows like Math? and the Haunting Hour. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFew things bring me more joy than being live on the air or recording a podcast. Those few things are my children, Polka, and guys named Griff. I have a streaming station at mixlr.com/pmclellan where a lot of shows air live, as well as plenty of custom live content such as charity shows with The Super Devil rapping for hours, or a World Series game with some weird ass shaman with a maybe racist accent. I\u2019ve also gone live at comedy shows like 12K Degrees Live at Come and Take It Comedy Festival with Zach Dickson and Mycal Dede.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point is I seek out any reason to do a show. The catch is all of these shows and streamed events take time and cost me money to make. I don\u2019t like things that cost me, like that Mummy I bought from Egypt that was cursed by a Sphinx, or \u201cmy way of living.\u201d Let\u2019s cut to the chase. Give me money, or else. I\u2019m a cop. You legally have to pay me now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make a streaming station full of consistently entertaining shows, and still do sporadic \u201chaunts\u201d because I feel like it. I have two daughters going off to college in 5 years, and I hear that is quite the expense! So, let\u2019s make a deal. You give me a lot of money in exchange for so much content and cool shit that it starts a funk band. Thank you so much for checking out my campaign, and for supporting me in any way, monetarily or not.\u003cbr\u003e"
