Today, the Pauper cube is played around the world. Every\u00a0\u003cem\u003eMagic\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0release brings new commons\u2013and a crash of update requests from fans like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow you can join in making the cube even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout the feedback and support of others who love the Pauper cube as much as I do, it\u0027d be impossible to keep such an amazing way to play tuned up. I want to hear from more of you, and give even more time (and cool cards) to the fans and players that make the cube possible."
