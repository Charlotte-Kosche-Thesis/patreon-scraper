Basically anything and everything I can think of having to do with what goes into the creation of paintings; design, technique, drawing, aerial perspective, color theory, inspiration, critiques, art criticism, brushwork, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m absolutely passionate and even driven to share my knowledge and experience. I produce videos that make learning how to create good art, simple and accessible.

Every month, your donation will go towards making sure that \nthese videos get uploaded week after week, and making sure that\n I stay sane while trying to balance my art career with my YouTube \nchannel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m Starting a Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eLike all good things, these videos take time to produce. A lot \nof time - between research, writing the scripts, filming, editing, etc.  I upload videos weekly, so in order to keep the quality high and the content fresh and interesting, I have to make sure that I spend time on them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI need your help.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a way \nfor me to focus on exactly what I want to do both in the world of painting and on YouTube and to dedicate the time that I need to \nensure that the channel grows and flourishes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I could do instead of Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI could spend all of my time painting. I\u0027ve decided that I\u0027m a good teacher and that although there is truly no greater joy than standing in front of my easel and having something come to life in front of me, I think I should pass on what I know.
