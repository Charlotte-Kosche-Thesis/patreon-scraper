    "summary": "I\u0027ve been a novelist for over twenty years now, and I\u0027ve always written books in different genres - magic realism, science fiction, gothic mystery... even some everyday realism at times, too. I love trying out new cross-overs and team-ups and I\u0027m always exploring where to send my characters and stories next. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the idea of a Patreon blog, and writing directly to an audience. Publishing books takes so long, and it\u0027s such a tricky process. Lots of the more wayward and eccentric ideas get lopped off and lost along the way. But... just like in the old fairytales, I love some of the sidesteps and detours - that\u0027s where some of the best adventures happen...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s always happened in my books, too, is that my characters have crossed over and between all my stories - teaming up and making guest appearances - and the stories tend to sprawl and continue beyond the boundaries of the individual books I publish...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m going to start publishing some of the stories and chapters that I write on a new blog that you can subscribe to. Many will feature characters and places that might be familiar to you from my books. Others will be completely new. It\u0027ll be a new way of keeping up with some of the stuff that I do, in a more up-to-the-minute way. And then my regular readers will see the wider world I\u0027m busy creating... \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also be doing drawings for all of these things, too, because that\u0027s how I work. I love to illustrate my stories and it\u0027s partly how I conjure characters up. In the past these have been confined to my notebooks... and more recently I\u0027ve shared pictures on Facebook. My pictures and paintings will be a regular part of this blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also write some autobiographical stuff. My own life has crept into my fiction over the years, but I\u0027d like to write some pieces that come directly from my life. I\u0027ve got some great true stories that I\u0027d like to share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope all that sounds good..?\u00a0"
