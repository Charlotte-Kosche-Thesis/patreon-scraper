I\u0027m a graphic designer and illustrator who owns Trash Queen, an online shop, as well as works online as a fashion blogger!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a physically disabled 24 year old, recently graduated, living in a small house I rent with my partner. It\u0027s my dream to be able to 100% focus on my business full time, as it is my passion. I love making things for people to wear, that allow them to feel confident about themselves, as well as art that is both surprising and enriching. Being able to combine my loves for design and illustration with my interest in fashion--particularly body positive, affordable fashion--especially to help folks who fashion typically ignores, really fuels my work!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you end up pledging money, no matter how little it might be, you are literally helping to fund my dreams and giving me the ability to finally follow them!!!! You are not only helping to make the ideas I have a reality, but making life a lot easier on me and my partner, and helping me make a difference in other people\u0027s lives as well through what I make!"
