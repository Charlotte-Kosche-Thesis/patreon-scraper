We undoubtedly value the support of collectors, but the pool is small, and only so many people can buy and collect art.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe could redirect our energies toward optimizing our program so that it fits the current trends of the market, but this could severely alter Postmasters\u0027 DNA.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe could convert to a non-profit, but this would weaken the economic support artists need, and our energies would be too directed toward garnering philanthropic support rather than finding and cultivating new talent. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, we are instead choosing to rely on the community at large, which has given us support over the years, and we hope to reach and build a new community, too. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe see a new way forward in this model, one that draws strength from the collective and collectors, one that continues to develop markets for artists\u2019 most urgent work, while providing a vibrant, independent program to an engaged global community of supporters. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e***\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQUESTIONS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a supporter-driven platform through which a distributed global network comes together to fund new creative projects, on a monthly basis. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe platform enables a two-way, responsive dialogue between Postmasters and our patrons. We want to build new relationships. We want your feedback. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn practice, Patreon is similar to a membership or subscription model, but you decide the amount you want to give. On our page, select your level of monthly support \u2013 ranging from $3 to $500 and above \u2013 each of which comes with a monthly reward. Patrons can increase, decrease, or suspend their patronage at any time. Patreon will charge you on the first of each month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat rewards and benefits do patrons of Postmasters receive?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe first and greatest benefit is the one we also share: the continuation and expansion of a vigorous and independent program, supporting boundary-pushing artists. This is what we have been doing all along, and what we feel is needed now more than ever, when so much of our culture is determined by financial returns. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBy doing more of what we do best \u2013 helping distinctive artists achieve and share their vision \u2013 Postmasters will serve our community better. And, we will provide our patrons with enriching rewards that augment the gallery\u2019s general programming. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe rewards and opportunities for each level of patronage are detailed below. In the list, you\u2019ll find invitations to early viewings and special events at the gallery, as well as Patreon-specific content like artist interviews, peeks behind-the-scenes, and more. We want to hear from you, too. We\u2019re open to discussion, ideas, and feedback about how to make this model work for us and you, our patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e***\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOTHER QUESTIONS WE ANTICIPATE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does my support go toward?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe expense of operating a physical gallery cannot avoid market realities. A physical space (which we feel is essential and helps foster community), production, shipping, insurance, staff, and digitizing our archive all require a constant stream of money. Your support will enable us to cover the expenses needed to deliver and expand our programming, and to support and develop artists\u2019 most innovative work without compromise. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou are a commercial gallery, already profiting from selling artists\u2019 work. How do you justify taking additional income from your audience?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the current system, a commercial gallery\u2019s revenue derives almost solely from sales of art, in one form or another. Postmasters are a primary market gallery: we organize exhibitions to sell art directly on behalf of artists, rather than focus on the resale of artworks for collectors. The challenge for artist and gallery alike is to realize the most exceptional work without succumbing to the influence of market trends or the pressure to compromise to make a sale.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWith more support from more patrons, we will be able to do more for artists, and thereby affect larger cultural change. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe understand that each of these answers brings up new questions. By signing up for Patreon, your feedback will help us refine these ideas. Together, we can imagine new possibilities for the art world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e***\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE FINAL MANTRA (if you read this far\u2026)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe artist\u2019s job is to be a witness to their time in history.\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 Robert Rauschenberg\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eExploring the new and the unfamiliar is what the best artists do. Supporting them is what the best galleries do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAt Postmasters we believe in growth, but not in verticality of ambition, or a single path that everyone must take to succeed. There is always \u201cA New Way.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s the thing: galleries are defined by their program. Galleries are not a thing of the past. In the art ecosystem, they are not shops, nor are they museums. They are by definition local and stationary, and that comes with power to create an active hub and a community around a place. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn New York, we want to be your destination space: large enough to have several projects presented at once; personal enough to be a place to hang out, talk about art, and contribute to ideas reflective of our time. Online we want to deliver as much content as humanly and electronically possible and foster new passions and conversations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eJoin us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
