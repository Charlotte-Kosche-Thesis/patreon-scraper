Unfortunately I cannot devote as much energy to it as I would like, as having to pay bills and maintain myself take priority... which results in me working 6 days a week and being frequently exhausted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge money would help me not only acquire new games for the channel, but also new equipment to increase video quality further, and open up new consoles and handhelds for recording. Any extra pledge money would also help support me and possibly allow me to not have to work two jobs, resulting in more time for the channel and my live stream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do greatly appreciate any support that comes my way, and feel this may be a good format for allowing for that."
