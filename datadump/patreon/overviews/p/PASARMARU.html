Call me Maru! ^0^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe short of it is that I\u0027m a Malaysian-based degree student with a love of storytelling. Most of my works have featured some degree of comedy, tangled with existentialism, and all decorated in flowery language.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe long of it is that I\u0027m the 20-something Sophie, who is better known as Maru. Maru used to be an \u0027alter-ego\u0027 of sorts, but after being more open about my hobbies (writing, illustration, etc.), the two personas started to merge into some strange fusion of the multiple facets of my personality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy talent for writing came from fanfiction, and scantilations of shoujo manga during my youth. It\u0027s become something so much more, and so much bigger from then on. I\u0027m excited to see where my skills and creativity will take me from here, as it\u0027s come so far from that point in the past.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS THIS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon account was originally created to showcase all of my work, but I decided I was going to use it to focus specifically on my writing, and anything involving it! It also serves as a neat log of my work, and the process behind it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePREVIOUS WORKS (AS A WRITER): \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurple Lipstick Designer Club (under VANIMARU PROJECT)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSpectrum: It\u0027s Life in Colour\u00a0(under VANIMARU PROJECT)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGods Among Men (under SHA-PEN)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRed Beans\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSUPPORTING_ROLE\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://myself.online/maruum\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(You can find more of my other work - voice over, acting, audio mixing, illustration, design, on my homepage.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SUPPORT ME?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo boost my self-esteem, and keep the creativity coming (ie. giving me money).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut no, really. I just really like sharing my work with others, and hope to make them laugh or something. Some of the most fun I\u0027ve ever had had come from writing a particularly angsty plot twist for a roleplay group I was involved in back in the day, and watching the chatroom collectively scream at it all. I felt incredibly powerful, and it was fantastic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO I GET?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI tried to make more than one tier, but I honestly... didn\u0027t know what else to put as a reward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe patron-only posts will all be progress stuff, thought processes, and audio logs in relation to my work. I\u0027ve often been asked how I\u0027d come to the conclusion of something, or how I was inspired to write something, or how I was able to produce something like that - it seems like these are some secrets that are worth something, true?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCAN I SUPPORT YOU ALTERNATIVELY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot into Patreon?
