We provide \u003cstrong\u003esanctuary to 62 animals  who have suffered from neglect or abuse or loss of trust,\u003c/strong\u003e or who are at risk of being sent to slaughter. Although their pasts will never be forgotten, they have been given a second chance full of happiness and love. We prefer to focus on the positive and let go of the past.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur primary goal is to \u003cstrong\u003erescue, rehabilitate, and provide a safe haven for life\u003c/strong\u003e. Through \u003cstrong\u003ecommunity involvement and education\u003c/strong\u003e, we aim to promote \u003cstrong\u003ecompassion and kindness\u003c/strong\u003e to all animals.  We  employ only positive reward-based methods when interacting with the animals.  Our philosophy is that they should be \u003cstrong\u003efree to just be\u003c/strong\u003e. Each day we learn more as we explore the relationship between humans and non-humans in an environment that emphasizes \u003cstrong\u003emutual respect and appreciation\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur \u003cstrong\u003enew location is set in the middle of a beautiful area of forest \u003c/strong\u003ethat we will protect under a management plan, just East of Ottawa in Saint Pascal Baylon.\u00a0There are \u003cstrong\u003elovely trails\u003c/strong\u003e to explore, and enjoy,  as well as an area of original first growth forest with tall pines that are hundreds of years old.\u003cstrong\u003e A picturesque creek winds through the woods\u003c/strong\u003e and a wide variety of birds and wildlife, some of whom could not survive outside of this forested area, call it home. We will be pleased to be the stewards of this lovely forest, ensuring that it remains as it is now, in tune with our philosophy of free just to be.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePlease take a moment to read through each one of their stories.  Reflect on their past experiences but do not dwell on them.  To look at each animal as an individual is to truly understand the peace they now know.  They will remain at the sanctuary for their entire lives, free from the life they once knew. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwbW9CeHd4VHpyZjA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePenny\u003c/a\u003e is truly a beautiful horse and the inspiration for the sanctuary\u2019s name.  It is hard to believe that she was once standing in a feedlot waiting to be shipped to slaughter. Penny was one of the first residents and is Teddy\u2019s dearest companion. Her past is completely unknown to us.  Penny has been ridden in the past, but she now spends most of her days enjoying freedom, friends, and forage.  She has an addiction to belly rubs and scratches and expects everyone who enters into her paddock to understand that need! Penny had dentistry done by one of our wonderful vets and from markings in her mouth and the state of her teeth her age has been reevaluated from 15 years to 8!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwRXNLME9XcGlMaUk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTeddy\u003c/a\u003e, a Belgian gelding, was one of the first residents at Penny Lane.  He was discarded by his previous owner for some unknown reason and found himself in a feedlot, waiting to be shipped to slaughter. Teddy arrived soon after Penny but the love affair soon blossomed.  It was not long before Teddy and Penny bonded. When Teddy arrived, he had a large tumor in his right eye.  Initially, he was not bothered by it and appeared to be comfortable. By the fall of 2014, it became apparent that Teddy was starting to suffer due to his tumor.  In October 2014, he was taken to Russell Equine Vet Service where they performed surgery to remove his entire right eye. He spent a few days in the hospital and was brought back home. He made a full recovery and has completely adjusted to life with one eye. Teddy demonstrates a high level of trust with people.  His great size and gentle demeanor wins the hearts of all who meet him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwRXc4d3h4YmVoU0k\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLady\u003c/a\u003e\u2019s story is a heartbreaking one.    She arrived at the feedlot with a foal who was taken from her there and sold on to an individual who did not want Lady too.  She was left behind destined to be sent to slaughter but saved from that fate in time. During her time at the feedlot she had been kept together with many mares, geldings and stallions, and became pregnant there again.\u003cbr\u003eAt the time of her arrival at the Sanctuary, she was estimated to be in her early twenties.  She was thin, neglected and suffering from heaves (a respiratory illness in horses). Finally, on August 22, 2013, Lady gave birth to a healthy foal \u2013 Blue. Lady requires daily medication to help with her heaves.  She is currently on a low maintenance dose and is very comfortable and happy. She is showing us that trust is a two-way affair and that she has begun to take a chance on people again.  She is a beautiful girl who loves a good morning back rub!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with many of the other horses at the sanctuary,\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwVWlFSWlUT1A2dFk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEva\u003c/a\u003e was also saved from the slaughter pipeline.  She is approximately 16 years old and was in terrible shape when she first arrived.  She was thin and frail \u2013 her tail had been cut short. Eva has found much of her spirit again, demonstrating the resilient nature of horses. While she  is one of the most affectionate and loving horses at the farm, she also has learned to express determined opinions, which is so good to see. She loves to be cuddled and will fall asleep in your arms.  She has a gentle soul that thrives on human interaction. Like Lady, Eva also suffers from heaves. She is currently on a low maintenance dose of medication which keeps her comfortable.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwaEdleVNRQXl1OEE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChances\u003c/a\u003e\u2019 story differs slightly from the other residents. She is a 10 year old standardbred that spent most of her life in the racing industry \u2013 a harness racer. She had many successful races and won a lot of money in her short life. Sadly, once she began to lose, she became useless and was destined for the slaughter pipeline. She was pulled directly off the race track and brought to her forever home at the sanctuary. It took nearly two years for her to settle in.  She had no idea how to be a horse. She started out at the sanctuary with one other horse \u2013 Prince. She became very bonded to him and somewhat overprotective. Prince was in his senior years and not quite up to the task of living with the active Chances. She was introduced into a larger herd and it was not long before she found herself. Today, Chances is a different horse. It\u0027s been a privilege to watch her find her place in her little group of friends.  She now feels confident enough to greet people and accept gentle interactions with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwZXdmWHNFdzBGdlk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNikita\u003c/a\u003e is also a standardbred mare like Chances, although it is unknown whether or not she was a part of the racing industry. She found herself in the feedlot in January of 2013 \u2013 dumped like so many others. She was about to be loaded onto the truck heading to the slaughter plant when she sneezed! Since only healthy horses can go to slaughter, she was immediately pulled off the truck. The sneeze saved her life.  Soon after, she was pulled from the feedlot and brought to the sanctuary. Nikita arrived wearing a halter that said \u201cI love my horse\u201d. Perhaps her previous owners had no idea of the risks inherent with sending a horse to auction.  It is not our place to judge those that once loved her. Thankfully, she avoided a fate handed down to most that make their way through auction houses. She is safe. Nikita is strong-willed, gentle and eager to learn. In the past it seems that she developed a reputation at a very early age as being difficult to handle.  People would come near her expecting her to live up to her reputation, and insist on using harsher methods. It\u0027s no wonder that she would respond in kind!  Treated gently and with use of reward reinforcement methods, she now eagerly loves to do target work. She loves her clicker sessions, and like Cowboy, often learns so quickly that anyone working with her has to be very creative to keep up with her!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwTzNwN1A5WUNJTlU\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMaya\u003c/a\u003e is a quarterhorse and was one of the last of a group of  20 quarterhorse yearlings to be saved from slaughter. She came from a PMU ranch in Manitoba and was separated from her mother at 4 months of age, then immediately shipped a thousand miles to an auction in Ontario.  At that auction Maya was purchased  along with some other yearlings, but then put in a field where she spent the next 8 months, before again being sent to auction.  She was purchased by a kill buyer at the second auction to be slaughtered for meat but was rescued and came to the Sanctuary near her first birthday. She turned 4 years old in May 2015 here at the Sanctuary and is an absolute sweetheart. She spends her days in the company of Nikita, Chances, Lady and Eva. She is often one of the first horses at the gate to greet new visitors. Maya demonstrates an incredible memory and an ability to quickly grasp things.  While other \u0027training\u0027 methods tended to cause her to resist, reward based approaches have really caught her attention.  She is personable, playful, and wants to be part of anything that\u0027s going on.  She\u0027s the first to try to get the other mares to play.  She is such a lovable spirit and people are drawn to her naturally, and no wonder!  She is a beautiful little mare and an important member of her little herd.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwb3VRQXBET1V0NlE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCowboy\u2019s\u003c/a\u003e story is one of past torment and neglect. In brief, he arrived at the sanctuary on November 16, 2013 from Windsor, Ontario after suffering torture, severe abuse and starvation at the hands of sadistic individuals, who were convicted of one of the worse cases of animal abuse in Ontario in 25 years and fined $50,000 (but not banned from owning animals!). After a long road of rehabilitation and recovery, he was trailered all the way from Windsor to the Penny Lane thanks to a number of kind people \u2013 his new life about to begin.He is thought to be approximately 10 years old now, although it is not known for sure. He shares a paddock with his companion, Oliver.  Cowboy loves attention and human interaction despite his past experiences. He is extremely smart and waits every day for a chance to play.  Reward based reinforcement work (clicker/target work) is something he loves being part of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwWHpEUlFGc2twVTQ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOliver\u2019s\u003c/a\u003e story is similar to most \u2013 he sat in a feedlot waiting to be shipped to slaughter. He was saved and brought to the sanctuary in the winter of 2013. Oliver is approximately 16 years old and appears to be quarter horse cross, possible with some Welsh Cob mixed in. Likely due to past experiences, Oliver requires lots of time to trust humans.  It\u0027s possible that in the past he did not have a lot of interaction with people. Once his trust has been gained, he becomes a \u201cpocket pony\u201d \u2013 always looking for gentle pats and attention. He also responds quickly to target training and is a quick to learn (and teach us).  He\u0027s a lovely little guy who now has become Cowboy\u0027s friend and companion.  The two bachelors now live together in a paddock next to the mares, where they spend many hours admiring the ladies across the fence happily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwWGVLVUJxZFhFd28\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMolly\u003c/a\u003e is a mini mule that was originally at the sanctuary many years ago after being rescued from the local feedlot. A loving family that gave her a wonderful home adopted her. Unfortunately, as in life, circumstances changed for her family and Molly needed a safe place to land. We were thrilled to be able to welcome her home. She arrived at Penny Lane in November 2016 and here she will remain.  Maya has since decided that Molly is her \u201cbaby\u201d and stays as close to her as possible, protecting her from the other horses. Molly may be small in size but not in stature (she\u0027s convinced she\u0027s every bit as big as the other horses!) Currently she spends her days with George, Ringo, Michelle, and Belle. She\u0027s really opened up at the new farm location, more open to interaction with people, and enjoys a good grass roll!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October of 2016, we visited a local farm and came across a flock of turkeys (destined to be someone\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner). Thankfully, the farmer agreed to spare two lives that day. Upon arrival at the sanctuary,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwQ2lxSUtZWkpNa1E\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMichelle and Belle\u003c/a\u003e were still calling for their other flock members \u2013 a sad sight to see. They soon settled in and made George \u0026amp; Ringo a part of their flock. It is not an unusual sight to catch the four of them snoozing together in the sunshine.  They are ambassadors for their species, most of whom don\u0027t  live very long. Intelligent and extremely curious they are a delight to watch as they wander around with George and Ringo, chattering away. George can be a bit of a bully to his brother Ringo at times, and you\u0027ll often see Ringo hightail it over to stand with the turkeys (who seem to be able to calm George down when he gets too frisky).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwbWloWlE5T043bUk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGeorge\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwem9QUFZhTV8wNDg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRingo\u003c/a\u003e are Alpine Goats that are approximately 6 years old. Although we do not know a great deal about their past, we do know they were seized from a neglectful situation by the SPCA of Montreal. They arrived at Penny Lane in June 2016 suffering from mange and  in poor condition. They immediately settled in and today they are the very picture of health with nice thick coats. They are brothers, together are quite the characters who will continue to bring joy to the sanctuary on a daily basis. They share space with our two rescued turkeys, forming their own unique herd, and Molly. They go for walks around the property every day, and are a true delight to spend time with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwOGE0WUsyRS12WnM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBob\u003c/a\u003e, a little bantam rooster and his two companion partridge hens,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwOGE0WUsyRS12WnM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMary and Elizabeth\u003c/a\u003e, named for their Tudor appearance, have moved in their coop up to the barn.

His two companion partridge hens were destined to be someone\u0027s dinner but now live happily here. They are quickly becoming a favourite of visitors!  Bob is another favourite of the staff at Lynwood Animal Hospital (where he has his check ups) and they are always asking after him when we go there. with other birds. The horses have gotten used to the idea that Bob not only crows happily at dawn and dusk, but all day and anytime he feels like singing out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Spring 2017 two sheep, a male and a female, were rescued by the Montreal SPCA from a field where a third sheep had already died.

Their coats were long and shaggy so we had a shearer come and gently take care of it for them. James cannot be neutered because of his age, so he needs to be approached with some caution - he has a gentle temperament but still can throw a good head butt if he thinks it is necessary! In May 2017, Herriot passed away at the sanctuary. Humanity failed Herriot in her past life and we tried to give her a happy ending but it was not to be. At least she knew love and peace for a short time. She will be deeply missed by all who knew her.

He was in an area where there were no houses for quite a distance. After a month-long attempt at finding his family, William was brought to Penny Lane. It is unclear as to how he ended up on the side of the road. Most likely he was simply unwanted and was dumped. He is quite the character. He\u2019s still a baby and will likely double or even triple is size \u2013 he is a reminder that there are no such things as mini or micro pigs! This is the reason that so many potbellies are abandoned \u2013 they simply grow larger than expected.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwNDN6enloel9BMFU\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWilbur\u003c/a\u003e and\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B01BRtBUhLtwRkRleHNrWHVQMXc\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u00a0Pokey\u003c/a\u003e came to Penny Lane this past May. They are father (Wilbur) and son (Pokey). They came to us after their owner could no longer provide them the care and attention they required. Every attempt was made to find them a place where they could live out their lives instead of sending them to slaughter. Wilbur and Pokey are standard farm pigs meant for someone\u2019s meal. In reality most won\u2019t make it beyond 4 to 6 months (the typical age for slaughter) and never reach their true size. At just over 2 years old, Wilbur now weighs at least 800lbs. Pokey is catching up quickly and at a year old is over 500lbs. They are incredibly smart and clean.

We\u2019ve had the pleasure watching them grow up and find their place amongst the other animals. They never stray from each other, constantly moving around together as one.
