If you\u0027re concerned about the exact # of Creations per month, don\u0027t forget to set your monthly maximum so you are never charged more than your budget allows. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCan I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Yes of course! You can cancel or adjust your pledge for any reason at any time. Also, you can also set a monthly maximum to ensure you are never charged more than you can handle!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars? \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Nope!
