It means a lot just to have you here checking it out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s always been my dream to be able to financially support myself doing work I love, and I\u0027ve always loved art. Plenty of people have discouraged me from pursuing a career as a professional artist, saying it wasn\u0027t lucrative. For several years after college, I\u0027d been trying to find a \u0027safe, more sustainable job\u0027, working part-time to full-time, doing work that I never felt was right for me. There was always that nagging feeling that I should start doing what I\u003cem\u003e really \u003c/em\u003ewanted to do as a career, and I sort of secretly began collecting the necessary equipment to start streaming my art on Twitch. On March 12th, 2016, I streamed my art for the first time, and have been streaming about 6 hours most weekdays ever since. On February 13th, 11 months and a day later, I became a Twitch Partner!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my Patron, you are directly supporting me as a creator and a Creative Twitch streamer! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I\u0027ll be able to continue improving my stream with things like a high quality art cam, better lighting, a wider variety of art supplies, and new, fun ways for me to give back to you! I am a full-time streamer and artist, and your patronage will help me continue to be that!"
