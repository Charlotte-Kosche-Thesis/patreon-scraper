     "about": "Lisa Kwong is currently an Adjunct Lecturer for the Department of English and Asian American Studies Program at Indiana University. Born and raised in Virginia, Kwong is an AppalAsian poet in the Midwest. She earned her MFA in Poetry from IU. Kwong was inspired to claim the AppalAsian identity after learning that poet Frank X Walker had coined the term Affrilachian. Her creative work explores the AppalAsian identity, gender and self-image, family history, and contains references to popular music, particularly 1990s R\u0026amp;B. She has lectured about writing as an AppalAsian in IU undergraduate courses in American Studies and Anthropology, as well as at IU\u0027s Annual International Interdisciplinary Graduate Conference, the Indiana Asian American Conference (IAAC), and the IU Asian Culture Center. Kwong\u2019s poem, \u201cAn AppalAsian Finds Home in Bloomington, Indiana,\u201d was selected by Dorianne Laux for inclusion in Best New Poets 2014. Her poems and personal essays have appeared in Naugatuck River Review, Rebelle Society, Banango Street, Appalachian Heritage, Pluck!, and other journals. Her honors include two Frost Place scholarships, the Neal-Marshall Graduate Fellowship in Creative Writing, Guy Lemmon Award in Public Writing, and the inaugural Asian Pacific American Inspiration Award at Indiana University. Her research interests in Asian American Studies include media representation, gender representation, obscurer Asian American experiences (e.g. AppalAsian, Asians in the US South, Indiana, and Montana), and the themes and forms of historical and contemporary Asian American poetry and prose.",
