    "summary": "Hello, listeners! Rob, Kevin, Dennis, and Richard here from the Preferred Enemies podcast. In the past, we\u0027ve had listeners ask us if they could throw us a dollar or two to show their appreciation for the podcast. We\u0027ve hemmed and hawed over it for a while, but with some of the changes that have come over the last year or so, it\u0027s time to get off our butts and set up a way for you to do just that. With the increased number of products produced by Games Workshop, the increasing number of events we\u0027re traveling to cover, and the increased complications as we\u0027ve become more geographically separated, we can definitely use the help of our listeners to keep improving what we\u0027re doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry, though. We\u0027ll never lock Preferred Enemies behind a paywall - the show will always be free for listening. That said, if we can get even a fraction of our listeners to chip in, we can improve our show \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0maybe just start coming up with some bonus content for our backers on Patreon. We may just be able to travel to more events and meet more of you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have some of the best listeners around, and from all of us here at Preferred Enemies, good night, good gaming, and thank you all for your support!"
