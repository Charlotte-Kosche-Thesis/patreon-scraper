    "summary": "Hey everyone, we\u0027re Practical Folks - an LA-based YouTube channel that makes comedy and review videos. Our goal is to make quality content about stuff we LOVE like Disney, Game of Thrones, and comedy in general.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe launched our channel in 2014 from the ashes of our previous group, Comediocracy, which focused mostly on sketch comedy. Since then, we\u2019ve grown to include mash-ups, TV reviews, livestreams, and of course our flagship series Drunk Disney. \n\nOver the last couple years, we\u0027ve been so lucky to attract some of the coolest fans on the internet. But with so many awesome eyes on our stuff, we feel the constant desire to make more and better videos, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re always pushing ourselves to grow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n \nIn 2015, we had our first Drunk Disney livestream and multi-camera review show, What\u0027s on the Box. One year later, we now livestream almost every DD, host live review aftershows for Game of Thrones, and have expanded our comedy team to develop more hilarious and ambitious short film projects. But to make all of this as good as our fans deserve, we need a little help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy becoming a patron of Practical Folks, you are directly making a HUGE impact on the quality of our videos. You\u2019ll enable us to get better cameras, lights, sound equipment and livestream hardware, plus pay professional crew members to help us use it all. By supporting our channel in any amount you choose, you are immediately making the content you love better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at the side panel to see some awesome rewards we have for you, and thank you so much for your support! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLove,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePractical Folks\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
