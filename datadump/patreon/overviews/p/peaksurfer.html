    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Albert Bates and I\u2019m writing this from my octagonal\n2-room house at The Farm. This house used to be a yurt, but after many years in\nthe forest the canvas became moldy and began to shred, and I could no longer\nstand to cover the \u201ceye of god\u201d skylight with another layer of tarp, so I tore that\ndown and replaced it with this two-story octagon, still on the original 24-foot\ndiameter platform. I built the second floor from wood scrounged from the throwaway\npile at the nearby Amish sawmill and bamboo that I grew right here as part of\nthe waste-treatment wetlands at my training center. I sleep upstairs and work\nat my computer downstairs. The eye of god is once more open.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA Walk in The Woods\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://imgc.allpostersimages.com/images/P-473-488-90/65/6564/9WG2100Z/posters/manz-washington-lafayette-at-valley-forge.jpg\" style=\"width: 217px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eWhen I first came to these woods I was 25 years old. On\nJanuary 1, 2017, I turned 70. If you live in the Hamptons and work at Goldman\nSachs, you might at first glance think my life has been a complete waste. I was\nborn from a deep line of New England blue bloods. I trace my ancestry to four\ndifferent families aboard the ships bearing the \u201cWinthrop 700\u201d to Massachusetts\nin 1634. Three of my line served with General Washington at Valley Forge. One of those, my great\ngreat great great grandfather, Issachar Bates, was a Shaker poet and hymnist,\ncrossing the Appalachians, meeting with Tecumseh and The Prophet, and founding\nthe western Shaker colonies in Ohio and Kentucky, where his 1804 house still stands.\nHe should have ended my line right there, because the Shakers were celibate (although The Prophet named his daughter Marsha S. Bates after Issachar).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFortunately, Issachar had a son. Artemis, before he foreswore\npleasures of the flesh, and Artemis then had a son, my Great Grandfather Artemis, who marched South to the War Between The States. My own grandfather was a Marine Captain when the entire Corps numbered 98 officers and 3481 enlisted men. Cut to the chase\nand I was raised in Connecticut, schooled in fine schools, competed in\nOlympic-level dressage, jumping, and cross-country eventing, played rugby and lacrosse, traveled the world, took a law degree\nand then\u2026 dropped out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLike Issachar, I walked the Appalachian Trail and wound up\nin Tennessee, where I joined the big hippy commune called \u003ca href=\"http://www.thefarm.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Farm.\u003c/a\u003e I live here\nstill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBack to The Future\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are good things about these life choices we make and\nsome not so good. For me the good thing was a life well spent. I became a\nfarmer, horse logger, vegan cook, baker, flour miller, builder, mason, scrap\nmetal hauler, typesetter, graphic artist, schoolteacher and videographer. As an inventor in\nthose heady years of the 70s, I developed concentrating solar arrays and a\nsolar powered automobile we showed off at the 1984 Knoxville World\u2019s Fair. I\npatented a cylindrical tofu press and rotary flour sifter, and hybridized fast\ngrowing strains of trees for land reclamation and biomass conversion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eLazRt8s8Wc/maxresdefault.jpg\" style=\"width: 276px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eReturning to my training, for 20 years I was able to\npractice law on my own terms, suing chemical companies, the nuclear industry,\nthe military, the FBI and other dark actors from the eyrie of the Natural Rights\nCenter \u2014 really just a dimly lit room in the cavernous potato barn I had built\nyears earlier as a Farm mason.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Farm gave me the freedom to be a battleship on the\nboard, moving at will to attack targets of opportunity and return to the safety\nof our lair. The \u003cem\u003eVillage Voice\u003c/em\u003e dubbed\nme \u201ca hero of the revolution.\u201d With the rest of my team at The Farm I shared\nthe first Right Livelihood Award in 1980 for our work assisting native peoples\nto stand against empire. That was also the year I restored the voting rights of\nall the convicted felons in Tennessee, forcing the state to set up balloting\nin the prisons, and won a big case for the atomic veterans which changed federal\nlaws and begin compensating radiation claims. Earlier, we\u2019d won a similar\nvictory for Agent Orange, again the first of its kind. I went after the FBI\u0027s secret program targeting war protesters and preserved for historians The Farm\u0027s massive surveillance archive through the Freedom of Information Act. With the power of a community egging me on, I was fearless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy Climate Porn\nAddiction\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA case I took involving chemical waste ended up\ninvolving climate change and in the process of bringing in experts and\ndiscovering evidence, I scared myself. My confidence was deeply shaken. I had what might be called a dark night\nof the soul, as I learned, in the early \u201880s, about the potential \u2014 maybe inevitability \u2014 of\u00a0 near term\nhuman extinction. That led to my retiring from law and becoming a mushroom\nfarmer for a while, before being roped in to help found the global ecovillage\nmovement. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut my brush with climate change continued to color my\nreading and travels, and for 25 years I was obsessed with the issue, looking\nfor some way out, any possible way that humans might escape an otherwise\ncertain fate. With the help of Peruvian shamans and Native American road chiefs,\nI communed with ayahuasca and peyote and asked the spirit world for guidance. I attended\nclimate summits and spoke with scientists and policy wonks. I studied\npermaculture, carbon farming, ecological restoration and agroforestry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://old.thefarm.org/farmgif/Brazil09dolphin.jpg\" style=\"width: 214px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eEventually I discovered, deep in the Amazon, upstream from the\nWedding of the Waters, a way out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow I have the solution, and I am writing books, attending\nconferences, and jawboning with big wigs to get it out there as quickly as I\ncan. I only hope it is not too late. You can read about this is in some of my\nbooks like \u003cem\u003eThe Biochar Solution\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003ePour Evian on Your Radishes,\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Paris Agreement\u003c/em\u003e. I blog weekly at \u003cem\u003eThe Great Change \u2014\u003c/em\u003e every Sunday morning.\nI write for magazines and journals. I do interviews and teach. I post the occasional video to YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have more books and articles in the pipeline. I am\ndelivering papers at scientific conferences. I am giving workshops and doing\nwebinars. I am Typhoid Mary, infecting my disease into an unsuspecting\npopulation. This thing I know needs to go viral.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt can\u0027t just die inside my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFeel the Force, Luke\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut there is a dark side to the commune choice too. When I\njoined, at 25, I gave up everything I owned and anything I would inherit. To\nbecome a voluntary peasant I severed the artery that carried my blue blood. For\nnearly half a century now I have labored only as a volunteer, my basic subsistence\nmet while the communal society existed, but no salary, no wages, no W-9s, no\nearned income credits, and no paycheck deductions to Social Security. When the\ncommune dissolved and became a cooperative, I was left with no safety net.\nSocial Security pays me the minimum required by law \u2014 $300 per month. From that, they deduct $200\nfor Medicare, leaving me a $100, which just happens to be the monthly dues at\nThe Farm so I can keep living in my 2-story yurt. In my 70s now, I get a bare\nminimum health insurance with very high co-pays for prescriptions, doctor\nvisits, and treatment, which mostly I cannot afford. I cut my dosages in half and skip expensive tests. Consequently, my health is\ndeclining, my heart is failing, and I may not live to see the outcome of my\npretty amazing discoveries. At least they amaze me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have woven my findings into a model that integrates the\nUN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals; soil sequestration of carbon; preserving\nthe cultures of indigenous peoples; ecovillage modalities for governance,\neducation and self-provision; anti-fragile biomass to biochar renewable energy;\nclimate moderating semi-aquatic ecosystems; and microenterprise innovation,\nincubation, acceleration, B-corporation hubs that function as bioregional circular economies. I sketched all this in the 90-second\nvideo we did in 2016 for the MacArthur 100 and Change Challenge that led to my new videos and essays you will find on \u003ca href=\"http://gvix.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGVI(x).org\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 I will describe it in greater detail in my book from Chelsea Green due out in 2018 called \u003cem\u003eCarbon Cascades: Redesigning Human Ecologies to Reverse Climate Change.\u003c/em\u003e An autographed copy (and every subsequent book) awaits you at the Power Up! level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow I am going on Patreon to get a little help for the home\nstretch. Give me a shot in the arm. I\u2019m not done. Let me run my heart out. I\u2019ll\ngive you my best."
