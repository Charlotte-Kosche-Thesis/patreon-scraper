    "summary": "Hello, everybody!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m Joe Parlock, and for the last three years I\u2019ve been\nmaking games-related stuff for a variety of sites. I was the managing editor of\nIndieHaven.com, associate editor, and later Hardware Editor, for\nDestructoid.com, and now I\u2019m the co-founder and co-Editor in Chief of\nLetsPlayVideoGames.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve also done plenty of not-writing stuff. You most likely\nknow me from my co-hosting of the Let\u2019s Play Video Games Podcast, and its\npredecessor the Destructoid UK Podcast. I\u2019m also co-host of Truckin\u2019 With Laura\nand Joe, a YouTube series with my fellow LPVG EIC Laura Kate Date. I also have\na YouTube channel and a Twitch channel that are ripe for making fantastic use\nof.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s a lot of stuff, but it\u2019s only now that the time has\ncome: the time to go\u2026 \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFULL TIME. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUp to now I\u2019ve been\nprecariously balancing my studies with my games \u003cem\u003estuff\u003c/em\u003e, but I\u2019m now ready to push further forwards and come (back) to\nPatreon to (hopefully) be able to do this a whole lot more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFlexibility, mainly. I like to do a wide spread of things,\nfrom the more mundane things like reviews to more out-there things like \u201cJoe\nParlock\u2019s Orc Boyfriends\u201d and \u201cClifford the Big Red Dog is a Titan\u201d. And they\nwere made when I didn\u2019t have a whole lot of time, which I do now. If I pursued\na full-time position at a games site, the chances are pretty high that I\u2019d not\nhave that creative flexibility and freedom to do side-projects or the slightly\nmore bizarre features I love doing. I\u2019d much rather work with the people who\nlike the variety of content I do, so I can do more of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Can We Expect\nFrom You?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWritten content. Most often on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://letsplayvideogames.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLetsPlayVideoGames.com,\u003c/a\u003e but elsewhere too. I\u2019ve even set up\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://JoeParlock.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJoeParlock.com\u003c/a\u003e for\nnot-necessarily-games stuff! You\u2019ll always be kept up to date through social\nmedia and/or Patreon about stuff I do.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eVideo content. YouTube series and Twitch.tv\nstreams multiple times a week.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003ePodcasts. I\u2019ve got ideas for more podcasts I\u2019d\nlove to get going.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore stuff. Patreon = freedom to make whatever sort of stuff I want and you like.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThank you very much for reading, and I hope you support me!\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
