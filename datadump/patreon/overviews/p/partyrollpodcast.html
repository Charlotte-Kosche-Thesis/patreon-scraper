    "summary": "Hey guys! We\u0027re Dusty, Cory, Mark, Vanessa, Steven, Matt, Jose, and Rory and we started a podcast in late 2014 that recorded us playing Dungeons and Dragons. Since then we\u0027ve released 3 seasons of D\u0026amp;D, 2 seasons of Savage Worlds, and many games on our youtube show Teener Time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe didn\u0027t really know what we were doing when we started this ordeal. We had been playing various forms of D\u0026amp;D for the last few years and always had an uproariously good time. One day we came to conclusion to start recording our sessions, and Party Roll was formed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find it on most podcast aggregation apps, or you can just go to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://http//partyrollpodcast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epartyrollpodcast.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been a goal of ours since the very beginning to have High \u003cdel\u003eDefinition\u003c/del\u003e Fidelity audio that doesn\u0027t sound like we\u0027re all huddled in a tin can around computer mic. We\u0027ve sunk a lot of money and time into making the best sounding podcast we could, and we\u0027re proud with the end result so far. Mic-ing up 6+ people, having the equipment to handle all of those mics, editing, and hosting doesn\u0027t come easy! We\u0027re not ones who are good at asking for things, but if you feel compelled to support our roleplaying show in its current form as well as into the future, we\u0027d appreciate it greatly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from the rewards on the side, we often release episodes of Savage Roll and Teener Time on here several days before the public gets it. Joining also provides you a special Patron Level on our Discord server, should that interest you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love making this show, and we love you. Come join the party!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
