However, there are costs to producing the show and it would be great if a few generous patrons could help me to meet those costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListeners have already contributed to the purchase of a new portable voice recorder, allowing me to retire the old desktop microphone I had been using since 2009. I was able to take the recorder with me to two academic conferences in 2017 so that I could record interviews with scientists about their new research.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://robertburriss.com/images/podcast_banner.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also excited to give the many thousands of listeners to \u003cem\u003eThe Psychology of Attractiveness Podcast\u003c/em\u003e the opportunity to contribute to the show. I want you to help me decide which research I should cover so I can make the show you want to hear. Already this year patrons have chosen the topics of two shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also answer your questions about attractiveness psychology, post podcast extras, and give you sneak previews of what\u0027s coming up on the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you like what I do on the podcast and would like to help me do bigger and better things (and stop recording under a blanket in my closet), please consider bunging me a couple of dollars. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRob"
