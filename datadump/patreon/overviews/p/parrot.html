\nprotection.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt includes a full portable laboratory for security and digital forensics experts, but it also includes\nall you need to develop your own software or protect your privacy with anonymity and crypto tools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSecurity\u003c/h4\u003e\nParrot Security includes a full arsenal of security oriented tools to perform penetration tests, security audits and more.\nWith a Parrot usb drive in your pocket you will always be sure to have all you need with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePrivacy\u003c/h4\u003e\nParrot includes by default TOR, I2P, anonsurf, gpg, tccf, zulucrypt, veracrypt, truecrypt, luks\nand many other tecnologies designed to defend your privacy and your identity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch4\u003eDevelopment\u003c/h4\u003e\nIf you need a comfortable environment with updated frameworks and useful libraries already installed, Parrot will amaze you\nas it includes a full development-oriented environment with some powerful editors and IDEs pre-installed and many other tools\ninstallable from our repository.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDigital Forensics\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nParrot Security is developed in collaboration with\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.caine-live.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCaine\u003c/a\u003e,\none of the most important GNU/Linux distributions in the Digital Forensics world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne of our purposes is to provide the best forensics enviromnent ever seen in a security distro,\ninfact the entire system is hardened to not perform device automounts and to provide all the\ntools needed to do forensic acquisitions and evidence identifications in a safe comprehensive and portable virtual lab.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nParrot includes the most famous frameworks,\u003cbr\u003e\nit has many reliable acquisition and imaging tools\u003cbr\u003e\nand the top class analysis, evidence management and reporting softwares,\u003cbr\u003e\nall of them on top of a reliable OS designed to not alter the proof.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCryptography\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nParrot includes many cryptographic softwares\u003cbr\u003e\nwhich are extremely useful when it comes to\u003cbr\u003e\nprotect your confidential data and defend your privacy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nParrot includes several cryptographic front-ends to work\nboth with symmetric and asymmetric encryption, infact it\nnatively supports volumes encryption with LUKS, TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt\nand the hidden TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt volumes with nested algorythms support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe whole system can be installed inside an encrypted\npartition to protect your computer in case of theft.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother swiss army knife of your privacy is GPG, the GNU Privacy Guard,\nan extremely powerful PGP software that lets you create a private/public\npair of keys to apply digital signatures to your messages and to\nallow other people to send you encrypted messages that only your\nprivate key can decrypt, in can also handle multiple identities and subkeys,\nand its power resides in its ring of trust as PGP users can sign each other\u0027s keys\nto make other people know if a digital identity is valid or not.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEven our software repository is digitally signed by GPG, and the system automatically\nverifies if an update was altered or compromised and it refuses to upgrade\nor to install new software if our digital signature is not found or not valid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePrivacy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour privacy is the most valuable thing you have in your digital life\nand the whole Parrot Team is exaggeratedly paranoid when it comes to users privacy,\ninfact our system doesn\u0027t contain tracking systems, and it is hardened in deep to\nprotect users from prying eyes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nParrot has developed and implemented several tricks and softwares to achieve this goal,\nand AnonSurf is one of the most important examples, it is a software designed to start TOR and\nhijack all the internet traffic made by the system through the TOR network, we have also modified\nthe system to make it use DNS servers different from those offered by your internet provider.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nParrot also includes torbrowser, torchat and other anonymous services,\nlike I2P, a powerful alternative to TOR.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eProgramming\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe main goal of an environment designed by hackers for hackers is the possibility\nto change it, adapt it, transform it and use it as a development platform to create\nnew things, this is why Parrot comes out of the box with several tools for developers\nsuch as compilers, disassemblers, IDEs, comfortable editors and powerful frameworks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nParrot includes QTCreator as its main C, C++ and Qt framework.\nAnother very useful tool is Geany, a lightweight and simple IDE which supports a huge amount\nof programming languages, while we also include Atom, the opensource editor of the future\ndeveloped by GitHub, and many compilers and interpreters with their most important libraries\nare pre-installed and ready to use.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd of course many other editors, development softwares and libraries are available\nthrough our software repository where we keep all the development tools always updated\nto their most cutting edge but reliable version.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
