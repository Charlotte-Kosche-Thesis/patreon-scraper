Either way, thank you so much for visiting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an animator and creative lead of a small team of fellow collaborating artists, this has become a lot more than just a hobby: it\u0027s my full-time job and passion. I basically spend almost all of my time planning, animating and putting together these videos, and it\u0027s only been made possible with the support of patrons, who enable me to put in the kind of insane full-time hours required to produce this stuff. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo If you really enjoy the kind of content I make and want to play a small (or big!) part in keeping the team and I fed and sheltered while we create ever more content, then this is the place to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eIMPORTANT: Please note that when using PayPal to back creators on Patreon, there\u0027s a higher chance of being rejected or declined when backing NSFW/adult content creators.\u003cbr\u003eIf this happens to you, then you can simply change the payment method to the standard credit/debit mode.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, Patreon is a crowd-funding platform that connects fans (patrons) with their favourite artists. It\u0027s a secure and safe processor that allows you to subsidise the continued creation of the specific and very-hard-to-find content that you love. It allows fans to directly support the continued creation of their favourite content, and gives artists the valuable support they need so that they can commit all of their time and dedication to their craft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon makes it possible for non-mainstream artists (erotic artists like myself in particular) to commit significantly more time towards honing their craft and creating a lot of content, and not having to pander to advertisers. For many of us, it allows us to turn a hobby that we would otherwise have very little time for, into a full-blown commitment, working entirely to give our fans the best content. Before the advent of crowd-funding, artists slaved away, on behalf of studios, companies and managers who would decide what they can and can\u0027t create. Those studios and managers then sell the artists work at a premium to fans and consumers, for a tidy profit. Patreon allows us to destroy that old fashioned model, and connect artists and fans directly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou simply select a donation amount, modest or generous, it\u0027s entirely up to you, and for the price of a cup of coffee each month, you\u0027ll make it possible for artists such as myself to sustain ourselves and dedicate as much time as possible to our work. This is extremely important for niche creators such as myself, who work hard (day and night in my case) to hand-craft high-quality content of a rare calibre.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get if I pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eInstant access to all Patreon-supported artwork, and early access to Patreon-supported releases, usually weeks before they go public.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpdates on projects as they progress, along with sneak peaks and previews\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVotes on characters for Patreon-backed projects\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA direct line of communication with me via direct message, or via chat in our wonderful discord community!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGood feels!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much do I donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever much or little you want; whatever you deem is reasonable, depending on how much you enjoy or believe in the content.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eThe standard entry amount that most people pledge at is $5, which is the baseline reward level.

A fundamental principle of this page has always been that a very big chunk of the support is invested back into enriching the quality and quantity of the content.

I channel this into my creative work, and I enjoy animating, and I\nespecially love it when people enjoy my content. Countless hours of time and\neffort go into animating my scenes, and the quality you see is the direct\nresult of long nights spent animating until sunrise. My commitment to quality means that 8-16 hour stretches of\nanimation work, for consecutive days, are not unusual for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was something I had very little time to do when working a regular job, and often I would be too physically and mentally drained to find the time or energy to really pursue my creative passion. The generosity of fans has changed all that, and I know how lucky I am.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnimating is an extremely labour-intensive craft, but I absolutely love it, and\nI hope you enjoy my content enough to help me make more of it and more often. I\nknow from personal experience that this kind content is hard to find, and it feels great\ngiving those of you also looking for it some really awesome premium-quality\nstuff that you won\u2019t ever find elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing as particular about quality as I am means that untold hours need to be\npoured into my scenes to ensure that they are consistently visceral, life-like, unique,\ndaring and top-notch. Like everyone else, I have general living expenses: groceries, bills,\nrent, a cat, petrol and whatnot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDue to work commitments, I have only a finite amount of time right now to spend\nanimating, and if possible, I\u2019d like to spend as much of it as possible working\nfor YOU! Your generosity will go a long way towards helping me put out as much content\nas possible, as well as funding the necessary hardware and software upgrades to improve the quality and frequency of the content,\nas well as giving me the time to be implement new features into my scenes, such\nas sound, voice work ,motion capture and even interactive scenes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut don\u0027t take my word for it; here\u0027s what some people have said about me and my work (taken from a recent survey), to give you an idea of what to expect:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e-Pestilence is a pretty cool dude who shows that having an unorthodox taste in material has no bearing on his ability to think rationally and form reasonable personal philosophies. The stuff he does is truly unique in a medium which very easily becomes samey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-I think he\u0027s super cool and does fantastic work! Many people look down on it for being too dark but for me it\u0027s fantastic.
