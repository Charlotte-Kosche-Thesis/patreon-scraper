    "summary": "I\u0027m Joshua Unruh, superhero expert and person who thinks way too hard about genre fiction. I know things like what time Bruce Wayne\u0027s parents were murdered and why it\u0027s significant, why a modern take on Superman couldn\u0027t have him hailing from Kansas, and why Captain America wears swashbuckler boots and chainmail.* \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd when I was a kid, absolutely nobody cared.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut in addition to knowing that stuff, I also understand \u003cem\u003ewhy it\u0027s important\u003c/em\u003e! That\u0027s quite a bit rarer, even among superhero nerds. Plus, with superheroes invading every level of media consumption, they\u0027re also starting to inform popular philosophy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now a lot of people care! I\u0027ve been cornered at parties to explain why a terrifying horse monster is the greatest character in Thor comics but won\u0027t appear in movies. I\u0027ve been begged to explain why anybody would like Superman, let alone love him like I do. I\u0027ve preached the need for and power of diversity in superhero comics. Believe it or not, people \u003cem\u003elistened\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuddenly, understanding why the obscure bits of superhero lore matter is a hotter commodity than twelve-year-old Josh clutching his Wolverine comics to his chest could ever have hoped to dream.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, dear patrons, I\u0027m going to explain every single bit of this superhero esoterica to you. That is, if you\u0027ll have me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming my patron will give you entrance to live seminars on some of the biggest names in superheroes as well as give you a say in who and what I cover when. But first and foremost, it will allow me to share this deep pop cultural knowledge across more videos and podcasts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*In case you were wondering, to unlock a hidden entrance to the Batcave, you have to move the hands on the grandfather clock to this time like a combination lock; Kansas\u00a0is no longer a breeding ground for the kind of selfless ideals Populism bred during the Depression when Superman was originally created; Cap represents an idealized America in World War II, a shining knight but one that only defends its allies rather than attack."
