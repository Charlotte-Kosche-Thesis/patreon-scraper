I\u0027m a children\u0027s author or, as I like to put it, a \u003cem\u003eTeller of Fibs\u003c/em\u003e. Apparently, I do it well. You may have heard of my first series of novels\u003cem\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Luck-Uglies-Paul-Durham/dp/0062271504\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTHE LUCK UGLIES\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, which was published by HarperCollins. My books have won a bunch of awards if you\u0027re interested in that sort of thing, including being named an ALA Notable Book, a New York Public Library Top Book for Reading and Sharing, a \u003cem\u003eBooklist\u003c/em\u003e Top Ten First Novel for Youth, the CYBILS Award Winner, and a \u003cem\u003eKansas City Star\u003c/em\u003e Best Book of the Year. But more importantly, my writing has given me the opportunity to travel to schools and libraries around the country in an effort to inspire a love of reading in children. I\u0027m constantly inspired by letters from the parents of reluctant readers whose sons and daughters have gone on to become dedicated bookworms after reading my books. For those of you who may be inclined to support my efforts to reach as many of those readers as possible, I hope you will read on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eMY PASSION\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always had a soft spot for two groups of people--kids and aspiring authors (probably because I was once both of those myself). I left the corporate world three years ago so that I could spend my time writing for children and teaching writers of all ages how to follow their vision and pave their own creative paths. It\u0027s my passion, and I am so fortunate to wake up every day and do things that I love. For a full year after my first book was published, I visited schools absolutely free. Even now, with three books under my belt and more on the way, I set my speaking fee lower than my peers\u0027 to make an author visit attainable by schools regardless of their budget. Unfortunately, that\u0027s not necessarily a path to job security. Despite what you may have been led to believe, most published children\u0027s authors don\u0027t live in castles or get chauffeured to their public appearances. This one lives in a modest house in New Hampshire and drives an old Subaru to his book signings. I \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e get to write in an abandoned chicken coop at the edge of a swamp, though, which beats writing in some drafty castle any day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this Patreon page so that I can continue to share the type of work I truly believe in. I will always find a way to write books that entertain and challenge young readers--that\u0027s a promise. I was doing it before a publisher ever paid me and I\u0027ll keep doing it long after they stop. But with your support, I can do so much more. Here are just a few examples:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can keep producing my iTunes podcast, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://pauldurhambooks.com/telling-lies-to-children/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTELLING LIES TO CHILDREN\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, where I interview bestselling authors, editors, and agents in order to give teachers, librarians, aspiring writers, and readers a behind-the-scenes look at the children\u0027s publishing industry. It\u0027s always free to listen and I don\u0027t sell advertising, which ensures that I can invite guests who share a passion for producing quality books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can keep offering  free Skype visits to schools and libraries. Any time, anywhere. If a teacher has an enthusiastic classroom of students and and internet connection, all they need to do is reach out and I will spend a half-hour or more answering questions for their readers. I\u0027ve already \"visited\" schools from California to Krakow, Poland, with a whole lot of stops in between.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI can offer scholarships to my \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://pauldurhambooks.com/tribe/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTRIBE OF THE MIND\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e creative writing workshops for children, giving talented young writers who may not otherwise be able to afford a writing workshop the opportunity to attend.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e Most importantly, I will have the time and flexibility I need to visit as many students as possible, in-person, in cities and towns near you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eWHAT I CAN OFFER YOU\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will consider joining me on this journey by becoming a patron.

But I have a new pet project for teens and young adults that I am writing \"on spec.\" That means I\u0027m writing the full manuscript before offering it to the publishing world. Why? Because I believe that it\u0027s complex, nuanced, and ambitious. When publishers get their hands on projects to early, they sometimes try to mold them, label them, and stuff them into categories where they don\u0027t belong. This one is too good and too important to me. I want it to stand on its own, as-is, and my patrons will be part of its development.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e"
