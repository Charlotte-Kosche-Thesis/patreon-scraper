I have a vast collection of latex outfits of all different types from leggings to dresses to coats. I wear my latex as a fashion and wear almost all my latex out in public (as well as for shoots of course!). I do have a boyfriend who also doubles as my personal photographer (all photos on here are and will be taken by him). \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eModelling latex is only a hobby for me at the moment as I have a full time office job from Monday to Friday. I regularly get new latex outfits to add to my collection, be it from collaborations on Instagram (my Instagram user is @MissPheeJameson) or just from when I go shopping at some latex shops in London! So there will definitely be no shortage of new content! \ud83d\ude09\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for the support I receive, it truly means so much to me! \ud83d\udc96\u003cbr\u003e"
