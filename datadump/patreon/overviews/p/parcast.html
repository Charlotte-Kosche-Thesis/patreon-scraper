We did not take into consideration just how many of our listeners tune in to all or most of our shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of your feedback, we will continue the Parcast Network Page for $10 a month. This will continue to allow access to all of our shows, ad-free. We are also going to continue with the new pages for our individual shows (\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/parcastserialkillers\"\u003eSerial Killers\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/unsolvedmurders\"\u003eUnsolved Murders\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/cults\"\u003eCults\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/historicalfigures\"\u003eHistorical Figures\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/haunted_places\"\u003eHaunted Places\u003c/a\u003e), so if you prefer to support one show instead of the whole network, you can for $6 a month.

Yes, you. If you\u2019re on this page, you\u2019re most\nlikely a Parcast listener. And if you aren\u2019t, well, maybe you\u2019re about to be.\nParcast would not be here if it weren\u2019t for our wonderful listeners. You\u2019ve\nbeen a huge part of our launch and growth, and we consider you part of the\nParcast family. You are the most important part of what we do, and we can\u2019t\nexpress how amazing you all have been to us. \nSo from the bottom of our hearts, thank you!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eParcast in a\nNutshell\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.parcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eParcast\u003c/a\u003e is a production house and network that brings you\npodcasts like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.parcast.com/unsolved/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUnsolved Murders: True Crime Stories\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.parcast.com/serial/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSerial Killers\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e. \n\u003c/em\u003eUnlike other podcasts produced by one or two\ncreatives, Parcast is a team of over 40 people, including screenwriters, actors\nand sound designers currently producing three new episodes per week. The team\nworks together to produce podcasts with everything done in-house, similar to\nthe way the classic movie studio system produced great films. In the last 30 days we\u2019ve had over 1.5 million listens. In\nthe last seven months, we have had over 10 million listens. And last year, \n\u003cem\u003eRemarkable Lives. Tragic Deaths\u003c/em\u003e. was\nnamed one of iTunes best debuts of 2016. \nNone of this would be possible without YOU, our listeners. So thank you!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShowing as\nMuch as Telling\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nPodcasting is among the most intimate forms of media. It\u2019s\nyou, your headphones and your host. When podcasting strays from the traditional\nhost format and puts you inside a story, showing you scenes and events, it becomes\neven more intimate. Through storytelling podcasts, listeners continually form\ntheir own pictures of the story and in that way, our listeners\u2019 imaginations\nare part of the production.  We put a\npremium on providing entertainment just as much as well-researched information.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFather \u0026amp;\nSon Team\n\u003c/h3\u003e\nOur CEO/President, Max, grew up in a radio household. He\ninherited his passion for audio and storytelling from his dad, Ron. So, immediately\nupon dreaming up the idea that would become Parcast, he recruited Ron out of\nretirement to help consult and make his dreams a reality. Their relationship\nhas had a profound impact on the whole Parcast team. Together they have built a\nculture of creativity and respect. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy We\u2019re\nAsking You for Money\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe currently produce 3 weekly shows, and plan to release 2\nto 3 brand new podcast series in 2017.  Our\ngoal is to put our listeners first, and improve with every episode. However,\neach episode costs thousands of dollars to produce. Why? Every episode is\nwritten, acted, and sound designed by trained professionals. A few other costs\ninclude the recording studio, equipment and online hosting. Producing podcasts\nis an uphill battle\u2014like the Wild West, the podcast space changes daily, and we\nstrive to stay independent so we can create shows that are fresh and original.\nIn order to continue releasing episodes weekly, we need stability. You\u2019ve\nprobably heard our ads, and we love our advertisers, but unfortunately, in the\npodcast space, ads aren\u2019t consistent. Our listeners, however, are. Hundreds of\nthousands of you tune in every week, and we\u2019d love to continue to produce high\nquality podcasts for you for a long time to come.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd if you can\u2019t afford to give but still want to help, you\ncan write a nice review, give our shows 5 star ratings on iTunes or your\nfavorite podcast directory, or share the podcasts with your friends, all of\nwhich help out tremendously!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you again for all of your support!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
