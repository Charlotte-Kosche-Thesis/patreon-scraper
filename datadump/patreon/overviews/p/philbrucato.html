    "summary": "Hi,\nfolks! I\u2019m Satyr, aka Satyros Phil Brucato, the guy behind a steady stream of\nbooks, games, comics, articles, stories, essays, and various projects since the\nlate 1980s. Best-known for my work with \u003cem\u003eMage:\nThe Ascension\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Sorcerers Crusade\u003c/em\u003e, and other World of Darkness multimedia settings from White\nWolf Game Studio and Onyx Path Publishing \u2013 as well as for my work with\nnewWitch, Realms of Fantasy, and Witches \u0026amp; Pagans magazines, \u003cem\u003eDeliria: Faerie Tales for a New Millennium\u003c/em\u003e,\nthe webcomic \u003cem\u003eArpeggio\u003c/em\u003e, and other\nstuff as well \u2013 I\u2019ve spent almost 40 years as a professional creative person in\nmedia ranging from writing and gaming to music, acting, dance, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCreativity\nis my life, my love, my passion and vocation. It\u2019s also a lousy way to pay the\nbills, especially once you hit the magical half-century mark when your body\nstarts reminding you about its pending expiration date. I have tons of things\nstill left within me to create, and although my health is good these days (*\u003cem\u003eknock on every piece of wood in the Pacific\nNorthwest\u003c/em\u003e*) I have a finite number of years with which to produce them.\nBecause creativity demands time, money, and other resources, I have to budget\neach project I create within the parameters of home finances, health care, work\ntime, and \u2013 the big one \u2013 the production costs involved with hiring and paying\nmy creative collaborators what their time and work are worth. These days, I\nhave a sweet gig crafting \u003cem\u003eMage: The\nAscension\u003c/em\u003e for Onyx Path and CCP. That gig pays many of my day-to-day\nhousehold expenses. I have many other projects to share, though\u2026 and I want to\nbring them all to life. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFolks\nwho\u2019ve been familiar with my work over the years know that I\u2019ve started various\nprojects that wound up stalled or in outright limbo \u2013 \u003cem\u003eDeliria\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eArpeggio\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eHoly Creatures To and Fro\u003c/em\u003e, and plenty\nmore besides. The biggest reason for those delays is simple: Aside from my\ntext-form novels, those projects involve other creative professionals: artists,\nillustrators, editors, musicians, graphic designers, web technicians, personal\nassistants, even the occasional videographer or sound engineer. These folks do\ngreat work, and I pay them for their time and effort. As a creative\nprofessional myself, I never lose sight of the fact that \u003cem\u003eart is work and work is worth money\u003c/em\u003e; hence, I pay the people who\nwork with me\u2026 and if I cannot afford to pay them, then I do not commission\ntheir work and so that work remains undone. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCreativity\nhas material expenses too: web costs, printing costs, shipping costs, computer\nhardware and software, studio time, office supplies, taxes, fees, etc. etc.\netc. And again, if I can\u2019t afford, say, the printing costs of a given book or\nthe hosting fees for a web-based comic strip, then those projects remain\nvaporware until I\u2019ve got the funds to complete their production. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs\na result, projects like \u003cem\u003eDeliria\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eArpeggio\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003ePowerchords\u003c/em\u003e, and other efforts of mine wind up being delayed for\nyears\u2026 or even, like \u003cem\u003eArpeggio\u003c/em\u003e, being\ndiscontinued entirely. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd\nI want to change that situation. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\ncreate the things I create because I\u2019m passionate about them. Speaking\npersonally, I feel frustrated when a vision I\u2019ve worked hard to manifest winds\nup relegated to the sidelines of my primary job. I\u2019m not complaining\u2026 most\nfolks in my line of work don\u2019t even \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e\nthat primary job\u2026 but I\u2019d really like to share those other projects with you\ntoo. I want to bring back \u003cem\u003eDeliria\u003c/em\u003e, to\nturn \u003cem\u003ePowerchords\u003c/em\u003e from a one-off game\nsourcebook into a full-fledged series, to produce audio versions of my stories\nand craft graphic novels with friends like Bryan Syme, to record tracks from my\nband Telesterion, and to do other crazy shit that my mind is always churning\nout.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHence,\nthis Patreon campaign \u2013 a campaign that goes beyond sponsoring my own life to\nshare these creations with other artists and our audience. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere\u2019s\nwhat I can offer for your support: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2022\nBlog updates about my ongoing projects \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2022\nWork-in-progress previews\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2022\nProduction dairies for current creations\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2022\nInsider tidbits \u2013 sketches, excerpts, cut text, and so forth\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2022\nExclusive content for Patreon sponsors\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u2022\nAdditional productions when we reach various stretch goals. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor now, we\u0027re going to start things simple.  Check below for current pledge options.  Based on the kind of response we get on this campaign, we\u0027ll come up with some awesome rewards for our higher level patrons.  I honestly have no idea what my work is worth to you, so this is an opportunity to find out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank\nyou for whatever kinds of support you can offer. If nothing else, please spread\nthe word.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s do some awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
