    "summary": "Hello folks welcome to my Patreon page! Check to the left for my goals! If you\u0027d like to see my videos before they are released on Youtube you can come here and for one dollar (or more if you like) you can watch my videos at least one week (or more) before they appear on Youtube! If you don\u0027t mind waiting a week or longer to see them then nothing will change and you\u0027ll still be able to see them for free when they are released on Youtube. From time to time you\u0027ll also have access to videos that will NEVER be aired on Youtube but only to you, my patrons. As a patron you can request videos on certain subjects, certain repairs or tunes you would like to learn and as time permits and IF I am able to fulfill your request, I will make those types of videos specifically for you!! Alsoif you become a patron whatever you pledge you will then have access to all of my videos here and on Youtube! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you have stopped by to support my Youtube channel where I teach music from time to time, repair musical instruments and give you MANY free tips on guitars and musical related things and how to repair tips. Many of the repairs I video to help teach you to work on your own instruments saving you lots of money. Also tips on caring for your instruments so they will be well maintained over the long haul. Donations I receive from here will be applied right back to my channel so I can continue to teach and share with you many repairs you can make to your own instruments without having to pay someone a fortune to do it. Donations to support my channel are not only greatly appreciated but turned right back into tools, cameras, lenses, anything I can use to keep videos coming and better videos for you! So thanks in advance for your support and thanks for being a part of our Youtube family!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

So if this goal is met, I will be replacing my oldest camera and in turn videos you love and learn from will continue regularly as they have in the past and you can continue to laugh, love and learn uninterrupted. So if you can only drop a couple dollars here that would be great! If not, I still love ya, and videos will continue anyhow, for as long as the equipment lasts. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e",

Here\u0027s the plan, I have set one goal for $500 per month, if we get enough patrons to reach this goal, \nin 2 to 4 months (2 months = $1000 to 4 months = $2000 guitar) I would be able to purchase a guitar that YOU (my patrons) chose, be it a new guitar or used, I will fix it if needed and set it up to\n the winners specifications (all on videos) and send it to the winner \nfor free!!! The ONLY thing it will cost you to win is what ever amount \nyou pledge here per month. And then we\u0027ll do it all over again! Giving \neveryone more than one chance to win! Another option is, have the contest first, then let the winner of the contest choose the guitar (within the above price range for now) they want, I buy it, make videos setting it to their specs and mail it to them! YES! It\u0027s that easy! So lets do this folks! Become a \npatron, make a pledge, enjoy my videos and lets see who the first winner\n is!\u003cbr\u003eYOU CAN HELP! Tell your friends and Youtube buddies to come here and get involved! Lets make this happen! And MAJOR THANKS to those of you that have signed on so far!\u003cbr\u003e",
