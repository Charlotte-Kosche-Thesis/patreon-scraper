    "summary": "Starcraft is so much more to me than a game, it\u0027s something special. I always enjoyed RTS games even as a small child playing CnC, Dark Reign and Warcraft 2. But it wasn\u0027t until 2010 when SC2 came out that I realised just how deep the strategy and skill goes. I was blown away watching guys like Artosis and Day9 explain intricate details of the game in a way that even I as someone who hadn\u0027t played a much multiplayer could understand. They opened my eyes to the beauty of the game... a few years later I was flying all over the world competing as a progamer. I got to experience and learn so much because of this game, it became my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn early 2016 i was semi-retired as a pro player and couldn\u0027t help but notice the lack of analytical content in our community. The movement towards people talking about Starcraft strategy in reductionist terms. People would always say \"That\u0027s just a build order counter\", \"X just beats Y\", \"Z is imba!\"... but there was so little discussion of WHY people thought these things. Everything was taken for granted and assumed. The community had reached a point where no-one takes the time to explain the basics anymore as it\u0027s assumed knowledge. And yet SC is such a complex game! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew players were lost in a sea of technical jargon, veterans were simplifying the game and dismissing playstyles they didn\u0027t understand as \"gimmicky\" and no-one was bringing the game back to basics and trying to reason out the finer details of everything. There was little post-tournament analysis of WHY pro play was so smart and efficient. The Starcraft community had lost it\u0027s will to analyse and think about these things. I wanted to change that. So I started \"The PiG Daily\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI stream and upload The PiG\u00a0Daily Starcraft videos 5 days a week. I make analytical and educational content that teaches players how to understand and think about Starcraft. \u00a0I want everyone to appreciate the complex beauty of this game, and seek to do so in my own way. The show is inspired by Day9\u0027s huge influence on the Starcraft scene but I don\u0027t just try to emulate him, everything I make I do in my own way and my own style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSchedule:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSundays:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eBeginner-basics - an episode where I help brand new and less experienced players explore the competitive experience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeginner Basics episodes so far: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFUDU8AOevUf-8cdOzmuZ5QZqVg3A3VC6\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFUDU8AOevU...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMondays:\u003c/strong\u003e Pro-game/conceptual episode - an episode where I showcase a famous pro players replay - breaking down what makes their strategy work so well OR look at a concept of the game such as \"defending all-ins\", \"Scouting vs Terran\" and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI split most episodes into race-specific playlists:\u003cbr\u003eProtoss:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFUDU8AOevUc4Y10yIUlMsXSiy-F0LEgP\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFUDU8AOevU...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTerran:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFUDU8AOevUdGldXWE5C7U8H2cCB53RYU\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFUDU8AOevU...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZerg:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFUDU8AOevUcJr5YGuAJRu_egZPNSAA0M\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFUDU8AOevU...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTuesdays: \u003c/strong\u003eI Cast Your Freakin Awesome Replays or \"ICYFAR\" for short is a show reminiscent of Day9\u0027s Funday Monday series. I commentate replays submitted by viewers attempting to win with a specific Challenge such as \"you\u0027re only allowed to use flying units\". The aim is for every player from bronze through to GM to have a chance to have their games showcased to an audience - and for us to have some fun while we do it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e ICYFAR episodes so far::\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFUDU8AOevUczdbU-zuY0-vykRSR1YsLC\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFUDU8AOevU...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWednesdays:\u003c/strong\u003e \"What If? Wednesdays\" is a rare insight into how progamers practice and understand the game. I invite 2 progamers on the show to play a showmatch. After the game, the loser analyses where they think they made a key mistake. We recover the game from JUST before that key mistake and the player is given a second chance to right their errors. At the end of the rematch both players hop onto a call and we debate what the correct choices where, and what the players could have done differently to take advantage of each other. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat If?

I answer as many questions from chat as possible and seek to commentate my thought process whilst I\u0027m playing. Sometimes commentary dies down when I\u0027m multi-tasking like crazy, but I will always analyse what the key points were afterwards and often analyse the replay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a big hole in the Starcraft scene for this sort of content ever since Day9 left. I want to fill this vacuum - I still do some shoutcasting and coaching to make ends meet but 90% of my efforts are going into the Daily and my regular stream content. My goal is to provide something the Starcraft scene has been lacking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me through my Patreon is the best way to ensure I can keep on making the Daily and improving all of my content. There\u0027s absolutely no pressure to support what I do - I simply hope that anyone who\u0027s found themselves entertained watching a lot of my content will consider a small contribution so it can continue.\u003cbr\u003e"
