    "summary": "There has been a movement within the last few years to bring conversations about death back into the public sphere, as evidenced by the popularity of \u003cem\u003eThe Order of The Good Death\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Death Cafe \u003c/em\u003emovement\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I began making these videos after reflecting upon my own grieving process, and I like to think that they are part of the larger cultural conversation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe videos I share here are mostly shot in cemeteries, using images of melancholy objects to relate back to themes of memory and place. It is my belief that these videos serve not just as video art, but as meditations on our mortality and reflections on the things we hold most dear. I often use analog glitch methods to create the videos, though just as often I shoot with my DSLR in a more documentary style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of the videos you see will eventually be collected and offered on VHS as the second iteration of \u003cem\u003eThe Cemetery Tapes, \u003c/em\u003ea project I began a few years back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a video artist, editor, educator and VR content creator living in Los Angeles. I obtained my M.F.A. in Media Arts (with a certificate in Digital Humanities) from UCLA in June of 2015, and completed my M.A. in Digital Art and Video in May of 2013. I also hold a B.F.A. in Fine Art/Graphic Design, with a minor in Religious Studies. I am currently associate faculty in Digital Media Arts at IVC in Irvine, CA.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe month of October is my promo month. I will be posting videos daily. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I will continue to make and post videos about topics specifically related to mourning and grief.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
