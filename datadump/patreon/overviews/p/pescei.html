I started teaching myself to draw and getting more serious around the age of 10. Upon finishing high school, I had many options for a college and career, but I found art and design being a more passionate subject. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, I\u0027m a self-taught artist and studied at Full Sail University for Digital Arts and Design. My ideas generate from my love of games, books, nature, art, and the influences around me. I am currently a freelance illustrator and designer, but I would love to work for Blizzard Entertainment or Disney as a character designer or designer in general.\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cbr\u003eIf you do plan to support me, thank you! You are the reason I have the ability to continue to do what I love, and grow as a person! Thank you again for your support, and I hope we grow together and prosper!"
