    "summary": "Hey guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Sandy Rojas or \"Popushi\". I\u0027ve made parody songs for League of Legends and other things for a few years now, and I\u0027d like to continue to do so! It\u0027s very apparent that I have huge hiatuses between my content and that is rather sad. The reasoning for that is because I lack all skill to audio master my own songs so I rely on others to do so. They usually take long periods of time, especially because they\u0027re doing it for free. So by pleading to me, I\u0027ll use the money so that I can commission others to help mix my songs, so that I can sing more frequently and make more videos!"

In 2015 I had the wonderful opportunity to become a professional voice actress and have since landed a few roles! But way before that, I always did YouTube and singing as a hobby. I became busier moving out to LA to pursue my dream, but I don\u0027t want to stop doing the things I loved such as singing and entertaining. If at all possible I\u0027d like to continue to do that, but on a more frequent basis, but to do that, I need your help! I hope I can do many of the ideas I have in mind, and that you\u0027ll enjoy them too.",
