    "summary": "Once upon a time\nin an English village, an eight-year-old schoolboy drew a sketch for a visiting\nteacher. Without knowing the woman, he listened to God\u2019s\nheart for her and drew what he saw. The drawing was filled with pathways\nleading between God\u2019s heart, the woman, and the arts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI was that visiting teacher. And what the young\nboy gave me was a piece of prophetic art. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nProphetic art is about hearing God and creatively\nsharing His love for others. It could be done with painting, writing, dance. It\ncould be done with a child\u0027s sketch. Prophetic art is anything that calls out the best in others, anything\nthat brings heaven to earth in a creative way.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have practiced and taught prophetic art for\nyears, and I\u2019ve long been dreaming about what it would look like for prophetic\nart to be part of that great exhortation: \u201con earth as it is in heaven.\u201d But\nwhen people would ask me for more prophetic art information, I couldn\u2019t find a comprehensive\nresource to recommend. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI discovered that each month, about 1,000 people\nsearch for prophetic art online via one search engine alone. But the search results\nyield mostly personal artists\u2019 web pages or sub pages on other sites. There was no page devoted solely to sharing a broad spectrum of prophetic art\ninformation. Until now. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSomeone once said that if you can accomplish your\ndreams on your own, you\u2019re not dreaming big enough. Well, I am embarking on a\nbig dream\u2026or the first part of one! I have begun to create a website\ncalled \u003ca href=\"http://propheticart.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePropehtic\nArt: Bringing Heaven to E(art)h\u003c/a\u003e. It\u2019s a resource page for prophetic\narts. My goal is to share what I\u2019ve already discovered and to continually add\nnew resources as I find them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTurns out, this dream is bigger than I thought. For\nthe site to be truly helpful, it needs your help. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen you visit \u003ca href=\"http://propheticart.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePropheticArt.Info\u003c/a\u003e,\nyou\u2019ll see that I still need to add plenty of content in some of the menus. Researching\nand curating that content takes time. For example: I only suggest books that\nI\u2019ve read, and though I\u2019ve read a lot, I have a lot more to read. Also, my\ncreative strengths are in two-dimensional arts and writing, but I hope to add\nmore resources for prophetic music and dance. I also want to connect with people and groups who are creating prophetic art--for the site to be a community\nbuilder. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so I\u0027m reaching out to my community to get the project going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI chose this Patreon crowdfunding platform\nbecause it creates ongoing support: patronage. And you can become a patron for\nthe teensy starting amount of $1 per month (see the sidebar with other pledge\noptions). You can change your monthly amount whenever you want. You can cancel\nwhenever you want.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTypically, Patreon artists give their patrons\nrewards for different levels of pledges. But I made my \u201crewards\u201d more like a\ncontinued loop of giving. So when you pledge any amount to \u003ca href=\"http://propheticart.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePropheticArt.Info\u003c/a\u003e,\nI won\u2019t just use it to keep the website growing, but also to help support other\nartists, organizations, and things I haven\u2019t even dreamed up yet! I\u2019ve listed\nsome ideas at each pledge level, but they will likely blend and weave together\na bit, and each level will build on the next. Once the costs at lower levels\nare covered, your pledges will help with the next level. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eA note: Since Patreon is about ongoing support for artists,\nit\u2019s not really set up for one-time donations. But prophetic art\u00a0website\nitself is! If you want to make a one-time donation, just visit the\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=9WCIrUZQy3M8NmzVEfbzmLoSOsjO2DcIveL76E6JleOJIAXfcxDWcCONsl0phsNLiUvdBG\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edonate page\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.
