     "about": "Hi, I\u0027m Wes Otis, founder of Plate Mail Games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started gaming early, I think I was seven or eight when I found the Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons Red Box at K-mart, of all places. I had to have it and begged my mother \u0027til she gave in. I\u0027ve been playing RPGs ever since, and they help keep my imagination alive. I got into music at 15 when I got my first guitar. I had wanted one since my two sisters received acoustic guitars as presents. I wanted to be a rock star, and for the next 13 years, that was the goal I went after... but it never happened. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have terrible stage fright. Playing gigs was too much at the time, plus I had fallen in love with my lead singer and best friend. We married and eventually had two kids. My life changed, but it changed for the better. During all this, my dad found a place called The Conservatory of Recording Arts \u0026amp; Sciences. He was desperate that I learn a trade besides wanna-be rock star. I went, and am glad he found the school and encouraged me to go there. I love being a sound designer. After graduation and getting married, I started my career. I have had the privilege to work with many great people and companies. Being able to work on animation was just as good to me as being a rock star, though I still play almost every day. I have worked on several different projects, mostly for Disney and Warner Brothers. All have pushed me to be a better designer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlate Mail Games is run by wife and myself. We create audio for tabletop RPGs as well as the Dungeon World compatible setting, the Realms of Rothaen. I love gaming and put all my creative experience into my art. You can see me run games and use my audio on Black Bag, my Call of Cthulhu show that airs every-other Friday on Saving Throw\u0027s twitch and YouTube channel. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
