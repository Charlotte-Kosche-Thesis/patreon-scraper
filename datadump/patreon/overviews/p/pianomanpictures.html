    "summary": "Hey there! So, we are Piano Man Pictures, a group of filmmakers and artists living in Memphis, TN. It is our passion to tell stories in many shapes and forms- shorts, features, series, narrative, documentary; you name it, we love it. We love making movies, talking about movies, and living and breathing all things movies. And we want to share our passion for movies with you. If you\u0027re like us and you even dream in movie themes, then Piano Man Pictures is the place for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out some some of our movies and shows to see that we mean business: \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJrGuRCJj9M\"\u003eAvarice\u003c/a\u003e- A fantasy film about a young girl awakened by a magical fairy light. Follow her as she journeys through a land of soot and greed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-_SDbzXqOg\u0026amp;t=61s\"\u003eHirsch\u003c/a\u003e- A science fiction film following a rookie copy-cat artist whose self-defeating fears start to take him over after he is transported to a frightening new world. It\u2019s a film that asks questions about the importance of the artist and his impact, and the thin line between truth and happiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBHh7L9zYGw\"\u003eFaceless But Remembered\u003c/a\u003e- After a new kidney transplant, Camp finds himself trapped, working on New Years Eve with his violent Uncle Ellis, a transplant recipient 20 years prior.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAn_DEoiYDLt_0nDWXDAzzP6OnabW2b6E\"\u003eTotol Recal\u003c/a\u003e- Our movie review show.

We all have day jobs, families and lives, just like all of you, but we\u0027ve decided to go on a foolish endeavor to chase after our dreams and make films we can share with the world. We sincerely appreciate all of you who already follow us on this journey and engage in the stuff we do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, we need help maintaining what we have to keep the content coming out. Our biggest expense is our studio where we keep our gear, store our props, house our sets, film many of our projects, edit our movies, and so much more. We also need help with gear maintenance (gear breaks and often needs to be repaired or replaced), advertisement money, and support for the monthly content we film like Totol Recal and our Short Shorts. \u003cbr\u003eRight now we\u2019re paying out of pocket to keep everything afloat, but that takes away from the time we can spend on what\u2019s really important: creating meaningful films and content to share with you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of our tiers will be set up as donations that give you access to more behind the scenes and free downloads of our content before anyone else can even pay to see it. (VIPs should feel free to suggest ideas and we\u0027ll try to do those, too).  As a disclaimer, this is a per month donation, so that\u0027s why the amounts are so low.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFilmmaking means so much to all of us at Piano Man Pictures for so many reasons, but one of the main attractions is the community it\u2019s developed. Through all of our work, we\u2019ve come to think of each other as family. We see each other through thick and thin. And we want our patrons to be part of that as well. If you make the choice to support us, it\u2019s because you understand why this important. Stories shape our world, inspire us to reach beyond the possible, and challenge us to be the best versions of ourselves.  Stories are the driving force in all of us, and we want you to take this journey by our sides. We\u2019re very excited to welcome you to our Piano Man Pictures family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
