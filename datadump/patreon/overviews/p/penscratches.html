    "summary": "Hi there! My name is N. Pivonka, also known as Indilee in some circles, and I love to write. People like reading what I put to pen and paper, so what better time than to create more? I love setting goals - they\u0027re the best motivator - and Patreon is a good platform for me to be able to do this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo who are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer - novels, short stories, novellas - you name it, I write it! I\u0027ve been scribbling stories on paper since I was a child and have been ever since. I have a BA in Creative Writing and am currently working on finishing my first novel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dabble in most genres, but I write fantasy, modern fantasy, and supernatural fiction. I also write reviews from time to time about books, comics and video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this Patreon for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of right now, this Patreon is set up as a tip jar of sorts. Any amount that you pledge will help me take care of financial obligations and allow me to work on more writing and content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the 5$ mark - you\u0027ll gain access to the Patron only WIP blog posts, where I\u0027ll share posts about the writing process, snippets or samples of writing, possible background information for stories and much more. This will update at least once a month, if not more, with some written word from me. Fiction provided here may change upon release or finalization, but you\u0027ll get an inside look at how things progress and change as a story develops.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the near future, more tiered rewards will become available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere can I find some of your work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027d like a sample of my fiction, I\u0027ve been published in \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/wv02#\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWerewolves Versus: Romance\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, a pay what you wish publication. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOtherwise, I can be found talking about writing, editing and flailing about excitedly on my \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/penscratches\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy ultimate goal is to make a living off of my writing and Patreon has the tools to allow me to do this. With your support, I will be able to focus more on writing, producing content and building connections between myself and others. I believe that supporting writers is so vastly important as it is a difficult profession to commit to. With Patreon, supporters have greater control over their support to my creations - something that I find to be the best option for everyone involved!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said - some tiered content may be released to the public in the future, but only after patrons get to see it first. At the moment, there is no current plan to do this. If it does come up, patrons will get their rewards here first for at least 24 hours, if not longer, like two to four weeks before the public. I don\u0027t care much for pay walls, thus this will allow me to build a community with all who enjoy writing and discussing it with all eventually.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a pay what you like pledge system. You choose the amount you wish to pledge and once a month, Patreon will charge you the pledged amount. You control everything regarding your pledges, can change how much or little at any time, if you\u0027d wish for tiered rewards or not and only want to pledge money without worrying about anything else. It\u0027s very easy! Just click the orange button at the top of this page to become a patron and the \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203913709-How-do-I-make-a-pledge-\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esite will walk you through the rest\u003c/a\u003e. :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing to note for new patrons: I do \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/208404313-Why-was-I-charged-immediately-Will-You-Charge-Me-Again-\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echarge upfront\u003c/a\u003e when you first pledge to my Patreon! This means that you will be charged the amount of your pledge immediately when you join, but afterward, the reoccurring charge will happen on the first of the month, so you\u0027ll know when to expect it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the case that you previously pledged and cannot do so any longer, you can \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204606205-How-do-I-delete-my-pledge-\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecancel your pledge at any time\u003c/a\u003e. No hard feelings! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs that it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor now - yes! Thank you SO much for taking the time to visit my Patreon. If you do decide to pledge, double thank you! It\u0027s because of you that I\u0027m able to keep doing what I love to do. \u003cbr\u003e"
