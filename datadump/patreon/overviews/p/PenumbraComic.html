On her first visit back to where it all began her past swiftly draws her back in. Arcadia rescues a slave girl, named Astrid, who Arcadia recognizes to be from her homeland. The two will set sail to find out what has become of their once thriving clan, while Arcadia relives the hard past, and finds that perhaps mercy is not always the answer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePenumbra is an adventure comic, featuring light hearted topics like romance, friendship, trust, and goofy shenanigans. Along with harder topics like abuse, manipulation, slavery, and mental illness. With a diverse cast ranging in cultural background, sexual orientation, gender identity, and relationships. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig07.deviantart.net/9b26/f/2017/233/5/5/penumbra_logo_by_owl_flight-dbkundf.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePenumbra is an idea that\u0027s been very near and dear to my heart for many years. It\u0027s always been a dream of mine to turn it into a comic but I didn\u0027t ever expect it to happen. Due to some recent changes in my life that have surprisingly left me in a financially stable position with enough free time to work on personal projects. I figured it was time to give this little dream of mine a shot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate every view, like, comment, or share given to any of my Penumbra related work. It is such an honor to know people find my work engaging enough to become patrons and I cannot express my gratitude with just words."
