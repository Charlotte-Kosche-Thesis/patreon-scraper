It features, in no particular order: political upheaval, fake news, war with Europe, an unsuccessful attempt at Scottish independence, religious intolerance, cash for honours, and a lot of people with very silly hats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSound familiar? For some reason this significant segment of history is overlooked in various curriculums when it is becoming ever more relevant to our current time. \u003cem\u003ePAST TENSE: BRITISH CIVIL WARS \u003c/em\u003edoesn\u0027t just bring history to life - it shows how it never died in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Feasibly Productions, a podcast production company focusing on matters of fact and fiction that we think are well worth your attention. \u003cem\u003ePAST TENSE: BRITISH CIVIL WARS \u003c/em\u003eis our first podcast out of the gate. We are excited for you to join us on what promises to be an ever-shifting journey, as our production schedule will allow us room for manoeuvre on the impact of current events and how long a shadow centuries of political organisation really can cast on us today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour host for \u003cem\u003ePAST TENSE: BRITISH CIVIL WARS \u003c/em\u003eis Fiona Barnett,\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ea writer, editor, tutor, and theatre critic based in Edinburgh, UK. She has studied law, but not history, and her favourite things are other people\u0027s stories and finding out a lot about obscure stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will go towards the overheads of the podcast, covering our equipment and labour costs, as well as helping us all sleep better knowing that you\u0027re out there, cheering us on. Also, coffee. Honestly, it\u0027s mainly coffee.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions, please get in touch with us on our various platforms. Things are tight for most of just now, so even if you can\u0027t pledge, please don\u0027t underestimate the power of your word of mouth.
