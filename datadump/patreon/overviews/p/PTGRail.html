    "summary": "Where to start? I am presently running a YouTube channel dedicated to creating tutorial and route learning videos in the game Train Simulator. Started just three months ago, the channel has already seen substantial growth and still keeps on growing. The video I have shared here is a sample of the videos which I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m looking for support at YouTube earnings are notoriously unreliable. Any money raised from this project will be used to give my PC a much needed upgrade as well as being used towards the purchase of new routes and trains, enabling me to produce wider variety of videos in much higher quality than at present.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will always offer all content for free, this is simply a way for me to ask people if they would like to donate something towards the PTGRail project. It takes many hours of work just to create one video, let alone the number of videos which have already been created. With more funding, I will be able to create higher quality videos with more content, more often.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother way in which you could support me if you wish to and don\u0027t want to use Patreon is through my Steam wishlist. You can find my current, updated Steam wishlist here with all of the DLC I am currently trying to get:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ptgreensmith/wishlist\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://steamcommunity.com/id/ptgreensmith/wishlist\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks for visiting this page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePete (PTGRail)\u003cbr\u003e"
