     "description": "You love unique coffee mugs ~ obviously, since you picked this reward. You will receive one hand made (by me) coffee mug a month for twelve consecutive months. If you are in a hurry, you can have them all at once in case you are hosting a soiree which requires twelve coffee mugs. Either way, these will all be different. There really is no telling what they will look like. I assure you they will hold liquids, other than that, I simply don\u0027t know what mood will strike the particular day I make said mugs. Since they will be kind of cool, they are definitely gift worthy so you can share. Pretty sure there will probably be a little trinket which comes with each mug...and you will most certainly get a postcard or three... \u00a0Thank YOU!!! Email me a photo of you using your mug so I can post it and share with the people I teach in the under-served communities. xoxo \u00a0",

     "description": "The ultimate tier...I come to you. \u00a0Seriously, I will travel to your place and we will make a masterpiece...you really have no idea how cool this is! I enjoy teaching so much. It really is my favorite thing, other than my son \u0026amp; his family, and baby giraffes and otters. \u00a0\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you and your posse will make individual paintings (up to nine other people), or you collaborate on one LARGE (up to 48\"x 60\") piece. Collaborative art pieces really are stunning creations ~ this is great to do if you are celebrating something special: wedding, reunion, special birthday, National Margarita Day, birthday, anniversary, because the day ends in \"Y\", etc. \u00a0Personally I believe there is always something to celebrate!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will communicate quite a bit prior to my arrival. This part is really important so we can square up the details: dates, designs, if wine will be served, etc. Pretty likely I will bring you and your co-creators several goodies for everyone to take home. I will also randomly send you postcards, probably for many, many moons. You are so damn awesome! Chances are I will hug you and may even shed a tear or two upon completion of the piece. THANK YOU. Just...THANK. YOU. SO. DAMN. MUCH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dream of the Blue Turtles\" shown for this tier is a collaborative piece created with a group of special needs children I worked with.

I am totally up for that. Totally. OR, if you want to do this somewhere other than your home within the continental US ~ perhaps you want to paint while staying at an Italian Villa or on the deck of a boat tied up in the Caribbean, I will indeed come to you if you provide the ticket.
