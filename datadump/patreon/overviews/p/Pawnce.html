    "summary": "Hey, guys. Pawnce here on Patreon, and I\u0027ve been professionally producing Youtube gaming videos and Twitch programming for over four years now. During that time I appear to have carved out a small niche making videos based solely on my personal tastes and odd sense of humour. Fortunately, some of you fine folks out there seem to be of like mind, and I\u0027ve thus been able to eek out a living off this content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are considering using Patreon to support my future endeavours, thank you. I hope I can continue to produce works worthy of your generosity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, I know there is much more I can cover in terms of topics of interest. I want to bring all my viewers new and exciting forms of content I\u0027ve not been able to relay thus far. Unfortunately, this requires financial stability beyond the scope of Youtube\u0027s tenuous ad revenue scheme and\u00a0Byzantine algorithms. And that\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile increasing the production and quality of my core gaming content, I would also like to relate a number of my other passions. Aside from gaming I\u0027ve also extensively studied martial arts, earned a degree in archaeology, spent eight years working in several kitchens, and still harbour various creative writing ambitions. I am confident I can present these topics in an exciting and informative manner that would complement my game-centric videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also really want to fight again :P\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s a breakdown of some of what you can expect with your Patreon support:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDocumented fitness regime and diet (aka getting back into fighting shape)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnce again taking up a martial art and/or combat sport (boxing, MMA, kendo, jujutsu, judo, HEMA, Muay Thai, etc) and documenting it for everyone\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePurchasing all the hardware (cameras, etc) needed to produce quality videos of all my martial activities and progress. Will also allow for informative videos\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaving tryouts and making a ranked team with supporters (probably LoL, but who knows what the future may hold)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCulinary adventures. I will purchase everything I need (possible additional hardware, cookware, and ingredients) to make proper guide, recipe, and general cooking videos\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWith enough support I will be able to invest enough time into either fighting professionally in some capacity or joining major competitive tournaments (depending on the discipline I\u0027ve selected)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd more!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

Additionally, a consistent exercise routine tailored to my personal needs will be started.

Boxing, MMA, kendo, jujutsu, judo, HEMA, Muay Thai, etc. etc. are all possible options. While I will take into account people\u0027s interest in the varying disciplines, what I ultimately choose will be heavily based on what the best local options are, what I am currently most suited to, level of competitiveness, and how open the club/gym is to me recording progress for everyone. Note that certain things I am already quite experienced in (e.g. kendo) while others options I have no formal training in (e.g. MMA).\u003cbr\u003e+90 Twitch Subscriber Count for the Sake of Twitch Perks.\u003cbr\u003e",
