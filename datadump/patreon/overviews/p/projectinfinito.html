Now I intend to restore this 1978 antique fiberglass beast, learn the necessary skills to survive out there, sail into the horizon, and live a life of sustainable travel, adventure and contact with nature. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started making some videos about the process of refurbishing the boat, and some of the people who liked the vids tipped us through Patreon. It was an awesome\u00a0experience - to be rewarded for expressing myself artistically - and I wish I\u00a0can get back to it in time. However, for now I gotta put my head down and focus on rebuilding the boat + working a time-demanding job.

We dream to work full-time on creating content of increasingly higher artistic quality, and your patronage allows us that. Thank you.",

With a fiberglass hull providing shelter, solar panels providing energy, and the ocean providing food, I am confident that we can live well with very little money.
