    "summary": "Every\nweek since 2011, you have invited Priority One into your lives. Together, we\nhave laughed, we have raged, and we have passed the time discussing the topics\nthat interest us most. You are with us as we travel at warp speed in Star Trek\nOnline. You are with us on the convention floor interviewing Star Trek alumni.\nWe want to continue to share all those experiences with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why this crowd funding campaign?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\nare inevitable running costs involved with producing Priority One Podcast. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not free to host a combination of audio files,\ngraphic art, photos, blogs, and more in one centralized location that is easy\nto access. Nor is the equipment or software free that allows us to\nrecord, process, and produce the quality audio podcast you have grown to expect\nfrom week to week. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor everyone involved in producing our shows, Priority One Podcast is a labor\nof love and we don\u2019t profit from its production. For the past six years, we\nhave invested our personal time, money, and passions into producing the quality\ncontent you have grown to expect. Most importantly, we\u2019ve\ndeveloped a relationship with each and every one of you. You invite us into\nyour lives every week and listen to our rantings. You even participate in some\nof those discussions, with active engagement via email, comments, or chatting.\nWithout your support, we could not have been nominated for Best Produced \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBest\nGaming Podcast in the 2014 People\u2019s Choice Podcast Awards! Without \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eyour \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003esupport,\nwe would not have been able to represent \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e at the 2014,\n2015 \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n2016 Star Trek Las Vegas Conventions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy give?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCombined, the\noverall running costs to keep Priority One Podcast running at minimal\nefficiency is a little over $3,000 a year. We have web hosting and domain\nrenewals, software licenses, equipment maintenance, and all the other little\nbits and pieces that ensure we can deliver our podcast to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll it would take is 50 of you to commit to $5 a month \u2013 for 12 months \u2013 and we\ncould meet that base goal and keep Priority One Podcast going for another year!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut if you know\nus at all, you\u2019ll know that we don\u2019t just want to keep going, we want to keep\ngrowing! Above our base goal, we can pay for improved equipment that lets us\nbroadcast LIVE from conventions, and for the social media tools that help YOU\nget closer to the action!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, we have other expenses as well. Travel costs to attend\nconventions or visit places like Cryptic Studios is a very expensive endeavor!\nFor instance, just for one member of the Priority One Podcast Team to report on\nSTLV can cost nearly $1,000. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTherefore, any money collected beyond our\nmonthly running costs will go towards alleviating the costs involved with\ncovering a convention. The more we can generate, the more likely it is we can\nsend members of Priority One Productions to conventions around the world.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat is why we have come to Patreon. We know you love our content, our quality,\nand our format. We believe that if you support us, with whatever level of\ncontribution that suits you, we can raise the bar on podcast quality and\nreliability. You deserve more, but we need your help to get it to you!\u003cbr\u003e"
