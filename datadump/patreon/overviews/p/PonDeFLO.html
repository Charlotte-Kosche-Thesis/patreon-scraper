This change has to happen one person at a time. We all deserve to be truly happy, confident, secure and feel love. In this world, we know it can be hard to do so, which is why our signature program Pon De FLO was created: To inspire oneness within all through dance fitness.  We all want to be part of something greater than ourselves. If we don\u0027t know ourselves, we can\u0027t know what we want to associate with. If we don\u0027t accept and love ourselves, we can\u0027t accept and love others. If we don\u0027t have peace and oneness within ourselves, there will be no peace amongst the human race.

While instructing classes, class participants didn\u0027t believe they could push their physical limits. She heard things such as \"I\u0027m not strong enough and calisthenics are too hard\" from numerous individuals. Something pretty similar happened in the \u00a0strength based classes she taught. Her class participants restricted themselves to strength and mat based classes because they believed \u0027they couldn\u0027t dance\u0027. Heather took it upon herself to create a program which would bridge the gap between the dance and fitness world, turn everyone\u0027s \u0027I Can\u0027ts\u0027 into \u0027I Can\u0027s\u0027 and inspire positive self reinforcement and fearlessness within others. After much time, trial and error, Heather created a unique program around caribbean, reggae and dub music, called Pon De FLO. After teaching the program independently, she noticed how much Pon De FLO was evolving into a positive and empowering movement. Class participants began \u00a0to see positive physical, mental and emotional changes in themselves and shared this with Heather. At this point, Heather knew Pon De FLO no longer belonged to her, it belonged to everyone. Heather knew this program could help so many other lives and decided to take a leap of faith into entrepreneurshipville in 2012 to flourish the program. \u00a0Leaving her corporate job, she began to instruct Pon De FLO independently on a daily basis, developed the program further into a business and began working towards creating a DVD. In 2012, a major gym chain got wind of Pon De FLO and offered the opportunity to expand it across the US. Although Pon De FLO would not be compensated as a company, Heather could not pass up this opportunity for exposure and marketing. Throughout the years, an Instructor Training program was created and launched, additional gyms picked up the program and demand was growing at a rapid rate. Behind the scenes, Heather was struggling with several challenges including finances, physical fatigue, becoming homeless and needing to sacrifice everything to keep the program alive and growing. On the verge of quitting and terminating the program completely, she felt an overwhelming and undescribable urge to keep pushing with Pon De FLO. Contemplating her direction, she created business plans to open a fitness studio or launch a supplement line, but decided to let time unfold the proper direction. After years of listening to how Pon De FLO has inspired and changed people\u0027s lives for the better, Heather realized PDF changed her life and had built her to be fearless, confident and above everything, centered. At that moment, she was \u00a0motivated, more than ever, to strive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014,\u00a0Heather met a student (Meira) new to Pon De FLO who was completely hooked on the program after her first class experience. As time passed, Meira began to see changes within herself. She felt stronger, happier, fearless and empowered to make some big changes within her life. At that moment of realization, she knew Pon De FLO was so much more than just a workout. To her, it was a positive lifestyle. Wanting to be part of this movement, she approached Heather to ask about helping out with the business in anyway. In 2015, Meira became Heather\u0027s assistant and they grew to become very close which lead to becoming business partners. In 2016, they were presented with the opportunity to open the very first Pon De FLO Studio in NYC. This would be a huge challenge, as they knew they only had enough funds for the lease and construction costs, but could not let this opportunity pass by. Together, they strategized, planned and decided to dive into the Start-Up venture. \u003cbr\u003eThe Pon De FLO Studio opened January 1st, 2017 and is run by these 2 Girl Bosses who met through Pon De FLO. This isn\u0027t the only friendship that has formed through this empowering program. The community that has formed through Pon De FLO consists of some of the best humans on Earth, seriously. Come catch de vibes and join our community to help be a positive change within this world! The sky is the limit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
