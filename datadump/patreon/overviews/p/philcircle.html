    "summary": "Greetings! I\u0027m Phil Circle. Welcome to my Patreon page. This is where you become a true patron of the arts. This is where you benefit by investing anywhere from a dollar a month to a part-timer\u0027s wage, and can know that I\u0027ll be increasing my creative output and inspiring hundreds or even thousands of others to do the same. Thank you for joining me in the movement away from the mainstream, where commercialism is secondary and inspiration and art are first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a working professional musician and critically acclaimed singer-songwriter-guitarist, who also teaches my craft to aspiring musicians and other working pros. I\u0027ve been teaching since 1993 and playing professionally since 1986. I love everything about my work! Even the business-end of things is fascinating to me now that independent artists like myself can thrive on their own. In fact, I\u0027ve always been an advocate of the independent artist. And I\u0027ve been doing this since before DIY or Indie were even in our vernacular.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter years as a singer-songwriter-guitarist and private music coach, I began to write down my experiences. In August of 2017, my stories coalesced into a self-published book about my journey as an independent musician: \u003cem\u003eThe Outback Musician\u0027s Survival Guide: One Guy\u0027s Story of Surviving as an Independent Musician\u003c/em\u003e. I am delighted by the responses I\u0027m receiving! People are finding inspiration in my story of survival! One critic called it a \"celebration of what it means to be human.\" Indeed, this is the role of an artist. We are here to contend with the human condition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I asking you to become involved in this enterprise? Well, it\u0027s simple really. There are 24 hours in a day and it takes half of my work day to accrue enough income to pay my bills. I love teaching, but dedicating much more time to it would leave less time to put together my method book for guitar, produce another album, and do the level of promotion necessary to build an income from recorded music sales and the like. There\u0027s so much I can do and all of it I do well if reviews are a fair reference. We can expand on my ability to be heard and to inspire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy using this patronage platform, I will reach many more people with my services and really bring my experience to bear on a wider level. Additionally, I am allowed more means with which to create and distribute music and can be more confident of its production value.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is with constant gratitude that I work on my craft; writing music, working toward my next performance, coaching aspiring or established musical artists, and maintaining my knowledge and up-to-date experience as a musical entrepreneur. All of these activities offer me daily opportunities to inspire or be inspired. Mine is a purpose-driven career without question.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is folks like yourself, and those we\u0027ll reach together, that make it possible for folks like myself to continue working and creating. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart: Thank you. You will have access to more of my work than the general public. You will enjoy access to me personally through the private group I\u0027ve created for us to communicate directly. You\u0027ll be able to ask pointed questions about the craft and business of music and even share your ideas about it. You\u0027ll be able to ask me more personal questions about my work as an artist or learn more than what my book tells. You\u0027ll receive copies of everything you help create and much that I\u0027ve already created, even material nobody can find anywhere else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing on the responses I receive almost daily from people who enjoy my work, I remain highly motivated and simply can\u0027t wait until the next day presents itself for me to go record another song, or coach a new student, or present a workshop, or write the next piece of entrepreneurial encouragement for all the struggling artists out here. I wake up looking forward to every day. I fervently hope that more musical artists can begin to live this way. I hope to offer an example of how it\u0027s possible. You\u0027re involvement is the next step."

     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003ePhil Circle has always preferred to pursue his career on his terms, mostly by disregarding the much sought-after \u201crecord label\u201d in favor of his own, booking more intimate venues that appreciate the musician and his work, and receiving radio play on stations all over the country and world that look for independent talent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhil is by no means your ordinary songster picking away quietly on his acoustic guitar. He manages to blend elements of rock, jazz, blues, folk, and even classical, to seamlessly create a style truly his own. Add to this his often flawless and always energetic live performance, and he lands far away from what most people think of as \"Singer/Songwriter.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhil\u0027s debut release in the 90s was hailed by In The Mix as \"just what the doctor ordered\" and they pointed out that his music \"defies rock, jazz and blues\" saying his songs were \"from the master class.\" 20 years later, Illinois Entertainer referred to his latest full band effort as proof that Phil is \"one of our town\u0027s most unique voices.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBack in 2015, after much \"you should write these stories down\" from friends and music fans, Phil finally took the stories he\u0027d been telling about his life in music and put them to the page. This became a collection of stories, and thoughts on the business and craft of music called The Outback Musician\u0027s Survival Guide. It was loosely structured, non-linear and comb bound from pages printed at his home. It was, however, favorably enough received by the small number of people that got their hands on a copy. Phil also received input from many of those who read it. Their input included a lot of requests for more in-depth stories. They wanted more than the funnies, they wanted the dirt. Be careful what you ask for. In August of 2017, Phil managed the publication of a 215 page rewrite. He made it a more guided story of his survival as an independent musician over thirty years. You get to learn about the darker moments along with the crazy antics, and all of his latest observations about an ever changing business and an ever evolving art form. \u003cem\u003eThe Outback Musician\u0027s Survival Guide\u003c/em\u003e is available in paperback and ebook through Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Jet, Google Play, iBooks, and some 50 outlets online.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"It\u0027s impossible not to be swept up in Phil\u0027s current of passion.\"\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0- Sarah Jane, Beat Media\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Phil Circle\u0027s prolific songwriting and\u00a0powerful performance make him a staple of Chicago music.\"\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0- Who\u0027s Who in Music, CenterStage Chicago\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
