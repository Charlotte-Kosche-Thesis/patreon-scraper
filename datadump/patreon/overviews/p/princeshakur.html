I have a Bachelors of Arts degree in Creative Writing from Ohio University and is a board member for the \u003ca href=\"https://peoplesjusticeleague.com/\"\u003ePeople\u2019s Justice League\u003c/a\u003e. My dedication to activism began during my final year at Ohio University with the uprising of the Black Lives Matter Movement when I organized hundreds of students on his campus for numerous protests in the name of \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pKJrB0zfEg\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\"\u003eMichael Brown\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZxJBsOxQT4\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\"\u003eEric Garner\u003c/a\u003e. From there, I became a boycott organizer for UNITE HERE Local 8, helped organize a campaign against gentrification in Seattle, participated in NUIT DEBOUT protests in Paris, spent a month protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.theamericanmirror.com/video-bill-clinton-tells-black-protester-hillary-wasnt-sending-people-prison/\"\u003einterrupted a speech\u003c/a\u003e by Bill Clinton to criticize the 1994 Crime Bill. I am currently freelance writing for publications, like \u003ca href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/contributor/prince-shakur\"\u003eTeen Vogue\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://intomore.com/?q=prince+shakur\"\u003eINTO\u003c/a\u003e, about social justice, LGBTQ awareness, and my experiences as a queer, person of color.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have made this Patreon...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ebecause although I am hustling, it is sometimes hard to make ends meet as a freelancer. Between traveling, editing videos, sending out pitches, repairing video equipment, and working to be true in my solidarity with as many movements as possible, it becomes clear that the world does not always help out those who make a life of their activism and art. So I\u0027ve made this Patreon because I want to give folks the chance to support a young, determined black artist who has a big heart and a ferocious pen.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
