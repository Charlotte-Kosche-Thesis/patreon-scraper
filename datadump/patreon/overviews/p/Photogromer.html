You took the time to head over here to learn more about the community we\u0027re building together, so thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNow let me explain the purpose of this community...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be able to\u00a0give back to my biggest supporters!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a fan of engaging with my supporters. It may be hard to believe but I read every single comment, snap, and messages that I receive! #teamsnap\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the growth of my channel also comes a lot of new voices, some that have only seen one or two of my videos. While I appreciate them hitting the subscribe button, I\u0027ve come to learn there are two different types of subscribers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. The ones that subscribe based on seeing a viral video. Comment once when a video is uploaded to compete for \"first\" comment then don\u0027t watch the entire video or really become a part of the Photogromer community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eor\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. The loyal subscriber who watches the entire video, comments, tunes into live shows, engages with the community and gets the most out of every video I put out. They are the ones that keep me motivated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to give back specifically to those subscribers and I\u0027m hoping Patreon will be a great platform for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s my\u00a0Goal?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAn army of Photogromers. A community within a community where I can put my efforts into giving back to this community. Whether\u00a0it\u0027s more in-depth photography tips, or behind the scene content, or even passing on some of my old camera gear to help start your journey into the YouTube or Photography world, I want to be able to thank those that directly support the success of this channel. Check out the Goals and Rewards to see some of the ways I\u0027m going to giving back immediately. By no means will any funds be used to pay for bills or my mortgage. Every dollar will be reinvested back into this channel and you, the supporter!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Often Am I Charged?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight now I have it structured as every month. In the future it might change to every episode depending on the support, don\u0027t worry you\u0027ll have to confirm your subscription if I change it from monthly to per episode and can still put a monthly cap on it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58dd41016b8f5bda12c7b761/58dd435ac534a52312bb6748/5a7173d1c830258d368775da/1517384681239/s2n+logo.png?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStock2Not Build Series:\u003cbr\u003eIdea -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThe Stock2Not Build Series is something I\u0027ve wanted to do for a while now. I\u0027m by\u00a0no means a mechanic. When I first bought my\u00a0Honda\u00a0Grom\u00a0in 2016 the only\u00a0mechanical work\u00a0I could do was an oil change. Since then, I have\u00a0done everything from\u00a0replacing the clutch (multiple times) to\u00a0rebuilding the motor. I\u0027ve learned by watching other YouTubers and doing it myself. The idea of this build series is to continue to learn and show you how to modify\u00a0a stock bike and make it into something great. I\u0027m sure there will be plenty of laughs along the way!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEpisodes -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e The series will be broken down by the build. Each build will be a \"Season\" and each video will be an \"episode\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Schedule -\u003c/strong\u003e We will film every \u003cstrong\u003eTuesday night at 7 PM EST\u003c/strong\u003e. The fully edited videos will be uploaded to YouTube pubically every \u003cstrong\u003eSaturday\u003c/strong\u003e however only Patrons will be able to watch the build happening live in an uncut atmosphere. The goal is to have this first build complete by June 2018, in time for the Smoky Mountain Crawl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture Builds and What Happens to the Bike?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027d like to say at the end of the build I sell the bike to one of you Patrons at a very low cost. As for this first build, we\u0027re not there yet. I plan on keeping this bike. My goal is to have season 2 of the Stock2Not Build Series end with me transferring the ownership of the bike to one of you. But that\u0027s going to take the support of you guys. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I\u0027d like to do a different theme build every build and I fully expect to have you the Patron vote on that theme at the start of each build.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdditional Notes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis Patreon isn\u0027t just going to be structured around the build series, please check out the rewards which include a monthly live show that you vote on the topic (how dangerous is that!) among other rewards. I have several BIG projects currently in the works, additional rewards will be added as those projects come to fruition.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to engaging with each and every one of you on a more personal level and of course THANK YOU! I am humbled and honored by the level of support ya\u0027ll give me. #Photogomers\u003cbr\u003e"
