Your friendship and kindness, and your willingness to be an audience and a witness to my process has been essential. Poetry has saved me, healed me, taught me, given me perspective and resilience. I\u0027ve shared my poetry with many of you--online, on Facebook, in the privacy of of my home. I want to publish a collection of my poetry that includes some of my photographs, many of which, I think, are pretty good. By asking for your help, I\u0027m asking you to help out with some of the production costs; I\u0027m not looking to make money, per say, but I\u0027m looking not to lose money either. Really, I\u0027m looking to set out what many friends have suggested that I do--publish my poetry collection (finally!). So to cover costs, print at least two hundred copies of the book, and launch it into the world, I\u0027m asking for a little help from my friends. \u003cstrong\u003eIf you donate $27.50 (half my age on May 9th) in honor of my 55th birthday, I\u0027ll send you a copy of the collection and include your name on the acknowledgements page in a poetic tribute to those who support me and my artistic endeavors.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e"
