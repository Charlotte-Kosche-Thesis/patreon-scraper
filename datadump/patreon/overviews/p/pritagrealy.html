Originally from Perth, Western Australia, I started to get itchy feet and the \u0027lust\u0027 to travel and see the world, so I packed up and left everything I knew to go on an epic journey backpacking around Europe with just a guitar and a (ridiculously big) backpack.. what started as a tickle in my stomach, grew into an amazing adventure where I met and stayed with friends of friends, saw tiny towns in France, slept in the big cities of London, Paris and Berlin.. adventured through Switzerland and ended up doing a Vipassana Silent Meditation Retreat in the snow covered hills of Piacenza in Italy.. (can you even imagine me being silent for 10 days... hahahahaha).. and that led to learning how to ski in Slovenia + travelling with a fun bunch of random travellers! and an offer to crew a private yacht in Miami!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I ended up crewing a private yacht for 2 years based out of Fort Lauderdale, The Bahamas, Caribbean, New York, Hamptons, and the Mediterranean... it was epic and such a good experience to travel and make money doing it! but something was missing - in my heart + soul I was dying to play music and perform again!!! So I made a decision to do whatever it takes to start playing and doing music again.. that led me down a whole \u0027nother adventure and 10+ years later I am working as a full-time touring musician doing what I love in Europe!! It really is a dream come true!! and it took a lot of hard work and and big decisions to get here but I am so glad I did it because there\u0027s nothing more rewarding than following your heart and listening to your soul!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to My Patreon Page where you can be a part of my magic musical journey!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
