    "summary": "Parents are a growing segment of the tech community, but there are few resources out there for developers with children. We can\u2019t even tell you how large this segment is, because the number of developers with children isn\u2019t included in most diversity surveys. But we do exist. We connect with other tech parents in the office, online, at local events, at conferences\u2014everywhere we go.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eParenting is difficult in an industry that values working long hours for companies located in more expensive cities. Developer parents share a lot of concerns and frustrations that can be hard to balance with family life, including staying up-to-date with emerging technologies, attending and/or speaking at conferences, on-call schedules, and more. As developers, we worry about parenting issues like screentime and internet privacy from a more technical perspective. Parent Driven Development will cover all these topics and more with a panel of developer parents from diverse perspectives and a variety of tech backgrounds. Parent Driven Development will shine light onto these issues and provide a valuable resource for not only parents in tech, but their managers, colleagues and employers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast will feature a diverse group of panelists including: Allison McMillan, Katherine Wu, Andy Croll, Chris Sexton, JC Avena, Josh Puetz, Mandy Moore, and Sarah Olson. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParent Driven Development will cover a multitude of topics, including (but not limited to): \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003echildcare at conferences\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ebringing your children to conferences\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003equestions from colleagues without kids\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003escreen time for children\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eparental leave\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eself-care\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eflexible work schedules\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eremote work\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eEach show costs approximately $500 to produce and requires 12-15 hours of work.
