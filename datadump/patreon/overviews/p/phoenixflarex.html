My name is Tyler Rogers (a.k.a. PhoenixFlareX) and I am a Youtube content creator focusing on the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game. I\u0027ve loved the game since it\u0027s beginning and have traveled my own road from being a newbie to a highly competitively oriented player. I create content with the intent to appeal to and be useful helping tools to both the competitive and more casual player bases of the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Do I Have a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI love making quality \u0026amp; informative content but that unfortunately takes a lot of time, research, \u0026amp; planning. I try to upload videos daily but sometimes that takes a huge tole on my schedule and current recording equipment. The aim of this Patreon is to allow those who want to see better videos contribute in their own meaningful way (no matter how big or small) to allowing me additional funds toward upgrading equipment for smoother video production as well as funds to allow me the ability to dedicate more time into creating and improving content as a whole. I may even like to do this full time in the future as a real profession and any assistance given here would only help make that happen even further.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for any and all support you have given and/or will give in the future!\u003c/strong\u003e"

However if this goal is reached I should be able to gain enough funding to quickly get access to a new computer specifically built for gaming \u0026amp; streaming purposes. With this I will be able to livestream at least 2 times a week for everyone who enjoys. And hopefully not do it on a potato.",
