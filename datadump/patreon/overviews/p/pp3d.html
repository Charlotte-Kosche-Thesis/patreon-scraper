    "summary": "Aloha! Welcome to the Patreon Page for Practical printing- AKA crussty, AKA Chris Russell. I love everything about 3D printing, and I make videos and do live streams on a wide range of related subjects. I cover everything from fun projects and tutorials, to printer builds, upgrades and maintenance. I also do reviews on printers, filament and other related equipment from time to time. But one of the biggest things I enjoy doing is hosting community driven interactive content- like the first ever Build-a-long we did in October of 2017! I try to make everything as educational as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Support Practical Printing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy hope is that between patrons, affiliate sales and the little ad revenue that comes in from YouTube, I would like for channel to be self-sustaining.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFunds raised on Patreon will go back into the channel, allowing me to buy the consumables like filament and resin I need to produce content. It will help to cover costs of things like maintenance on the printers, materials for projects- or even printer kits for things like the community build-a-longs. It will also help me cover costs of travel, etc. to community events like Maker Faire and MRRF.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow To Support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are a number of ways that you can help support the channel so it will flourish. \u003cbr\u003e\nEven just $1 a month here as a patron is greatly appreciated and goes a long way to helping. Also, shopping with the affiliate links listed in the videos is a great way to help that doesn\u2019t cost you anything extra if you are shopping those sites anyways. I am very grateful for every penny that comes in to help me keep things going!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePractical Printing is a community driven channel, so your support means the world to me. I aim to keep it as interactive as possible for everyone. Videos will of course always be free to everyone, but I will try to slip in sneak peaks of videos to supporters here where I can, as well as some special content (out takes and the like) for Patreon Supporters eyes only. I also have some other special perks in mind for contributors as well! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMahalo nui loa,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nChris Russell\u003cbr\u003e\nPractical Printing\u003cbr\u003e"
