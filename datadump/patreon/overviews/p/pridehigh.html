    "summary": "Hey there! I\u0027m Tommy, the creator and writer of Pride High, an indie comic that follows the adventures of a gay-straight alliance at a school for super-powered youth. The comic was shaped in part by my experiences as a gay, biracial teen at a residential high school.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was a recipient of the Prism Comics Queer Press Grant in 2007. Also that year,\u00a0Pride High earned an award for its Braille transcription and the positive portrayal of a blind lesbian teen by Blind LGBT Pride (formerly BFLAG), a national organization serving the needs of LGBT members of the blind \u0026amp; visually impaired community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePride High was originally a standard pay-by-issue comic book, available for printing through IndyPlanet. However, not all teens have supportive parents willing to purchase LGBT-affirming comics.\u00a0In 2011, in response to rising rates of reported LGBT teen suicides, Pride High was released for free online to reach those who need it the most. You can help keep it that way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"It might sound dramatic, but Pride High left quite a mark in my life. Back when it came out I was just a teen who, being quite a geek and gay in a country not known for being very progressive at the time, I felt a little isolated. The comic was one of my first tastes of both LGBT+ culture and indie comic fandom, both for its plot and themes as well as the interactions I got with other fans in the forums. It helper me power through my teen years and know that I wasn\u0027t alone or weird at all.\" \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--Manuel Martinez, Spanish Translator for Pride High\u003cbr\u003e"
