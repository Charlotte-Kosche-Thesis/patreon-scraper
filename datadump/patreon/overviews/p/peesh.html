    "summary": "Heya! My name\u2019s peesh (well, no, it\u2019s not, but you get the idea), and I write a whole bunch of gay trash. 100% gay-ranteed. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got a few projects going on at any given time; my current main project is a webserial called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://silversmithserial.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSilversmith\u003c/a\u003e, the blurb for which goes a little something like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eOn a mildly chilly winter\u2019s night in the city of Brisbane, a teenage girl suddenly bursts into flames. This wouldn\u2019t be out of ordinary, except for the part where they then burn her to death, leaving behind a single word in the ashes. Officially, the police think it\u2019s spontaneous combustion. Certain people think otherwise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJune Young is trying not to think about it at all. She\u2019s much too busy trying to keep her wardlaying business afloat to get involved in any mysteries, despite her best friend\u2019s efforts to the contrary. She\u2019s not a private eye, or a detective, or a sleuth, so there shouldn\u2019t be any reason for her to get caught up in it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSilversmith is an urban fantasy mystery, featuring murder, crime, snappy banter and just a whole bunch of queer folx trying to do their best. It currently updates once a week, Mondays AEST, but if goals are met, it\u0027ll help me put more time and effort into it, and bump that up to two or even three times a week.\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u0027s not all! Becoming a patron also grants you access to a whole shit-ton of original fiction! For just $1 a month, you get access to the biweekly Worldbuilding Wednesdays, a dive into the various worlds and details of the different stories, as well as some microfiction and other shorter bits and pieces. If you go for $5 a month, though, it gets even better. You get access to a mix of short stories, one-off scenes and chapters of future novels, released on the 1st and 16th of every month. There\u0027s already a shit-ton of content on there (for example, a completed short horror novella called \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/backroads-part-1-11726743\"\u003eBackroads \u003c/a\u003eabout\n monsters attacking a backwater gas station), and the selection is just gonna keep on getting bigger.\u003cbr\u003eSo thanks for your support, and I hope you enjoy!"
