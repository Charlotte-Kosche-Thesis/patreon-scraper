During these past three years I have interviewed over 130 ballet dancers and it\u00a0was then that I realized that aspiring dancers, their parents, professional dancers. and\u00a0anyone who loves the world of dance, not only loved what they heard on my show, but\u00a0that they wanted MORE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT AM I DOING NOW?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn response to this, in January, 2016 I launched the\u00a0Premier Dance Network (PDN) with the same mission as I created with the Balancing Pointe Podcast; to educate and inspire. Today, PDN boasts 8 shows and 11 episodes that come to you each week. There will be 4 more shows will be launched over the next few months. My goal is to create a \"one-stop-shop\" for all things related to dance while creating and producing a 5 Star line up of shows, hosted by a 5 Star line up of Hosts. \u00a0I believe that knowledge is power and I know each of the shows featured on PDN will make a positive change for anyone involved in the world of dance. \u00a0Each show offers FREE information, education and inspiration. With your help the Premier Dance Network\u003cbr\u003ewill continue to expand and improve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SHOULD YOU BECOME A PREMIER DANCE NETWORK DONOR?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a PDN Donor, \u00a0you will allow me to continue to produce a 5 Star line-up of new and interesting shows. \u00a0While the content provided is offered FREE, the cost to produce each show is\u00a0NOT.
