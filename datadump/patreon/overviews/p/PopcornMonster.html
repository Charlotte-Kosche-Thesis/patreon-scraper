Working with the computer, graphic arts programs, and my own hand drawn creations to produce very unique and hopefully creepy and dark shorts. I also create single page versions as Shel Silverstein-ish poems with my artwork as well.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve done a number of short horror films but I recently realized my charcoal style was really calling to me. The Bellman of Briarwood Green was the first one I did, establishing my style. Each piece is different though and some techniques are abandoned or used again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/heiA-wOYyAQ\" width=\"420\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I love coming up with unique stories since at my core I think of myself as a storyteller first and an artist second. I create each piece myself. The drawings, music, voices, everything is created by me. As someone is naturally shy, I have a social phobia and working on my own, under my own creative terms enables me to still function while providing interesting creations for the public."
