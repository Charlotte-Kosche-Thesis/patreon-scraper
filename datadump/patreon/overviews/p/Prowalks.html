I truly appreciate all your support, feedback and views and I am delighted to know that my videos have had a positive impact on so many wonderful people. I have spoken with many subscribers who have expressed interest in supporting Prowalks and Patreon offers a way to support it financially. My main goals with Prowalks are to increase the production quality of my walking videos and to walk the places that you want to see. By becoming a Patron you will help fund future walks. This will not only contribute to my travel costs but will also go towards new video equipment. Finally, it will allow me to post the videos without advertisements. Thank you again for taking the time to check out my Patreon page and for all your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
