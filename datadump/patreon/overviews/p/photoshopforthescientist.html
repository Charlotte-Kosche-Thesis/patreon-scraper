Having been there myself, I know a lot of fledgling scientists out there don\u0027t have a lot of extra cash to spare, and that\u0027s ok; mostly I just want to create a useful resource that I wish that I had had back in my day. If, however, you have managed to free yourself from the shackles of grad school (or if you\u0027re a high-rolling scholarship winner) and you\u0027ve got some extra dollars, I would be very appreciative if you\u0027d become a Patron! It\u0027d be nice to break even on the videos, but mostly it\u0027d be great to see that there are actually people out there who find them useful. And of course, with enough support, I will finally be able to fulfill my dream of quitting my job and becoming a YouTube celebrity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
