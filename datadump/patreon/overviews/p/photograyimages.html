    "summary": "Please allow me to introduce myself. I am a narcoleptic archaeologist and freelance photographer. I am currently struggling to find a more effective treatment for my narcolepsy with cataplexy and hypersomnia, which causes me to sleep between 12-20 hours a day and suffer EDS (Excessive Daytime Sleepiness) the few hours I am awake. My photography began as a way to battle the increasingly severe memory loss caused by the sleep disorders. My photos were like my diary, and seeing them allowed me to remember those events in my life. Over the years it has become my joy and my passion. Although I feel so much of my life is being drained away in the suffocating lonely dark of sleep, I can capture the light of a few fleeting hours a day and make those hours eternal. If you find some of these images have brought a little light into your life too, I hope you consider becoming a patron. To be perfectly honest, narcolepsy medications are wicked expensive, and any help is greatly appreciated. Your help allows me the meds to be awake to take photos- thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"

He is a cherished member of our family and I could not bear to put him down simply because his medical care would be expensive. I am disabled by severe narcolepsy and hypersomnolence and my medical costs are also extremely expensive, so how could I not help my fur baby when in similar circumstances? Through the wonderful generosity of several kind souls, a goodly amount of his vet bills were taken care of, but the remaining balance is still $689. If you would be willing to become a Patron or even just share my post, it would mean the world to me! Thank you so much!",
