    "summary": "My name is Nicolaus Yannotti a 42 yr old disabled man trying to make a new start out of life! I am a you tuber that usually will film un-boxings and reviews. I am also an advocate for legalization of cannabis. I have spent almost fourteen years having my liver destroyed by just about every horrible thing a Dr \u00a0or surgeon prescribes. Now I am trying to get a medical card to try alternative medicine. while on this journey I try to entertain people through my videos on you tube. and my constant quotes on twitter. I am just trying to get help living on disability with a twelve yr old whose mother was murdered at 4 has been a very difficult path. sometimes I believe he is stronger than I. Just then I realize handicapped or not I have got to be there for my son. I can not no I will not let him down it bothers me that I need help but the point is to get to a place where sitting in this chair gives me the means to take care of my family. So after 16 surgeries a lot of physical therapy and multiple specialists I have learned with all the pain It is worth every extra minute with my son. I will succeed. I appreciate anyone who has read this far and even more so people who can see what I and he have been through. I can not wait to one day walk tall and be able to meet all the good people in this world instead of seeing my bed my desk my Dr. I am remarried my wife is under a lot of stress as I am quite the burden I long for the day when I am not a burden but the pleasure I once brought her. The last surgery came with many complications and I am still looking at 8 more months of this horizontal predominant life but I will keep counting the days till I can be whole. Thank you to anyone kind enough to read all of this I am sure it was tedious bordering \u00a0just too much reading for that I apologize clearly I do not get out enough once a month to be exact. even with my wife and son it is a lonely life. I lay and sit with my own thoughts can not even get up and go to church. That is actually one of the things which bother me most the fellowship of others. you tube does give me people to talk to. for that I am grateful!"
