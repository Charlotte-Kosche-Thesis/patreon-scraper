    "summary": "Hello, all.\u00a0 This is the situation: I write fantasy novels and short stories.\u00a0 My husband David has supported my writing career since forever.\u00a0 (Well, technically, since 1981.)\u00a0 But he\u0027s been having a harder and harder time finding work, while I fell right out of conventional publishing in 2012 when the publisher cancelled a completed and much-revised novel called \u003cem\u003eGoing North.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 After a three-year delay I got the rights to that book back, and David and I plan to publish it ourselves.\u00a0 However, stress and worry about our financial problems, including medical bills for my recently-diagnosed type 2 diabetes, are making it hard for me to put the finishing touches on the novel and actually get it out there.\u00a0 I also have unfinished short stories and an unfinished novel that I want to finish when the revisions to \u003cem\u003eGoing North\u003c/em\u003e are complete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need peace of mind and stability to be able to revise and write, and am hoping that this Patreon will help to provide them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor people who have read my other books: \u003cem\u003eGoing\n      North\u003c/em\u003e is a joint sequel to \u003cem\u003eThe Dubious Hills\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe\n      Whim of the Dragon\u003c/em\u003e. For people who haven\u0027t read either of\n    those: \u003cem\u003eGoing North \u003c/em\u003ecan also be read as a\n    standalone.\u00a0 It\u0027s hard to say much about it without spoiling both\u003cem\u003e The Dubious HIlls\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Whim of the Dragon\u003c/em\u003e. I think I can safely say that two teenaged girls whose respective communities didn\u0027t know what else to do with them have been sent off to Heathwill Library. Heathwill is a repository of books about magic, housed in a fortress, that has somewhat accidentally become a school for people studying magic, both its history and its practice.\u00a0 When the two teenagers meet, matters don\u0027t turn out exactly as either set of their elders expected.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe longer version of David\u0027s and my situation and the strange editing history of \u003cem\u003eGoing North\u003c/em\u003e are in an unlocked post at my LiveJournal.\u00a0 This is the link: \u003ca href=\"http://pameladean.livejournal.com/175679.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://pameladean.livejournal.com/175679.html\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have three creative goals; they don\u0027t map well to amounts of money, so I haven\u0027t set them up that way.\u00a0 But this is what any contribution will help me to do: first, to revise and self-publish \u003cem\u003eGoing North\u003c/em\u003e; second, to finish and, probably, self-publish \u003cem\u003eThis Green Plot\u003c/em\u003e, a fantasy novel about the theater, set in the shared world of Liavek; and third, to finish three or four stalled-out short stories and submit them to markets, though they could be self-published too if that didn\u0027t work out.\u00a0 Two of the short stories are set in the city of astronomical werewolves that, it turns out, is part of the Secret Country\u0027s universe; the other(s) are in new worlds and thus far stand alone.\u00a0 I also have ideas for two other novels, but that\u0027s a bit far out to worry about just now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe overwhelming and surprising consensus of people whose opinions I\u0027ve asked for is that I shouldn\u0027t mess around with a lot of different awards or levels, just give people a chance to donate and get on with my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s how it will work.\u00a0 To begin with, at least once a month I will give all supporters a report, or discussion, or possibly a litany of complaints about the process of revising\u003cem\u003e Going North\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 I will also put every single one of you in the acknowledgements when the book is published, under what name you wish, unless you would prefer not to be included.\u00a0 As time and energy permit, I hope to add a few other things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will give supporters at the next higher level at least one cat picture a month.\u00a0 We have six excellent cats.\u00a0 For higher levels yet, I\u0027ll give people a look at deleted scenes from the two-volume version of \u003cem\u003eGoing North\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 I don\u0027t expect to be deleting any scenes from the version I\u0027m revising for publication, but if I do, I\u0027ll add some of those in.\u00a0 These will need to be chosen with a little care to avoid spoilers.\u00a0 Most of them are from subplots now eliminated from the book, but they could contain incidental spoilers.\u00a0 So I won\u0027t be doing those right away. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also give supporters at a higher level a first look at excerpts from the unfinished short stories and novels I want to work on when \u003cem\u003eGoing North\u003c/em\u003e is done and published.\u00a0 From time to time I\u0027ll make some of these excerpts available to all supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs long as I have your attention, I want to say that I\u0027m very\n    familiar with the feeling of wanting to contribute to people\u0027s\n    Patreons but being unable to do so at the level I would prefer, or\n    even to contribute at all.  And I want to note that spreading\n    the word about this project will also be very useful, indeed vital to\n    its success.  I\u0027m going to make a selection of the revision reports public so that anyone who is interested can read them, though some will remain for supporters only.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that the levels specify a particular amount \u003cem\u003eor more\u003c/em\u003e, up to but not including the next level. So if you feel that $1 is less than you want to contribute but the jump to $5 is too much, you can pick whatever amount works for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
