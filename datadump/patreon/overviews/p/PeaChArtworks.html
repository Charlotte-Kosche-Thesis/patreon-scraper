( Furi2Play! ) is a slice of life, romantic comedy series\u00a0that takes place\nin Japan. I wanted to portray the life of a few foreigners/otakus living in Japan and\ntheir relationships with each other.I\u00a0have a lot of fun whenever I\u0027m\u00a0working\u00a0on this series, which is why\u00a0I\u0027ll continue\u00a0drawing\u00a0as long as there are people who enjoys reading them. ^^\u003cbr\u003eDrawing\u00a0comics requires a huge amount of dedication and I\u2019ve spent hours daily  working  on this series (that includes planning, drafting and all that jazz). Although\nit is free for public, it is definitely not free for me :( \u00a0While I am still a\nuniversity student, I have to balance between studies and\u00a0freelance/part time jobs. Because of this I was never really able to put all\nmy dedication into this series.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nBut here\u2019s how you can help!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s when patreon comes to the rescue.
