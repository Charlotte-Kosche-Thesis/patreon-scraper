    "summary": "What\u0027s Pure Cinema you ask? It\u0027s another film podcast, BUT it\u0027s not just another film podcast. It is a\u00a0weekly show (running in 12 episode seasons) hosted by Elric Kane (of the Shock Waves podcast) and Brian Saur (of the Rupert Pupkin Speaks film blog) featuring discussions of new films, old films, double features, cult movies, filmmakers and movie lists among a smorgasbord of other Cinema-related things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have developed the show to feature a topic for each episode and to have what we call a \"5 Films Because\" list from both us (and perhaps a guest as well). Rest assured that if you are a cinephile (or looking to become one) this show is 100% for YOU! Our motto is that the show is like \"A Video Store for your ears\" and that\u0027s how we hope it feels. It should be as if you just wandered into a video store and are hearing two employees talking about movies they love. By pledging as little as one dollar a month, you are helping us keep the show going and cover our costs as well as show us you love us (we have the overwhelming need to feel loved)! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t take any of this lightly - your support is a huge deal to us and we cannot even express how much we would appreciate you coming aboard the Pure Cinema \"Inner Circle\"!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease Subscribe to Pure Cinema on iTunes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/pure-cinema-podcast/id1204885502\"\u003ehttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/pure-cinema-podcast/id1204885502\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
