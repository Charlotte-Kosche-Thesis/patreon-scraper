I do this because I think games are important on a societal level, and not only \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0be talked about from these perspectives, but they \u003cem\u003eshould \u003c/em\u003ebe. Games have incredible potential to inform, educate, and explore important and potentially difficult issues, and game criticism can and should play a role in the medium\u0027s development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome topics I like writing about:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eViolence and its representation in games\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMental health in games\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNarrative development and structure\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCrowdfunding and its implications\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLevel design\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInterplay between real-world and game-world spaces\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ci style=\"\"\u003eFar Cry 2\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0and \u003ci style=\"\"\u003eDoom \u003c/i\u003e(a lot of this) as design\u00a0exemplars\u00a0for the shooter genre\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI\u0027m largely interested in how games communicate, be it narratively, mechanically, or otherwise, as this presents the medium with its incredible capacity to explore new modes of thought."
