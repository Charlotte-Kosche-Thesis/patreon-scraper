     "about": "I taught \"basics of writing a novel\" classes for over twenty-five years. I didn\u0027t intend to stop. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring\n those years I was asked many times if I would consider writing a book \non the subject, and I always said no. I said no because not only have I \nlearned so much from other writers, i often remember who I learned \nspecifics from. It felt false to take things that I paid for [whether \nthrough attending conferences or buying books] or got for free [through \nthe generosity or friendship of other writers], and trying to make a \nbuck off of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcept--there are actually subjects that I do \nhave a lot to say about.  I\u0027ve taught seminars and given programs on \nvarious writing subjects that I\u0027ve refined or learned in more individual\n ways. They feel \u0027mine\u0027 not because I am the only one who does these \nthings, but because my path to learning was very individual and I feel I\n own this knowledge in a way that makes it more mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027m \nunder contract for my current trilogy, and have two more to follow. I \ncan\u0027t justify the time to write nonfiction books which will have a \nsmaller readership, when I have fiction readers waiting for my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnless--there\n are enough of you interested in this project to fund its writing. And \nthat\u0027s why I\u0027m here. There are books on writing I could write a chapter \nor so a month and post while in progress. And if there is enough \ninterest, we could all benefit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou would get the benefit of \nseeing first unedited drafts with things that might get left out of the \nfinal published book. Anyone who takes my classes knows I am prone to \nadmit horribly embarrassing \u0027true facts\u0027 about dumb mistakes I\u0027ve made. \nAnd yeah, those will show up here. Will I leave them all for the \nfinished project? Well, that might not be so easy. How many dumb \nmistakes can I reveal in a book where I am presenting myself as an \nexpert, and be taken seriously?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is what I\u0027m looking at doing here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd\n here are my credentials. As I said, I taught creative writing/basics of\n writing a novel for over twenty-five years, even though I don\u0027t have a \ndegree or formal writing education. My writing was self taught an honed \nby the old \"submit and get rejected\" tunnel of fire. I got hired to \nteach \u0027how to write a novel\u0027 because I\u0027d done it, and continued doing \nit. And then screenplays came into the game... and into my toolbox of \nwriterly tricks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo.
