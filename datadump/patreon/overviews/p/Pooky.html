I make things that a bunch of people apparently enjoy, such as Tutorials for FPS games and League of Legends, gold-making guides for MMO\u0027s, Reviews of games (or weapons and items), and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNYrNTLBuBQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esocial commentary\u003c/a\u003e about things like sweaty male harems or redistribution of candy since my youth was pretty bizarre by some standards. Most of my content is hosted on youtube... however, because of reasons including but not limited to youtube going more ax-crazy than an overly-protective anime waifu, some content creators have started to seek funding elsewhere to keep their content free of \"this video made possible by product placement and brand deal!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIncluding me. Due to some IRL health issues, youtube\u0027s insanity has become so burdensome it has become a threat to my videos and started effecting them, which I want to correct post-haste.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhatcha Doing and what\u0027s all this words?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you havn\u0027t heard, over the past year-and-a-half-or-so youtube\u0027s been toying with how they value a channel similar to how jigsaw might toy with someone\u0027s intestine, including brilliant plans like slashing income on shorter-length videos and giving financial incentive to elongate videos, taking steps against thievery by trapping the creator\u0027s content in purgatory and seizing the revenue, etc. etc. For example I made a finance tutorial for an MMO, some people made and uploaded copies - I didn\u0027t really care, but youtube decided the only fair thing to do was take the revenue from the original and de-monetize my video, placing it in \"under-review\" limbo for over an entire year, where it is to this day as I type this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45Py5OQK2-g\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI kept the video up\u003c/a\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e(I wasn\u0027t going to take it down because I think punishing the common person for the behavior of a few hooligans \u003cem\u003eis wrong\u003c/em\u003e)\u003c/strong\u003e and undeterred made\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ekKBnztQpA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epart 2\u003c/a\u003e of the series. The same thing happened - it was copied, youtube nicked my revenue, it has sat under review ever since, and several other videos were put under suspect seemingly arbitrarily - I was unable to continue my own series under threat of numerous videos being content-ID stolen from myself. Because that makes sense.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother example is some videos are designed to be short but heavily edited such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntR2g8L6y7Y\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enutshell \"lore in a minute\"\u003c/a\u003e videos,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDt3jeXGfDU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emusic videos or songs\u003c/a\u003e, and the like (or in my case for example, something like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lftHYV95OLY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eQuick FPS Tactics: Effective use of Cannon Fodder\u003c/a\u003e) have their income slashed, encouraging the creator to make long let\u0027s-play type videos, even if that\u0027s not what their content normally is - because short videos (and long ones) that are edited or scripted to avoid uh\u0027s and um\u0027s are considered inferior to less edited ones (being longer due to inclusion of said uh\u0027s and um\u0027s and requiring less time to produce via less editing).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are more examples, but \u003cstrong\u003ethe punchline is \u003c/strong\u003ethis Patreon page exists because I don\u0027t want to censor my own content or cut projects because youtube\u0027s having a tantrum. It\u0027s caused interruptions already, and I would see them cease \u003cem\u003eimmediately\u003c/em\u003e - which I could do if I made enough via Patreon that I didn\u0027t need ads (and consequently didn\u0027t need to care about said tantrums).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe there random reward crap?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not planning reward tiers at the moment. My content is about information, and a large portion of it includes review / tutorial / critique. I can\u0027t think of anything \u003cem\u003econsistently\u003c/em\u003e offerable on a reward tier since offering \"premium information\" is a contradiction to my videos which are already supposed to offer that - I wouldn\u0027t make an Autopsy asking the question \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btyAy0Qi_C4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhat Happened to Titanfall and Why Did We Forget About It?\u003c/a\u003e\" if I were planning to add in \"but pay a premium and you get the super secret answer that devalues this video by not being in it!\" at the end. My videos are open to anyone, \u003cem\u003eand I\u0027d like to keep it that way.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy only real \u0027objective\u0027 with the funding is to cover my current health issues, upgrade my outdated hardware (if I can\u0027t pawn off my 2004-era monitor as a collector\u0027s item) and a workable income - pay what you want, no more no less. I don\u0027t want to bludgeon people into giving me funds as that\u0027d be in contradiction to what my channel is about, so hopefully I\u0027m not shooting myself in the foot with this decision. Hopefully.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDECLARE YE GUDS MATEY! WHAT MEAD AND WENCHES BE IN YER CARGO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think it\u0027s fair to want some disclosure in regards to who you support, so let\u0027s be upfront: this page exists for the purpose of preserving the integrity of the channel and improve the quality thereof, which you can decide to support (or not) at your leisure - but since part of my content is social commentary (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCWuhiqlvr4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewhich may or may not be me high out of my mind on painkillers and talking about the problems that come with building a supervillain fortress\u003c/a\u003e), let\u0027s get the following out of the way now so it doesn\u0027t come up later:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m fairly laid back about serious issues. Stressing over it isn\u0027t healthy. I don\u0027t get phased by controversy very much, probably because my earlier years were... colorful. I mention this because when\u00a0it does come to controversy, I have a\u00a0motto I go by - if you discover two extreme positions, assume the truth is somewhere in the middle and both extremes are embellishing their own claims and probably belittling the merits of the opposition to some extent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccordingly, many of my opinions are pro education and in favor of greater understanding of things, so you\u0027re not purchasing my agreement on any particular topic. There\u0027s a chance we\u0027ll disagree on things; not something I see as much of an issue, but for some it is, so be duly notified ahead of time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the snark is non-negotiable!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs that everything?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s all the important things to the page and channel, I think... pretty sure. Youtube doesn\u0027t like it when I make shorter-length but heavily-edited videos and goes bonkers at random, went to crowdfunding to control the issue before it goes out of control. Got some health issues, but I try to make stuff consistently. Make social commentary too, partially influenced by colorful childhood and usually laid back in nature. I think that\u0027s all the important disclosures. This paragraph \u003cstrong\u003e*should*\u003c/strong\u003e function as a TL;DR. I think. Maybe. Possibly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePersonally I think people would avoid adblock and the like if they could get a reasonable service for a reasonable price like getting a channel ad-free for a dollar, so my game-plan at the moment is just to upload my next several videos without any ads on them and set the Patreon bin at one dollar (since that sounds a lot more reasonable than the ten asked by youtube red) and hopefully I\u0027m proven right and the plan doesn\u0027t come back to bite me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
