    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Hello, I am so glad that you found my Patreon page and are interested in joining my close-knit community of art and drawing patrons. I am a zealous, late-bloomer artist that has embraced my passion for art and drawing. A realist at heart with a abstract mind with a passion to create. I am a individual that likes to generate what I see, how I perceive, identify, and develop my art. It is a continual process that I try to express, communicate, and share. As my patron you will get access to my teaching assignments and monthly rewards.\u003c/h4\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I am a late bloomer to the art scene. I did start to see my talent when introduced to art by a English teacher in Jr. High school. For educational reasons she would have us read poetry and short stories, memorize poems, have us read it out loud. Next, she would have us draw and paint on paper and canvas in class expressing what we learned in the stories. Thus, began a awe inspiring life of culture, sense, emotion, detail, and perception.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 However, life happens and sometimes we are lead down another path away from our passions. Everyday of my life I have always admired artists and their works. What the artist has created relentlessly affected my heart and sparked a fire throughout my being. So much so, that I decided to pursue a degree in fine arts. While on that path I also became aware of people and artist\u0027s emotions, behaviors, mental, and cognitive processes. In addition, I  decided to follow my need to understand why people behave, think, and act in certain ways. The interest in psychology mostly came from wanting to know why artists exhibited such flamboyant and mental distress. Yes, I did find the answers and I now have more understanding, compassion, empathy, and understanding of other people\u0027s personalities, desires, and meaning to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 So, while on my journey to learn about art, mostly painting and drawing, I learned about ceramics, sculpturing, mixed media, photography, and history. In the meantime, I was craving to create, in which I did, I created graphite, ink drawings, sculptures, pottery, and watercolor, acrylic, and oil paintings. I loved everything I did, I even tried to perfect everything I did but nothing was perfect according to me. After years and years of agony, defeat, and practicing I started to become very discouraged with my art. It seemed I could not move forward for the life of me practicing, practicing, practicing.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Here is why, I wanted to become a artist and realist. I wanted to create something so real that people would be touched and fall in love with the paintings or drawings that I created as I did when taking in other artists\u0027 works. But to no avail, however, I started remembering what one of my college art instructors said to me when I was so discouraged about one of my paintings and looking around at the other students\u0027 paintings. She said, \"You need to be looking for your own style, not for your style in other artists. You have an abstract style like Alex Katz, you are more of an illustrator. You need to find it and be more comfortable with it\". Well of course I ran home and looked up Alex Katz and his work. My heart sank, I finally had to come to terms with who I was and who I am. My mind is abstract but I love realism. I am good at illustration and abstract, I do want to find my style and move forward. So that was about eight years ago, I still love realism and continue to practice, practice, practice, but I am also finding a way to be comfortable with my talent, my style, and who I am as an abstract artist and person. I still want to reach my goal of realism and will continue to work on it for as long as I can. Nevertheless, I can still look and admire all styles of art and let the passions and emotions run through me as I learn and gaze. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Thank you for reading my journey and if you would like to learn or continue creating art, can relate with my experiences, or have struggled with your art, join me on my Patreon page to continue on your journey sharing the like-mindedness and details of light and dark, color, and value. All I ask is for patience, passion, and desire to create!\u003cbr\u003e"

We will be able to share monthly assignments on my Facebook page and start monthly give-aways to encourage patrons for being dedicated and faithful artists. I will work with beginners to intermediates and others who would like to share their experiences were we all learn from each other. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I know my mediums are many and diverse, however, in the future I would like to be able to teach everyone their specific medium and help them with their passion. I would like to expand to tutorials and sharing specific mediums. \u003cbr\u003eI am looking forward to helping cultivate, develop, and watch each artist\u0027s progress.",
