I\u0027ve been running that site since January 2014 and have been credentialed for Providence games at the Dunkin\u0027 Donuts Center, the Barclays Center, Mohegan Sun Arena, Hinkle Fieldhouse, Carnesecca Arena, the Big East Tournament at Madison Square Garden and the NCAA Tournament in Columbus in 2015. I\u0027m also a 2010 graduate of Providence College living in New York and my day job is employee benefits administration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI provide regular news, information, opinions and analysis on Providence basketball, both on the court and in recruiting. I started the site as a hobby and a hobby it remains. However, I\u0027d like to do what I can to improve on what I\u0027ve built to date and the following I\u0027ve accrued over that time. I have several ideas for ways to improve both the website itself and my overall coverage of the Providence program. With Ed Cooley taking the Friars to a school-record 4 consecutive NCAA Tournaments, there has never been more interest in Providence basketball in the internet age.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get by becoming a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery level of support receives my gratitude and then depending on the level you choose you will receive access to a channel or channels on Slack to chat with me and the community of other like-minded Friar fans who have become patrons. (Note: The email address you provide when becoming a patron will be where the Slack invite is sent) Those who opt for some of the more generous monthly levels can be a guest on an episode of the Friartown Fan Voice podcast and/or take part in a monthly interactive livestream where you can ask me questions and I\u0027ll update you on the goings on around the Providence program.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you read through all of this and decide you don\u0027t want to become a patron I want to thank you for stopping by my page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe goals\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027d love to be able to travel to more away games. Being based out of New York allows me pretty easy access to Providence road games at St. John\u0027s and Seton Hall. I\u0027ve also been able to fairly easily attend games at Georgetown and Villanova. But I\u0027d like to get to the other road arenas around the league. This past season I was able to get out to historic Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis to cover Providence\u0027s game against Butler. It\u0027s a bucket list thing for big hoops fans and I\u0027d recommend it to anyone that\u0027s been considering taking the trip. One of my goals\u00a0is to get to Chicago, Cincinnati, Milwaukee and Omaha for games and your help here will go towards travel expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other goal is to be able to perform some upgrading to the website itself and some of the content that I provide to everyone for free. I don\u0027t intend on making any of my actual website content paid and your generosity here will help me to make some of my ideas come to fruition. One big idea is the creation of an enhanced recruiting section with interactive lists and recruit profiles. I\u0027ll need to pay someone to do the technical work that will be required and I don\u0027t have the funds laying around for that right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if the goal is exceeded?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll money over the current monthly goal will be donated to the Angel Fund at Providence College. For more information on the great things the Angel Fund does for students at PC,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.providence.edu/alumni/support/giving-opportunities/Pages/angel-fund.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclick here\u003c/a\u003e."
