    "summary": "These days, it seems that internet-browsers are bombarded by long, tasteless ads alongside every song, article, or video. The easy solution for most people is to install an ad-blocking program on their browser. Unfortunately, blocking advertising also blocks content creators from being compensated for their work. With ad-block, you can enjoy the free media produced by your favorite creator, but they get short-changed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why services like Patreon exist: to give you, the viewer, an option to directly support your favorite creators without any guilt for avoiding those pesky ads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support Pravus?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong story short, I\u0027m a video game enthusiast who decided to start creating gaming videos on YouTube as a hobby. Over the years, my content has greatly improved in quality and quantity, but these improvements have come at a cost. Whereas before I might have spent two or three hours a week creating videos, now I invest nearly twenty. This channel has effectively become a part-time job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not complaining, of course. This is still only a hobby for me, not my full-time career and I\u0027m lucky to receive as much support as I do. That\u0027s why I\u0027m starting this Patreon. I\u0027ve received several requests for a Patreon page from loyal viewers who have enjoyed hundreds of hours of my content and would like to support my channel directly. So here I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinancially speaking, supporting a channel on Patreon is an extremely cost-effective way to enjoy online video content. If you were to go to your local movie theater, you might pay anywhere from $7-12 for a two-hour film. Alternatively, you could subscribe to a service like Netflix or Amazon Prime for $8-12 per month for an average of one or two hours of entertainment per day. All of my YouTube content is completely free, but even if you were to pledge $1 per month, you be paying me \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e than the typical ad revenue and you\u0027d have guilt-free access to nearly an hour of fresh content released every weekday.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre there any perks for supporters?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt this time, no. This Patreon exists only for those who wish to support this channel out of the goodness of their heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if at some point I expand into streaming and am able to offer any other sort of perks to my audience, then I will extend that offer to my Patreon supporters as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhether or not you choose to support my Patreon, I will continue to provide free videos for your enjoyment. Truly, I\u0027m just thankful to have you in my audience! However, if you find yourself frequently visiting my channel and you are in a position to sponsor my content, please consider that your support would allow me to invest in new games, equipment, and software to improve your experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and consideration!"
