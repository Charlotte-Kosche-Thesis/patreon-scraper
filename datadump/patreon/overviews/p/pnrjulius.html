(Closely-related terms are \"behavioral economics\" and \"evolutionary economics\" or \"evonomics\"). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am particularly focused on issues of global development and the eradication of poverty. We live in a world of almost unimaginable wealth, yet it is so concentrated in the hands of a few that still over one billion people languish in poverty. For just 1% of the total amount Americans spend in a year, we could eliminate the worst kind of extreme poverty, effectively ending world hunger once and for all. I work in research, education and policy activism to find out what policies would lead to sustainable and equitable economic growth, to teach people how those policies work, and to get people to actually implement them in the real world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to cognitive science and economics, I have also studied physics, philosophy, and social psychology.
