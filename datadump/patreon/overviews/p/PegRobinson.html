    "summary": "Hi. I\u0027m Peg Robinson--a pro writer with a long history in fanfic. I was one of the early online fan writers on the Usenet, producing the Star Trek: Voyager fanfic \"Talking Stick/Circle\" with my partner, Macedon. Over the past few years I\u0027ve produced fanfic as \"Tammany\" on AO3 and other fan forums. As a pro freelance writer under my own name I\u0027ve made my living in non-fiction writing and editing. I am an active SFWA member with over six pro fiction sales.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI won publication in the first and second Star Trek: Strange New Worlds collections. I received honorable mentionfrom the L.Ron Hubbard Writers of the Future competition\u00a0for \"The Spinster and the Clever Man,\" and eventually sold the same story to Cicada Magazine. There\u0027s a long, odd story about that, as WotF no longer gives honorable mentions, but there it is. It happened.\u00a0My novella \"Tonino and the Incubus\" qualified for the 2007 Nebulas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am on Patreon because I love to write and also love the immediate satisfaction of offering my work to my readers. I\u0027ve worked both professionally and in the fan writing world, and have found I hate the lag between writing and pro publication. However, I also hate not getting paid. Writing is hard work and income is necessary. Patreon lets me suit my publishing pattern to each piece, knowing I can reach readers quickly, without long delays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I\u0027ve been blessed with the support of thousands of readers in the fan world and as a pro. Every interaction I\u0027ve had added energy to my day and interest to my writing. I\u0027m grateful to all of you for supporting my writing life this way, and grateful to Patreon for providing a platform to try to expand that support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been online for many years, and writing for even longer than I\u0027ve been online; however, this is the first time I have attempted a format and a writing schedule of this type. The following is what I hope will be a normal month\u0027s production, but it is only a first estimate based on my usual production levels. I think I can manage the following, but time may prove me optimistic. If so I\u0027ll let subscribers know as I refine my estimates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMonthly goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne chapter minimum--approx. 2-3,000 words--of \"The Hornbeam Staff,\" a novel being written in real time, first draft. The setting is alternate history WWI Angeland, the genre is fantasy. This is intended to be a serial with monthly updates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne chapter minimum of \"The Waterloo Documents,\" a nearly completed Regency era historical mystery-romance novel being revised into second draft. Another serial with monthly updates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne short story if possible. My short-story output has always been variable, but I will attempt and average of one short per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt least one essay in The Food Salon: I am a gourmand and a glutton with a passion for good food, from things almost everyone likes (baked chicken, good salads) to things some people like (clams, oysters, and mussels) to things relatively few people like (liver). I hope to write a minimum of one monthly essay on some food I am eating, cooking, of merely dreaming of with longing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVarious essays: I considered attempting a journal, but I think of things on an erratic basis and find essays scattershot all over the topic realm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOccasional original art: I am not a pro artist. This does not prevent me from doodling and trying to master drawing on my tablet computer. On occasion I may get pieces I like, draw a cartoon I think is cute, and so on. I see no reason NOT to throw that up online to amuse you all. Just don\u0027t expect genius--I\u0027m a duffer with pretensions of grandeur at best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be adding bonuses and goodies to reward those subscribing at higher levels. However, the majority of my writing will be aimed at my entire audience, with goodies for higher ranks a matter of trying to provide some added value or just a bit of fun. There is no way to \"repay\" those of you who contribute and help pull me and mine into solvency...and that is true of even the least of my subscribers. Bonuses will be little flourishes intended to charm or illuminate far more than they can ever hope to repay your generosity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope this gives those of you considering subscription a good sense of what I plan to provide in return for subscription. Thank you. I do hope very much you subscribe. I believe I offer good value, great stories. I know I offer profound appreciation for a more stable income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatron Lists of Honor:\u003cbr\u003eCopper Patron\u003cbr\u003eBlade McMicking, DI, is my very first Copper Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: The dragon image used on this page was found on Wikimedia Commons, was taken by Bernard Gagnon, and is used on a Share and Share Alike contract."
