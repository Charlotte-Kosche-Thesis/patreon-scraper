Go figure...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPawsitive Vybe is part art gallery, part rescue organization, part dog training studio, and provides some of the best disc dog and dog sport instruction in the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat good is knowledge if it\u0027s hidden away?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe develop and share unique dog training knowledge with the world. All of this knowledge is freely available via our website. Our content is the foundation for all of our classes and camps, and it\u0027s freely available.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe believe that having our content freely available makes people\u0027s lives better with their dogs and elevates the base level of knowledge in dog sports and dog training in general.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut there are only so many hours in the day and creating content is a time consuming activity. One person can only create so much content. \n\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a patron of Pawsitive Vybe and ensure that this important stream of dog training consciousness keeps flowing and remains free to the general public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eFreedom to Tackle Large Projects\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe have taken on a few large projects in the past few years: the PVybe Life/Pawsitive Vybe web series, the Art of K9Disc, Jam in a Flash, and a few that didn\u0027t quite pan out. These large projects are amazing to work on, but it\u0027s a little stressful working without a net.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn the agenda is a new book by Ron Watson, \n\u003cem\u003eSlacker Training,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0a fun look at shaping and capturing for a better working relationship with a dog that has both pet dog and dog sport applications. We are also developing a dog training graphic novel series and a couple of instructional DVDs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLarge projects require time and money and two things almost all dog trainers are short on are time and money.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a patron of Pawsitive Vybe and provide some stability so we can move forward on large projects that can reach more people and create more cool dogs.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
