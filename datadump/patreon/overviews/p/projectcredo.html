For the vast majority of people, those answers are hidden away in primary sources like scientific papers while only a few intrepid souls brave the world of academic publishing to satisfy their own curiosity. But there hasn\u0027t been a good way to share those answers - or a process that went into finding them. That\u0027s why we built Project Credo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eProject Credo is a smart way to share and evaluate research.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nIn it, one contributor can save other people hundreds of collective hours of research by adding papers to a shared list. Users can also push papers to the top of the list by voting on them. You can add papers by searching for them, by URL, or by IDs like DOI or Pubmed IDs. And when you\u0027re done, or you want feedback, you can share your list with colleagues to add or comment on papers. \u00a0Make a list for everyone to see so people no one has to search for the same papers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nWe don\u0027t like ads or paywalls so we are looking for ways to support our site. Patreon lets you become patrons if you believe in our mission. It also gives us an easy way to keep in touch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow can I help?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nIf you believe in us, believe in the site, or just have too much money burning holes in your pockets, you can help keep our site (and us) afloat by becoming a patron on our Patreon page. We both left full-time jobs to take this as far as we can, so anything we can do to buy ramen would be an improvement, at this point. \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.projectcredo.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSign up on our website\u003c/a\u003e and help people discover the best research! \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/UUa2sMZjFWTPSJK22\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePlease also fill out our survey to help us understand how best to serve our community.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
