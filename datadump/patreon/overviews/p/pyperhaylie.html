I love drawing, and I\u0027m slowly, but surely, learning my way around a digital format, and that has been a lot of fun. Eventually I want to start up a comic series involving my main OC Elana.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0That\u0027s where you come in. Getting patron support is so exciting for me, and helps drive me to create, even when I\u0027d rather sit and mess around on youtube. It is a constant reminder that there are people around who want to support my work. I work fulltime right now, and my goal now is that between commissions and Patreon that someday I\u0027ll be able to do this full time and pump out more art than I\u0027m able to right now through time constraints. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0More time dedicated to my art would also gain extra perks for my Patrons. These perks include, but are not limited to a Patron only stream, educational material, step by step guides on how I do certain effects, speedpaint videos, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thank you for your support in my art journey!\u003cbr\u003e~Pyperhaylie\u003cbr\u003e"
