    "summary": "So, what is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s like Kickstarter, except that while Kickstarter is designed to allow fans to pledge money to make sure a project they want happens (or happens better), Patreon is designed to allow fans to pay their favorite creators a monthly salary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a tough business - and it\u0027s hard for creators to be paid what they deserve. The more money we get for being creative, the less time we have to spend doing uncreative things just to pay the bills. Patreon allows you to subscribe to a creator\u0027s content. You pay so much a month and the creator keeps making the content. Yes, most of us would do it anyway - in fact, some of my content is free to all comers. Some, you have to pay for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jennifer R. Povey. I\u0027m a published novelist (Check out \u003cem\u003eTranspecial\u003c/em\u003e, through Musa Publishing) and prolific writer of short stories. I\u0027ve had short fiction published in numerous anthologies and periodicals, including two stories in the top science fiction magazine \u003cem\u003eAnalog\u003c/em\u003e. I also have comics in production with QEW Entertainment, Emerald Star Comics and Vivifica Studios. Finally, I\u0027ve written RPG supplements for Occult Moon and edited for Imperfekt Gammes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m forty years old and live in northern Virginia with my husband (sorry, guys, very married here).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, so, why should I subscribe to you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI run two blogs - one is a personal blog with occasional reviews. The other, \"Do Horses Neigh When They Run?\" is my new blog for writers, gamers, and the curious. The goal is to help people use horses in their fiction (especially fantasy or historical fiction) and get it right. Although a lot of writers are horse people, most aren\u0027t - and regular lessons are expensive! You can find this blog at neighwhentheyrun.blogspot.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also, currently, doing a purpose written web serial, Making Fate. This is not a serialized novel, it\u0027s more like a text comic and will probably run for a couple of years - depends on my ratings! You can find Making Fate at \u003ca href=\"http://makingfate.jenniferrpovey.com/?p=6.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://makingfate.jenniferrpovey.com/?p=6.\u003c/a\u003e That\u0027s the first page, by the way, so if you didn\u0027t come here from there - go check it out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, subscribers, once I get some, can expect to see exclusive content - or simply early access content, including short stories, microfics, character profiles, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and keep checking this page. I may add rewards - if I do they will go out to anyone subscribed at that level, not just new subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
