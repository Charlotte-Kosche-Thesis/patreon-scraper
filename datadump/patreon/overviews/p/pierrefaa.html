    "summary": "I have so news many songs to share that it\u0027d be impossible to release them all together. And it seems like the old rules are not working so well\u2026\u00a0So let\u0027s try to unveil this music as \u003cstrong\u003ea cycle of 12 short EPs\u003c/strong\u003e, each month, \u003cstrong\u003efrom January to December 2018\u003c/strong\u003e. This rhythm will give you time to enjoy their different colours and textures, to embrace them one by one. It also gives me more freedom than the standard album format.\u003cbr\u003eSome songs are very produced. Some others are very raw, just guitar and vocals.\u00a0I wrote and composed everything, but of course some musician friends are involved in the project. I will give the credits and details when each EP is released.\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0don\u0027t exclude to have a physical release of a selection of songs, later in the process (could be a double album), if it makes sense. We\u0027ll see.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been through a lot of emotional turmoil lately. It\u0027s not over yet. Focusing on the songs has proved to be a very good shelter - because they help us (creators and listeners) to process emotions, to express the deepest things in a way I couldn\u0027t achieve in mundane life.\u003cbr\u003eAnd then, we also have some funny little songs, here and there. They open the window, let the sunshine and fresh air in. A fair amount of light-hearted, innocent pop can be good.\u003cbr\u003eHere we are.\u003cbr\u003eI know it\u0027s Christmas, I know we\u0027re broke, I know that everything else can be a priority. So it\u0027s probably a bit crazy to believe in songs and in what they can do\u2026 Well, at least we\u0027re not selling weapons here, right? Let\u0027s be that kind of crazy, let\u0027s water the flowers and feed the birds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePS: besides this cycle of 12 EPs, I will also release two other parallel projects, in collaboration with different musicians from Korea and Japan. These 2 works are not part of the Patreon offer, because they have very specific mood that wouldn\u0027t fit in the cycle. They will have separate, distinct releases.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
