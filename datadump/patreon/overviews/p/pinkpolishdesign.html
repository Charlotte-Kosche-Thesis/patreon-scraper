But for those that stumble on this page, I thought it would be good to provide you with a bit of background.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love art.  I always have.  I had a wonderful great grandmother who bestowed on me at an impressionable age amazing watercolor paints, easels, paper, brushes and a host of other supplies.  And you know what?  I wasn\u0027t very good. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eEven after school art classes, college art classes, and several sketch books later, you know what?  I still wasn\u0027t very good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome times you have to stumble through life a bit before you find your niche.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up, married an amazingly talented artist, and gave up the pencils and brushes.  It wasn\u0027t until my amazing husband began a challenge to draw daily that I dared pick up art again.  We would do this together.  I would be supportive by putting my own lousy drawings online, to encourage him to share his amazing art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started with a cute (albeit a bit squished) pencil drawing of a puppy.  And look where we have landed now... as of writing this, I\u0027m on day 273 of the challenge.  Was I very good at the beginning?  Not at all.  But the longer I continue to practice daily, the more proud I am of the works I create.  I\u0027ve developed a love of working with ink.  My daily \"go to\" are my pen sketches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you know what?  All that dabbling in watercolor as a child has paid off as well.  The techniques that I was clumsy at with a child, I was able to easily master now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe moral of this story?  It may sound corny, but \"never give up\".  I\u0027m living proof of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy the art I create.  I absolutely love creating it.  If you just want to follow my daily challenge?  That\u0027s great, I would love to have you follow me on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or right here on Patreon, where I\u0027ll post my latest drawings and paintings, and best of all, you get to share in that art with me for free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you really, really like my artwork, (you\u0027re making me blush!) then feel free to support me here on Patreon, or support me through one time purchases from my shop at www.pinkpolishdesign.com.  I really appreciate the support, and your assistance will help me continue to create art for a long time to come!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

It\u2019s a challenge to interpret form \u0026amp; texture into the stark contrasts of black \u0026amp; white, then re-imagine it into the brilliant hues of watercolor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I continue to grow as an artist \u0026amp; experiment with different subject matter, I find myself gravitating to forms with movement.  I\u2019m excited by prospects of dresses, dance, hair, sea life \u0026amp; fish with their glorious fins.  Moments of beauty forever frozen in time on my page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe a piece of art is only great if it connects with you on an emotional level.  My goal is to find a moment that moves you emotionally.  A moment that captures your glance and gives you pause to enjoy that moment of beauty with me.\u003cbr\u003e",
