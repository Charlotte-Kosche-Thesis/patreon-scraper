So you go obliquely. Tell the truth but tell it slant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings us back to my horse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis name is Milo; he\u0027s a 2006 Holsteiner cross (meaning in this case he\u0027s half \u003ca href=\"http://www.holsteiner.com/\"\u003eHolsteiner\u003c/a\u003e (sired by \u003ca href=\"https://www.ironspringfarm.com/stallion-horse-detail/2012-10-22/fleming\"\u003eFleming\u003c/a\u003e), a quarter \u003ca href=\"https://www.arabianhorses.org/\"\u003eArabian\u003c/a\u003e, and a quarter \u003ca href=\"https://www.percheronhorse.org/\"\u003ePercheron\u003c/a\u003e).

He has been, not even kidding, a steady shining light\n through an awful lot of darkness over the past seven years. Dressage is\n literally therapy for me, both physical and mental, even though no health insurance company in the world would agree to cover it, and my \ngoofy asshole of a horse both makes it possible for me to ride regularly\n and is himself a beloved partner in a way that is unlike any human \nrelationship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past year, Milo has started \u003ca href=\"http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/agriculture/pests-diseases-and-weeds/animal-diseases/horses/founder-laminitis-in-horses\"\u003efoundering\u003c/a\u003e for reasons that are still unclear. This has meant months of stall rest (read: boredom, and a bored horse is not a happy horse), weird and fancy shoes to support his feet, and a lot of vet visits. He gets better and relapses, gets better and relapses. The relapses are getting shorter each time, but we\u0027re still trying to pinpoint what triggers them. Along with the foundering, we\u0027ve also discovered an ulcer and the horse equivalent of asthma--meaning \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e vet visits and medications and my trainer bending over backwards to try to manage Milo\u0027s environment so that he can breathe easily. Right now, he\u0027s doing acupuncture (which he loves!), but since he can\u0027t tell us how he feels, it\u0027s hard to know whether it\u0027s helping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003edidn\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e know, horses are very expensive--they\u0027re expensive just to maintain, and even a routine vet bill is \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOT SMALL\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e Milo\u0027s vet and farrier bills are mounting by the day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing income is sporadic at best, and this snarling squirming knot of fibro and migraines and RLS and MDD means that \"at best\" hasn\u0027t been available for a long time.

All the money I make with this Patreon will go to my horse\u0027s vet, farrier, and boarding bills.\u00a0Let\u0027s be clear: these are things I would be--and have been--paying for \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eANYWAY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.
