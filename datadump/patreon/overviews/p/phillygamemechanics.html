Most popular is a monthly game jam that starts on the first week and is judged on the third week hosted graciously by our friends at Indy Hall. Winners receive a lovely laser cut trophy made by a community member and all games are hosted on our itch.io page for the world to see. We hold tournaments, formal game discussions, talks, critiques, and most importantly the opportunity to have people play your games!
