    "summary": "Hey! Welcome to Pie Cubed\u0027s Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat is Pie Cubed?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://piecubed.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePie Cubed is a website\u003c/a\u003e about the wonderful world of science. I write about cool interesting things such as how humans breathe in space, how there is a giant cloud of gas in the middle of our galaxy that tastes of alcoholic raspberries, and how hippos are closely related to dolphins(!).\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to make science fun and accessible. To write entertaining and interesting science articles without dumbing things down. Everything is meticulously researched.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting for Pie Cubed is a lot of fun and I really enjoy delving into the sciency stuff that really fascinates me. However, it does take a lot of time and a lot of effort. Researching, writing, fact-checking. It\u0027s almost like a real job. Which is why I\u0027m asking for help. For YOUR help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat is Patreon?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nPatreon is a crowdfunding service and a really good way to \u003cstrong\u003esupport your favourite creators\u003c/strong\u003e. You might have heard of Kickstarter, where creators can get their big projects funded by their fans. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is similar, but unlike Kickstarter, the focus is not on a big huge project but on the regular creation of smaller pieces of content: videos, comics and (like in in Pie Cubed\u0027s case) articles.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe way it works is simple. You can pledge an amount of money for each piece of content produced. So for example, if you pledge $2, every time a new Pie Cubed feature-length article goes live you donate those $2.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also set up a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly maximum limit\u003c/strong\u003e. For example if you\u0027ve pledged $2 per piece of content and set a maximum of $4 per month you will never donate more than $4 per month, even if more than 2 articles are published! Pretty neat!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDepending on the donation amount you can exclusive rewards, such as getting access to the articles a day early or getting to participate in monthly hangouts with yours truly (yay!).\u003cbr\u003e\nMy aim is to publish 2 feature-length articles per month (1000+ words). Other, shorter pieces of content, like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://piecubed.co.uk/2014/02/10/great-wall-space/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis one\u003c/a\u003e, for example, will not be counted in this total (and no money will be taken).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support Pie Cubed?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWriting thoroughly researched and entertaining science articles takes time and effort. Just like a real job. I would like to make it my real job.\u003cbr\u003eThe donations would also help me to buy better equipment to record videos and to do other fun things.\u003cbr\u003eIf you think Pie Cubed is awesome and want me to continue making great content YOU can help. Even the smallest of donations makes a huge difference. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
