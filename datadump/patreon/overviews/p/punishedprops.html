In an effort to help the cosplay community learn more about the techniques we use, I started making instructional YouTube videos. Since then, along with Brittany\u2019s help, we have produced\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/punishedprops\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eover 600 videos\u003c/a\u003e, and we don\u2019t intend to stop. I am in love with teaching new cosplayers and prop makers everything they need to know to get started building incredible works of wearable art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePunished Props Mission Statement:\u003c/strong\u003e To teach the next generation of prop and costume makers the skills necessary to fully explore their passion and enthusiasm for the things they love. We create honest instructional content that is designed to push ourselves and others to be better makers. Our goal is to not only teach techniques, but to also be a positive role model and leader in a quickly growing community of makers, crafters, and creators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s Make More, Together\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now we\u2019re committed to publishing at least one fully produced shop video on Mondays and one live technique or Q\u0026amp;A video on Wednesdays every week. This chews up a lot of our time, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re passionate about and we will continue to make that commitment. With your help, our Punished Props video channel can become something even better than I ever imagined. With the support you give us through Patreon we can devote even more time and resources towards these videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBetter videos. More videos.
