    "summary": "Hello everyone. I am Mehdi Sadaghdar, the creator of\nElectroBOOM videos and website, and the holder of the GREAT UNIBROW. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://electroboom.com/patreon/eyebrow_dance.gif\" style=\"width: 356px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs you may already know, I create educational and entertaining videos around\ndifferent creative and scientific subjects, mainly on electronics since I\u0027m an\nelectrical engineer. And unfortunately for me, every project has dangers and\nrisks and fortunately for you, I catch them on camera. While that provides\ncomedy and humor to help consumption of a boring scientific subject, it also\nprovides exposure to the risks and prepares viewers against injury while\nworking on similar projects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBefore anything I should say, I am not trying to start charging money for\nmaking videos. I will make them no matter what and your feedback and comments\nare the best reward for my efforts. But I like to do better, more efficient and\nmore frequent and for that I need your support. My goal is to become a full time YouTuber and provide frequent videos. But that looks like a far-fetched goal at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been blessed by so many viewers and that has provided me with the opportunity to grow faster. But yet, every video needs tools and equipment, most of the times a design and components both for engineering and video building aspect and so far I have been able to deliver in less than ideal working environment (corner of bedroom). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis has been quite challenging, but my work has become easier as more people and companies join to support me for the funds and equipment I need. And I thank you all. But there is a long way to go, although I am seeing\u00a0 the flickering light at the end of the tunnel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy first goal is to be able to produce videos efficiently and seriously and for\nthat, I need a proper setup. And that\u0027s why I like to ask for your support, so\nthat I can prepare this setup, buying required tools and equipment and maybe\nget a space where I can setup a lab as well as a dedicated studio, moving away\nfrom my living room lab and bedroom studio into a more descent space. Your support would also provide for\nthe cost of components, devices and new tools that every project needs.   \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy second goal is to expand into a bigger business of spreading knowledge via\nproviding tools, prototypes and kits to people interested to experiment. With\nmy videos, I have been able to make many people interested in science and from\nthe messages I receive once in a while, I was able to inspired many to return\nto school or choose/change their major to study electronics. With the addition of learning tools to my\nvideos I can help people experiment and learn easier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd my ultimate goal is to bring you any crazy idea I can\ncome up with for my videos and not be limited by the required budget. There are\nso many things I could do like trying to teach how to fly a combat jet plane for the first\ntime. But so far I can just dream!\u003cbr\u003e"

But I like to spread and teach my knowledge of electronics faster so people can learn quicker and can put their own circuits together. For those videos, I would have to spend less time to be funny and more time to be educational, which works better for quick turn videos. Of course my funny videos will never go away! Reaching my goal would help me buy the tools and equipment I need to build a suitable lab which would help both kind of videos.\u003cbr\u003e",
