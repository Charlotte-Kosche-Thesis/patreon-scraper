    "summary": "Hello there boys and gals, Lords and Ladies, knights and priestessess, dungeoneers and explorers, and welcome to Zoink\u0027s Emporium of odd ends, tinkered trinkets and boggling baubles. If you didn\u0027t know you wanted it you\u0027ll find it here! So step right in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Being the DM of my friends D\u0026amp;D group as well as the fortunate owner of an iPad and an Apple pencil I\u0027ve found a quite sizeable amount of joy in making graphical resources for use in my games. When we played back in our heyday I used to draw maps on graph paper and draw items on little slips of paper. Returning to the table some 20 years later I first started making resources to use with the digital tabletop rpg simulator Fantasy Grounds; maps, scenes, items, portraits, tokens and everything in between. After some time in FG, finding the nostalgia skittering across our dice-hungry palms too much to bear, my group and I once again sharpened our pencils, straightened out our character sheets and went back to full-blown pen and paper tabletop role-playing. And much to me surprise I\u0027ve found that the need, or perhaps rather use, or want for, visual aids, terrain and other graphical additions I can make to enhance our games are even more prevalent in our PnP games than they were in FG; POGs, maps, tiles, terrain, item cards, scenery, handouts and other 2D resources that I can crank out are only limited by my fantasy, the time available and my own limited skill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I can offer you as a patron is downloadable pdf-files of my various drawings, for use in your own games. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now I\u0027ve been creating stuff only for my own games, stuff that I\u0027d need myself, but hopefully further down the line, if other players and DMs would be interested, I could start making commissions or take suggestions for specific stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy what I make, and that you will find a use for my stuff in your own games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a link to my first \"show and tell\" post:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/17721342\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/17721342\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks and regards!\u003cbr\u003e- Zoink\u003cbr\u003e"
