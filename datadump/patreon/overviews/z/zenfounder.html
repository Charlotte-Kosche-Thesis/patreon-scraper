Now we need your help to continue producing the show, and to elevate it to the level of storytelling we believe founder relationships, sanity, and family, deserve. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat if ZenFounder continued to tell the stories of founders, their lives, and their relationships, but with better production, more intricate storytelling, live Q\u0026amp;A episodes or two episodes each week? \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve delivered a new episode to your podcatcher every week since the show\u0027s inception.
