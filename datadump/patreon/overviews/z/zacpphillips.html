I use these platforms to platforms to promote mental health awareness, personal development and self-discovery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Passion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is very easy to feel isolated inside of our own minds. It can be hard to understand it ourselves, let alone aptly express it to others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a significant issue, as this isolation can lead to further decreases in mental health, self- harm, addiction and potentially even suicide. If we feel alone with the issues and trauma from our past, our sexuality, or our mental afflictions, we may not know what to do or where to go for assistance and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that by starting open and honest conversations we can form a community of supporting, caring and understanding people that will ultimately help to reduce the stigma that is associated with all aspects of our inner worlds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t already, please check out my content:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.zachary-phillips.com/blog/books-zachary-phillips\"\u003eBooks\u003c/a\u003e - \u003ca href=\"http://www.zachary-phillips.com/blog/\"\u003eBlog \u003c/a\u003e- \u003ca href=\"http://www.zachary-phillips.com/realitycheck/\"\u003ePodcast \u003c/a\u003e- \u003ca href=\"http://www.zachary-phillips.com/shareyourstory/\"\u003eShare Your Story\u003c/a\u003e - \u003ca href=\"http://www.zachary-phillips.com/videos/\"\u003eVideos \u003c/a\u003e- \u003ca href=\"http://www.zachary-phillips.com/fiction/\"\u003eFiction \u0026amp; Poetry\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI would like to be able to release much more content, but I am currently restricted by the amount of time that I can commit. I need to balance content creation with work and family life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven something seemingly as small as a five minute video can take up to an hour to complete - once you take into account the writing time, retakes, editing subtitles, uploading and publishing. As you could imagine, a 2000 word blog post, 30 minute podcast, or 10 minuted video takes much longer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIdeally I would like to be able to release a daily video, as well as a minimum of one blog post and one podcast per week. By contributing, you would help to make that a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Help\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll that I am asking for from my followers is \u003cstrong\u003e$1\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0per month. Everyone has money issues and I couldn\u0027t justify asking for anyone to be compromised financially by contributing more than they can comfortably afford.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason that I am asking for such a small amount is that it is practically unnoticeable. $1 per month for an individual person is almost nothing. Yet when many people contribute such a small amount, it will all add up and become quite significant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is $2000/month. That amount will provide enough income to cover the costs of my rent, food and utilities bills, and enable me to produce content full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are enjoying my content, and can afford $1 per month, please consider contributing to my Patreon. Please note the all contributions via Patreon are in $USD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTogether we can make a difference\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
