I also vectorize them so I can change their size in case they are too small or to even animate them. That\u0027s basically the only type of edits I\u0027ll make here.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMost of the images I edit are not mine, so I will always post the source of the artist that made the sketch in the first place. In case you\u0027re the artist and want me to delete the coloring I made, just send me a message and I\u0027ll delete it. I work with NSFW and SFW images, but most people like my NSFW art for some reason, so don\u0027t be surprised if there\u0027s a lot of it here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I do it:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is mostly just a hobby of mine and not my job or any important source of income, that also means that all I do here will be free and available for everyone to see. Also, everyone is free to share it wherever they want, but please source it correctly, if you don\u0027t want to source to my Patreon that\u0027s fine by me, but please mention or link the original artist that drew the picture in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I do it:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNormally I pick semi random images from artists I like to edit them, but with this Patreon thingie I\u0027ll be open to requests. Just please don\u0027t get mad if I don\u0027t pick your request, maybe I\u0027m busy with my job and I\u0027m not working on pics or maybe I\u0027m already working on other images and can\u0027t take more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, thanks in advance for reading all this and even considering giving me money. I\u0027m not going to use rewards since I plan to use this as a tip jar. If you feel like giving anything, it\u0027s really appreciated and I\u0027ll try to take requests from patrons as a priority.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledges:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, since this is my hobby, I won\u0027t be uploading very often or on a schedule, that\u0027s why I won\u0027t charge monthly. I could charge by upload, but it won\u0027t be for every upload, just every now and then, I\u0027ll leave that decision to my patrons. All your donations will be wisely spent on the fuel needed to make this hobby possible, which would be candies and juice, mostly juice.\u003cbr\u003e"
