I\u2019ve been working in the advertising industry since 2004.\nWhat I really want to do though, is to create illustrations and fan art. I used\nto draw a lot before, when I was a child up until college. Then, when I landed\nmy first advertising job things started to change. I found myself drawing less\nand less. When I got home from work I would just eat and then go to bed. I\nliterally had no more energy left to draw and create. Eventually, I got married\nand had two kids, and drew even less. It is now 2017 and after some soul\nsearching, I decided to step away from my hectic advertising job and draw,\ndraw, draw full time. I want to recapture the magical experience of my youth\nwhen drawing and creating gave me so much happiness and love for life. I want\nmy art to grow as it has been stagnating all these years. My eldest son was\nactually surprised that I could draw. That just goes to show how long it has\nbeen since I took up the good old pencils and pens! So I am now determined to\nfollow my dreams before it\u2019s too late and I regret it for the rest of my life.\nHaving said that, I am extremely excited to embark upon this adventure at this\npoint in my life and look forward to the challenges that lie ahead.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eWhy do I have Patreon page?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, there are still bills to pay and food needs to be put\non the table. While my wife is working full time, what she earns is not enough\nto cover all of our monthly expenses. So I am turning to the Patreon community\nfor support to help get the much-needed funds so that we won\u2019t need to be in\ndire financial straits and I can concentrate on creating and further improving\non my craft. Thanks in advance to those who choose to pledge and support what\nI\u2019ll be doing. Your help is sincerely appreciated. I won\u2019t let you down! Also, feel free to message me since i do want to touch base and meet people who have appreciation of the arts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo\nhere\u0027s a quick explanation of how my patreon works:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will be posting around 2-4 works each month.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne\nwork is always a pin-up, the other works can be either a portrait, or a bigger painting, or whatever format:)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* The rewards are not retroactive so as to be fair to the patrons who pledged earlier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Patreon is monthly, meaning whatever amount you pledge will be charged once a month. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eBut you will never be charged during a month that I\u0027m inactive\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e. That means if I don\u0027t upload any art during a month, your pledge for that month will be refunded!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I Plan on offering on Patreon\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRight\nnow, I\u2019m leaning towards doing pinups and artwork of characters from cartoons,n anime, comics, video games, etc. I\u2019ve come up with a list of my\nfavorite cartoons, anime, video games, and comics over years and will be doing fan art from characters from them. Occasionally, I\u2019ll be posting \u00a0artwork of my original characters as well. Initially, I will\nbe posting 2-4 works each month. In time,\nI expect to churn out a higher volume of artwork with noticeable improvements\nin rendering quality as I continue to hone and evolve my craft.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
