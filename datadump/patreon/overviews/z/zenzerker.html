    "summary": "First of all, just as a reminder: \u003cstrong\u003emy stories are complete fiction and are meant for adult readers only\u003c/strong\u003e. Even where not specified, \u003cstrong\u003eall characters involved in sexual activities are eighteen years or older\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re reading this, you probably already know what I write and, hopefully, you like my stories enough to want to support me. For that, I thank you. If you want to sample my stories for free before becoming a patron, you can find a bunch of them on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.literotica.com/stories/memberpage.php?uid=2031339\u0026amp;page=submissions\"\u003eLiterotica\u003c/a\u003e page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started writing smutty stories after being a long time reader of erotica, until one day I figured \"Hey, I could do that too!\" and I did. I didn\u0027t really expect people to enjoy my stories, I didn\u0027t even try to make them enjoyable to anyone other than me, honestly. I just wrote what I\u0027d have liked as a reader in terms of characters, themes, \u0027plot\u0027 and so on. Surprisingly, people seemed to like my stuff, and that kept me going. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to start this Patreon page as and experiment of sorts, but also as a necessary incentive to keep writing. Basically, I can\u0027t really spare much time to write smut lately, not unless it somehow turns into a source of income, limited as it might be. It\u0027s funny that I\u0027ve never considered writing as a \u0027real job\u0027 and yet I always end up putting a ridiculous amount of time and effort into everything I write. Sadly, I won\u0027t be able to do that as much as I\u0027d like unless I get some financial support through this page. It\u0027s as simple as that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, that was awkward and unappealing enough, I guess! If I haven\u0027t put you off just yet then you really must be into my writing! Good. Alright then, let\u0027s move on to the fun stuff, shall we?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZZ\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
