I\u2019ve written over two thousand posts, answers, articles, stories and other pieces. I focus on current events articles, photo essays, short stories, nonfiction and anecdotes meant to analyze, criticize, challenge, uncover and uplift. I\u0027ve had my work shown in half a dozen galleries and exhibits. I\u0027ve traveled to Ferguson, NY, Baltimore, Cleveland and across the country raising awareness on police brutality. Currently, I am a teacher in my hometown and writing and art are an extension of my activist work in confronting and ultimately dismantling a system robbing us all of our humanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/f1e4a1a6be79d7f83d9607513cafe050/tumblr_nrltauSCdx1qhodu2o1_540.png\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBeing a artist and organizer in this world is getting harder and harder.
