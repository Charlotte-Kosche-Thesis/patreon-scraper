    "summary": "Hey, check it out! I\u0027ve got a Patreon now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Wait... I\u0027m supposed to write a description here? Oh, uh... okay. What kinds of things does one put in a Patreon description? Um...)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, uh... heya! My name is Zana B. Sparrows, and I\u0027m a fanfiction writer! ...Yeah. You know, the odds are that if you\u0027re looking at this, you already know that. In fact, you\u0027re probably one of my well-loved followers on Quotev that has to put up with my random posts and my sudden spikes of curiosity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, for those of you who managed to stumble across me on Patreon, I guess I should give you a more in-depth description, huh? (Let\u0027s try this again.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, so... I\u0027m Zana B. Sparrows. I\u0027m a fanfiction writer that specializes in romance type things (especially x Reader fanfics). I\u0027m currently obsessed with the game Undertale, and it just so happens that most of my fanfics have something to do with it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main fanfic is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.quotev.com/story/7735410/When-Two-Souls-Meet-Sans-x-Reader\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhen Two Souls Meet\u003c/a\u003e, a Sans x Reader fanfic that is... wait for it... over 451 pages (155,000 words) long. (Yes, I know. If that doesn\u0027t scream \"obsession,\" then I don\u0027t know what does.) I also have a secondary fic that I\u0027m working on called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.quotev.com/story/8010767/My-Greatest-Experiment-Skelebros-Origin-Story\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMy Greatest Experiment\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s a more sci-fi type fic that explains the origins of Sans and Papyrus, as well as their relationship to Dr. Gaster. I\u0027m also planning a sequel to When Two Souls Meet called \"When Two Fates Intertwine,\" which I plan to release by the end of March.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I don\u0027t just write fanfic (though that seems to by my \"thing\" as of right now). I also write original novels from time to time. I have two published novels up for purchase on Amazon (\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Third-Angel-Prophecy-Book-ebook/dp/B00HIRTDRO/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1469453552\u0026amp;sr=8-1#navbar\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Third Angel\u003c/a\u003e and its sequel,\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010Y6SB3C/ref=series_rw_dp_sw#navbar\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e Hades\u0027 Hall\u003c/a\u003e). However, that series is, as of right now, on indefinite hiatus. (Sorry guys.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Oh! I think I\u0027m supposed to say something about what I\u0027m going to do with the money, too. That\u0027s important. How could I forget that?!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo. My reason for being on Patreon is that I want to see if it\u0027s a possibility for me to make a living writing in the future. As many of you probably know, being an author is usually a hit-or-miss kind of thing. Either you make it big, or your book just sits there on a dusty shelf and stares at you for the rest of its natural life. With a Patreon account, maybe I can navigate between those two--I can make enough to sustain myself once I\u0027m on my own, and I can keep writing for all of you fabulous people! Because, honestly, that would be my choice of work--writing fanfiction or novels from home.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for what I\u0027ll actually do with the money right now, while I\u0027m still under my parents\u0027 wings... I\u0027ll save it. I do plan to go to college at some point, and the money that all of you donate to me would be a HUGE help in getting rid of those pesky student loans that everyone complains about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, uh... that\u0027s it, I guess. Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my Patreon page, even if you don\u0027t feel like donating anything. I really love all of my readers, and your continued commentary and support will always, ALWAYS, be welcomed and appreciated. I love you all. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
