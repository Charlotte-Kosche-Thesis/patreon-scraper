After working with agents and publishers over the last couple of years I found I was losing my own personal illustration style and my artistic identity. I was illustrating subjects that just didn\u0027t come naturally, that I wasn\u0027t enjoying or just being asked to change all the things that I used to love about my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis all lead to me\u00a0to taking a step back and re-evaluate my work. I fell upon the realisation that I really wanted to write my own books as well as illustrate. So, I am now on a\u00a0mission to create and publish my own children\u0027s books. I have ventured onto Patreon in the hope that you can help me towards my goal of publishing my books to the highest standard so they can sit proudly alongside any traditionally published book. I want to prove my independently published books deserve some shelf space.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately printing books is expensive! It is not always possible for me to print many books up front but with your help I hope to eventually be able fund the production of more and more books and to grow my audience.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMost\u00a0importantly, what\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI really don\u0027t believe in you giving me something for nothing so in return for your pledges and support I will reward you with lots of exciting exclusive content, colouring-in and activity sheets to download, first look e-books as well as the physical books themselves for the higher tier rewards. I like to think of it as a subscription to my \u0027Ink Spiller\u0027 Book Club where in return for your support you will receive really cool exclusive inky things and an inside look into my inky process.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am aiming to publish 2-3 books a year. I have already published my first picture book and anyone who pledges for the \u00a325 reward will automatically receive a copy of this book (see below) along with some other exclusive goodies in the post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4188/34572757166_2a043fe4fe_c.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe more support I have from you all, the more exciting my rewards can become and I can offer you more and more exclusive and limited edition goodies. This will also allow me to start creating more content and videos just for you where I can give you an inside look into my illustration process with timelapse videos and perhaps even some mini \u0027Ink Spiller\u0027 tutorials.

Being cursed with a problematic book obsession (she has far too many children\u0027s books) lead her to a post grad in Publishing at the University of Plymouth. Following this Zoe worked as an illustrator and book designer at a London book publisher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZoe now works as a children\u0027s book illustrator, from her studio in the picturesque and inspiring Isle of Wight. She also now writes her own children\u0027s books. Zoe\u0027s second children\u0027s picture book \u0027Chasing Butterflies\u0027 is due to be published in June 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen not covered in black ink or with dip pen in hand, Zoe can most often be found drinking Earl Grey tea or obsessively knitting mittens. Although she sometimes has to fight with her cat \u0027Mouse\u0027 over ownership of the balls of wool. She also loves hula hooping (yes, a little random she knows) the fresh air and can often be spotted out and about in her red wellies walking her black lab \u2018Wilson\u2019.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZoe is also the founder and creative director of \u003ca href=\"https://inkyeverafterpress.com/\"\u003eInkyeverafter Press\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e",
