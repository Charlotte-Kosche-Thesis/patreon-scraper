Here you can support my adult Visual Novel \"Powered Stranger\". It\u0027s basically a Dating Simulation that definitely doesn\u0027t take place in the Power Rangers universe at all. ;-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what can you expect from me? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs Gosei would say: There\u0027s a simple explanation for that! First of all, this game is all about fan service, which means:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt any time you have \u003cstrong\u003efree access to the latest playable version\u003c/strong\u003e of the game.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will find a lot of Power Rangers references in the game if you know the show by heart.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere is sex and nudity, but only if you treat the characters respectfully and responsibly.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eSo yes, the game is available for you whether you support me or not, so please download the latest version and give it a try. My goal is to have as many people as possible enjoy my work and hopefully provide me with valuable feedback to further improve it\u0027s quality. Please tell me what you have in mind for the project\u0027s future. What are you missing? What content shall I work on next? How can I make this game even better for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like to support me, I\u0027ll happily accept any donation. I will always owe a dept of gratitude to all you patrons, which is why you will be treated specially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you if you support me financially?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough there\u0027s no difference in the game that you receive, a patron\u0027s opinion is very special to me. This is why you have the following advantages:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou are invited to a monthly Google Hangout to take part in a live discussion and get some insights on the development process.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen a chapter ends, you participate in a poll to decide about the next chapter\u0027s content.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you\u0027re one of the top 20 patrons, be sure to get mentioned in the main menu.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see: This is not a one man show.
