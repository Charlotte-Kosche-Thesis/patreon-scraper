i doing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehello my name is zea webb, i\u0027m a web comic writer and artist. it\u0027s a fun hobby but it doesn\u0027t pay the bills. and that\u0027s why i\u0027ve started a patreon, i\u0027m seeking support from any fans of my work to help me keep being able to do comics, fan art, convention artist alley and anything involving my art. i would love to do this for a living.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003emy comics can be found on tapastic, or most other webcomic hosting sites, but most of them are on((\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108,

help,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003enow generally on this site, \"helping out\" means donating a certain amount of money, but listen, it\u0027s not fair that only people with money to spare get to be the heros here and as far as i\u0027m concerned, sharing posts or retweeting ads or in any way marketing my stuff (because lord knows i suck at it) is a huuuuuuge help that i feel doesn\u0027t get enough gratitude.\u003cbr\u003eso!..other than supporting my work as a patreon (as listed on the right side of this page) i\u0027ll also offer up rewards for \"shares\" \u00a0through either my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/zeawebb90\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e or\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004240935421\"\u003e facebook\u003c/a\u003e for

with my art, that was posted within the past month. it will usually always have either an image attached or a link, if i\u0027m just posting random stuff about my day or where i am, i wouldn\u0027t consider that a marketing attempt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0what i need (and the reason for me being on patreon) is to be able to afford airfare to conventions where i do most of my selling. that includes hotel and food and all that stuff.\u003cbr\u003emaking the art, comics and charms from home in of itself does not cost me anything, however food, internet, bills (being of value to the people i live with) also ordering the merch to eventually sell.....this all cost a lot.\u003cbr\u003enow normally if you\u0027ve gained enough momentum from artist alley to artist alley you eventually start to be able to afford your merchandise from the money you make off it, and hopefully enough left over for food and housing and stuff. but getting there is kinda difficult, that\u0027s why websites like this are so cool! \u00a0
