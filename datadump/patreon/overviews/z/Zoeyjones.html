Welcome to my Patreon page! Im very happy that you are here visiting my site..\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Zoey Jones and I\u0027m an English Singer, Songwriter, Producer and Video maker. I currently live and work between Hong Kong and the UK. I love Hong Kong so much and travel around the region for gigs and also just to enjoy the stunning countries I\u0027m surrounded by. My heart has always been in London and currently this is where I am working on my next album / EP. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t find music, music found me and now it\u2019s my life. I started out my creative life as a ballerina. After my studies I soon fell in love with the art of making music. I started my career in music reaching the finals of the original Pop idol in 2002, this soon led to my songwriting career which began in London. After releasing a few tracks I then moved to Portugal to further expand my knowledge for music. I became exposed to a lot beautiful Fado, Brazilian bossa nova and samba. It was in Portugal that I released my first album (released independently) you can hear hints of the Portuguese / Brazilian inspired Latin flare in some songs in the album. I also worked with many DJs during this time in Portugal feat on many collaborated tracks. The country, culture and it\u2019s music took my breath away.In 2010 I was given the opportunity to work in Asia which lead to a seven year journey throughout most of the region. I was able to gig in some of the most breathtaking venues as well countries like Singapore, Cambodia, Thailand and of course my favorite place, Hong Kong.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/zoeycjones\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/zoeyjonesofficial\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://spotify:artist:3Jda2Ao2bAUnMJGaxlRlJw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8gJxT1RAUHGlxq8tF55yCQ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eAND WHY HAVE I CHOSEN PATREON AS A WAY OF INVESTMENT?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI came across patreon via a friend who intact wanted to sponsor my work suggested doing it via Patreon. Since I have looked into the page I think its a great platform not only to gain a solid, loyal, supportive audience but to also have a great page to place all of my works, creations and stages through each process of creativity. \u003cbr\u003eI have been writing for years and released in the past an album of my own and also collaborated with many producers on their work as a featured artist. Now its time for Zoey to really make her mark as an independent artist!\u003cbr\u003eThis year especially, I\u00a0have many exciting projects on the horizon and in the making. And thats what has brought me here. With your help I can/ we can make these projects not just a record but a piece of memorable music to make a difference. Your kind donations will enable me to be able to produce these exciting projects with regards to spending the hours in the studio, making the music videos, mixing and mastering of the albums/work and then the main pat in my opinion the marketing and PR! Its pointless making great music if it doesn\u0027t get out to the world! Also, there will be employing of the crew to make all of this happen, food, travel and having the opportunity to dedicate precious time to the studio hours and production of everything instead of doing awful jobs which takes up time, crushes the soul and distracts from what I should really be doing.. working on my music!\u003cbr\u003eThe memories of my musical journey will always be in my writing. Projects are so important and it\u2019s the best way I can express and share my art to the rest of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET BEING A PATRON OF MYwork?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eWell, the list can be as big or as small as you want.. the more you choose to contribute, the more rewards you will receive. These can include receiving a signed picture of mine of your choice, receiving copies of my albums.. to having your name in the credits of my releases (Albums and videos), or/and to feature in one of my music videos. Or if you want to get access to my work and postings but have a tight budget it can be as little as a $1 donation a month and you will still be welcomed with open to the exciting world of how Zoey Jones\u0027 musical life is being created.. with many other awards.. please check the rewards page for more info on deciding how to be part of the team..:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
