    "summary": "Greetings, internet! I\u0027m Heidi Kemps, intrepid freelancer. You may know me from talking about \u003ca href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/a-quest-to-find-the-secret-origins-of-lost-video-game-levels/373925/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSonic 2 ROMs\u003c/a\u003e.

Or \u003ca href=\"http://shoryuken.com/2014/09/08/death-crunch-smashing-through-the-cage-of-fighting-vipers-2-with-heidi-zero-chan-kemps-and-heruru/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewaxing at length about Fighting Vipers 2\u003c/a\u003e. Maybe you saw me highlighting some \u003ca href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/05/hidden-messages/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efascinating hidden messages in game code\u003c/a\u003e, and even looking in-depth at \u003ca href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/satellaview-nintendos-forgotten-console\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSatellaview game preservation\u003c/a\u003e. Or heck, you might even know me from numerous interviews I\u0027ve done with game industry folks. In other words, I\u0027ve done a lot of weird and interesting work for a lot of different places over a very, very long period of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, now that I\u0027ve got my Troy McClure introductory bit out of the way, let me elaborate on why I\u0027m here. There\u0027s a lot to love about being a freelancer - your work appears anywhere and everywhere, you can cover a huge swath of different subjects, you meet all manner of wonderful people, and your hard work gets spread far and wide over the internet. It\u0027s pretty great!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, there are numerous downsides to the freelancing thing. There are some review titles you\u0027re not going to be able to do simply because site staff gets first dibs. You can have a pitch you are incredibly excited about writing get rejected by everyone you send it to. And, of course, there are various financial shortfalls that can happen during lean periods when little of immediate note is happening in the industry. Unless you\u0027re one of the absolute tippy-top-tier folks in the freelance biz, you\u0027re going to have certain periods of time when money becomes extremely tight. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is where \u003ca href=\"http://gaming.moe/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGaming.moe\u003c/a\u003e comes in! This is a new personal site that\u0027s run, curated, and completely editorially controlled by me and me alone. It plays host to numerous bits of my writing that just don\u0027t really \"work\" in traditional games media: long and short-form things that set my 68000 heart on fire, so to speak. I want to tap into my burning game-love spirit and deliver wonderful, outside-of-the-mainstream content that will also ignite your gaming passion!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAmong the things I\u0027ve covered and/or eventually plan to cover on \u003ca href=\"http://gaming.moe/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGaming.moe\u003c/a\u003e:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReviews and analyses of obscure (but awesome) retrogames\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterviews with numerous Japanese gaming personalities, both new stuff and things from my archive that haven\u0027t seen publication in English before.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nAll-new interviews with folks involved in some of gaming\u0027s interesting subcultures: fan translation, pro players, event organizers, preservationists, writers of gaming-related books, and so on.\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nEssays on trends in gaming and personal editorials on various industry and gaming sphere happenings, big and small.\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nEvent reports - from local gaming cons to industry gatherings to huge, crazy, awesome celebrations of fan culture like Comic Market.\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nReviews of smaller, less visible games and genres: doujin games, otome games, visual novels, fan translated titles, etc.\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nBonus non-gaming related bits like Japanese figure and anime/manga reviews - I got a .moe domain for a reason, after all!\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://gaming.moe\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGaming.moe\u003c/a\u003e has been live since October of 2014, and within that time, I\u0027ve already published a lot of stuff that I\u0027m extremely proud of: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterviews with people involved in games in many different capacities, including Robert Jerauld (former Enix producer), veteran videogame voice actress and singer Donna Burke, Resident Evil and Final Fantasy scribe Kenichi Iwao, legendary composer OGR, Tsuneki Ikeda of Cave, and others.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn-depth looks at a variety of interesting and historically important retrogames.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReviews of books about games and game history.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeaturettes about interesting gaming related tidbits.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHighlights of events and visits to arcades and other gaming spaces in places you might not expect.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAs happy as I am with the site so far, your contributions will help me \nafford the time I need to expand Gaming.moe\u0027s coverage even further!

There have been some lovely voices who have, sadly, departed the world of games writing as of late, and rather than let the halls of independent games writing echo silence, I\u0027d like to work so that my voice can fill them with a passion for the games and people I love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a .moe domain?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMoe is an interesting Japanese term that is tough to describe in English. Most people tend to think of it as a genre: specifically, cute anime girls expressly designed to push varied otaku buttons. But moe is more than that, as it\u0027s also a descriptor: you\u0027ll hear about people who are moe for certain characters and character types - meaning having those things present sets their hearts a-pitter-pattering. But you can be moe for many things: situations, places, things, even concepts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMe? I\u0027m moe for videogames, especially the extreme nerdy fringes of the hobby. Old 80s Japanese game commercials enthrall me. People hacking into game code and finding interesting unused bits and bobs gets my blood pumping. Talking to other folks who love the same weird old arcade games I do puts me in an excited furor. It\u0027s pretty apt that \u003cem\u003emoe \u003c/em\u003eis also part of \u003cem\u003emoeru\u003c/em\u003e, to burn - because when it comes to weird and interesting gaming stuff, \u003cem\u003eI\u0027m burning, I\u0027m burning, I\u0027m burning for you~\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat exactly is the \"goal\" of this site?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe goal is to post words about interesting gaming stuff from time to time. That\u0027s really it. One day I could be looking at a clever gameplay or storytelling mechanic, the next I could be talking about my issues with AAA gaming, followed by talk about some obscure Japanese title you\u0027ve never heard of. But the overall tone is that gaming is awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is writing for the site?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGaming.moe is all me. I may post images, videos, links, etc. that I think are cool but are made by others. Besides that, all content/opinion/words are mine and mine alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill there be comments and discussion on the stuff you post?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course! Keep in mind, however, that this is my personal site, and as such, jerks in the comments shall be terminated with \u003cem\u003eextreme prejudice.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you going to keep on doing freelance work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI kinda have to if I want to live and pay the bills, y\u0027know? This is more a place for stuff I want to write (or, in some cases, have already written) that just doesn\u0027t really \"work\" on mainstream game websites. I\u0027m still going to keep doing previews/reviews/interviews/features/etc for bigger outlets, but I also want to write about the more obscure stuff I\u0027m really passionate about on the side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
