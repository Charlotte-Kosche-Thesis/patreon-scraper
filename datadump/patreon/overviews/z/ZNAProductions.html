My most recent solid week of work resulting in YouTube\u0027s most polite \"Lol no monie 4 u\" has brought me to realize it\u0027s time to get my Patreon back up and running.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m revamping my patreon in particular on account of all my faithful subscribers begging me to, and I\u0027m extremely grateful for your individual desires to help. Now, I can hardly remember to check my own personal Facebook more than twice a year, if I try paying as much attention to my Patreon Page as I do my YouTube channel, the channel will inevitably suffer and my upload frequency will continue to poopify.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo just a fair warning, if you\u0027re signing up for monthly donations, it\u0027s purely out of the goodness of your heart. I highly doubt I\u0027ll update the Patreon page very often at all, but rest assured, your money is helping in an immense way, and likely directly funding these videos you guys apparently enjoy for whatever reason.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you tons for every bit of help. You\u0027re very attractive."

Not the best way to start, but it lead to me making one of the best choices of my life; going after making a living on YouTube no matter how long it would take or how many people would tell me it was a mistake. After 2 grueling years, it all paid off, and I am proud to call myself a full-time YouTuber, and ex-butthole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t particularly enjoy asking people for money, but recent scares concerning YouTube\u0027s ad revenue have made me realize I can\u0027t put all my eggs in one basket, and multiple streams of income are necessary to guarantee I can continue bringing you all quality content for as long as possible. Patreon has always been immensely helpful to me, and not a dollar I receive from it goes unappreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much for giving me the opportunity to live my dream,\u003cbr\u003eEli",
