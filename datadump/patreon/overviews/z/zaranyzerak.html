    "summary": "I\u0027ve been creating short movies and videos since I was a kid, and playing video games since PONG was the hot new thing! \u00a0I jumped on the YouTube bandwagon shortly after it started, as of March 2006 and have been producing videos on a fairly regular basis ever since.\u00a0 I make a variety of videos including movie/DVD/Blu-ray reviews, rants, full video game playthroughs (many of which I also stream live on twitch) and First Impressions reviews, Muk Bang eating show/live chats, short movies and music videos.\u00a0 I am also a musician and create all my own original music for my videos, and have released two self-produced albums of my music over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most successful series I\u0027ve produced on YouTube is The Multimedia Chronicles, which is an ongoing review series I\u0027ve been doing since April, 2008 in which I talk about all things geeky - movies, DVD/Blu-ray reviews, comic books, gaming, etc.\u00a0 Unlike other review series, I put a very personal spin on my videos, often dropping in personal anecdotes, reasons why a particular thing is significant or meaningful to me personally, etc.\u00a0 I talk to my audience as if we\u0027re just sitting down and having a friendly chat about whatever it is I\u0027m reviewing that day.\u00a0 My viewers have responded to that very positively over the years, and as such I have acquired a very smart, loyal, and positive viewership.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also do a weekly live chat show called \"Saturday Night InSaNiTy\" with several other like-minded YouTubers, which is a casual geek chat in which the viewers can participate.\u00a0 I also often stream live gameplay of various video games on twitch.tv and was one of the first YouTubers to do \"reaction cam\" style gameplay videos as far back as 2008.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary goal with this Patreon campaign is to move things forward.\u00a0 Having to balance life between my job, my awesome little girl, and my YouTube/Video Production ambitions means my time and funds tend to be very limiting a lot of the time in terms of what I would ideally like to be able to do.\u00a0 I feel it\u0027s time to take things to the next level, and really turn my YouTube channel and other projects into what I have always wanted them to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to be able to produce videos more often, do more regular live streams, and to acquire the necessary equipment upgrades to further improve my production value and variety of videos.\u00a0 It is my hope that this Patreon campaign will help to make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by, and especially thanks for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
