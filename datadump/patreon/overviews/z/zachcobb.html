I\u0027m Zach Cobb and\u00a0I\u0027m currently a graduate, hailing from the Cartoon \u0026amp; Comic Arts course from Staffordshire University. I am profiled as a comic artist, a cartoonist and an illustrator. Some of you may know that I\u0027ve been producing artwork and have been showcasing it on social media for the past 5 years. So far, I\u0027ve been loving every single minute of it.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img00.deviantart.net/45ca/i/2017/016/4/f/starkiller_s_training_by_zachcobb-dag2s2l.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eNow that I\u0027ve finished education, I\u0027ve been doing commissions, improving my art style, whilst searching for a job.\u00a0However, whilst searching for work, I am no longer getting any income to help me make more comics and prints to sell at conventions. Which is why going on to Patreon I\u0027m hoping to receive some income whilst acquiring a part time job. This will go towards creating more comics and prints as well as better equipment. I also will be able to devote more time into my work, whilst interacting with my audience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow remember, I\u0027m not demanding money and\u00a0pledging to my campaign is optional. You don\u0027t have to do it, there is no obligation to donate and please don\u0027t donate if you don\u0027t have the means to. Patreon is a way to show your support and that you care about the future of my work.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pre00.deviantart.net/1636/th/pre/i/2017/128/9/c/without_us_front_cover_by_zachcobb-db8kxyh.jpg\" style=\"width: 314px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://pre00.deviantart.net/3960/th/pre/i/2017/165/8/0/without_us_page_1_by_zachcobb-dbcojzd.jpg\" style=\"width: 313px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the last year and a half of university I had created three comics. The first two is \u003cstrong\u003eBrother X Parts 1 and 2 \u003c/strong\u003eis a action/superhero/thriller story, that is also part of an anthology. The story follows the vigilante, Crimson X, who has to join forces with cop, Robert Walker, to take down the kingpin of Orlando, who is after a mysterious artefact. My third comic is called \u003cstrong\u003eWithout Us\u003c/strong\u003e. It is a sci-fi/adventure about four alien archeologists that travel underneath the planet Utopia\u0027s surface to discover more about her past.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThese stories were inspired by cult classic movies and books.\u00a0They were made to sell at conventions such as London MCM and Stoke-Con-Trent.They are all under \u003cstrong\u003eFarpoint Comics\u003c/strong\u003e, which is a small comic house I am part of with my friends from university. All three comics are exclusively available to purchase at \u003cstrong\u003eOrbital Comics\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0in London.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have more ideas on the table at the moment that I want to get drawn in the near future. These ideas will most likely become series or split into parts. I\u0027d like to make this into a reality, and that is where you come in with your pledges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img00.deviantart.net/3389/i/2017/207/9/c/lords_of_the_sith_by_zachcobb-dbhs1eq.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNow you\u0027re probably wondering, \"What do I get out of pledging to this campaign?\" Well what if I tell you that all patrons will gain access to rewards, every month?! Now that sounds pretty awesome, doesn\u0027t it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on how much you pledge, each patron will have access to a reward tier. The more you donate per month, the higher the reward tier and the more rewards you get. But if you feel that the higher tier is expensive, you can still pledge as little as $1, per month! That\u0027s \u00a30.76! But every bit counts in the end and no matter, how much you pledge, I am truly grateful and that you\u0027re awesome people in my book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will gain access to content early than everyone else, original Photoshop files, work that is in progress includes thumbnails, sketches, illustrations and personalised artwork. Finally to top it all off, you will be able to see work that has never been released anywhere else! Note that these rewards I\u0027m planning to do now and that there will be more rewards, that I would like to do\u00a0in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s make it happen! Become a Patron today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
