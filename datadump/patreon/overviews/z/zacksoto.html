I\u0027m Zack Soto and I like to draw monsters, weirdos and more. I\u0027ve been a professional cartoonist and small press publisher for about 15 years, under the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://studygroupcomics.com/main/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eStudy Group\u003c/a\u003e banner and while I\u0027ve done a bunch \nof short stories and anthology comics, \u003ca href=\"http://studygroupcomics.com/main/category/title/secret-voice/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Secret Voice\u003c/a\u003e is \nprobably the work most people know me from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://studygroupcomics.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SV-123-Pile-3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n The \u003ca href=\"http://studygroupcomics.com/main/category/title/secret-voice/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSecret Voice\u003c/a\u003e is my version\n of an \"epic fantasy-adventure comic,\" though there are elements of \nmetaphysics, art comics, super hero fiction and science fiction to round\n it out. In The Secret Voice, the warrior-monk Dr. Galapagos races \nagainst time to stop a war, save himself, his world and everyone he \nholds dear. There\u0027s action, mysticism, kung fu, trolls, epic battles, \nand I\u0027ve built a huge world, which people have only seen a fraction of \nso far. Still to come are conspiracies, hand-to-hand mayhem, secret \nsocieties, doomed romance, betrayal, psychic showdowns, bloody \nbattlefields, and dark forces!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nSo far, there\u0027s been three print issues of the first few chapters, with another one planned for \nSummer 2017, completing \"Book One\" of the story. You can buy copies of these books \u003ca href=\"https://studygroupcomics.storenvy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere in the webstore\u003c/a\u003e, but issues 1, 2 \u0026amp; 3 are also available to read on \n\u003ca href=\"http://studygroupcomics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eStudy Group Comics\u003c/a\u003e right \nnow for free.

It\u0027s a story full of alien invasions, cyborgs, kid adventurers, family life, and great upheaval. Power Button is me channeling my love of 80s anime \u0026amp; manga, and european kids comics into one vessel. I\u0027m well into development on the first book of what will likely be three large graphic novels. I\u0027m not planning on serializing Power Button online or in print, but I will be posting sections here on Patreon as Patron-exclusive content as I work on it. \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://studygroupcomics.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sally.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIn addition to those two major comics, I\u0027m writing other pieces for people to draw, and in the beginning stages of another standalone graphic novel, and as these things progress, I\u0027ll post about them here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with that in mind, let\u0027s talk about: \u003cstrong\u003eEXCLUSIVE CONTENT!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the Secret Voice updates on \u003ca href=\"http://www.Studygroupcomics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eStudygroupcomics.com\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0027ll be running some Patreon-exclusive content here, only for my backers!
