You might have heard my music through \u003ca href=\"http://ocremix.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOverClocked ReMix\u003c/a\u003e, on an original album like \u003ca href=\"http://overclockedrecords.com/release/identity-sequence/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIdentity Sequence\u003c/a\u003e, or through \u003cstrong\u003eYouTubers \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eTwitch \u003c/strong\u003estreamers like TotalBiscuit, Sevadus, and Bacon_Donut. I\u0027ve even done my fair share of game soundtracks! I\u0027ve been making music since 2003. A lot of what I create is electronic (trance, house, dubstep, electro, etc.) but I\u0027ve also done orchestral tracks, funky jazz, ambient, rock, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you creating?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy specialty is \"\u003cstrong\u003eorganic electronic\u003c/strong\u003e\" dance music - a blend of flashy modern synths, rhythms, and ear candy, with really melodic and atmospheric elements. I often use a lot of jazzy and funky chords as well. You can hear one of my most popular original tracks, \u003cstrong\u003eAugment\u003c/strong\u003e, right here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hR9W6rOg-Es\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027m also making \u003cstrong\u003eremixes \u003c/strong\u003eof game soundtracks old and new. In the past, I\u0027ve covered games like \u003cem\u003eFinal Fantasy VI\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eVII\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eChrono Trigger\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSuper Metroid\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eTeam Fortress 2\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eCastlevania\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eLufia II\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eSmash Bros Melee\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027ve done these remixes in a \u003cstrong\u003eTON of different styles\u003c/strong\u003e, usually combining several genres.. For example, here\u0027s a remix of the sub-castle theme from \u003cem\u003eSuper Mario World\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eMonstrous Turtles\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WZeXhdVbHxI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking remixes and original tracks is extremely fun, but I always have to prioritize paid work like sound design, mixing, and mastering over \u003cstrong\u003ezircon\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0music. But through Patreon, you can \u003cstrong\u003edirectly support\u003c/strong\u003e the creation of tracks like \u003cstrong\u003eAugment\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eAcross the Ocean\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eMonstrous Turtles\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eTime to Oil Up\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003cem\u003eSuper Street Fighter IV\u003c/em\u003e), and hopefully many more like them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBasically, your support enables me to spend less time working on non-zircon projects, and \u003cstrong\u003emore time making awesome music\u003c/strong\u003e for everyone. It will also help me stay consistent with my live streams on Twitch.tv, which I\u0027m really having fun with right now and which I\u0027d love to keep doing on a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCool! What do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can support me by pledging as little as $1 for each new song or remix I make. In return, you\u0027ll get some awesome \u003cstrong\u003erewards\u003c/strong\u003e, not the least of which are instant downloads of my new material! I sincerely appreciate ANY and all support. You can of course cancel or change your pledge at any time, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEven if you \u003cstrong\u003edon\u0027t\u003c/strong\u003e pledge to this Patreon and you just watch my videos, join my live streams, and buy or stream my albums, I still really appreciate it. So THANK YOU for reading all this, and for helping me do what I love! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I change or cancel my pledge anytime?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes - Patreon makes this super easy!

If I do more than that, you\u0027ll only be charged for one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs Patreon the only way to get your stuff?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNot at all. My new music will always be made available through as many channels as possible, though some might take longer than others. Patreon is the best way to get early access to my tracks as soon as they\u0027re done, though!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
