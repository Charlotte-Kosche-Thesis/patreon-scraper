With your support, I can discover and report stories that expand your understanding of the world. Working together, we can change the world with stories. Didion so famously said \"we tell ourselves stories in order to live,\" which is true. We do. And that\u0027s what we\u0027ll be doing. We\u0027ll be telling ourselves stories in order to live new and differently shaped lives, to tramp down paths rarely taken, to celebrate people who inspire a new way of seeing or being in the world. That\u0027s why I\u0027d like your help, so we can tell stories.\u00a0"

Whether it\u2019s working as a screenwriter in Hollywood, or as a freelance journalist and essayist, he enjoys telling  stories both real and imagined. He\u2019s at his best when he jabs at humanity, drawing insights from our social foibles, our foolishness, and all our time spent \u201cfucking around.\u201d He certainly pulls no punches to himself, speaking in a confessional style, he lays out a nakedly honest experience of life. He\u2019s been called \u201csmart, funny, inventive, and insane.\u201d That\u2019s not a terribly sexy dating profile, but the combination makes for a wildly entertaining writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
