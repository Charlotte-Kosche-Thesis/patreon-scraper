I\u0027m Zo\u00eb (known as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://zoe-bug.tumblr.com\"\u003eZoeBug\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/xiexiecaptain\"\u003exiexiecaptain\u003c/a\u003e around various internet haunts.) They/them pronouns for me please!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou most likely found your way here because you\u0027re familiar with my fanfic, podfics over\u00a0 on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://zoe-bug.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/ZoeBug/pseuds/ZoeBug\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAO3\u003c/a\u003e, along with the occasional song or craft project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently a graduate student beginning my master\u0027s program in creative writing.\u00a0Because I deal with a variety of disability symptoms, it\u0027s hard for me to hold down a traditional job with traditional hours. Since I already spend much of my time making lots of things that many people seem to enjoy, I thought perhaps Patreon could help me be able to spend more time working on these projects without negative financial consequences!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the things I do, whether it\u0027s one shots or multi-chapter fanfiction or recorded version of fanfiction or any other number of things I make, you can pledge as little as one dollar or as much as you desire to support me and my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will this work be? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriting\u003c/strong\u003e: I plan on continuing to write a variety of fanfiction for lots of different fandoms and pairings, including to continue work on and finish my Jean/Marco fanfiction \"Cutting Shapes.\" \u003cbr\u003eAlso, I do original fiction and poetry and have posted things on my tumblr like short stories centering on diversity of trans experiences, and poetry about mental illness and queer love. I\u0027d love to write more of those!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudio\u003c/strong\u003e: I record a lot of podfics! One-shots and multichapter fanfics, alike. I\u0027ve recorded long fics from the SNK fandom like Ghost Story, Keep That Breathless, Audacity, and I\u0027m working my way through recording others like All The Stars In Texas and all your demons and desires and dark sides. If I were to be funded here, I would be able to work on those more often as I wouldn\u0027t have to worry about sacrificing time that could be spent on potential paying jobs since the time would be supported.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis support would allow me to spend more time on these works without the stress and toll on my mental health imposed by more hours at a traditional job. If you enjoy my work and would like to see more of it or more often, supporting me here, regardless of how much, would allow me to do that! There\u0027ll also be some special rewards for patrons such as special previews, updates, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me be clear, I do these things because I love them. I don\u0027t only write or record to get paid. Whether or not I am funded, I\u0027ll continue to do work on these kind of projects. But monetary support for these kinds of things means that I will be able to spend more time on them and put out more content.\u003cstrong\u003e No content will ever be withheld from non-patrons\u003c/strong\u003e because of this. However, patrons at the $3 or more level will get previews or early access to work. And those above that level will have the chance to have me write or record something specifically at their request!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll keep working hard at the things I love and I hope that I will be able to return your support with the things I create."
