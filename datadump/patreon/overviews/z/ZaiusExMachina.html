Here is where you will find reviews of the latest movies in the show called \"Please don\u0027t make a scene\".\u003cbr\u003eFor some of the cuff opinions about movies and the movie industry, there is the \"Please don\u0027t make a livestream\"... well, livestream.\u003cbr\u003eThere is also \"The script doctors\" podcast. once a month, me and my co-host take a look at the disease that is Hollywood, and try to fix it. One movie, or franchise at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eall this content takes a lot of time to produce, even in the scaled down format I use, and because I have a regular 9-5 job I only have time to create on the weekends and the occasional weeknight. That and the fact that, despite my poignant critique, I still buy my own movie tickets means that I cannot create content on the level I want, and that my followers deserve.\u003cbr\u003ethat\u0027s why you\u0027re reading this. You\u0027re probably here because you\u0027ve seen some of my stuff, and you enjoyed it enough to sneak a peek at my patreon. Then, maybe you would actually consider contributing to the cause and help me create better content for you to enjoy."
