The move here has been transformational.\u00a0 Learning to live authentically and openly in another environment, another culture, and within an occupied nation struggling to survive against great powers, has opened my heart and my eyes in new and powerful ways. I have always been connected, at a soul level, to the Earth and the community of life she sustains, but Hawai\u0027i has provided an empowered framework to explore that connection.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver my many years here, my love for the Earth, for the \u0027\u0100ina, has integrated with who I am, and I\u0027m compelled from the deepest sources to express that appreciation through the channels of photography and poetry.\u00a0 I do hope my art improves our world, but I\u0027m doing this because it \u003cem\u003egives me Life\u003c/em\u003e - because I do not understand\u00a0how to live as part of the manifested miracle that is Planet Earth without expressing gratitude, creatively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe secret of the universe is \u003cem\u003ethe infinity of beings learning to live in balance\u003c/em\u003e. If your life is enhanced by my creativity, consider balancing that exchange of Life \u0026amp; Energy.\u00a0Suggested ways would be to become a Patron of my work and to share my page and work with others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll support I receive through this Creator Page will go to two purposes: \u003cbr\u003e1) investing in resources that allow me to increase the quality and quantity of my poetry and photography\u003cbr\u003e2) supporting other Patreon Artists (maybe even you!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport me, and I will support our world through\u00a0Art and\u00a0other\u00a0Artists.\u00a0 This is the synergy of Love \u0026amp; Life on Earth. I invite you to participate.\u00a0 A more creative, grateful and vital Life is right here, right now. Together,\u003cem\u003e let\u0027s make that true.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
