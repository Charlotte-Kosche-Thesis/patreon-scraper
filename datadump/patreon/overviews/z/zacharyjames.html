Us.\u003cbr\u003eI create to explore what we have forgotten, what we remember, what we lost, what we\u2019ve gained. Where we have been and where we are going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been creating since I was a kid. It has always been my dream. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, several years ago, I shelved the full-time pursuit of that dream to commit myself to my family. A classic choice for many artists at some point in their lives, and a choice I was glad to make. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I never entirely gave up the dream. I have continued to write songs, perform and release music as often as I am able. And now, a series of life events has taught me that I CAN have both and not shelve that dream. There is a lot of music and lyrics rolling around in this head. It needs to get out and I would love to share it with you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am, will you join me? Great! Let\u0027s make some music and play some shows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
