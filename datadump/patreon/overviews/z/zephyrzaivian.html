    "summary": "Creating is hard. Being creative is hard. At least, that\u0027s how it\u0027s become for me. I may not do much anymore, but if there are people out there who want to help a person like me, then I am truly thankful. I figured a Patreon page was worth an attempt, all the cool kids are doing it. And hey, you could get to see some of the scribbles I never release (which is a lot).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll do my best to provide you all content. I know I\u0027ve not been the best with that lately, but. We\u0027ll see how this goes. I maybe change up how this works, I\u0027m new to it. I may only run this for a short time, but I will make sure that people get their rewards as I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease be aware, that I post things from human art, pony art, furry art, weird stuff. But if you knew me, I hope you already know what you\u0027re in for!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, as I am new to this, and kind of oblivious as to how it works, I set it to pay out per drawing. I don\u0027t know if it works that way with the tiers I have, but maybe it\u0027ll motivate me to draw at least one big thing. I will still post sketches and WIPs! Which is what a majority of my art is, haha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this page and considering me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is currently on hiatus. I am unsure if I will ever use it again.

I contribute to communities I\u0027m in as much as I can. I try my best to help people, provide them with art, and writings, whatever I can. I may not be the best, or do much, but I try my best.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not the most healthy person. I\u0027ve been fighting awful doctors and several health issues for years. These issues have become a big part of my life, but not in a positive way. My state has been declining steadily for awhile now. Chances are, you don\u0027t see me as much, or at all anymore.
