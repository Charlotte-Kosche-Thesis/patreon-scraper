    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m Zeta of ZetaPlays.  I mostly make Let\u0027s Plays, but I also \noccasionally make music, most often chiptune.  I also made a really \ncrappy game, and more to the name, the Wheel of Crap by which I choose \nmy games I play at random.  I\u0027ve been on a quest to play all NES, \nGENESIS and SNES games since May 2008, and will continue until every \nsingle game has been played.  But that\u0027s not what this patreon is \nabout!  That stuff\u0027s gonna exist either way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe primary focus of\n this patreon is an idea I\u0027ve had for a long time now, that I hope to do\n someday.  I call it THE GREAT LET\u0027S PLAY EXPEDITION.  It will be a \njourney across the country to meet up with fellow gamers I\u0027ve come to \nknow on the internet and will never otherwise meet (and maybe some more \nwell known people too if they\u0027d like in on the adventure when it \nhappens!), to hang out with them a bit, and play their favorite \nmultiplayer game.  I\u0027ll record it all in bursts, the trip, the hanging \nout, and the games I play with each person, and then bring it all back \nto the internet to share the adventure with everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m already\n set to do this, except for one pesky detail:  I\u0027ve got a shitty full \ntime job that destroys me, and while I\u0027m reliant on it for money, I\u0027m \nnot exactly looking to lose it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u0027s where this patreon \ncomes in!  If I manage to net enough golds that this can support me, I \nwill quit my job entirely and begin plans to set the adventure in motion\n immediately.  On top of that, having more free time would mean more \nfrequent and predictable streams, more creative output that has \notherwise been fizzled out by work (meaning more macots for the wheel \nand more music and such), more time to play games with people online, \nall sorts of more and better Zeta experiences all around!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut \neven in the much more likely scenario where we don\u0027t come anywhere near \nthat amount, the money acquired from this patreon will still be of \nsignificant help to the expedition in the future!  Someday, I\u0027ll likely \nend up quitting or losing my job anyway, though it will likely be years \nfrom now, and the money I get from this will be saved up until that time\n - ensuring that when it does happen, I\u0027ll have the cash I need to go on\n the adventure before having to look for another.  I\u0027m gonna make it \nhappen one way or another!  It would just be a far superior experience \nfor everyone if we manage to make miracles happen - not to mention, we \ncould do it more than once, we could even make it a yearly thing, or \nsmaller and more frequent trips instead of just one giant megatrip!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think this sounds as awesome as me, help support yet another insane quest in the history of ZetaPlays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if you have any ideas for other milestones or rewards or something that won\u0027t break the anti-trust of 100% free content for all, let me know!\u00a0 I\u0027ll consider adding other stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the jumpstarted first 48 hours, I have come to represent our progress with the Star Pieces of Mario RPG.\u00a0 Help me reach for the stars, and open the Star Road that will take me to distant lands!\u00a0 As the milestones say, everyone who helped reach a star will be immortalized within it.\u00a0 I\u0027ll be working on this flash over time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://wheelofcrap.com/stars/starway.swf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://wheelofcrap.com/stars/starway.swf\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
