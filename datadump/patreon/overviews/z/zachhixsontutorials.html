    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Zach, and since 2010 I have been making videos that help teach people how to get started in 3D modeling, Visual Effects, and Programming using various methods and software.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in 2010 when I started, there weren\u0027t a lot of videos that were well produced, and most of the narration sounded like it was from somebody coming off the effects anesthesia. Trying to learn software like Blender3D this way was pretty miserable, and while there were a few exceptions with channels like BlenderGuru, it still felt like there was a hole that needed to be filled, and I set out to help fill it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started YouTube, I didn\u0027t do it to become \"YouTube famous,\" or to make tons of money like Ray William Johnson or SMOSH (because they were big back in 2010) I did it because I wanted to help people learn. I never thought I would have more than 50 subscribers much less the amount I have today! Every comment of someone saying that my videos helped them learn, or posting their work that they created with the help of my videos always fills me with a ton of energy and reminds me why I love to do this so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, no matter how much you like something, logistics always manage to wiggle their way in between you and it. As my life has moved from sleeping through high-school with no job and no car to pay for, to College, part-time job, freelance work, and bills to pay, time where I am not doing one of those things is hard to come by. While I will still always make videos, I have to prioritize paying jobs over YouTube largely due to the fact that I barely make anything from ad-sense as is, and as more people start to use programs like ad-block, the income from YouTube has dwindled from nothing, to zero.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is not to become rich, but to get back to doing what I love to do: helping people learn, while hopefully being able to do it even better than before. With extra funding, I would be able to dedicate more time to the channel, live modeling streams, better equipment, and most of all more content at a higher quality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you choose to support me on this platform or not, I hope you enjoy the content none the less and learn from it as much as possible, and as always: See you next time!\u003cbr\u003e"
