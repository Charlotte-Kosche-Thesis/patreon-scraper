    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eHi amazing people! \u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf this is your first time checking this out...here\u0027s the thing..\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI create multiple songs, videos, and do live streams many times throughout the year. Most of my content is either here:\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF_elVVtPLXyV9x992QFWig\"\u003eZachNelsonVEVO\u003c/a\u003e or here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.younow.com/ZachNelsonMusic/channel\"\u003eZachNelsonMusicYouNow\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you would like to help support me in the creation of my new music, videos, production, or even my merchandise... this is your chance. You\u0027ll also receive some really cool things for helping out (see below for reward tiers).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the last few years I\u0027ve been putting all of my time, energy, and resources into creating content for you all. Wether it\u0027s been new music, cover songs on Youtube, or live streams on YouNow I have been putting my heart and soul into it all. The reason I am asking for your guys support is that I have reached a point in my career where I can no longer move forward doing music full time unless I have you guys all supporting me. (content costs a lot of money to produce \u0026amp; I can\u0027t use the money I live on to support all the content I want to produce for you.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you know as much as I love creating I have a lot of trouble trying to bring in the funds on a day to day basis to continue to pursue music in the way I really want to! Here\u0027s the amazing thing about it though... YOU are the solution! Without you, I\u0027m honestly nothing. I\u0027m working really hard to be able to make a living and move out while doing music as a full time job. For this reason I could really use your help. Without you I\u0027d have to start working a normal 9 to 5 job and stop creating music and content for you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHere\u0027s where your money will be going:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) The first thing it will go towards is paying my monthly expenses such as rent, car insurance, phone bill, and all that other crazy stuff. Over the last few years I\u0027ve found many ways to make this work from month to month, but honestly the stress of not knowing if I\u0027ll have the month to pay the bills each month can be rather distracting when it comes to creating content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Your support will help me to be able to grow the music career we have already started to establish. Like hitting number 7 on the Pop Charts on iTunes and charting in 13 countries on the day of my last release... Yeah that wouldn\u0027t be possibly without you guys!! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis really comes down to all of us being a family and doing this thing together. I\u0027m so thankful for every single one of you guys who supports me and my music. You guys are the reason I am able to continue to release new music and new videos, and I honestly feel so blessed and thankful to have your support and backing. Wether its $1 or $500 dollars your support will help more than you could ever know!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I saw this idea somewhere so I\u0027m using it lol: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALSO...don\u0027t forget, you will get cool things in return...scroll down to see what you get :) We can always change, adjust or add anything to these tiers. We can keep tweaking this thing as we go. If anybody comes up with a brilliant idea on what to include we can ADD it.\u003cbr\u003e"
