    "summary": "In the comment section of my videos you can find some of the nicest, kindest people ever - every day they make my life just that little bit brighter, infusing me with strength to face another day with a smile on my face!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Now, as if that weren\u0027t support enough, a few of these kind people have been asking me to create a patreon account, too...\u00a0It\u0027s been happening for quite some time now and, honestly, I\u0027ve just been too prideful to make one until now! But sometimes you have to swallow your pride and admit that you could use some help, so here\u0027s my patreon account, finally. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Truth is, money is tight. There\u0027s always food and a roof over our heads, and that\u0027s the important part, but we\u0027re constantly scraping by... and that affects my channel, of course.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0YouTube is not my actual job, I don\u0027t earn all that much from it, and it is therefore hard to justify spending a lot on it (as much as I\u0027d like to). Replacing equipment, mailing giveaways, opening a PO box- they\u0027re all expenses that I can\u0027t take on at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve created this patreon account as a\u00a0\"savings account\" for my YouTube channel.\u00a0It\u0027ll help me cover unexpected YouTube-related expenses that may arise, and the money raised is to be put aside for a rainy day (I don\u0027t plan on touching it until something actually is needed).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe money would be used for:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Replacing equipment in case it\u0027s ever necessary;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd if eventually possible, I\u0027d love to:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Rent a PO box so I can receive and answer your letters;\u003cbr\u003e- Organize giveaways and other fun stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, I\u0027d love to hear your suggestions for what you think we should do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e A little ending note:\u00a0\u00a0If you have a couple of bucks to spare, you like my channel, and would like to help me keep it up and running at full speed, then I hope you can consider becoming one of my patrons! I\u0027d be forever grateful, really.\u00a0That being said,\u00a0I definitely don\u0027t want your money if you are in need of it yourself, so PLEASE please please don\u0027t go out of your way to help me, either! What\u0027s the point of me being a little better off, if that means you\u0027ll be a little worse off?\u00a0\u00a0I know what a difference a bit of spare change can make, so I\u0027d much rather you keep that money for yourself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yeah, that\u0027s about it I think... Sorry I rambled so much. :P\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to read this, whether or not you decide to become a patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a beautiful day!!! xx\u003cbr\u003eIn\u00eas/zmashd\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
