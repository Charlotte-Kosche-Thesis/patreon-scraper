    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e2174 AD. Five years ago, a shipwrecked cosmonaut from the exploratory mission Novy Mir documented the flora of an unknown planet in quadrant NQ3 while waiting for a rescue team. Her notes and drawings were found inside a charred capsule adrift in the Arctic Ocean. The scientific community, awed by what she discovered, has been attempting to decode her jumbled words and complex diagrams ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://biorequiem.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AlienBotanyFabric1s21.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cosmonaut\u2019s specimen-documentation took on many forms. From sketches to sculpture, she used whatever materials had survived the crash. Reconstruction is ongoing in laboratories worldwide.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlien Botany\u003c/strong\u003e is an ongoing concept series of hyper-detailed drawings, fine art prints, and capsule fashion collections, with the long-term goal of a coffee table book and an exhibition featuring large models in an Alien Botany garden. I have all these ideas bubbling in my imagination and finally, after years of spreading myself too thin between too many projects (as the hulking bio column on the left demonstrates), I have the time to devote to an expansive art project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://biorequiem.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0628s21.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy portfolio website, complete with all \u003cstrong\u003eAlien Botany\u003c/strong\u003e progress and other art-centric updates, can be found at \u003ca href=\"http://www.ZoeticaEbb.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eZoeticaEbb.com\u003c/a\u003e.

This is where, in addition to my artwork, I share my photography, writing, style, and crunchy tidbits of culture. I used to be a more frequent blogger, but, as with my artwork, time constraints have been keeping me from making this the lively port of information and inspiration it could be. I\u2019d love to blog regularly, but continue to run into the same dilemma \u2013 finite time.\u00a0I run out of it because I freelance to make money \u2013 a distraction which I would like to reduce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do per-creation payments work?\u003c/strong\u003e Funds arecollectedonly when I finish a new drawing, or complete a different type of project \u2013 a photos series, blog post, fashion release, and so on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I really afford to be a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e Yes! You have the option to fix a monthly payment limit in your \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/settings\"\u003eaccount settings\u003c/a\u003e. You will not go over this limit unless you change your preferences, so pledge with total confidence.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe thing about Patreon I respond to the most (besides the obvious benefit of getting to do what I love) is the idea of cultivating a circle of allies-in-vision. It\u0027s part old-school patronage we can actually afford and part art coven, with a secret blog, special stuff, tangible snail mail and occasional face time. It\u0027s mutual motivation and encouragement and a moonlit harbor in the murky fog of creative seclusion. I\u0027m delighted by all of it and hope you\u2019ll join me on this adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://biorequiem.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0639s21.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
