    "summary": "What is up guys and gals!?!?!? Ok, so some of you may be wondering what the hell this whole Patreon thing is. Well, basically Patreon is the coolest/easiest way or you to support the content creators you love the most!!!!! First off, Patreon is 100% optional and your level of contribution to the Patreon is 100% on YOUR terms and based solely off of how much YOU want to contribute. There are no minimums and no standards for \"donations\". Basically, Patreon is a way for you to pledge a certain dollar amount to content creators per video whether it\u0027s $1 or $100. For example, I upload my videos for my subscribers ever Tuesday and Thursday. If you become a \"Patron\" to my channel and say you will pledge $1 per video uploaded with a monthly cap of $5 then every month you will donate a total of $5 even though I upload 8 videos a month. I am solely creating this account to benefit the channel (i.e. bike parts/repairs and most of all funding a few trips I have planned this year to attend some of the big meetups going on ) and will NEVER be used for anything other than that. I hope you guys continue to enjoy my channel and I can\u0027t wait to see where this next year takes us ONLY 17k more subscribers until we join the 100k club WOOOOHOOO!!!! I love you guys and stay safe, PEEEEEACE!!!"

I will run bimonthly polls exclusively for my Patrons to find out what you guys want the funds to used for the most. You guys are the reason the money is there......why shouldn\u0027t you have a say in what happens with it???\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Everyone who becomes a Patron to the channel no matter how big or small the donation will receive exclusive access to 1 unlisted \"private\" motovlog each month. You all are here and supporting because you love the content so I think you all deserve a little something extra :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Also, each Patron will receive a free ZJ decal shipping to them once they become a Patron to the channel as a way for me to say thank ya aaaaaaaall so much!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Ok, so you already got an exclusive motovlog.........so why not a monthly Patron exclusive 1hr livestream where we can all get together and interact??? There will never be a set time or date set for the stream within each month because I will ask all of my Patrons each and every month what time/dates work best for everyone that way as many of you can attend as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Last but not least, Patron exclusive post here on the Patreon site. Obviously since we are all gathered up here on Patreon and we can post for one and all to see it would only make sense for there to be some interaction on my Patreon Profile as well........right???\u00a0",
