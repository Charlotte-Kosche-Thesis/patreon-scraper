Our weapons were the fundamental forces of the universe itself, concepts your species can barely begin to understand. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCarved quanta, shaped into blades met shimmering super-string shields, while whole galaxies fell into ravening black holes and gods themselves died in the millions, but still, the Destroyer was only slowed. Finally, as an act of ultimate sacrifice, my good friend Cosnot flew his diamond lattice-ship into the Infinite Manifold. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a single instant, the universe was seared into atoms but the cycle of the Destroyer ended.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd for fourteen billion years, a single atom of my original form wafted through space. Around this atom, the planet you know as Earth formed. For millions of years, it waited. Until, at long last, it was inhaled by a young boy who had gotten his head trapped in a playground set.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the playground was disassembled by emergency response workers, my atom settled in the child\u0027s fore-brain, gifting him with an unusually active imagination. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, David Colby uses this great power to write trashy novels with lots of lasers, robots and explosions.",
