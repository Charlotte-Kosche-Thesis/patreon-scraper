I have found, however, that even though I\u2019m writing and publishing\nregularly, and am making money to pay my bills, I require a little extra to\nhelp me run my business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis brings me to my reason for joining Patreon.\nAs any entrepreneur knows, growing a business is expensive. However, I have set\ngoals for that, and I am pleased to offer you, my ardent supporter, this\nopportunity to be more intimately involved with me and my books. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have two goals for business expenses: I hope to\nraise $500 to purchase a domain name and webhosting. I will set aside monies from what I\nreceive from Patrons, in the hopes that next year, I can make that purchase. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also hope to raise $500 to use for advertising.\nThose funds will be used for ads on Amazon and Facebook, and to pay for flyers, teaser booklets, and other swag to take to Cleveland-area author events.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get in exchange for being\nmy patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eAt the\n$1.00 per month level\u003c/strong\u003e, you will get first access to all blog posts, which I\nwill post here a day or two before I post on my blog. This will include an\nexpanded version of my Thursday\u2019s 300 posts, which means that where everyone\nelse gets a tidbit of my work in progress, you will receive a chapter or more\nevery week, and my new Writer\u2019s Journal posts. Writer\u2019s Journal is a new\nfeature I am implementing at Austen Promises, and it\u2019s just what the name\nimplies: a journal entry, one per week, in which I reflect on my\nself-publishing journey. You will also receive my entire backlist as PDF\ncopies. Please email me at \u003ca href=\"mailto:zoeburtonauthor@outlook.com\"\u003ezoeburtonauthor@outlook.com\u003c/a\u003e\n to get your copies. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eAt the\n$5.00 per month level\u003c/strong\u003e, you will receive all the above PLUS a digital copy\nof every new release AND an opportunity to help me name original characters.\nYou will be credited for your assistance in the acknowledgements of the book\nwhen it is published.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eAt the $10\nper month level\u003c/strong\u003e, you will receive all the above, PLUS digital copies of my\nentire backlist.
