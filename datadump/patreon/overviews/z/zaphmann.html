If there\u0027s a big issue, I start having ideas and modelling how to understand it, so it can be fixed. If there is a blank slate, I\u0027ll begin to transform it into art. I look at a wall, or a floor or foliage and see images; if I close my eyes I see thousands of people one by one, animals I can animate; I dream concepts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u003c/strong\u003e are the potential patrons that can provide the blank canvas, the open time, you can free me to create without insecurity.

Imagine all that quiescent work let loose in new brains! I see them updated into new applications and \u0027apps\u0027, plus made free for all in the creative commons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always needed to be active in both primary brain aspects (at school I was always top in art and mathematics), but painting, writing and pioneering music don\u0027t pay well (yet). \u003cbr\u003eTo make this all work, I need patrons: That\u0027s * You *\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron you\u0027ll get first release of all my digital output, special gifts of artwork, invites and more, but most importantly you\u0027ll be directly supporting me, and although Patreon isn\u0027t yet designed for multi-faceted campaigns, I\u0027m setting up separate links so that you can support the one or two things you know me for, or the whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou always get to control how much you commit to and can stop/change it easily\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
