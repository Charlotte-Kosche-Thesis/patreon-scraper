     "about": "HI!, and just like that let\u0027s get into what I can do for you if you want to support me. I LOVE ART!!! NOW HOLD ON, hear me out. By the time I hit my sophomore year of high school I discovered my love for drawing. After I made an Instagram art page, got comments saying they \"loved my art.\" and doing a lot of research. I realized this is something I want to do for the rest of my life, producing content for people that they\u0027ll love. For a long time now I\u0027ve been producing content on YouTube which i\u0027m pretty sure we\u0027re all aware is the most popular video sharing website on the web. Now even though I have a couple complaints about YouTube content ID system it is a wonderful website for content creators like me to express them self and show people what they have created. Now let\u0027s just get into what I create and if it sounds like something you like to help support :). I\u0027m going to start with what i make that gets tons of attention on my channel, but that i\u0027m not the proudest of because it\u0027s not to hard to make. My friends and I every week react to anime episodes, it either being older popular anime or the latest episodes of anime that have just came out. Reactions are pretty easy for me to make, but my fans love them so I get them out there as much as I can. If you support me and become a patreon member, I can easily take anime request for my friends and I to watch and react to :). The next thing I like to talk about that are pretty easy to make \u00a0are the podcast I make. I have a podcast with my friends and I called the WeebTrash Podcast, where we talk about almost anything really\u0026gt; We do end to discuss popular and recent topics and trends stretching from the latest Marvel and DC movies to political debates. As for what I can do for you if you become a patreon member, well honestly no a lot the best I can do is have you suggest a topic for a podcast and we can talk about it, or maybe we can get you to join a podcast one day :P. \u00a0The Reviews I make are what i\u0027m proud of, I put a lot of effort and editing in my reviews, and if you support me I\u0027ll take any anime review request if you have any.\u00a0",
