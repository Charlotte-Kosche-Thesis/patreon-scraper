    "summary": "I\nremember the day as if it were only a few months ago roughly before\nChristmas, my manager told me \u201cYou no longer have a job, I\u0027m\nsorry.\u201d\u003cbr\u003eI looked at him with a tear in my eye and choked \u201cThank\nyou.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes!\nI lost my job, which is fantastic because it means I can give what I\nlove doing the good ol\u0027 college try. After the first month of\nrealising that everyone and their mum is a professional artist and\nthat the jobs are like the public toilets at a festival, I decided\nthat striking off on my own is the most exhilarating option. So on\nthe recommendation of my housemate, from now on known as \u201cThe\nCostume Designer\u201d, I have joined Patreon to write!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nam a script writer and performer, with circus and cabaret being my\ndiscipline, but I do keep creeping back to musical theatre.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\nlike to write mainly about delusion, dreams and dystopia. Exploring\nand revelling in the decadence of nihilism. I do also have a bright\nside, believe it or not, and I show it through acceptance and growth\nin my characters. Most of my current inspiration comes from gender\nroles, teenage development and sociological structures that follow us\ninto adulthood, human relationships, and the bloody housing market.\n\u003cbr\u003eAs\nI write scripting, I like to create a backdrop for characters in\nshort stories, to discover the ins and outs of them as a person.\nAlong with characterisation I write short stories for inspiration and\nto keep my writing fresh.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy\nreasons for joining Patreon is to be able to fund my work on it\u0027s own\nsteam, to gain patrons enabling me to survive as I create, and as I\nsee it, I would prefer to spend my time writing something worth\nreading and getting paid by the people, rather than filling in forms\nthat have no entertainment value at all and get paid by the people\n(via centrelink and the people of Australias money). Oh and to buy a printer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your\npatronage, \u003cem\u003eyou beautiful beautiful little honey suckles\u003c/em\u003e, you will be\nable to see my work before it hits the stage or work that won\u0027t make\nit to the stage, you will be able to read the back stories and\ndevelopment of characters, see sketches of set, costume and character\ndesign, videos of development, participate in collaborations, and\nconversations. With each month there will be a \u201clink into me\u201d\nwith hang out sessions and song lists offered to very particular\npatrons that give an insight into my practice and inspirations at the\ntime, or even secret hints of upcoming work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for\nyour patronage in advance and I look forward to tugging at your heart\nstrings, welling joy in your chest, or throwing a bucket of ice water at\nyou... which ever comes first.\u003cbr\u003e"
