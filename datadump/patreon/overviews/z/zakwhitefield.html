As I have found from my experiences\nmaking a living from music can be a challenge and all this travelling and the\ncost of a roof over your head is even more challenging.  I am using the Patreon Platform as a way to\nget my music out to a greater more dedicated fan base and at the same time be\nable to survive and continue to be able to offer what I love to others in a\nsustainable way.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
