I am a huge fan of media and I want to share my love of media with you. For the past seven years, I have run a webshow called the Media Meltdown, where I review, analyze, and give my opinion on various different forms of media, from books to video games, anime to films, television shows to manga. While there are many other reviewers out there, my show was created to promote media that I like and introduce new audiences to good media. There are too many negative critics out there and my show is created to showcase the positive instead. Here is one of my best videos, so you can get an idea of exactly what it is that I do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinal Fantasy 1 Retrospective:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXVBGg7X38Y\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eIn addition, I am not hiding my content behind a paywall.

I want to get better equipment to improve the quality of the show and to expand the audience of my show greatly. If people continue to donate to the show, I will be able to donate my full time and effort to this show and truly make it great. In the end, I hope to be able to produce videos as a full time job and I can only do that with your help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI do so appreciate the support and love all the well wishes from my \naudience and I encourage the feedback!
