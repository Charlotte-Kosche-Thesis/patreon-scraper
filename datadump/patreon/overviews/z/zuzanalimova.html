    "summary": "Hi lovely patron, \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for visiting my Patreon site and\nthus considering supporting my work. I want you to know that I really\nappreciate it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWorking on my movie \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0027Before I Met You\u0027\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e has truly changed my life. I didn\u0027t realise that my graduation\nfilm covering the daily routine in Slovak maternity wards would stir so much\nemotion and controversy. Shortly after its release, the film caused a national\nscandal. We had to face a daily onslaught of critical media coverage,\ncensorship and even threatening messages, trying to silence us and the films\nscreenings. As a result, the Slovak premiere of \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2018\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eBefore I Met You\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2019\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e was sold out within a few short\nhours. It was and still is a whirlwind. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nToday we are proud to say that\nour film has given voice to hundreds if not thousands of women and men with similar\ntraumatic experiences from Slovak maternity wards. But thanks to social upheaval\nand subsequent public pressure, the Ministry of Healthcare announced a new\npolicy of positive changes that will be implemented in Slovak hospitals. These\nwill lead to more dignified and respectful care for mothers and their children\nin Slovakia.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am\nproud to say, that my film has been screened\nin many other countries as well, including Romania, Czech republic, Italy and\nCroatia. We continue to receive invitations from all over the world to screen\nthe documentary further, as well as host discussions about the many very\nimportant issues addressed in the film. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, considering that \u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0027Before I Met You\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e was a diploma film, it also left me without any\nbudget to travel to the screenings and speaking engagements.  Many of the events I get invited to aren\u0027t\nable to cover any of my expenses, as they are organised by local festivals,\neducational institutions and mothers\u0027 centres. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt simply is not doable for me, especially with having no regular income and raising\na small child.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShould you feel inspired to donate to my cause,\nyour money will help me to cover my expenses and travel to the various screening\nand discussions of my \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0027Before I Met You\u0027\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003efilm.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for stopping by and considering\nto support me.
