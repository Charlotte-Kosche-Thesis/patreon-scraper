    "summary": "Greetings to all, I am Zen-Shaori and I\u2019m an independent\nanimator who works hard making animated shorts with quality and dedication, my\npassion is to create this type of \"art\" through my YouTube channel,\nit is my passion, my goal is not to be a\nYoutuber, I use the page to publish my creations, to make myself known to the\nworld, to see my abilities, I\u2019m not a professional, nor am I taking courses nor\nam I attending art classes to do cartoons, but with independent practice I\naspire to be a professional, a great teacher, and what a great way to learn by\ndrawing and practicing every day doing art. My\nmain goal is to have my own animation studio with sophisticated and updated\ntools to help me create a more fluid animation with more quality and clarity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCurrently I have made several animated videos and each\none is better than the previous one, even so, I do not consider them a success\nnor the greatest creation, I consider that I have to improve every day and I\nknow that the animations that I make last their months of being published, and\nthe reason for this is for 2 reasons mainly:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe first is that obviously doing animation is not easy,\nI work alone (for the moments) and I dedicate myself to make the sketches, the\nanimation simulation, then the LineArt, the colored, shaded, background scene\nwith its textured, effects ,\nand finally the rendering of the video with editing, then, this whole process\ntakes up to 1 or 2 weeks depending on how simple or how much sequence is\ncarried in a single scene, it is not easy and you have to have a lot of\npatience to be able do\nall this alone, still I do not complain because it\u0027s my job and it\u0027s something\nI like to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow to the problem with the second reason and are my\ncurrent tools and the situation that I am going through in my life, every day\nthe technology grows and the old is obsolete in such a way that incompatibility\narrives and / or have unexpected technical problems, the\nslowness of a pc that previously worked like a wonder 5 years ago, programs are\nasking for more updates every day more graphics performance and more memory so\nthe development of new technologies is overwhelmingly constant. In\naddition, every human being should eat to be able to live or stay in a stable\nsituation, yes, and this is solved with a second job either in the city, but\nfor my current situation this seems too insufficient due to the national crisis\nin\nwhich I live, the need to buy a component or a better PC is made impossible by\nissues of inflation and currency devaluation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have created a Patreon account for this reason, as a\nnecessary help to support by independent artists and artists like me, who need\nfinancial support based on donations, THIS IS NOT OLDER, is only voluntary so\nthat we can continue to do what the more I\nget passionate and turn it into a profession.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEvery month I will be showing updates of my new projects\nas \"animated sketches\" rather I know many love my Fan Animated\nShantae (as many prefer my short animated Shantae for the dedication and\nloyalty of art with the official video game of WayForward).If\nyou like my fans videos of Shantae so I can gladly bring more and even better\nquality of animation!! \u003cstrong\u003eSUPPORTS\nTHE CAUSE, BECOME THE CHOSEN ONE AND SHOW ME YOU ARE FAITHFUL TO SHANTAE ENOUGH TO MAKE HER YOUR WAIFU!!\u003c/strong\u003e without much problem because you surely coming here\nfor that, so go and support me, even in the few a lot it works for me, helps\nthis artist to grow big, because no one grows without help from his fans.\u00a0 =D\u003cbr\u003e"
