I don\u0027t have many expectations out of this patreon, but a couple readers have suggested it to me as an option for readers to give a little back, and get a little in return. Thank you for stopping by, and feel to free to reach out with any questions or comments!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my personal work, I tend towards queer pairings (mostly F/F) and I am\n especially happy to create scenes with non-binary or \ngender-non-comforming characters. Some of my favorite series are \u003cstrong\u003eFire Emblem\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ePersona\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eFinal Fantasy 14\u003c/strong\u003e\n (and others!) and many of the usual big-hitter JRPGs. But I\u2019m fairly \nknowledgeable about video games and anime in general, and my greatest \npleasure is creating something from an obscure series or pairing that \nhasn\u2019t gotten its due. So please don\u2019t let my list of works on AO3 \nconstrain you, that\u2019s really just the beginning!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to read more of my stuff, you can find it all over the place!\u003cbr\u003eMy website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.bespokesmut.com\"\u003ehttp://www.bespokesmut.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy AO3 profile: \u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/ZoeGMiller/\"\u003ehttp://archiveofourown.org/users/ZoeGMiller/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy tumblr: \u003ca href=\"http://zoegmiller.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehttp://zoegmiller.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy stuff on Amazon: \n\u003ca href=\"http://amazon.com/author/zoemiller\"\u003ehttp://amazon.com/author/zoemiller\u003c/a\u003e\n               \u003cbr\u003eInfo on commissioning me! \u003ca href=\"https://zoegmiller.wordpress.com/commissions/\"\u003ehttps://zoegmiller.wordpress.com/commissions/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently have it set to \"$X per written piece,\" which I prefer because it\u0027s more concrete than a monthly pledge (I wouldn\u0027t want anyone to feel taken advantage of during months where I have low inspiration or am overwhelmed with other work). You can also set a max dollar amount per month, so please feel free to cap your pledge at whatever monthly rate you feel comfortable with.
