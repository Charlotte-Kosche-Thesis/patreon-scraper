My finished projects will be free and open to the public, but for $4 a month, you get a behind the scenes look. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis includes updates on top secret projects that just aren\u0027t ready for the public. For a dollar a week, you get to see it first, sometimes months in advance. You\u0027ll also get a collection of paper prototypes of everything I want to build over the next year, and a weekly update on how all of my top secret projects are going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also talk with others who\u0027ve pledged and drive what direction my research should take, essentially forming a secret society of badass project managers. I work for you, and if there\u0027s something you\u0027re passionate about, I just might be able to help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat kinds of things have I built in the past? I created a wearable light-based weapon that debuted on the Emmy-nominated documentary, \"Superheroes\", and successfully brought a wearable solar generator project to Kickstarter. In 2014, I helped design and build a prototype segmented armored vest for emergency workers with a former soldier and a costuming expert. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy most recent job was as Hacker-in Residence at a major Chinese engineering university, where I researched ways to remove volatile organic compounds from the air using hydroponically grown plants. At Beijing Mini-Maker Faire 2015, I unveiled my prototype chewing gum that makes you smarter, temporarily anyway. Over the past few months, I worked with incredible women and men in Beijing to co-found the feminist makerspace Q-Space, which has been a phenomenal success. I\u0027ll be speaking at The Eleventh HOPE this July in New York.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy previous bosses have included a professor, the director of a hackerspace, a millionaire and even an armored vigilante. I\u0027m really hoping the next person to hire me will be you! I look forward to briefing you on the current top secret projects being conducted and hearing from you on what you think I should build next.\u003cbr\u003e"
