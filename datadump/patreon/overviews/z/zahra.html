I attempt to facilitate this through my charitable efforts to deliver musical instruments to those whom i feel such a gift could help in uplifting their mental wellbeing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of the money i earn i use to buy instruments for people effected by homelessness, and for Children in Hospitals with chronic and terminal illness. \u00a0This is my primary goal in life, as i personally have experienced the depths at which music can bring a person into a better life. \u00a0Creating music not only is therapeutic, but also gives a person a sense of achievement and greater self worth, it can bring pride into the life of a person whom has lost all else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not care for fame or fortune, for reputation or personal gain. It is simply my duty as an artist whom has been blessed with the ability to create, to pass that gift onto other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore details of my charitable work can be found at \u003ca href=\"http://www.give1year.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.give1year.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext year , the year 2017, i depart for my 30 year charitable tour, for which i will dedicate my life to the principal of using music to better the lives of others. \u00a0I will be walking alone across the countries of Europe to inspire in others these values.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am thankful to all whom support my cause, all of you whom care about what i am trying to do, walk beside me in spirit ."
