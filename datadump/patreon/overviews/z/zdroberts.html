Photojournalism is doubly so. With newspapers closing up their photo departments and grabbing random shots off of the internet to fill their pages photojournalists have never had a tougher time covering the stories that need to get covered. For years in my spare time I\u0027ve been covering political movements around the country - from voting rights activists in New Mexico to Occupy Wall Street in Chicago and NY to Black Lives Matter in Ferguson and Brooklyn. On my own dime I traveled to Kiev during Euromaidan and similarly went to Ferguson and just recently New Hampshire during the primaries.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027m looking to you - the consumers of this media to support my work. I have many sites with a wide readership that would love to take my work but sadly don\u0027t have the cash to cover hotel rooms and gas (even as cheap as it is now). As with most things in the world of progressive media we\u0027re all working on the cheap - and as I said before photojournalism is very expensive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my site zdroberts.com to see what I do. And if you\u0027re a fan - please support my work - so that I can do this every day. I\u0027ll take my 15 year old chevy that I bought by selling nearly everything I own (except my cameras) to the road to cover protest movements, the unseen side of the political process and investigate the bastards trying to take your rights from you."

I\u0027ve been working with Greg Palast for the last 10 years on his investigations into vote theft and corporate influence in gov\u0027t. I\u0027ve also traveled around the country documenting protest movements from #OWS to #BLM to Charlottesville. I spent quite a bit of time in Alaska documenting politics there, too. I\u0027m an editor at the Alaskan political blog, TheMudflats.net, now I\u0027m starting my own news site focusing on visual journalism, VISU.NEWS.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisu.News will be a not for profit journalism site, akin to Propublica. Working with other news orgs and non-profits we will provide original visual journalism content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything you donate here will go to that effort as until we get some magical funding from Soros (kidding, not kidding) we need to fund it with our own cash.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more monthly donations I get - the more work I can do and the more work I can pay other journo\u0027s to do covering protest movements, crime, poverty immigration... and entertainment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll also be starting a a series of podcast on movements, on the daily drudgery of politics, movies and more.\u00a0",
