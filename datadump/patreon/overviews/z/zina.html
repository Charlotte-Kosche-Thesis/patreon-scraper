Women under the age of 25 are twice as likely to contract HIV as their male counterparts, and hardly anyone can afford the antiretroviral treatment available at government or private hospitals. This treatment is critical to keeping these people alive, stopping the progression of the disease, and reducing risk of transmission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Institutodominicanodeestudiosvirologicos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstituto Dominicano de Estudios Virol\u00f3gicos\u003c/a\u003e (IDEV), was founded by an American doctor, Ellen Koenig, in 1992 to address this issue. Historically, IDEV has bridged the resource gap between the white, wealthy, West and the streets of Santo Domingo.

But just because the treatments exist, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re getting to everyone who needs them.

This one is scary because making something that involves publicizing my musical chops (especially as they pertain to original material) fills me with abject terror -- and anticipation. It\u0027ll be so good for me to be accountable to other humans for this kind of creativity. It is something that I\u0027ve wanted to get back to for a long time and if you pitch this much to me, by golly, I\u0027ll do it!\u00a0You\u0027ll get to see how living on the island influences my melodies and rhythms and how my music evolves over time under these forces! Additionally, you\u0027ll get access to all the other tier rewards, including video messages.",
