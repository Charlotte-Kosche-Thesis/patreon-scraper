Before that, I\ntaught Philosophy for eight years in a range of secondary schools, sixth forms,\nand universities. For four years, I was an assistant examiner on a major A-level\nin Philosophy. Somewhere in between, I started talking on Twitter about my\nexperiences as a disabled PhD student, and from 2013-15 I founded group blog \u003ca href=\"https://phdisabled.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePhDisabled\u003c/a\u003e, dedicated to capturing mine and others\u2019 experiences, reflections\nand expertise navigating the conjunction of academia, disability and chronic\nillness. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT DO I DO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a writer, teacher, speaker, and academic philosopher. My\nscholarship focuses on the way that ignorance works to keep some of us down,\nand hold some of us up. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWRITE\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy PhD, now in its third year of writing, is titled \u2018Three\narguments for the Epistemology of Ignorance in the work of Charles W. Mills\u2019.\nIt engages political theory, social epistemology, critical race theory/critical\nwhiteness studies to produce the first monograph-length engagement with Professor\nMills\u2019s work. It\u2019s going to be great. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCALL OUT, BUILD UP\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy \u003ca href=\"http://philosophycommons.typepad.com/disability_and_disadvanta/2016/03/accessing-philosophy-on-disability-and-academic-philosophy.html\"\u003edisability activism\u003c/a\u003e speaks to the structures that\nperpetuate and facilitate making life so hard for disabled people in\nuniversities. I draw on my own and others\u2019 experience to highlight patterns,\npractices and presumptions that serve to perpetuate \u2018disablism\u2019 (or structural\ndisability discrimination and domination). Mostly this happens through writing\nand speaking. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTEACH\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy teaching work focuses on creating fun and accessible\npedagogy for teaching intro-level philosophy and critical thinking. I produce\nresources on my blog, \u003ca href=\"https://falasafaz.wordpress.com/\"\u003efalasafaz!\u003c/a\u003e, and offer commission services in resource creation\nand course design. I\u2019m interested in the \u2018pipeline\u2019 of philosophical education\nincluding formal and informal subject provision. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY ARE YOU ASKING US\nFOR MONEY? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFor the past two and a half years, I\u2019ve been working\nsteadily on my PhD. Give or take the fluctuating chronic illness, recent\nbereavement, and some other stuff, I\u2019ve made great progress. Everything else\nhas been on hold. Well. I stopped teaching, but I didn\u2019t stop being disabled. The\nPhD studentship is my only source of income. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBut my health issues have combined their powers to render me\nenough varying flavours of unwell to need to take a year off. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIF YOU VALUE MY WORK,\nI NEED YOUR HELP\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m about to interrupt my PhD project, which means that my\n(generously provided) research-council funding will interrupt along with my\nstatus. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThere is 13 weeks statutory sick pay available, but using it\ndoes nothing to stop the clock before the funding runs out (October), and it\u2019s\nsafe to say I\u2019ve used most of it up already.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWith the clock still running, the pressure is still on. This\npressure has already created the circumstances such that the only way forward\nis to smash the bureaucratic big red \u2018STOP\u2019 button and make things come\nscreeching to a halt. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThat way I get to greet 2020 with a PhD and my health better\nthan somewhere between \u2018imminent collapse\u2019 and \u2018about to burst into a thousand\nfiery pieces\u2019. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHELP ME HELP ME OUT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy monthly outgoings come to about \u00a31600 per calendar month.\nYour contributions will help me cover these costs. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eEven though I should be resting, I\u2019m already working on\ngenerating alternative revenue streams to meet my monthly outgoings. I\u2019m\nlooking for work at London-based Summer Schools in Philosophy, and I\u2019m already\nstarting to generate some commission work producing bespoke, exciting resources\nfor teaching and learning in philosophy and critical thinking. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut folks, listen, I really, \u003cstrong\u003eREALLY \u003c/strong\u003eneed to rest. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBy chipping into a monthly Patreon fund, you support my work\nby supporting me to create the conditions in which I can do the work, because\nthe work is important and apparently I\u2019m pretty good at it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYou get to become the philanthropic benefactor I always\ndreamed of, but a glorious beautiful multi-headed and bodied not at all hydra\nlike figure whatsoever. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT I\u2019LL DO WITH THE\nMONEY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePay my rent.
