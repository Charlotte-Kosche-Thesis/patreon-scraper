Before I get into detail about what I do, first a little about me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI am a 32 year old illustrator living in Aliso Viejo, California. I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio where in 2008, I graduated from the Cleveland Institute of Art with a degree in Game Design. In 2010, I took part in the internship program at\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://periscopestudio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePeriscope Studio\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ein Portland, OR.\u00a0where I learned to do comics-related work and illustration. I moved to Aliso Viejo in the fall of 2017 to place myself in a better position to take on illustration and concept work in the gaming industry. I am passionate about game design and have been working towards finding a long term career as a concept artist for games. I am a lifelong nerd and try to bring the same passion that I have for particular series or characters to the work that I do re-imagining them with some new spin. I also bring it to original characters and worlds that I build!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a steady flow of freelance work that comes across my desk, most of which is custom armor and weapon design commissions for cosplayers. With your help, I can continue to do so while providing unique insights into my thought process, and tutorials on how I do what I do. My goal is to some day work as a concept artist for a major game studio like Blizzard Entertainment, Riot, or Bioware, so creating as much of this particular kind of work as possible is a big step towards that ultimate goal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Why Patreon?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, as you can see, I have had a fair number of successful collaborations with some incredible artists and cosplayers out there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/21150284_1311512942310228_3093005902434260852_n.jpg?oh=9e353f04dc3a41c382bee7dc64df74d8\u0026amp;oe=5B0D0868\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/17966378_1186181424843381_6834456406247470577_o.jpg?oh=cfb77ed4ed087539355cc796222edc54\u0026amp;oe=5B1FD0BC\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/15591142_1070777609717097_5268455825111308250_o.jpg?oh=88ac2172eea80194aa3961262087417c\u0026amp;oe=5B06CAEB\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14956042_1020306468097545_5665079227977714923_n.jpg?oh=b3a485a6f4e18942c35c95ff1274bd96\u0026amp;oe=5B0D93B5\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13726686_932835903511269_6421617862308454376_n.jpg?oh=6b853be40e64c13c511244ced3f13af6\u0026amp;oe=5B12101D\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12718339_829858867142307_579767318105021072_n.jpg?oh=6f272c5df5399e937fb34cfe0689226f\u0026amp;oe=5B1321E0\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat your support through Patreon will do is help me focus on being able to show more of my process, create tutorials, and even discuss it with you and answer your questions directly. Your contributions will help keep me creating more of what I do, as well as occasionally create extra \"passion pieces\" that allow me to explore ideas and concepts that I am personally excited about, but haven\u0027t found time for otherwise! I also want to get myself set up with better hardware so that I can hop on Twitch where I can live stream my drawing sessions when possible and discuss what I am doing from minute to minute as I work. With enough support, I will also be able to attend more conventions around the country, and perhaps even the world, where I would be excited to meet more of you face to face! All this in addition to some pretty cool discounts and special deals you can use in my Etsy shop that will only be available to my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOn a more personal level, you\u0027ll be helping me stay healthy and happy! Things like helping me keep the lights on, connected to the internet, and well caffeinated! I love coffee, and I live in Portland. I\u0027d say it might be my only real addiction ;) \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"How often will I be charged?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have it set to a monthly patronage charge. This means that you will get charged once per month. I will do my best to post as much as possible throughout the month. I will try to post at very least once per week, but I would ideally like to post multiple times per week. The good thing is, that no matter how berserk I go posting every little tip or trick I can think of, you will only be charged once per month. So even if I post something EVERY DAY, you\u0027ll only get charged once! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
