I\u0027ve hit the \u0027make\u0027 button and now I\u0027ve got a Patreon, my readers have voted for Patreon as a means of supporting me and my writing, and now its time to see how well that works out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can call me Zeonman, or just Zeon, but not Just Zeon. Thank you for putting up with me, my odd writing, my not so occasional typos, and the down times I\u0027ve had while posting on Hentai Foundry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor starters what can you expect from this Patreon?! Well, for starters more content from me, or commissioned through me, in general. If my day job income can be augmented and improved through Patreon, I can afford to commission awesome artists to draw characters and scenes from my stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf things get really good, and don\u0027t fall out from under me, I might even be able to support myself on Patreon, what a world that would be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the Moment I have only one \u003cstrong\u003eMajor Project\u003c/strong\u003e active: \u003cu\u003eNew Lease on Life\u003c/u\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003e.\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 A story about a man dealing with his recent divorcee in a world that is... like ours but no longer \u003cem\u003ejust\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0humankind\u0027s.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMajor Projects\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is the term I\u0027m going to be using for long run stories like\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cu\u003eNew Lease\u003c/u\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMinor Projects \u003c/strong\u003ewill refer to: side stories, one shots, and commission or reward stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA word on\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSide Stories: \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Any side story that is the result of a commission or a reward will be uploaded to HF, with the rewarded Patron\u0027s permission.

That amount will be charted as your membership goes on, and should you you change your monthly donation, it will still add to your \u0027account\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould you END your patronage, it will remain static and not diminish (so \u0027pause\u0027 or end your patronage, you don\u0027t lose what you\u0027ve accumulated.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what is this strange Ledger for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMembership Loyalty Rewards:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen your membership builds up to a certain amount you can cash in some of your cache to get a reward. These might seem, \u0027small\u0027 but they can add up to something really neat. Depending on feed back, membership, and ease, I might add or alter these prices down the road.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOWEVER.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Queue member will not be cheated out of their \u0027credit\u0027 by me raising the prices, if they were a member saving up for several months, before the changes were made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCause that\u0027s not fun for anyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut enough gabbing, you wanna know what this membership rewards are right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCAMEOS\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Character Here \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eCANON \u003c/u\u003eCAMEOS \u003c/strong\u003ein my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e.... I know, contain your excitement. Please.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe long and short is, a world is bland without people living in it, and the more people there are, the better! Having a Persona in one of my worlds means they could, in future, show up in the backgrounds of comics that are commissioned, have conversations with the major characters, or even, at higher levels, be part of the story and have sides stories of their own!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Now It\u0027s getting interesting\" You\u0027re thinking, I can smell it in your brains. No wait, that\u0027s your popcorn, don\u0027t let it burn. I\u0027ll wait.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e... Got the butter? No? Okay, fine, I don\u0027t judge.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst a disclaimer: \u003cstrong\u003eALL YCH MOMENTS WILL BE DISCUSSED WITH CHARACTER OWNER. NO CHARACTERS UNDER THE AGE OF 18, AT ALL, EVER. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$50 Dollar Cash In: Walk On Role: \u003c/strong\u003eFor this, you\u0027re character is someone in the background of the comics, or somewhere the focus characters are having a conversation. They might be the bartender handing them drinks, a tourist asking for directions, or someone just saying hi on the street. This will generally be summed up in a paragraph interaction.\u003cbr\u003eAn Example.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEric and the scruffy looking man stood over the map. The tourist had spread it over some milk crates and ran a hand through his curly red hair. \"I\u0027m sorry, mate.\" He said with an accent that remind Eric of Oz, but in the other cardinal direction. \"I\u0027m rubbish at maps.\" He laughed and Eric nodded. \u003cbr\u003e\"No worries, Rob.\" Eric helped the Brit translate the map and even walked with him toward his destination. The man was sightseeing and would be in the city for a few months, actually. Not surprising, given how difficult traveling was. Eric made a few recommendations\u00a0on food, and \u00a0Rob was grateful for the help. He gave Eric his number and offered to buy him a pint in thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eSomething like that. You (or rather your character) interacts in a way that is a \u0027rest\u0027 phase from the main action, a breather, that can set up future interactions. Each 50 dollar cash in is worth one of these, so if you want to have your character just be \u0027that normal guy\u0027 the MC knows whom he can talk to and grab a beer with THIS is a perfect option!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$100 Cash in: Sexy time Role:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Your character Gets Some. Maybe not with the MC, but the MC can and may oversee your character getting some fun time (with the pairing of your choice, in terms of gender/general description/etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePartial Example (NSFW):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEric stepped back as he reached the doorway to the karaoke room. The door was ajar and he could see Rob inside, sitting in a comfy chair. Rob wasn\u0027t alone; in the room, or in the chair. A woman with dark curls and thick curves was sitting in his lap. Her skirt was hiked up above her ass, as Rob\u0027s hands squeezed into the thick curves. His Pants were down around his ankles, as he thrust up and into her, spreading her as he speared her and making her moan loudly into the karaoke microphone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEric stepped back and looked over his shoulder at Maz, \"I think they\u0027re busy.\" He said, and Maz went on her toes to look over Eric, her breasts pushing against his face as she leaned in to get a good look at the action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Oh wow.\" Maz said with a smile, \"We should join them!\" She suggested, \"I mean we paid for the room too!\" She took Eric by the arm and reached for the door handle.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eALL YCH MOMENTS WILL BE DISCUSSED WITH CHARACTER OWNER. This is to avoid, \u0027my character wouldn\u0027t do that\u0027 moments that make things awkward.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$150 Cash in: City Resident/Secondary Character:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Your character is somehow tied into a future plot line; not as a victim or a body, or some nameless goon, but as someone whose a willful participant and has control over their destiny! \u00a0Can\u0027t really make an example for this, but I would say that characters like the Police officers working at Cornelia\u0027s precinct are the best examples of this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCharacters like this can expect to work with the MC\u0027s on at least one major leg of a plotline, possibly more, depending on how we work things out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAGAIN: ALL YCH MOMENTS WILL BE DISCUSSED WITH CHARACTER OWNER.\u003cbr\u003eI won\u0027t make you a baddie, unless you want to be a baddie, you can totally be a baddie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$200 Cash in: Neighbor, Companion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s right, for a cool accumulated $200, your character gets to move in to the same building as the MC, travel with them, or generally be a Regular. It\u0027s hard to guarantee how often they will show up, but they WILL get a plot line that they are the major focus of. They may sex the MC, or be involved with some major situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut any Neighbor, Companion, etc WILL get their own \u003cstrong\u003eSide story\u003c/strong\u003e with at least one sex scene and their own distinct partner, or partners. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome restrictions may apply in terms of physical sex, species, etc, depending on my genre and my ability to do justice by that level of writing. I can BS a lot, so there\u0027s hope.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI may come back to this and add things like \u0027news\u0027 or updates like new projects, but I imagine that\u0027s what news and update posts are for, right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, enough out of me.\u003cbr\u003e"
