Bornheimer recently was appointed \nInstructor of Saxophone at Eckerd College.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBornheimer was the first two-time winner of the Owen Prize in Jazz Composition, awarded the 2016 prize for \u003cem\u003eHenry (\u003c/em\u003ecomposed and premiered by Donny McCaslin \u0026amp; USF Jazz Ensemble 1), and the 2017 prize for his composition \u003cem\u003eElegy\u003c/em\u003e.   His piece \u003cem\u003eColor Shift\u003c/em\u003e\n was among the finalists for the 2015 Herb Alpert Young Jazz Composers \nAward and was featured during New Music Workshops for the 2017 \nInternational Society of Jazz Arrangers and Composers (ISJAC) Symposium.\n  Bornheimer was named a Ravinia\u0027s Steans Music Institute (RSMI) Fellow \nfor the 2017 Program for Jazz by Rufus Reid.  He returned to Ravinia in \nlate 2017 to perform as a part of the prestigious Ravinia All Star \nQuintet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBornheimer\u0027s most recent release is his 7-part Suite for Jazz Quintet, The Emotional Suite\u2013on a 7-part album called \u003ca href=\"http://zachjazz.com/emotional\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmotional, Vol. 1: Live at the University of South Florida\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. \n This recording is an exploration into the late 60\u0027s Avant-garde and the\n modern fusion eras while simultaneously writing to challenge and push \nhis Quintet to new heights\u2013the live performance of the suite had one of \nthe largest audiences and quickest standing ovations of any USF recital \nwithin recent years (until his graduate recital). Strikingly unique \ncompositions and arrangements have been pervasive through Bornheimer\u2019s \nworks, being commissioned by various ensembles including the USF \nJazztet, USF Jazz Ensemble 1, Andrew Allen Trio + Friends, and Paul \nGavin \u0026amp; Full Force.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen completing his graduate degree in Jazz Composition under Chuck \nOwen at the University of South Florida on Graduate Fellowship, \nBornheimer assembled his Jazz Orchestra, a tour de force of musicianship\n and power, with some of the best and well respected musicians in the \narea in the Central Florida area. The premiere performance of the Jazz \nOrchestra earned one of the largest audiences to attend a student \nperformance (even larger than some USF Ensemble concerts) and one of the\n fastest standing ovations on record. The orchestra blends free, \norchestral, fusion, Brazilian, swing, and post-bop jazz elements into an\n emotionally satiating, exploratory, and enriching sound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs\n a saxophonist, Bornheimer has performed with with local and national \nensembles including the USF Jazztet, USF Jazz Ensemble 1, Paul Gavin \n\u0026amp; Full Force, the Jazz Legacy Big Band, Samba Jazz Quartet, the New \nJazz Standards Quartet, Andrew Allen Trio + Friends, La Lucha, Jack \nWilkins \u0026amp; Friends, and the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra at\n various venues including the Umbria Jazz Festival, Jazz \u00e0 Vienne, the \nWigan Jazz Festival, and the Birmingham Jazz Festival. Professionally as\n a sideman or soloist, he has performed at the Jewel of the Ridge Jazz \nFestival and the Hague Jazz Festival and, as a member of the top Big \nBand at USF, performed with Danny Gottlieb, Frank Greene, Christine \nJensen, Maria Schneider, Rufus Reid, Steve Houghton, Ryan Truesdell, \nGary Smulyan, Michael Dease, and Ron Blake. He has studied clarinet with\n Brian Moorhead, saxophone \u0026amp; flute with Valerie Gillespie, saxophone\n with Jack Wilkins, saxophone, flute, and composition with Dean Eaves, \ncomposition with Chuck Owen, and has taken a lesson or two from Ralph \nBowen, Rick Margitza, and Maria Schneider.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGrowing up in South Florida, Bornheimer was exposed to a wide variety\n of music.  His mom, on Sunday afternoons, would play cassettes of David\n Sanborn while driving home; that music always bothered him because it \nreminded him that the weekend was over.  Eventually, he grew to like \nschool and didn\u2019t mind David Sanborn.  In fact, Sanborn is one of his \nearly influences.  USF alumni Ryan Lupton, one of his first teachers, \nexposed him to Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Cannonball \nAdderley, and Michael Brecker, all of which play a major role for his \nmusical ear.",
