    "summary": "Hey, I\u0027m Zach and I make videos with whimsy and wisdom for the Internet. I\u0027m a comedian with cerebral palsy and make several series for YouTube including Workout Wednesday, Top of the Monday, High Five Friday, Riding Shotgun, and other things as inspiration strikes. My goal with all my stuff is to make you laugh and occasionally make you think. I\u0027m also an author, a travel aficionado, and a great lover of fine cuisine \u2013 like the Olive Garden!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is me teaching you how to run on a treadmill:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWI_J3-2Nzg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get the idea...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like watching videos like this and you want to help me make more awesome stuff, you can support me by becoming a patron of my work for as little as $1. You can choose how much you want to contribute per video and even set a monthly cap so that you never spend more than you\u0027re comfortable with, no matter how many videos I end up releasing in a month. If you try and you decide a different amount is better for your life, you can always change your pledge at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out this page and for supporting my work \u2013 you beautiful, sexy beast. Let\u0027s do this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eFAQs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Why are you on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: I love making silly YouTube videos and over the years I\u0027ve been surprised and delighted by how much of a positive impact they\u0027ve had on my audience. I haven\u0027t been able to release content as consistently as I\u0027d like to because I don\u0027t always have the budget or the resources to actually create all of the wild ideas in my head. Patreon will allow me to keep my focus on making more of the cool stuff you love without worrying so much about whether or not I can afford another shoot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Will you still be releasing videos for free on YouTube?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Yes, absolutely, and always. Patreon is just a way for people who want to support me to get more involved and have access to some exclusive perks, like personalized shoutouts and webcasts, etc. Details of all the goodies are just over there to the right on your screen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: I just sold my moped sharing app for a billion dollars! Can I change my Patreon level?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Wow - congrats! Yeah, you can change your contribution level and monthly cap at any time for any reason as often as you need. But if you\u0027re going for one of those higher level rewards, I\u0027m going to take it on the honor system that you\u0027ll stick with me for longer than a month after getting your swag.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What\u0027s the timeline for reward fulfillment?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: It will vary a little between the different tiers because\u00a0I\u0027ll probably set aside time each week to do the more personalized message kind of things, and I probably won\u0027t be able to get to everyone right away. Just trust me, if you aren\u0027t in the first round of shoutouts, that my love and appreciation for you is boundless and we will have our moments together!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: I have a question you didn\u0027t answer! What do I do?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Reach out to me on Twitter (@zachanner) and I\u0027ll get back to you ASAP!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
