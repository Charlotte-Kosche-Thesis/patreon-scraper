If you\u2019re here you probably know that what I tend to focus on is short stories, though I have plans (very rough drafts) for longer works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI love writing. I love coming up with ideas for stories and working with what inspiration has been given to me. I could write about nearly anything and be happy while I do it. I have been doing commissions for stories for some time and I have enjoyed writing them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, writing does not as of yet pay the bills. I enjoy producing content and am so happy when I see someone\u2019s liked my work or wants to request a commission for me, but the reality of the situation is that I do not currently make enough from writing alone to sustain a living. While I can work a nine to five job to keep going, that limits the amount of time I have to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u2019s where patreon comes in! Every pledged dollar will be used to ensure that I have more time to deliver content for everyone. It will do this by paying bill, buying food, reducing the amount of time I have to spend working and, should there be enough, looking into additions for my content to make the experience of you, my readers, even better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI, also, promise to be as transparent as possible when it comes to my writing process and exactly what your pledges are going towards. Ultimately, I want to make sure that every patron gets exactly what they sign up for and continues to get what they want out of my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for pledging and I hope that I can continue to pen the ideas that excite you!\u003cbr\u003e"
