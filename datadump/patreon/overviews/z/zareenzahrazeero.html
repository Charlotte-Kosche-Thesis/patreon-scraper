My creative practices extend to arranging\nstimuli across many media. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to live and create when you\u2019re a poor,\nsick trans woman who\u2019s not being paid, and mostly, I\u2019m not being paid. So, I\u2019m\nlooking for ways to sustain my life and practices, as well as opening my\npractices for greater community involvement and getting the results into more\nfolks\u2019 hands.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEnter this Patreon campaign. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Background\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my life, I have tended toward the one-stop-shop\nmodel of creative work, with all that implies about labor, creative vision,\nownership of ideas, etc. I don\u2019t like this much. I think it\u2019s important to\nrecognize how ideas are collectively birthed, which to me suggests they should\nnot be \u2018owned\u2019 by particular individuals. I want to work in ways that are\ncongruent with this recognition, that engages with others in an effort to\npractice collective responsibility for cultural production. I believe this will\nresult in not only stronger but more ethically and politically vital works, as it\nprovides opportunities for us to correct errors and carry each other through\nterrain we might otherwise lack the ability to navigate.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Plan\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eA Patreon campaign is obviously meant first and foremost to\nraise funds, and this one is no different. As mentioned above, I\u2019m soliciting\nmonthly contributions to cover the costs of living and doing creative work.\nLike many Patreon campaigns, and in line with my desire to get things I\u2019ve made\ninto people\u2019s hands, I\u2019m offering rewards that will include copies of works in\ndifferent formats. There will be unlimited digital editions and limited\nphysical editions of everything I make \u2013 zines, music, posters, collage,\nchapbooks, essays, and so on \u2013 as well as a few one-of-a-kind items. This is\nall pretty standard fare, I think, and details of what\u2019s available at each\nmonthly contribution tier are on the right side of the page. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe twist, however, is that I\u2019m looking to experiment with\nopening my practices to others\u00a0\u2013 to you!\n\u2013 for participation, comment, and critique at all stages\nof the creative process. Since it\u2019s set up to encourage interaction between\ncreators and supporters, Patreon makes for a nice hub for me to disseminate\ninformation to, poll, and otherwise seek comment from the community supporting\nme. Additionally, I\u2019ll be sharing my email and Skype addresses so that I\u2019m\navailable for conversation. I want to make the process as transparent and\naccessible as possible, and I will continually refine how I seek input as I\nwork out better solutions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt doesn\u2019t end there, though. I believe the work isn\u2019t just\nmine, so I want to make it available for people to tinker with and change as\nthey see fit (within certain very relaxed limitations \u2013 i.e. don\u0027t make\nanything fucked up). Maybe you have an idea to take what I\u2019ve done and use it\nto make something completely new. I\u2019d like that to happen. To facilitate this,\nI\u2019ll make an archive of source files for all of the digitally-produced works connected\nwith this project available to everyone contributing $5 or more per month. Take\nthings apart, rebuild them, mash them together with things you\u2019ve been working\non, whatever \u2013 I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what comes of it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to read this and\nconsider supporting me. Truly, every dollar and share helps."
