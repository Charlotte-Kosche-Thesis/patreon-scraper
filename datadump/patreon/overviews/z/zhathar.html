    "summary": "Hello! My name is Jaska Kauppila from Finland and I humbly welcome you to my Patreon page. Let me present you the comic project I\u0027m creating:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/WLLSGTY.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLegend of Zhathar is a comic that takes inspiration from many adventure movies, comics and other series, such as Indiana Jones. It is action-adventure comic that follows the adventures of young rookie fox archeologist Rica Forrest and a fellow adventurer dragon Li Sheung. This duo will run into all kinds of adventures and epic moments as they seek for hidden relics and artifacts. The focus of the comic is in adventure, exploration, exciting action and mystery, with the biggest mystery being that of the long ago vanished snake demigod Zhathar. You can read the comic for \u003cstrong\u003efree \u003c/strong\u003ein the following link:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://zhathar.smackjeeves.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClick here!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis comic may look cutesy on the surface with its anthropomorphic animal characters , but do not let the looks deceive you. This comic is not without drama, romance, violence and death. Comic is primarily intended for teens and older readers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a project that I\u0027ve been working towards for a long time. Each story of this comic is going to be roughly 60 pages long and I have dozens of these stories in my head that I just need to get out there for you to read. I do weekly releases for this comic, roughly 3 pages a week, plus some artwork on the side. My hope is to earn enough money with my comic, that I can do it as a full-time job and you can help me achieve that. Even the smallest of support you can give will help me tremendously. Also, I hope you support my comic by spreading the word. Tell your friends, family, your favorite forum, share this comic in facebook, twitter, whatever. I\u0027m but a one man, I can\u0027t be everywhere at once, so any help is appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what are you waiting for!? Let\u0027s head to an adventure and discover the legend of Zhathar together! Be part of the legend! Support me now!
