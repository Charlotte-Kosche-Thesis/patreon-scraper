    "summary": "Who are we and why we do it?\u003cbr\u003e\nHello everyone! We, Daniel \"Flubb\" Jacoboski and\nShane \"Kimbrell\" Kimbrell, are Zombie Panda Studios (ZPS)! Our\ngoal is to produce fun, strategic, and enjoyable content about video games by\nusing pod-casting, video, and streaming. Our main focus is on Dota 2 as for it\nis the game that we both share and love though we will venture into other games\nin the near future. Flubb has been playing mobile online battle arenas (mobas)\nsuch as Dota, Hon, and Dota 2 for ten years! Flubb has also been on over 14\nteams in the past and has been able to achieve/keep a 5k solo mmr. His Focus is\nto better understand the game and break beyond the meta by understanding the\npotential in everything. Kimbrell has been a steady captain while playing DotA 2 for the last 3 years. DotA 2 was actually his first moba and it\u0027s been quite the experience for him. Kimbrell has however, been playing video games since he was old enough to hold a controller. Started with Mario, Kirby, Donkey Kong, all of the classics on the SNES. Now he plays just about any game he can get his hands on including DotA, PUBG, Overwatch, any action/fantasy/adventure/fps game, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat do we do?\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are a broadcasting network for video-games with a main\nfocus being Dota 2. As of now, we have 2 weekly podcast/video shows streamed\nlive on twitch that delve into the world of Dota 2 and reach to inform the\nviewer/listener while giving a unique perspective on strategies to improve. The\nfirst show we have is The Flupdate. The Flupdate is hosted by Flubb and is a\nnews show updating people on current Dota events that have happened in the past\nweek and what to look forward to in the next upcoming weeks. The second show,\nBrewmaster\u0027s Draft, Flubb and Kimbrell sit down with a couple of brews drafting\nvs each other or sometimes team up to draft vs a special guest. We also stream\nall types of games during the week. Flubb casts Dota 2 games and if are ever interested\nin having your game casted by him send him a message over twitter. He also will\nbe writing articles for strategy guides in the near future! Kimbrell is a nostalgia junky and is currently looking at playing and/or replaying a ton of games he either played in his childhood or the few he missed out on. Besides the old school games, Kimbrell is also open to any other game if requested. DotA 2 wise he can also provide drafting ideas/help. Flubb is more talented skill wise in DotA but Kimbrell is definitely looking to outdraft him each week!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want to take a moment to thank all for watching and\nsupporting our dream. It is truly incredible to have fans like you out there\nsupporting us not only through donations, but every comment and piece of\nencouragement you give us. Thank you so much for being you and welcome to ZPS.\nLet\u0027s play some games together!\u003cbr\u003e"
