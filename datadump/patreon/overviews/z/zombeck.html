    "summary": "Since October 2009 I have been writing about the financial\ncrisis, Wall Street, Corporate America, politics and social issues in America. I\nhave been fortunate for the past seven years to have been published and\nfeatured on the front pages of Huffington Post. As a result I have been\nasked to appear on various TV, radio shows, and podcasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI worked as a newspaper reporter in the mid to late 90s\ncovering local and national politics and later went to work in the booming\nsoftware industry as a technical writer for a few years. When the financial\ncrisis hit in 2008/2009, taking millions of dollars in savings, investments,\nand homes from hardworking Americans, I was inspired to once again take to\nwriting about social and political issues. In 2010 I was asked by a handful of consumer\nprotections agencies to travel with them to Washington D.C. and help lobby for\nwhat was to become our current financial regulation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince those days I\u2019ve continued to write about, discuss, and\nadvocate for equal treatment, financial regulation, a political system that\nworks for regular people as well as social and economic change that is inclusive and\nfair. It\u2019s become evident in the last few years how important information and\nfact based opinion is.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGone are the days when writers were paid $1.00 per word, so\nmy writing and podcasting until now has been unpaid. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have\na trust fund and I do have bills. The writing and podcasting takes time to\nferret out facts, good content, and then put it in a digestible form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI was inspired recently by an article in Vox by \u003ca href=\"http://www.vox.com/users/Scott%20Santens\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eScott Santens\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, \u003c/em\u003ewho wrote about his own crowdfunded efforts\nto promote basic income. Like him, I feel that the work I did to survive was an\nimpediment to the work I needed to do to inform which needs 100 percent\nattention. Worrying about how the mortgage, car payment, or internet bill is\ngoing to get paid doesn\u2019t lend itself to creativity or whether your work is\nvalued.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDonations and\nsupport from people who have seen and benefited from the work \u2013 the writing,\nthe information, the podcasting, and the activism \u2013 are proof that what I do\nand have been doing has value. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal amount I\u0027ve set is slightly above the poverty line and\ncovers basic needs such as housing and utilities. Any amount over\nthat will be pledged away to other Creators here on Patreon who are also\ncreating content in support of their own basic incomes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in reading more of me or about me, here\nare some places I can be found:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/richard-zombeck\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHuffington Post\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://tandztalk.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eT\u0026amp;Z Talk Podcast\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://samuel-warde.com/author/richzom/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLiberals Unite\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://zombeck.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eZombeck.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
