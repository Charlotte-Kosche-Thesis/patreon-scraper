    "summary": "A year and a half ago, I was just making long effort posts on Facebook. People kept telling me to stop writing my posts in a place where they were just going to disappear down the memory hole and get lost, because\u2014they kept assuring me\u2014what I had to say was worth more than that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the time, I didn\u2019t care because I wasn\u2019t writing \u003cem\u003efor \u003c/em\u003eanybody. I didn\u2019t care about persuading anyone, much less building an audience. I was just sitting around, thinking.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, my friend Pawe\u0142\u00a0put together the blog that became Zombie Meditations. He said something like: \u201cLook, it\u2019s already done. The blog is made. So copy and paste the last thing you wrote, and put it there. Or else.\u201d This is what it took for me to finally give in and begin \u201cblogging\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithin a few months, Loyola economist Walter Block had\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mest.meste.org/MEST_Najava/VIII_Block.pdf\"\u003eused me as a formal citation\u003c/a\u003e in an econ journal on the topic of the war on drugs. Where no one else anywhere I could find on the entire Internet had done so, I dug through the Congressional records to find out exactly how the black members of Congress had voted in the bills that defined the beginnings of the War on Drugs (surprisingly, nearly all had voted \u2018Yea\u2019), and I thoroughly documented the fact that it was actually \u003cem\u003eblack victims of crime and degeneracy associated with drug use spreading through black communities, \u003c/em\u003eand NOT racist whites who merely used drugs as a pretext for throwing black people in jail, who fundamentally pushed for and created the war on drugs as we know it today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlmost exactly a year ago to the time of this writing (I\u2019m writing in June 2017), a random coincidence led to an experiment and I ended up\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.counter-currents.com/2016/05/calling-for-a-nazi-social-justice-warrior-alliance/\"\u003ewriting at Counter-Currents\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuffice it to say that the experiment was a success.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I\u2019ve been releasing a slow stream of articles there that were mainly pulled from my extensive backlog of things I\u2019ve already written in various places (buried in the depths of social media, etc). But even with a steady average of nearly an article a week which I kept up despite a whole hell of a lot of other things going on in my life, I never thought I would be able to make journalism my \u003cem\u003ething \u003c/em\u003eonce I was done cleaning out my \u201cbasement\u201d of pre\u2013prepared material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe last couple of months have changed that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of May, I made my first movie in the real world acting the part of a real life journalist by flying to NYC to cover\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.counter-currents.com/2017/05/gilad-atzmon-in-new-york/\"\u003ean event involving Gilad Atzmon and others\u003c/a\u003e and then\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.counter-currents.com/2017/05/jewish-survival-strategies/\"\u003einterview Gilad\u003c/a\u003e at the end. The interview was extremely well\u2013received among Gilad\u2019s audience (which is mostly left\u2013leaning, although it generally blends the far left and the far right side by side). I also came out of the event with the offer of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18920481_432625543782677_1035531003562294281_n.jpg?oh=fc38a6406e26dad3b50b97dbee1b75fc\u0026amp;oe=5A039FE4\"\u003ea\u00a0photoshoot\u003c/a\u003e that turned out incredible.\u00a0\u00a0Then I spent the next two months traveling up and down the East Coast (aimlessly, beyond the ultimate destination of returning to Georgia), hitting whatever events or protests I could, meeting people who knew me from my writing, meeting activists and writers and people involved in the movement, getting trapped on malfunctioning subways and leading the way for people to dive over the gate where the trains are connected onto the platform since the doors wouldn\u2019t open, chopping wood and cleaning showers to pay for my \u201crent\u201d, meeting people and then passing out overnight next to them on 24 hour bus rides, hitchhiking to nearby gyms and convincing people to let me in for free as their guests\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I loved every minute of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it started to sink in: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI really actually do want to do this. I want this to be my \u201cthing.\u201d \u003cbr\u003eAnd I want to keep getting better and better at it.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first thing I did when I got back was list my audiophile PSB M4U 2 active noise canceling head phones for sale, because \u003cem\u003eI don\u2019t even want to\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eown \u003c/strong\u003eanything that isn\u2019t as lightweight and compact as possible and durable enough to survive rough traveling. \u003c/em\u003eI replaced them with a pair of V\u2013MODA Forza Metallos I found on sale and put the difference back away in savings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to take this \u003ca href=\"https://www.onebag.com/bags.html\"\u003eonebagging\u003c/a\u003e thing down to a science.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m already a pretty hardcore minimalist by nature:\u00a0I stocked my part of the kitchen with exactly one set of silverware and two bowls. My upstairs loft has my guitar and recorder, my desktop on an Ergo Driven industrial cardboard standing desk stand, and a Day Light Classic Plus Light Therapy Lamp from Carex. Downstairs, I sleep on a mattress on the floor. Now I want everything else I own to fit into a single backpack.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI no longer feel timid about asking for help\u2014and lots of it\u2014because I know exactly what I\u2019m doing now, and I\u2019m completely confident now that I\u2019m capable of it, so I know I can put it to responsible good use. I want to trade my current (weak) backpack out for a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/the-goruck-gr2/\"\u003eGoruck GR2\u003c/a\u003e, and possibly also a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://loctote.com/products/flak-sack-coalition\"\u003eLoctote Flak Sack\u003c/a\u003e. I want to get a rugged mic and a decent rugged camera so I can make video and record audio and podcast when I\u2019m on the road. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrucially, I need about $115 a month to afford a supplement called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2016/11/what-is-qualia/\"\u003eQualia\u003c/a\u003e. It\u2019s the difference for me between staying in a steady stream of high productivity, and just falling apart. And I\u2019ll eventually be writing about (or, with your help, releasing video of myself discussing) the scientific benefits of it in detail, as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSad story time:\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI already had to spend close to this to supplement lithium and taurine (I get horrific episodes of sleep paralysis \u003cem\u003eevery single night\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eif I don\u2019t take them) and B vitamins and magnesium (I get horrific panic attacks for no apparent reason otherwise). Qualia added a whole \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ehell\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e of a lot of value to my life for the marginal increase over what I already had to spend just to maintain basic quality of life, and it\u0027s a huge part of the reason I was able to be as productive and constantly adaptable as I was on this trip, despite the constant stress and changing circumstances.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eto have rough adventures. I want to take long buses instead of fast, easy planes as often as I can handle it. I\u00a0wantto know what it\u2019s like to go train\u2013hopping. I want to learn to sleep in an ultralight camouflage bivy and shower with a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ivation-Portable-Outdoor-Battery-Powered/dp/B00IFHFJXI\"\u003eportable shower\u003c/a\u003e and wash my clothes with a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thescrubba.com/\"\u003eScrubba\u003c/a\u003e instead of taking hotels.

I\u2019m a hardcore minimalist.

I need a fully rugged set of gear (backpack, mic, phone, etc.) to survive the rough conditions I plan to put them through.
