There has been an outbreak of some kind, and it\u2019s been affecting humans in very strange ways. We host an array of unique and interesting characters inspired by the ever interesting citizens of Baltimore. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be thrown into the city just as everything is falling apart, following the survival of a small band of people who have come together our of fear and necessity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach episode will be between 20 and 30 minutes in length, with some longer special episodes available later on down the road. The production features a full cast, more then half of whom are Baltimore locals, and sound effects all mixed together in-house by the creator\u0027s themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy co-creator and I have lived in the Baltimore area our entire lives, and have always wanted to base a good creepy story in the city that we call home.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has been a slow-going process, but we are now finally able to make our story come to life. With your help, of course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMonthly donations by our loyal fans here on Patreon will help offset the cost of podcast and website hosting, as well as compensate our actors for their time."
