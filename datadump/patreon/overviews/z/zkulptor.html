    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Hi guys my name is Erick Sosa I am a professional sculptor with over 20 years of experience working for the Toy and Collectibles Industries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n I started sculpting at age 4, my first sculpture was a T-Rex that was done in oven baked clay, and sadly it exploded while in the kiln ( oven) , but I came back and sculpted a great white shark that looked more like an airplane than a shark, but I kept practicing drawing and sculpting throughout my childhood and teenage years, until a great teacher of mine got me into Mattel Toys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love sculpting and I have tried to develop a dynamic style, always learning new techniques. \u003cbr\u003eI have trained for years to be able to capture any style in the sculpting \nspectrum, be it American streamline comic book style, Japanese \nAnime/Manga, Mechanical characters, beautiful women, creatures and \nmonsters, miniatures, or famous portraits. I have been working as a full time freelancer for the past 15 years. These days I am known for doing\u00a0 superhero statue designs doing everything in 3D or Zbrush ( \ndigital modeling), my operation is 100% digital these days. I also own a 3D printer in which I will be printing some cool stuff for all of those that kindly support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Some of the companies I have\u00a0 worked for include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n Mattel Toys, Disney Consumer Products, SOTA Toys,\u00a0 Hot \nButtered Elves, Bowen Designs, DC Colelctibles, Art Asylum, Warner Brothers, \nMaster Replicas, Eaglemoss, Jazwares, Wizkids, Mezco, McFarlane, \nHasbro, Universal Studios, Sideshow Collectibles,\u003cbr\u003e Kotobukiya (Designer/sculptor Managing\n advisor Product Planning and Development), Funko, His Majesty the King \nof Jordan, Round2 Models, and Yamato Toys, and lately XM Studios, among others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love what I do and have been doing it since 1994 ( in a professional way)\u00a0 to the present day. However I have always desired two things, first to be able to pass on my knowledge to others, which I have done many times, I have been able to help up and coming artists secure work in the collectibles industry and that seriously brings me a lot of joy. I believe\u00a0 with your help I can bring more knowledge on how to to go about becoming a professional sculptor, I am not promising work in the collectibles industry, but this knowledge can definitely be used for different areas of the entertainment industry, or to enhance your skills if you are already a professional,\u00a0 or just as part of your hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, I wish to be able to do more personal work ( I know that is every artist\u0027s dream) , freelance is a tough business, and my schedule is insane, I would love to be able to have more time for my own works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I am getting older ( I am 38) and every time I am working on a professional project I am daydreaming of doing my own creations. I believe Patreon might be the avenue to help me achieve my desire to share my knowledge and at the same time allow me to enjoy doing my own projects more constantly, without having to worry about working so much on professional projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a big thank you my rewards will range from time lapse videos, to live streaming tutorials, and better yet I will produce resin copies of some of my actual creature or portrait projects, and even T shirts with my characters printed on them so you can hold in your hands or even wear the product of your generous patronage. You can already find free sculpting seminars on my youtube channel, but with your patronage and feedback we will create\u00a0 constant higher quality content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to point out I will be covering traditional sculpting and zbrush ( 3d modelling). We will cover quick clay sketches, portrait sculpting, creatures, anatomy, gestures, creature design, and poses, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please help me spread the word, I believe my tutorials and content and rewards will be very unique. I don\u0027t see this as asking for money for nothing, if anything I want to give more than what I can get from your support, it is the least I can do for allowing me to live my dream at least one day a week. \u003cbr\u003eIf I can at least dedicate a few days a month to do my own thing I can show you we can create some awesome educartional art together!\u003cbr\u003e"
