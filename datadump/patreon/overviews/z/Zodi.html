    "summary": "Hello there! My name is Vaughn Burns and I\u0027m creating a comic book called \"The Zodi\". It\u0027s a story about how human children of both eastern and western Zodiacs must protect elemental birthstones hidden inside their bodies from constellations who want to destroy the universe. These children have 1 elemental power from their western Zodiac parent and 1 animalistic power from their eastern Zodiac parent. The birthstones hidden in their bodies are the source of their powers. The Constellations want these stones as they are the key to freeing their king who is imprisoned in the center of the universe. These children known as Zodi, must defend the stones for the sake of all life in the universe and to avenge the deaths of their ethereal parents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I have found an incredible artist named Erwin Prasetya who had previously worked on the Blade Bunny and Monsuno manga\u0027s as the illustrator. I love his style and I believe he was the perfect choice to create this story with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I have decided to use Patreon is because Erwin is the illustrator for the comic and he is working for $50 a page. I am currently paying him with my own funds to help produce the project, but with your help we can increase production speed and have more pages completed per month. Even as little as $1 a month is helpful as if we can reach our first goal of $100 that\u0027s an extra 2 pages completed every month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions feel free to message me or comment and I will answer them to the best of my ability. I thank you all for your future support!\u003cbr\u003e"
