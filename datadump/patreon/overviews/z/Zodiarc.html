My work focuses on evocative themes and a melding between \u003cstrong\u003eLGBTQ content\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e(sometimes\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eNSFW) \u003c/strong\u003eand an action based storyline. My goals on Patreon are to find people in my nich\u00e9 group who enjoy \u003cstrong\u003eJapanese style comics\u003c/strong\u003e, but also identify as gay, bisexual, lesbian, and much more. I feel as though we are bombarded with many heteronormative themes in mainstream anime and and wanted to make an interesting alternative.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eZodiarc\u003c/strong\u003e is a comic of my own design that seeks to achieve this. By being freely expressive, and at times just as sexual as normal anime can be, I hope to make something people enjoy as much as I enjoy watching it unfold. \u003cstrong\u003eHelp me make something beautiful.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/ef48ba8eaa744bdefec30aa78a6a53fe/tumblr_nquxpxsk1d1s5qgd9o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eDecus \u0026lt;\u003cem\u003eDecks\u0026gt;\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0The Whiptail Satyr\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is Decus, the main protagonist of my comic; Zodiarc.

Im Josiah, a college junior with a passion to tell a story that is evocative, deep, action based and sexy, I grew up watching tons of anime and was always disillusioned by the crazy amount of non LGBTQ material, we all know the tropes, giant boobs, defying gravity, jiggle to release bullet shells, yatta yatta yatta-- Well, why not have a story that can be fan service for everyone but still be good quality? Crazy right? Well thats what I want to do. We all love a good story, but who doesn\u0027t like being recognized in something as captivating as anime and comics??
