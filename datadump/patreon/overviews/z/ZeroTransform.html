    "summary": "Virtual Reality is a new frontier. I believe in VR so much that I\u0027m risking everything, leaving a safe industry job and going indie to create something that I\u0027m truly passionate and excited to make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing indie takes a lot of hard work. You have to handle hardware, licensing, software, coding, everything. But with that responsibility comes the freedom to make an amazing game that is only bound by your imagination and dedication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe initial hope was to get enough funding to start a full fledged (albeit small) game studio, using Kickstarter to get the initial funding up front. \u00a0That didn\u0027t make it, so I\u0027ve had to scale back my goals, but that doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m giving up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is still a game studio in the making - just a one-man studio, with whatever help I can manage to pay for out of my own pocket, and whatever assistance I can get donated from friends and colleagues. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u0027s where Patreon comes in! \u00a0If you love VR as much as I do, you understand the need our little gaming niche has for new, innovative, and high quality content. \u00a0We need to prove to the nay-sayers that VR isn\u0027t a fad - it\u0027s finally here, it\u0027s for real, and we\u0027re going to make it amazing. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got some truly fantastic talent at my fingertips, and a lot of these people have donated all of their contributed efforts so far without a dime of compensation. \u00a0I would love to be able to pay them, not to mention, afford to hire or commission some additional code and art support. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything you\u0027re willing to donate would help leaps and bounds in making this game a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegular behind the scenes videos will be released, as well as podcasts discussing VR and the gaming industry, and games development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will also get access to alpha builds of the game and help with play testing! \u00a0Feedback is always welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003eJustin Moravetz\u003c/strong\u003e is the Lead Developer and Founding Member of Zero Transform and was the primary creator of the previous VR title, Proton Pulse. Proton Pulse was originally a demo from the early days of Oculus Rift showcasing an arcade style game with intuitive headtracking control. Inspired by the initial spark of VR from the early 1990s, Proton Pulse has since then become a full-fledged game and is a love letter to that era.\u003cbr\u003eJustin has recently departed his game production career of nearly 10 years where he worked on titles such as Syphon Filter Logan\u0027s Shadow, Resistance Retribution, Uncharted Golden Abyss and more, to pursue his dream of VR development. He believes VR is uncharted territory where new experiences are waiting to be invented. Dreams become reality and reality becomes dreams. He is also an avid chip tune composer, particle effects animator, and voider of warranties. His motto is \"Good things come to those who wait. Great things come to those who pursue.\"\u003cbr\u003e",
