Thank you also for your wonderful support over the last few years as I have experimented with my creativity - and continue to experiment - which is where this Patreon thing comes in. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince I started sharing my creative journey back in 2015, I have been blown away by the incredibly positive feedback and amazing encouragement from my family, friends, supporters and fellow artists. It\u2019s been so wonderful to able to share what I\u2019m creating, and now this is me taking the next step towards creating even bigger, more awesome artwork to share with you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nSo what\u0027s patreon? If this is your first time hearing about it, here\u0027s the lowdown:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re a fan of of my artwork and want to support me in the creation of new paintings, projects, exhibitions and possible future tutorials/teaching and other random, probably sometimes confusing art-things, this is the place. If you know my work, you have probably noticed that I love birds and wildlife art, but sometimes I\u2019ll do something a bit different and more \u201cfrom the heart\u201d. As much as I\u2019d like all my artwork to come from an intuitive heartfelt place, the downside of that is that it doesn\u2019t always create consistent income.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEven though I ADORE the small artwork I\u2019m currently creating, I feel that I often play it safe and make small artworks on paper because A) the materials are cheap and B) I don\u2019t have to be as vulnerable or put as much heart and soul into a small artwork of a pretty bird.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have visions of creating these beautiful HUGE oil paintings, but hold myself back because of the expensive materials and the fear of creating work which people might not like. Just the cost of materials for a big painting can add up to hundreds of dollars, and that\u2019s before you consider the insane number of hours which goes into the actual creation of the painting. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nSo, there\u2019s a way you can help me out with this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon provides an opportunity for you (if you like what I\u2019m putting out to the world and want more) to support me while I delve into new interesting places with my art without the pressure of worrying about whether or not the work will make any money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ll be very honest and say that there\u2019s this icky feeling of asking for charity, and I want to say to myself \u201chow dare you ask for support!\u201d. But when I let go of the story that I don\u2019t have anything of value to share with the world, I see that what I\u2019m asking for isn\u2019t charity. It\u2019s simply asking for support from people who ALREADY love what I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s about REWARDING them, and it\u2019s so I can share with them what I\u2019m imagining and dreaming of creating.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf this sounds as awesome to you as it does to me, click on the Become A Patron button. You can change your pledge or cancel any time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m so grateful you took the time to see what I\u2019m up to. \u003cbr\u003e\nThank you! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nxx\u003cbr\u003e\nZoe\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
