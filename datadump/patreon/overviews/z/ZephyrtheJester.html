    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHello\n there! My name is Riley \"Zephyr the Jester\" Zumwalt, and I am a \nliveblogger currently reviewing shows on Tumblr. I began the hobby with \nthe singular goal of bringing enjoyment to those who read my blog, and \nthat has not changed since I began the journey on 12/31/16.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://zephyrthejester.tumblr.com/Master\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLink to my blog here!\u003c/a\u003e On this page, you will see a master list of all shows I have covered, and clicking those links will take you to a list of individual episodes for those shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo\n date, I have created comprehensive liveblogs of four shows, and had \nquick reviews of two, and am currently making strong progress through \nanother. I currently spend two hours every single day covering thirty minutes\u0027 worth of television content, then spend a few more hours hanging out on \u003ca href=\"https://zephyrthejester.tumblr.com/AboutMe\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy Discord.\u003c/a\u003e Of course, I do need to take breaks here and there, but never longer than a few days. My dream is to continue following this passion for the rest of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why have I created a Patreon? The way I view it, this is \nequivalent to a busker on the corner of a street laying his open guitar \ncase before him. To me, liveblogging and fostering a wonderful community\n in \u003ca href=\"https://zephyrthejester.tumblr.com/AboutMe\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy Discord\u003c/a\u003e are its own rewards... But I can\u0027t deny that it is taxing on my stamina. Liveblogging is a huge part of my life, and I\u0027ve found that it may just be my calling. The thought of making this a potential full-time job is my most hopeful dream, but getting any return from it would be marvelous, and would help me continue liveblogging for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll\n donations will go into bettering my blog and my personal well-being. \nExtra USB sticks to sort files, paying for streaming services to expand \nmy potential Liveblog selection, delicious slices of pizza from the best\n pizza place in the world that\u0027s right across my street-- And maybe \ntowards a few long term goals, such as getting a proper chair to sit in,\n or purchasing the required parts to get into video game livestreaming \nor live video reactions to shows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading. And should you choose to become my patron, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Regardless, I hope you enjoy my content for years to come!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
