This will allow my coaching services to be more efficient and will really help me in the long run. If you are interested in becoming a student, you can check out the reward levels below. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor any new players who are interested in becoming a patron, but not really sure if it\u2019s the right place for you, I\u2019ll give a rundown of how lessons usually work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFirst and foremost, players of all skill levels are welcome. I\u2019ve coached all types of players, from those who are just getting into the scene to veteran, top-level players.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSome of the PGR players I have coached in the past or that I\u0027m currently coaching are Tweek, Elegant, Cosmos, Lima, Darkshad, Tyroy, 6wx, Ryuga, CharliedaKing, Light, and many more.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ve taught over 350 unique players, and I currently have a private discord dedicated solely to my students. By becoming a patron, you\u0027ll be given access to my server where you can practice with others on Wifi, gain matchup advice/experience for any character, theory-craft with like-minded players, discuss the metagame, and improve your mindset. The ZekEsports discord is also a place to make friends, so come join our little family!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDuring your lesson, you can choose to either play me on Wifi or analyze a prerecorded set, in which we will dissect and discuss your gameplay. Following each of these, you will be given a write-up of important notes and a general summary of the lesson. The lesson can also be recorded and uploaded for you if you\u2019d like!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThanks again for coming and checking out my Patreon!
