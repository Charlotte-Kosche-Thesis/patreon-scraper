Over time, it has literally become a piece of internet history, preserving over 20,000 files ranging from little known emulators to game development utilities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently Zophar\u0027s Domain has also become one of the largest websites for preserving video game music, in its original form, extracted from the games, or converted as MP3 files. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe the future of the site is free of advertising. However, the site currently incurs considerable server costs, as the site\u0027s total file size including one backup amounts to 15TB (yes, that\u0027s 15,000 GB!). As you can imagine, the amount of data transferred is also considerable. I ask for your patronage in order to pay for the server costs while the site is ad free. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also believe that even as an archive, Zophar\u0027s Domain needs to be developed and worked on, not abandoned. The site needs a new layout, one that is hopefully better adapted to modern needs. There are certain issues in the backend that need to be fixed and features developed further to make the adding of new content easier. I would also like to develop and expand new sections like I\u0027ve done with the music section. I ask for your patronage in order to continue development of the site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZophar\u0027s Domain is a free website. What we have to give, we give you for free. So as our patron, I hope you are satisfied with the warm fuzzy feeling that you can get only by keeping a piece of internet history alive and kicking :)\u003cbr\u003e"
