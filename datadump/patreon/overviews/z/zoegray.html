    "summary": "Hey! My name is Zoe Gray, I\u2019m 15, and I write music and post it on Youtube. I write music about everything from the zombie apocalypse to the joy of rollerskating to dismantling the patriarchy. Oh, and also love and feelings and growing up. I can be normal when I want to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMaybe you\u2019re thinking: \u201cHey! This sounds cool. I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s going on, but I totally want to support this girl because she sounds awesome and her music (which I listened to on her\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSSmDOcHXiyjibPsqtaWKYQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYoutube page\u003c/a\u003e) is also of the awesome variety. What is Patreon and how does it work?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatron is a crowdfunding platform, not dissimilar to Kickstarter. It\u2019s like Kickstarter in that it\u2019s a way to support and directly fund an artist who you think is rad through the internets, allowing them to work independently. But where Kickstarter\u2019s goal is to fund one large project, Patreon harkens back to the \u201cpatronage\u201d system of Ye Olden Times, in which a sponsor, or \u201cpatron\u201d, could show their love for an artist\u2019s work through ongoing support and funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nApplicable example: you hit that button right over there and pledge to give me a certain amount of money every time I write a song. So then I write it, publish the video on Youtube for your enjoyment, and that money you pledged goes to me, to aid me in continuing to write more songs in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow I\u2019m going to imagine that you\u2019re thinking: \u201cDon\u2019t I already get those things for free? Are you going to start charging for all of your songs?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo which I reply with a big friendly \u201cNope!\u201d The videos I post will continue to be free of charge, so there\u2019s absolutely no obligation to support me. But, if you want to be a good person and help a young girl and her ventures, by all means step right up! I\u2019ll even sweeten the pot and reward you depending on how much money you pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSee that rewards page down there, right under this? That\u2019s where it comes in. For every \u201cx\u201d amount of money you send me, you\u2019ll not only get a sense of moral fulfillment and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.actionforhappiness.org/10-keys-to-happier-living/do-things-for-others/details\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebecome happier in the long run\u003c/a\u003e (you\u2019re really helping YOURSELF, not just me), you\u2019ll also get a little bonus in the form of \u201cy\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cY\u201d might be a shoutout on my Youtube channel, access to secret songs that have never been heard before, or even a cover of a song of your choosing! It\u2019s all very exciting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd, lastly, if you know me whatsoever, that little voice in your head with whom I have become so acquainted might be saying: \u201cBut Zoe writes, like, 47 songs a week! I\u2019m gonna bleed myself dry if I have to give money for every single video she posts.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGuess what? I have a solution to that, too. Just call me your magical solution fairy from now on. You can put a cap on your contributions and funding! So, even if I do manage to record and publish the 47 songs I write every week, you will only pay up to your limit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis has been a very long and meandering spiel about why you should use Patreon to support me, and I worry that if I write any more you\u2019ll grow so tired of me you won\u2019t want to listen to any of my music again, therefore defeating the purpose of this entire thing, so I\u2019ll wrap it up with this: thank you so much. It\u2019s my life dream to be a professional musician, and, with your help, I\u2019m determined to make it happen. Go hard or go home, my bros.\u003cbr\u003e"
