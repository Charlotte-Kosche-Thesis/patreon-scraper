I\u00b4ve been drawing since 16 years, but with breaks. First medium which started my passion for art was colored pencils I was gifted by my parents. It was 72 pcs set of Koh-i-Noor Polycolor artistic pencils, and was totally amazed of it! It brought me to the idea of joining University and study art there. And I managed to get there... but I had to quit whether because I didn\u00b4t agree with what kind of art I was supposed to create and because I got pregnant after finished 2nd year of school. So now when my beloved child has started visiting a kindergarden I have much more time to dedicate into art. Since we live in the age of internet, I decided to go by this long path and do my best for my big DREAM! Hope my english writing is understandable for you, Dear visitors! :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \u003cstrong\u003egoals, to be super honest,\u003c/strong\u003e are to make living for my thing-art, later also living for myself. :)\u003cbr\u003eWant to create here some \u003cstrong\u003eserious and good quality feed\u003c/strong\u003e for you, and wanna get better and better at it!\u003cbr\u003eIn future, I want to also \u003cstrong\u003erecord videos (work in progress, tutorials)\u003c/strong\u003e here, but I am not so confident about my english, so I have to solve this to please you and to make it interesting for you and to please or maybe teach something ones of you who are putting hope in my skills!:)\u003cbr\u003eI can\u00b4t even express how thankful I am to those of you who decided to support me and my stuff! I can tell you I am prepared to express my thanks through prints of my artworks or mini originals done especially for you, Dear Patrons, but in future times when we form a great community there are some more special and unique rewards in plan as well.\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMEDIUMS I AM CREATING WITH:\u003cbr\u003e1. Colored pencils: \u003c/strong\u003eVery slow and delicate technique. It also teaches me how to be patient, focused, but the results are worth it. I am still learning, but you can see here on my page I did a progress, and it is not all! Wanna get as good as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Watercolors: \u003c/strong\u003eNot a proffesional, but like to make some quick-dos w them, and also as first layer inder CPs, I know what can be created with watercolors but I am not so excited about it to work hard on my technique, maybe it will change, who knows? :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3 Ink and Liners: \u003c/strong\u003eI love these, for sketchink, and love to practising shading with the finest liners available, always was fascinated how realistic a drawing can be just done with ink liners!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis is the most important to say about my artworks, because I suppose visual aspect is much more important so I won\u00b4t make you bored with long texts!:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/dkskRS/IMG_1983.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
