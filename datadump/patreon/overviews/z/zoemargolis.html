    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Zoe Margolis. You might know me from my \u003ca href=\"http://girlwithaonetrackmind.blogspot.co.uk/\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/VonhxHGSs1\"\u003ebooks\u003c/a\u003e Girl With A One Track Mind. Yes, they were all about sex. My journalism, published in the Guardian, Observer, New Statesman, Telegraph, Cosmopolitan, and others, includes topics such as online privacy, feminism, sex, film, running and mental health. I\u2019ve also done bits and bobs for Channel 4, ITV, BBC, BBC Radio 4 \u0026amp; 5, on a variety of subjects. If you follow me on \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/girlonetrack\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, you know I swear prolifically, am extremely sarcastic, post many cat photos, and have amazing hair.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve set up this Patreon because I want to offer people access to all my new work. Here\u2019s why:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) I have unpublished writing which has no home, because it doesn\u0027t fit on my Girl With A One Track Mind blog (though some of it is about sex) and is not right for a national paper (though there are journalistic pieces). I\u2019m going to post these on Patreon, and produce regular, updated content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) I really miss daily blogging, sharing silly observations, and engaging directly with readers. I want to test out new writing and expand on those ideas, and I\u2019d like to offer snippets of that with people who enjoy my work. Yes, I will allow comments BTL: please be nice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3)  I am creating a podcast (on film, art, theatre, sex, objectification, and other topics), and am inviting other commentators/experts to contribute.  I have borrowed equipment for now, but I will soon need to buy my own microphones and editing software, as well as hire studio space and pay contributors, and Patreon will enable all this to happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4) I plan to host some exclusive, private film screenings + Q\u0026amp;As. These will include classic genre films and possibly some new releases. If you know my work, you know I LOVE film: these events should be loads of fun. Tickets will initially only be available to Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5) Patreon will free me up to work on the things that I really want to make happen. Right now, that\u0027s the screenplay of my book. If you\u0027d like to see Girl With A One Track Mind, the film, as a counterbalance to the sexism and tackiness of 50 Shades of Grey, then I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting me. This is my main writing project and I will post draft material exclusively for Patrons as I go along.\u003cbr\u003e"
