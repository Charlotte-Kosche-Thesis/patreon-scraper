Thank you so much for making your way to our Patreon page. We have some really big plans for the future and we are asking you to be a part of it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis website is managed by WillieJ, 3pac\u0027s brother, and a few other ZHG members. Our intention is to to continue spreading the hootless lifestyle: help people not give a hoot about things that\u0027s distract them from being their self or living to their fullest potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks everyone for the opportunity to earn your financial support. We don\u0027t expect or assume anyone will contribute any more to our initiatives than simply follow our social media posts. We appreciate that by itself. But if you feel like contributing more, it\u0027ll all go back into producing the 3pac Tribute Documentary.... read below to find out more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE STORY: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter my brother Ryan passed away, I received hundreds of messages from fans who told me how my brother\u2019s character 3pac and his message to give Zero Hoots helped them overcome difficult times of depression, anxiety, and, in some cases, even suicide. After witnessing the strength of his following, the Zero Hoots Gang (ZHG), as they maintained momentum and unity after his passing, I realized there is something incredibly powerful behind his brand Zero Hoots. Through this documentary, I\u2019ve decided to go on a journey across the country, and discover what 3pac and Zero Hoots means to the ZHG. I will drive over 20k miles in a van and meet ZHG members from all different walks of life. In the course of this journey, I hope to understand why my brother dedicated his life to promote his mantra Zero Hoots and what it means to the ZHG. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DUVN2sTU0AApr08.jpg:large\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY WE ARE MAKING THIS FILM: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that this film has the opportunity to be healing, interesting, and impactful in many ways. First, it will help heal the ZHG, who lost a good friend and a valuable light of inspiration. This documentary will help the ZHG continue to feel 3pac\u2019s energy and know that his spirit will carry on. Also, this film will clarify 3pac\u2019s mission and the meaning of Zero Hoots. Like many artists, 3pac and his mission wasn\u2019t easy to understand on a surface level. This documentary will dig deeper into the message of his character and brand Zero Hoots. In addition, this documentary aims to be impactful by helping new people understand Zero Hoots and, similar to the current ZHG, help them overcome any trials and tribulations they might have in their own life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHEMES OF THE FILM:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eLearn about 3pac and his rise to fame\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnderstand his mantra Zero Hoots and why it is important to the ZHG\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDiscover how we can continue his legacy and carry his spirit\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis film will appeal to a wide audience, including 3pac\u2019s fans, those that resonate with the mantra Zero Hoots, and people who might want to shed some hoots themselves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
