     "about": "zoe | juniper creations exist at the intersection of dance, installation and video technology. We dissolve barriers between art, artist and audience by challenging expectations of perception and making space for empathy and connection. Collaborating with artists from diverse fields, we employ a specific, singular combination of bodies, light, sound and sculpture to realize each project. When teaching our approach parallels our process: it is collaborative, experimental and rigorous. Our process nurtures play, a creative exploration where disruptions reveal new, exciting avenues. Rather than targeting a specific product, our work exists in a perpetual state of becoming. Through constant reframing and reinvention, we access a realm of liminality specific to the convergence of each element in a moment. Our art is a glimpse into this place of fleeting magic.",
