I am a Freelance Motion Graphics Artist based in London. I have been freelance here for 2 years after working in a studio for a couple years - In this time I have worked for some of the biggest companies and Brands in the world (If you are interested in knowing more please see my site www.imzola.com) and now I want to share some of the things I\u0027ve learned with you (techniques \u0026amp; insight).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m starting a \u00a0Patreon campaign to revive my making tutorials for programs from the Adobe Suite and Cinema 4D. In my heyday many people used to watch my Mograph tutorials, but I had to cut them short due to life and work getting in the way of what was a hobby I quite enjoyed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did receive many messages from people when I stopped doing them, and while I do feel bad about it I simply can not justify taking time out of what little spare time I had to do them with the minimal income that Youtube was providing as like everyone I have grown up and have bills to pay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy content is and always will be free, but by pledging to me I will be able to justify recording these tutorials as right now I just can\u0027t justify it financially, and even more so I will take greater care and make more in-depth tutorials and respond directly to my patron\u0027s tutorial requests - You want to know how to do something? I\u0027ll do a tutorial on that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will engage on a personal levels with all my patrons if this really takes off and will be offering lots of cool bonuses (see goals \u0026amp; rewards)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoooo I guess the question is, who wants to learn about Motion Graphics from someone in the industry?!\u003cbr\u003e"

This could lead to a job who knows? \u003cstrong\u003eThis Perk obviously replaces the 2-Hour Session from the $19.99 Pack. You only get 48 hours, not 50. Please note this does not guarantee you will become an amazing editor or Mograph Artist! The job still requires talent and an eye for detail as well as a great work ethic; what it does mean is that you will know the program(s) inside out and you have the platform to get an internship or job! This offer lasts for the 12 months after you purchase it only - If you do not contact me for several of those months, they are gone forever, they do not carry over, this should not be a problem as long as you keep in touch with me of course.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003eIf you get this package I want to personally say I love you and we will make sure you are equipped with the tools to get the role in the industry you want to be in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e",
