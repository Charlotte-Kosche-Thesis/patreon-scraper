    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xkqaGFA.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\nThe Tiny Arcade by Tiny Circuits is an awesome small Arduino compatible gaming console that deserves more games. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy aren\u0027t there more games available?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMaking games is not exactly simple for this platforms for many reasons. The limitations can be daunting to accept but also, there is no real market for selling games for this type of device. The games made so far are made by hobbyists like me who often lack time and resources to make more games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat games do I have in mind?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThese are the games I have released for the Tiny Arcade: \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003eAsteroids\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OtNhsyK.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTiny Invader\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lmM6c83.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTiny Run\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zVBpaO9.gif\" style=\"width: 202px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would like to continue making such games with more or less similar scope - the games should remain simple.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy motivation has been quite low to continue making games despite the fact that I have created a quite sophisticated set of library functions that I can use for making games. And while creating those games was certainly fun, but it\u0027s also taking time, money and energy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is where YOU come into my plan:\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eEnergy: I can be quite energetic as long as I am motivated. But having no feedback by players is quite annoying. It would be nice to have a few people showing real interest in what I do and sharing their opinion about my work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMoney: While my full time job keeps us (I have a family to feed) afloat, it can be difficult to justify spending money on hardware such as the Tiny Arcades (I have multiple). Generating a bit of an additional income helps me to keep my hardware up to date without arguing about the sense of why I absolutely need this.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTime: While I can not generate more free time to work on this, the previous two points create a sense of obligation for me so that I reserve my time for the Tiny Arcade projects\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat\u0027s the plan exactly?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI want to start small: One small game every three months. You, my Patreon, pay for each released game I do. You can set a maximum amount of money you want to spend. So you only pay when I deliver.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe games I make will be open source and I will make them available on GitHub. I will supply the binaries as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn case that this is working and that I am receiving more money per game released, I will increase my effort in order to release more games in a shorter amount of time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNext to that I intend to make making of videos where I go into details of how the game is created.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eDepending on how much you want to spend you will\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eget mentioned in the credits of the games released (depends on technical ability to show this in the games properly\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ecan vote on what game I should work on next\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003emake suggestions what games should be on the list to vote on\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ebe able to see what the current progress of development is and giving me direct feedback on that\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eGame ideas\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul style=\"\"\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eMicro VektoRoids: An asteroids like shooter\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTiny Race: A top-down racing game\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTiny Tino: A jump\u0027n\u0027run game\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eSmall Snakes: A snakes game\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMicro Worms: A worms game clone (must think of another game probably)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e"
