I am Tyler White, but I go by \"Zaezar\" basically everywhere I possibly can so I would ask you to call me by that if you can. Zae works too if you want to seem more personal! I am an artist that specializes in anthro character artwork. I like to joke saying I am a safe for work furry pinup artist, since that is often how my work veers. I do three streams a week on Twitch where I entertain whoever may want to show up and watch me work. That I have been keeping a weekly schedule for over 6 years now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do I do? As I said a second ago I am an anthro artist. \"Furry\" artwork if that suits your tastes better. I don\u0027t judge. I tend to focus my time on single character \"pinups\" and character development pieces. I tend to try whatever I come across if I feel I can learn from it. Because of this you will see animations, paintings in digital and ink, icons, writings, and a ton of other things in my gallery. But pinup-like things are where I spend the most time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I want to accomplish is to be able to make my artwork full time. That is a bit more difficult to do with a job taking up a lot of time, or with commission work being my main source of income. I would love to have support to sell items at conventions and support myself through only artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most important questions though. \"Why Patreon?\" Its simple, actually. While I love working with others on commissioned pieces it doesn\u0027t leave any time for personal projects. If I make all my income working on other people\u0027s characters it leaves precious little time for my own work. Not even counting for how unreliable living on commission wages can be. Patreon is the way for me to have a more reliable, steady income for the other artwork. The stuff that no single person would pay for my time for me to produce. The goals are set up to be about where my rent, utilities, and general costs of living should be. Each one makes it all the more possible that I can make these passion projects a reality. And you all get rewards along the way. Like I said, I love working on other people\u0027s characters too! So for being willing to give me a stable income you get basically discounted commission spots once a month. Along with a wallpaper piece each month that you can help vote for!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you need to contact me for your reward related to your tier, you can either message me on whatever art site you found me on (I will need some proof you are you the first time you message me though!). That, or just send an email to \u003cstrong\u003eZaezardraws@gmail.com\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eusing the same email you use on Patreon. You can also send any questions about the Patreon page or reward tiers to that address as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you made it to this point. Thank you for spending the time to read through all of this! I hope you have a wonderful day today.\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"

If you ever see me around, I will doodle you a thing as a thank you for being a Patron! Literally just prove you are you and I will doodle you a thing.
