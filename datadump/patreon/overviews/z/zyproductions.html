    "summary": "Good day all, as you may already know, I make videos of gear reviews, guides, and personal opinions on my YouTube channel. The main reason I make these videos is because I hope that through sharing what I know, it can benefit more people with similar interests and passion. My primary goal is to make videos that are helpful to the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, making these videos will incur significant costs. Many of the units I review on the channel were bought using personal funds. The production equipment used to make the videos also cost a lot.\u00a0With your support, I will be able to produce better quality content, and be able to travel to different locations to film on-location videos, not to mention acquire more items to review and share about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith myself still being a film student, I do not have a day job, meaning I have very limited funds to work with. Any support to the channel will be highly appreciated, especially if you like what I do on the channel and find my videos helpful. Your support comes a long way in helping me keep creating quality videos that are helpful to the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
