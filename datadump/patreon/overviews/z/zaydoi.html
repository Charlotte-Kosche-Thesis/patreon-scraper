I may have delved a bit into poetry during my adolescent years, but not even once did I think to consider that I develop my writing skills to the point of it becoming one of my greater passions, let alone establish myself as a writer among a certain community on Tumblr.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now, the goal for this account isn\u0027t anything particularly ambitious: I\u0027m content with my writing being something of a side hustle, with me making a relatively small amount in compensation for what is merely a hobby first and foremost. However, if there were ever a long-term goal, it would be to one day be able to make a humble living for doing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kinkythiings.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe thing I probably love doing the most.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e_________________________\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor those of you who follow my porn blog \u003cem\u003eKINKYTHIINGS\u003c/em\u003e, I thank you as well. And I encourage you for your support just as much as I encourage those who follow me for my writing. Your help will assist me in creating gifs and promoting the filthy content I love to consume, and also enable me with the ability to support the people responsible for creating said filth.\u003cbr\u003e"
