As a child she gripped the whittled sticks left behind from campfires, and used their charred ends to tell stories that no one would be able to decipher for years to come, but it was undeniable that she found meaning in the scribbled markings left behind on the trees. These markings can still be found, though few dare to venture into the mysterious murk and wilderness that is her homeland.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOthers say that she was born to a life of science fiction and books. As she grew her insistence that just because you grow old does not mean that you have to grow up, lead her to a life in pursuance of creating stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that would be silly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, she has integrated into human life, but has refused to forsake her roots of the wild, of the fantastical. She clings to them by crafting stories, podcasts, videos and paintings, anything she can to bring back the rush of the swampland magicks that spawned her imagination. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------------------------------\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! I honestly hate writing bios, and when I get frustrated I make them ridiculous in order to get out of my frustration. Thanks for sticking with me! My name is Zo\u00eb Mikel-Stites and I\u2019m a storyteller. Now, that\u2019s a very broad term, but it is the most accurate to what I do. I write (podcasts, short stories, a book eventually) and paint, among a myriad of other hobbies. To me these are all just different ways of telling stories. Sometimes  these mediums end up being abstract and strange, but that\u2019s usually my favorite. My dream is to one day be a full time content creator, and to be able to inspire those who may look for non-traditional ways to be creatively supported.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI release a podcast episode once a month, where the patrons get to decide the next major step for the characters at the end of each episode, prior to it being posted on my personal website, and I release short stories on a regular basis, as well as rough drafts and updates on my ongoing projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Patreon is a platform  much like kickstarter where you can support your favorite artists on a monthly basis. As a thank you for that support, there are different perks you will receive depending on what level you choose. For $1 a month, you get access to my patron only feed, among other things, and at $2, I will write you a thank you card (again, among other things). There are of course other rewards levels, so please check out the list to the right of this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for even considering supporting my work. Let\u2019s find out what we can create together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFgJV1kB2cFu35KrDD9VkXA/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
