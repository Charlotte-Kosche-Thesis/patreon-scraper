    "summary": "my name is \u003cstrong\u003ezak sally\u003c/strong\u003e. i do a lot of stuff, but mostly i\u0027m a cartoonist.\u003cbr\u003ethis Patreon is for a specific project: the completion of my comic book (or \"Graphic Novel\") biography of surrealist/ science fiction writer \u003cstrong\u003ePhilip K. Dick\u003c/strong\u003e. the working title is \u003cstrong\u003ePINK LIGHT\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethis is a project i have been knocking around in my head and note/ planning form for somewhere around 15 years. i have always known that the time and effort needed to actually do this book justice would take a concerted and sustained effort on my part that is well beyond my \"normal\" practice (i.e get it done whenever you can, fitting in work time between work that actually pays the bills).\u003cbr\u003ei feel like that\u0027s the single largest factor that has kept me from attacking this project, over the years: \"\u003cem\u003ewhen\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e am i gonna find the time to \u003cem\u003edo this right\u003c/em\u003e?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebut: about 6 months ago, i knuckled down and said screw it i\u0027m doing it. \u003cbr\u003eand now i am, guns blazing.\u003cbr\u003eit\u0027s going great: fully structured, rough pencils and script for over 50% of the book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e but here\u0027s what i\u0027m learning:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1)\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ei was right: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eit is an enormous undertaking\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2)\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ei need to get it done, in as focussed and single-minded manner as i am able.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e this needs every bit of dedicated, concerted effort i can give it. right now it\u0027s looking like it will be 175-200 extremely dense pages, and the research and reading necessary to do this justice is a full time job in and of itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) \u003cem\u003emy PKD book is going to be very \u003c/em\u003egood\u003cem\u003e, and i was born to do it\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for any of you out there who are Philip K. Dick fans, or know something about the story of his life, or the scope of his writing and inquiry, you know that....there is no conceivable excuse for half-assing a book about him. the material demands much, much more than that. and there are some very specific things about the Comic form that really resonate with the telling PKD\u0027s work and life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeadlines are a good thing, and so mine is to \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eget this done and published before the \"Sequel\" to Blade Runner comes out in July 2018\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e (it\u0027s as good a deadline as any, and Hollywood\u0027s track record with PKD ain\u0027t so great, so my book might provide a small antidote to whatever they cook up).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003enow, having been a weirdo/ fringe cartoonist for 25 years now, i have very few illusions about what i do and how i do it. but this book is different, and demands something different than \"fit it between other stuff\".\u00a0could i do it that way? yup.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003edo i want to, and would it make for \u003cem\u003ea better book about Philip K. Dick\u003c/em\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eabsolutely not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethat\u0027s what this Patreon is for-- to get this book completed, as soon as possible.\u003cbr\u003ethe metric here is very simple-- the more i can raise here to support the creation of the book, the sooner i can get it done, and you can read it. if i could work on this book full-time, doing nothing else, it\u0027d be done in a year. sooner, if i hit a hot streak.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei\u0027m assuming if you are supporting this you\u0027d rather have me working on the book than anything else-- but\u00a0there are some cool rewards i came up with, all of which don\u0027t necessitate a lot of time away from \u00a0the drawing table for me, but hopefully still enable me to share the process/ progress on the book in real time through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003eas i mention in the video, i\u0027m also really interested in hearing from other PKD fans/ scholars/ etc like myself, and getting feedback through the process of making this book. there is no single, definitive PKD story, and i\u0027d like to hear as many of them as possible. my hope is that this Patreon might very well provide a platform for those stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eso there it is, and here i am.\u003cbr\u003ethanks for your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--zak sally\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
