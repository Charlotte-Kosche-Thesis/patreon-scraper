    "summary": "Like a lot of people, I\u0027m passionate about music. I\u0027m also passionate about potential, about \u003cstrong\u003enew\u003c/strong\u003e music. I used to despair at the lack of access to great music (lousy radio and now safe apps that keep it cozy): We all like the music we latched onto when we were 13-17. Fine, and yet, creativity didn\u0027t stop, people all over the world are making wonderful music, new music of every kind, that is as good or better than what we each know and love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started out with a reel-to-reel tape recorder taping the latest singles from the juke-box at University then DJ-ing parties with the reels playing between records (and allowing me to vault over and join in the dance when I wanted). Then, finding myself employed running a bank\u0027s computers I started \u003cem\u003eThe Recorded Music Society\u003c/em\u003e and hired out pubs where I played \u003cstrong\u003eThe Stranglers\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027 \"\u003cem\u003ePeaches\u003c/em\u003e\" immediately after \u003cstrong\u003eRachmaninov\u003c/strong\u003e\u0027s Piano Concerto #2 - punks and bankers - bonkers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter \u003cstrong\u003eJohn Peel\u003c/strong\u003e died and \u003cstrong\u003eMixing It\u003c/strong\u003e got axed, there was a void. I tried to fill that: 8 years later my show was listened to in 80+ countries weekly, as I brought music from 1000\u0027s of sources together for a weekly distillation of 2 hours. It takes a lot of work, databases, filters, communication and dedication and it costs money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI keep hearing from people who want the show back - it was selected as the best place anywhere on the internet to hear new music by \u003cem\u003eLouder Than War \u003c/em\u003e- To bring back the show I need to, at least, cover my costs (up to $50 a week not including my 10-25 hours).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please become a Patron - it\u0027s straightforward, and you control it - all amounts are much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s get the show back on air!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: Later we can do bigger things - a new studio, studio sessions, a world educational tour! Music is hope, music is both descendent and transcendent... I love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePPS: This is my MUSIC page - To get to all my Patreon\u0027s for all I create (and more ridiculous videos) \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/zaphmann?ty=h\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/zaphmann?ty=h\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for this comment: \u003cbr\u003eHet\n beste muziekprogramma dat ik in tijden heb gehoord, ik ontdekte het een\n aantal jaar geleden en ontdekte daardoor weer heel wat nieuwe, goede en\n spannende muziek; wat zou het mooi zijn als het weer terugkwam.\u003cbr\u003e"
