    "summary": "Hello,\nwelcome to my page! I am Quiet Rage, the\nWarriors analyst with a jaded, snarky attitude. You may also know me as the founder of \"Badly Translated Warriors\", the mini series that puts Warriors names and quotes through Google Translate and makes fun of the results. I am also hard at work on my brainchild, Cards Against the Warrior Code, a Cards Against Humanity deck for Warriors!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I have been a\nWarriors fan since I was a young child, and an active member of the\nfandom since I was an...oldish child. I have watched the community\ngrow from an immature, snappy people who drew stick figures, to the\nmost talented and kind fandom I\u2019ve ever known, and being a part of\nthat community fills me with joy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\nstarted my days as a Warriors fan hanging out on forums, discussing\nthe books and fiercely debating with others about diverse topics. I\nwas a devoted member of Treetop Whispers, Warriors Wish, and\nWarriors Topic, serving as a moderator for a brief time on the\nlatter. I was also a member of the official Warrior Cats forum,\nbut...that didn\u2019t last too long. Although, in the long run, I think\nthat was for the best.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tTime\nticked by, and the forums I spent so much time on slowly dissipated.\nPeople began leaving in steady streams, and the pages became ghost\ntowns. With all my real life friends losing interest in the series, I\nwas a lonely fan indeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBut\nwith the rise of truly awe-inspiring animators, so too did a few\nanalysts. Watching their videos, I noticed that with the rise of the\nanalyst genre in the Warriors fandom, it carved out a niche that\ntheir calm, rational demenours couldn\u2019t fill. Anger.\nAngry humor can be a powerful tool in the right hands, making people\nlaugh not only at the absurdity of the punchline, but the glaring\ntruth in it too. It can give a voice to others inner frustrations and\nserve as an amusing\noutlet. With my brash personality, I knew I could give the people\nthat kind of outlet, and then, I could finally connect with other\nfans again.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAnyone\nwho thinks I am unfairly hating on the Warriors series is misguided.\nI only tear down Warriors so much because I love it to bits, and I\nwant to see it realize its full potential. And\nsometimes, the only way to get your message out there is to be harsh.\u003cbr\u003e\nBut\nthat doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have fun while we\u2019re doing it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have already learned so much from my faithful fans and great friends, \nand its just amazing that so many people have devoted some of their time\n to draw new sprites for me! I can never truly express just how amazing the Warriors community is.\u003cbr\u003e"
