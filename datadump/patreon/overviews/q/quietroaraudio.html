Quiet Roar Audio is no different, hoping to invoke this \nappreciation through its musical sound design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n* * *\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eQuiet Roar Audio is self-produced by\n Eddie Dreher, a graduate of The Los Angeles Film School\u2019s Recording \nArts program.
