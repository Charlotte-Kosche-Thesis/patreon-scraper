    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify; margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI have loved comic books all my life. Compared to motion film, I\u0027ve always believed that comics , as a medium, have been one of the most crucial and potent forms of storytelling in existence. In his book,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/006097625X/?tag=mh0b-20\u0026amp;hvadid=7000478549\u0026amp;hvqmt=b\u0026amp;hvbmt=bb\u0026amp;hvdev=c\u0026amp;ref=pd_sl_9q32n9bkv8_b\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/006097625X/?tag=mh0b-20\u0026amp;hvadid=7000478549\u0026amp;hvqmt=b\u0026amp;hvbmt=bb\u0026amp;hvdev=c\u0026amp;ref=pd_sl_9q32n9bkv8_b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnderstanding Comics: The Invisible Art\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, artist and author, Scott McCloud, points out that comics have been around for well over 3,000 thousand years. McCloud cleverly references ancient Egyptians, who recorded their stories\u00a0through their ingenious development and use of pictographic heiroglyphics. In regards to film, the developmental process of storyboarding is clearly related to comics as it pertains to drafting sequential art scene shots for establishing settings and actions for directing. So to fulfill a childhood dream, I\u0027ve chosen to create comics as one of my pivotal, lifelong pursuits. In May of 2003, I established my very own imprint,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://qewpublishing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQEW Publishing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Its purpose initially was to serve as a housing entity for my creator-owned intellectual properties, many of which were compositions of independent comic book titles, affectionately referred to as\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\"works.\" \u003c/em\u003eHowever, by 2011, during the advent of online publishing, it had transitioned to become a small press, self-publishing enterprise, which effectively changed its purpose altogether. Since then, QEW Publishing has managed to maintain a tradition of releasing two to three new comic books after the first quarter of every new year. It\u0027s a tremendous, sometimes tedious, time-consuming and costly process, but assuming roles now as both creator and publisher has granted me some precious creative liberty. I\u0027m now able to do what I love: create and produce comics for comic readers who love comics, too. There\u0027s an old axiom that says, \"If you love what you do; you\u0027ll never work a day in your life.\" It\u0027s a nice quip for waxing philosophical, but creating, producing, marketing, and publishing comics, including managing all their respective production processes, entail a lot of hard collaborative work. And although it\u0027s work that\u0027s deeply loved, it\u0027s not work without its economic challenges. So that\u0027s why I humbly believe Patreon can help QEW Publishing continue its endeavor with striving to produce independent comics that strive to possess the highest quality of entertainment for those who love comics...just like me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuenton Shaw, Owner\u003cbr\u003eQEW Publishing\u003c/div\u003e"
