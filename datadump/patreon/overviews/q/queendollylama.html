I also create new characters from other doll designs.  I enjoy creating these new characters, whether realistic or fantasy and mystical like and everything else in between and around. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a fan of DIYs and figure out how to creatively make things through upcycling, recycling or making from scratch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to continue to create, recreate and reimage dolls and experiment with my creative ideas. Ultimately this pattern will help lead to the production my own doll line that I have been designing. \u00a0I want to produce a line of dolls that can represent well and also will inspire and allow those who purchase them to be creative and develop their own unique characters stories.  Imagination and creativity has no age, it keeps you happy, vibrant, youthful and healthy in mind body and spirit. We are all creative by nature."

My goal is to continue to create art dolls and experiment with my ideas and creations, create visual stories and to share what I learn with those who want to get into customizing dolls of their own or those who just enjoy seeing the process of creation. \u00a0Imagination and creativity has no age, it keeps you vibrant, youthful and healthy in mind and spirit.
