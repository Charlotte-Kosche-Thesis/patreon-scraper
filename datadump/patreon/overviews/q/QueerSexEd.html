For many years, I\u0027ve wanted to help create a platform for queer voices to be heard on important topics, and I feel it\u0027s deeply powerful and important to reframe sexual health, education, and pleasure as a refuge for queer and trans people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQueer Sex Ed is not just a title, it\u0027s an imperative statement\u003c/strong\u003e. When we call to \"Queer\" Sex Ed, it is a call-to-arms for sexual health educators, schools, parents, and people in all types of relationships to intentionally \"queer\" the institutions of sexual communication, sexual health, interpersonal relationships, and relationship structure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that we must turn sex ed on its head. Even when sex ed is at its best, it is often (intentionally or unintentionally) exclusionary of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender queer, gender fluid, and agender people, polyamorous people, asexual people, people with disabilities, and so many more social groups who engage in just as many relationships as straight, cisgender, monogamous people, but are forced to do so through uncharted waters, lack of media representation, and massive social stigma.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore information about the creator of Queer Sex Ed:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Sara and I have been a sexual health and LGBTQ educator for 8 years. I began as a freshman in college with the Community Health department, then as a full-time professional doing sexual assault prevention education for a year after graduation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my professional life, I conduct workplace and school workshops about LGBTQ communities and allyship for businesses, non-profits, and conferences. I am a queer, sex-positive, non-monogamous woman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have seen countless times in my personal and professional life how a lack of open, honest communication about sex, relationships, power, sexual violence, and gendered expectations hurt people I love and their partners. I feel that the lessons I\u0027ve learned and people I\u0027ve met in non-monogamous, sex positive communities can help all people develop tools to better navigate relationships, pleasure, body positivity, and authentic desire, even for people who are monogamous, non-kinky, straight, and married.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that open conversations about desire, autonomy, and the ability to hear rejection\u00a0in all relationships can help build a world that is based on mutual support and authentic desire instead of one based on assumptions, projections, and resentment over unfulfilled (and unvoiced) needs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo many of us are afraid to ask for what we want, or even explore what we might want in the first place, because we live in a culture where sexual pleasure and communication are taboo, scary, and so often, something we never learn about in high school, college, or adulthood. I want to change that by normalizing conversations about sex and relationships with space for mistakes, learning, growth, and fearless communication. Would you like to grow with me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I think of lovers as trees,\u003cbr\u003eGrowing to and from one another\u003cbr\u003eSearching for the same light\"\u003cbr\u003e- \u003ca href=\"http://lithub.com/on-the-poet-warsan-shire-nobodys-little-sister/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWarsan Shire\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@QSE/when-you-say-i-would-never-date-a-trans-person-its-transphobic-here-s-why-aa6fdcf59aca\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClick here to read more content by Sara on Medium\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
