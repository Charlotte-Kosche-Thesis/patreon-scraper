    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eMikey\u003c/strong\u003e, also known as \u003cstrong\u003equantumdot\u003c/strong\u003e around the internet. I\u0027ve been playing tabletop roleplaying games for over a year now, and I\u0027ve always been interested in designing systems and games--which is probably why I\u0027ve fallen in love with tabletop RPG design. For me, designing TTRPGs is the perfect marriage of creative outlets like art, graphic design, world-building, and systems design, all wrapped up in a pretty accessible package! Not everyone can play a video game, but anyone who\u0027s interested can read a document.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been designing TTRPGs for little over a year now. When I started, I was doing it in secret or streaming bits and pieces of development here and there on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitch.tv/quantumdot\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitch channel\u003c/a\u003e. However, I wanted to open up the development process, both for interested folks to see my work and to give feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll content posted will be made public to followers after a period of Early Access; please see the \u003cstrong\u003eRewards \u003c/strong\u003epanel for details. I want everyone to be able to see my work and participate in the feedback process, whether they can contribute monetarily or not. Currently I\u0027m working on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy \u003cem\u003eForged\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0in the Dark\u003c/em\u003e game, \u003cstrong\u003eNo Place Like Home\u003c/strong\u003e, about exploring the secrets in small communities that hide behind well-meaning smiles and closed doors. This hack is inspired by things such as Twin Peaks, Silent Hill, Stranger Things, Oxenfree, Night in the Woods, and much more.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDungeons \u0026amp; Faction Turns\u003c/strong\u003e, a lightweight hack based on Kevin Crawford\u0027s faction turn system, designed for Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons or Dungeon World campaigns.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e...and more stuff coming down the line!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for stopping by my page. I hope you consider following and supporting me in my pursuit to design and develop tabletop RPGs! I look forward to seeing what we can make together."
