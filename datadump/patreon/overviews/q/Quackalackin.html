I am currently a college student with aspirations of making a decent streaming channel that all can enjoy, as well as a D.Va main that plays at the highest level of Overwatch competitive play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I have grown up surrounded by video games, and have been ultimately sculpted by their presence in my life. They have not only been the things that occupy my empty time, but also the doors that have opened and lead me to long lasting friendships that I would not otherwise have found. I cherish their existence, and the abilities that they have to not only bring people together, but to craft communities of like minded individuals, and be the rays of sunlight that cast away the darkness of day to day life. I too, in conjunction with games such as Overwatch, hope to have the same impact on other people\u0027s lives, and bring about positivity in a community that currently suffers from an alarming amount of toxicity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I am creating this Patreon is because certain individuals have deemed me worthy of receiving their support. I still personally do not feel as though this is the truth, for I have not reached the standards that I believe warrant such a gesture. I will leave this up to you guys though to decide. If you do decide to support me, do know that I am truly grateful for that. And any contributions will go towards keeping me alive, keeping the stream alive, and upgrading components to make quality better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
