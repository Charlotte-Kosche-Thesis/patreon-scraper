    "summary": "Hi All!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt means the world to me that I can thrive while being able to follow my deepest creative whims and share them with you!  I sing, write lyrics and blogs, produce, mix my own music from start to finish, and am currently working on my first album.  (Patrons here get to be the FIRST to preview tracks and get other material that NO ONE ELSE does!)  With my background in dance, writing, and stage acting, I want to make more thought-out videos too, but would be better off with a videographer to help me create those, so I can more fully devote myself to the responsibilities of my own pure self expression while continuing to contribute to the Bay Area.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT ME:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI have been singing in front of audiences since I was five years old and began learning the infinite nature of music production a few years ago.  While many people have seen me dance for years, or have bought physical artworks I\u2019ve created, these things have been kept largely underground here in the Bay Area.  While creating unique experiences in venues where there is not photography or film allowed is exciting, I want to use the experience I already have to build amazing things in the light to inspire more people!  :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT YOU!  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eArt wouldn\u0027t have as much purpose without an audience to connect with it, and here, I aim to create beauty and a safe container that values the honest expression of the human experience \u2014wonders, traumas, angers and all.  Eventually I want to help teach people how they can use art not just to feel, revel in, and then release that which does not serve them, but also to use it to connect with themselves and others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile I can create wonder where there was once nothing, the fact is that this costs time and money \u2014for real! \u00a0Have you ever delved deep into what it takes to make a CD quality album?! \u00a0It will make you appreciate everything it takes to take a music project from start to finish in an entirely new way. \u00a0(And aside from creating, there are the marketing and legality parts that must also be done. \u00a0I\u0027m doin\u0027 it!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m one of those people who get creative impulses ALL THE TIME, and will run to the bathroom or my car to get an idea recorded if it needs to be.  Only the good ideas make the cut, but the point is, I\u2019m always creating where there really are infinite things to learn and breathe life into!\u003cbr\u003eWe all know that things cost money, and I have already put a lot of time and resources to get things moving on my website, \u003ca href=\"http://www.quintessamusic.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.QuintessaMusic.com\u003c/a\u003e. My inner vision is vast and my inspirations come faster than I can put them out! \u2026With your help on Patreon, I can be in a position to hire artists in my community so I can get them out faster.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePATREON IS\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u2026basically like an on-going kickstarter.  Patreon is here, not only to connect you with the juicy stuff FIRST, but to take the performances some of you have already seen to the next level!  Your support helps me have more time to create, and less time at my day job.  You help me buy new equipment faster, maintain my website, and put aside more time to mix.  I would like to pay people to master my tracks, as well, but they are anything but minimal, and the more tracks you have going on in a song, the more that tends to cost!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePatron is like my little island away from Facebook where I sometimes only share secret stuff to the people who care and support the most, and any release I have, I announce it here first.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge on my Patreon account is billed \u201cmonthly,\u201d because I prefer to put out everything I create, without feeling conflicted with the question, \u201c\u2018is this \u201cthing\u201d enough to charge whatever amount people pledge \u201cper thing\u201d?\u2019\u201d \u2026I would rather just know that I am enough and have your trust that I will always be creating things \u2014while life is unpredictable and there are reasons why great works of art take some time\u2014 you all know that trust me to share the lot of behind-the scenes work that contributes to the final release, as well as small musings for other side projects, because we all know that inspiration stays when we keep PLAYing with new ideas!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYou also know that art is essential to sanity \u2014not just the sanity of the creator, but those who connect with it in times when a song feels just what is needed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMay the Patrons here live long and prosper while enjoying their rewards.  ^_^  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMore is yet to come, but while you wait for the next thing, support my Patreon, check out my artistic musings here, and go DOWNLOAD some of my past songs on BANDCAMP for FREE! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

When something earth-shattering happens, I have to write, and probably sing and dance about it too.\u00a0 As I adapt to the world\u0027s constant fluctuations and go through life\u0027s up, downs, and crazy spirals,\u00a0I find that more and more,\u00a0it\u0027s not enough for me to just do art for myself, but share it with people who I love,\u00a0with the hope that\u00a0it will impact and empower, or at the very least\u00a0comfort someone to know that\u00a0they are not alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLIFE GOAL: to create and give, to be honest,\u00a0to be wisely cautious, but to fear nothing; do everything I possibly can (except for crack, meth, heroine, etc --fuck that shit!), to live well, be accepted for\u00a0being\u00a0myself, and to love and inspire as many people as possible.\u00a0 To live with a sense of balanced purpose and power, finding the order within chaos, and make\u00a0it\u00a0feel beautiful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditional Links: \u003ca href=\"http://www.QuintessaSpeaks.com\"\u003ewww.QuintessaSpeaks.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSoundcloud: \u003ca href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/quintessakatra\"\u003ewww.soundcloud.com/quintessakatra\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eInstagram: Quintessa_Katra\u003cbr\u003e",
