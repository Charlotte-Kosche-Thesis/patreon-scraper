I create funny, often weird and always bold comedy videos that you probably have seen somewhere on the internet. I love singing and dancing (especially in public) and want to share my love for such with all of you. Hopefully it brings a smile or laugh to you or at least causes a little-bit-of-air-out-of-your-nose type of laugh. Hopefully it lightens up your day. Maybe even inspire some of you to live more fearlessly and in the moment :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to take our videos and movement to the next level. Right now it\u0027s just my girlfriend, Edith, and I working full-time on this.

We also plan to increase the number of videos we put out per week as well as increase the production quality of our videos.  We will start by hiring 1 or 2 employees to help take on some of the workload so that Edith and I can devote more time to CREATING MORE AND BETTER CONTENT each week.  We also plan to upgrade our camera equipment so that you can really see the shock on people\u0027s faces IN DETAIL!  MUHAHAHAHA :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso on top of supporting us and providing stability and safety for a show and genre that has been increasingly demonetized and targeted on Youtube we will be:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTaking our 2-3 days a week upload scheduleand getting the channel to 7 videos a week.\u00a0 We will continue to make the videos that you love but make MORE OF IT and also allow us to get more interesting footage in different places\u00a0 (maybe even your hometown!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLaunch a podcast and a new channel so that we can show you guys the behind the scenes funny moments that you guys don\u0027t get to see and all the cringe that goes with it haha.\u00a0 We have so much extra footage that we know you will love.\u00a0 A second channel would let us be more interactive with you guys.\u00a0 We plan on doing live chats with you guys during these streams.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMOST IMPORTANTLY\u003c/strong\u003e:\u00a0 We think of you guys, #QSQUAD, as a family as well as a movement.\u00a0 More than anything we want to let you guys into our lives more and really hang with you. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!
