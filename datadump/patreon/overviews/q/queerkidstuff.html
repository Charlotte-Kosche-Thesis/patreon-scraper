    "summary": "If you Google \"what does gay mean?\" can you guess what comes up? A dictionary definition and a how-to-explain guide for parents, teachers, and other adults. But guess what isn\u0027t there. Content explaining what gay means that is made for \u003cem\u003ekids\u003c/em\u003e. I want to change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://queerkidstuff.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eQueer Kid Stuff\u003c/a\u003e is an educational webseries devoted to exploring LGBTQ+ topics in a kid-friendly way. Lindsay, a tie-wearing queer lady, and her non-binary best-stuffed friend, Teddy, answer big questions for tiny tots. It\u0027s Gender Studies 101 meets Mr. Rodgers\u2019 Neighborhood. The series is recommended for ages 3+.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe premiered our pilot episode: What Does Gay Mean? in May 2016 and everyone LOVED what we were doing! Since then, we\u0027ve released 11 new episodes for our first full season of videos and started branching out into new series of episodes including Storytime where we read LGBTQ+ picture books, Sing-a-longs of our original songs), Playdates (interviews and games with other LGBTQ+ people), and a series Just 4 Grown Ups. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to make all of this free and highly accessible content I need your help. Webseries don\u0027t grow on trees. Supporting my Patreon means you are helping me rent necessary equipment so the videos maintain their high quality, and pay the team who helps me bring these videos to life. I can\u0027t do this without your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so excited to start using this Patreon. It\u0027s different than other crowdfunding platforms because it is ongoing! You donate in smaller increments ($1-$25) and you pay \u003cem\u003eper month\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e, \u003c/em\u003ekinda like a subscription!\u00a0Neat, right? And it\u0027s all about partnering with me to make more of what we both want: MORE QUEER KID ~STUFF~!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI firmly believe in strengthening and expanding queer representation in entertainment for all ages \u2013 and I believe this is the first step in getting there. I would like to also create stories about boys who wear dresses and non-binary princesses, but educational content is an important foundational step in that process. This is how we end stigmatization of queerness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA little bit about me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a storyteller at heart.
