I love getting mail. Not email, snail mail. Hard copy mail. Mail you can save in your underwear drawer. I doubt I\u0027m alone in my fondness for handwritten letters. Most of our correspondence these days is instant and impulsive and sterile and electronic. In a handwritten letter, you can catch glimpses of what the writer decided not to say under scribbled-over text. You might have to decipher a hastily written sentence. You might wonder why one sentence was written quickly, but the next one was written neatly and deliberately. Letters are a little like music. They have pitch, tone, texture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen there\u0027s folk music, balladry, and broadsides from the England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and the United States. I\u0027ve visited this playground of words and song in my game writing and fiction writing. The timeless stories in these ballads beg for re-telling and perspective shifting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to \"sing\" the stories in those ballads and broadsides with handwritten letters, postcards, and small packages.\u00a0So in this year-long project, I will write letters to you, the patrons, and retell the stories of some of my favorite folk ballads\u00a0in this weird, old-but-new again way, and I\u0027m inviting you all to read along.\u00a0Each letter, postcard, or package will be\u00a0a piece of the story written by a character. All letters will be handwritten. No two letters will be the same, although a character might write to more than one patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I write,\u00a0I\u0027ll compile the letters in an archive so your fellow patrons can read the stories as they unfold. The archive will be both plain text and images of snippets of the letters, the postcards, and the contents of packages.\u00a0My biggest goal for this project is to develop the text of the letters and postcards into a collection of short stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe \"Playlists\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the anticipated lineup and their numbers if they are\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/child/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChild Ballads\u003c/a\u003e or in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.vwml.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRoud Folk Song Index\u003c/a\u003e. Some stories will wrap up in a one or a few letters or postcards, others may take more correspondence to finish. I\u0027ve divided them into themes. Patrons can pick the themes, and I\u0027ll surprise you with the ballad. The stories that emerge will mingle and intertwine into a greater story. Some ballads fall into more than one theme.
