From scratch. \u00a0I try to keep the programs visually interesting so they are fun to watch. \u00a0I try to program at two levels: first is the nuts and bolts of how you make a program, the second is to exhibit a high level concept from computer science.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd most importantly, I try to make you laugh.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI invite you to watch my first episode. \u00a0Fast forward if you absolutely must, but hang on to the end. \u00a0There is magic in computer programming - and I want you to see it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest wishes,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eK."
