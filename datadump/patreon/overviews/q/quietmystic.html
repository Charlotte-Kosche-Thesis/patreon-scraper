I grew up steeped in Christianity, both Protestant and Catholic, but I am neither--I\u0027m a pagan and a Kagyu Buddhist. But I do make a cup of coffee for Mary every morning when I make coffee for my ancestors. Every mother needs coffee, right? So I feel like a contradiction in terms, like I don\u0027t belong in any particular cultural space, but am just kind of lurking in the in between spaces. In other words, in the liminal. Join me there! Quietly... :)\u00a0",
