I write a lot of work for various fandoms. Currently, my focus is on My Hero Academia and RWBY, but I also do work in Miraculous Ladybug, Pokemon, and Ajin. I also draw, though I don\u0027t share this as often - I\u0027m heading to University to improve my skills in this particular department.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to be able to write and draw a Manga, and have it published and turned into an Anime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m here: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am going to be attending University to study my passion - Manga and Writing. While I\u0027m very excited for it, this does mean that it becomes harder to justify taking time out of my day to work on the stories that I love to write so very much. The issue with writing fanfiction and drawing comics is that it doesn\u0027t pay online, unless you have an add filled site, something that I don\u0027t want to do. I don\u0027t want to gate anyone off from reading my work, but at the same time, also will struggle to justify to myself that the time I spend on this work when I can\u0027t get anything back from it. My girlfriend suggested a Patreon, and, after some research, I decided that I\u0027d come here and give it a go.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Supporting me on Patreon Means:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations would mean that I would be able to spend more time on my creative work. I would be able to justify the time that I spend on each story. the more money that I receive, The more time I would be able to spend, and even bring around more stories. Of course, no one should feel like they have to donate to me - Treat Patreon like a tip jar. Anyone who reads and enjoys my work is more than free to donate, or choose not to. I just thank you for reading my stuff, and enjoying it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me here would also mean you would get an early look at the ideas that I have, and hearing about the thoughts I have regarding certain stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel like honesty and openness is very important I want you to know how much I make, and where that money goes, so, I will disclose here what the money I spend will be going towards:\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eFood and Drink\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThis is the main thing that your money will go to.

However, I will not write Ideas I personally do not like. Neither of us want a story just forced out without any heart put into it at all. Additionally, you won\u0027t be given priority over my other works, or other Requests or Commissions. That, in my mind, would be unfair to others who can\u0027t, or simply do not wish to donate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do not wish to Patronize my content, but have a request, you are welcome to Commission me. However, the same rules above apply. I charge \u00a35 GBP or your regional equivalent for a story/chapter that will be at least 4000 words. No NSFW\u0027s, and I reserve the right to deny any requests that I simply do not wish to do - But please, don\u0027t be afraid to ask.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn both of these cases, I cannot promise a quick response. With so many works going on, I simply will get around to your story when I can - I ask that you understand, writing takes a very long time to do, and I have other commitments. Sometimes, I simply will be unable to complete a Commission - In that scenario, you will be entitled to your money back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eNo Pandering \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- Again, I ask you only donate because you want to. Just because you donate, it doesn\u0027t necessarily mean that I\u0027m going to do something you want me to. The story won\u0027t always go the way that you want it to. Twists, plot, and tricks will be aplenty. This will not change because a Patreon asks me to change it. Though by all means, suggestions can be made\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy you should donate: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause you enjoy what I do and \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to support me doing it. I cannot stress enough the fact I only want you to support me because you want to and feel I deserve it. I am here because I love the work that I do, and if I can be funded by you amazing people who want to help me continue, I will be absolutely overjoyed. I will not stop if you guys don\u0027t support my work, but your support would mean the world to me.
