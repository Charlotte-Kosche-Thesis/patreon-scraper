I want to complete my Rune art series and do something with it, as well as the major arcana art I have already completed. I want to make an impact with my art somehow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOngoing:\u003cbr\u003eI would like to improve my skills as an artist by affording myself more time to commit to drawing, turning illustrations into paintings, completing various projects (The Colossi series, Major Arcana Project, Egyptian god commissions, art for vending), starting new projects, and hopefully getting a local gallery to notice my work. My art is primarily imaginative. I evoke natural elements, dreams, mythologies, melancholic emotions, and occult themes. While I have been drawing my whole life I have only been showing my art beyond family and friend connections since my thirties began. I have had to change my lifestyle and place of living often to accommodate my creative pursuits, while managing to keep part-time jobs to survive. I\u0027m still a long ways away from ever supporting myself by art alone successfully. Art is basically my oxygen, my best means of communication, and probably the only thing I can offer to make this world better somehow.\u00a0With your help I can at least keep that dream going. Thanks."
