    "summary": "The\n Quad Cities Ballet Folklorico was founded in 1984 by Arnulfo Camarillo in Moline, IL with the help of his wife, Beatriz Camarillo.  After studying folklore \ndance at the Universidad de Guadalara in Jalisco, Mexico, Arnulfo \nreturned to the United States with aspirations to keep this Hispanic \nculture and its rich traditions alive.  He achieved exactly that and \naccomplished so much more. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Mr. Camarillo was first\n given the task to form a group as a Mother\u0027s Day gift for the mothers \nin the local area.  The original group consisted of about 15 determined \nkids. After Mother\u0027s Day, the kids wanted to learn more and Arnulfo was \nhappy to keep teaching.  \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Throughout the years, the QCBF has \nwelcomed students from a variety of backgrounds to join in their mission\n to express the Hispanic culture through dance and music.  Soon these \nyoung kids were performing traditional dances from the states such as \nNayarit, Veracruz, Nuevo Leon, and the popular Jalisco.  The QCBF have \nperformed at many local events including Viva Quad Cities, Cinco de Mayo\n Fiestas, and the Festival of Trees.  However, they have also had the \nopportunity to perform in other states such as Indiana and Arizona. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n The QCBF also has had the privilege to host numerous professional \ndancers from surrounding areas as well as Mexico.  These would be \ninformative workshops designed to instruct new dance steps and \nchoreography.  Not only do the workshops introduce new traditional \ndances, but it also presents a learning environment at a professional \nlevel.  These workshops in conjunction with the hard work and dedication\n of the students and parents allow the QCBF to continue their reputation\n as a well known local area attraction. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Ray Terronez Jr, a \nQCBF Alum, has been serving as the Director since 2008.  He is \naccompanied by fellow QCBF Alums, Kristy Munoz, Sonia Herrera, and \nCourtney Nieves as Assistance Instructors. The QCBF currently have over 100 students ranging from 4 to 18 years old. \u00a0We have also established our first mentor program, Pasos Con Amigos. \u00a0This program is designed to bridge the gap between the Small and Older Group students. \u00a0In addition, we have also incorporated QCBF Education, where the students are taught a variety of facts about the specific states that they are performing and then later quizzed on those facts. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Even after all of \nthese years, the QCBF\u2019s mission is to give our dancers and the \ncommunity, the knowledge of this beautiful culture and to keep it strong\n for generations to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to visit www.TheQCBF.com for more information.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
