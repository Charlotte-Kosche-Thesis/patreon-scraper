    "summary": "Hey everyone!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know I\u0027m one of many jewelry artisans out there in the internets. But for me it\u0027s not just about enjoyment. It\u0027s about mental health. If you\u0027ve found me here on Patreon, you\u0027ve likely seen my facebook page, know me personally or on my personal facebook wall, follow me on Twitter or on Instagram. What\u0027s the connection? I do lots of FB live videos which are more like vlogs. Sometimes they\u0027re makeup tutorials, but often they\u0027re about me and what\u0027s going on. So if you\u0027re interested in learning more about that, please do like my page and you shall learn.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve made 2017 \"the year of content\" on my channel. I\u0027ve been so busy uploading and creating. I\u0027ve made more videos since February than I made last year! It\u0027s awesome! People are subscribing and liking, which makes me feel great inside.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically it boils down to keeping sane, teaching people that they too can create their own art, and helping my family move into a better home away from our current situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for your patronage and for following me along this journey. You rock!\u003cbr\u003e--Yours, Danielle"
