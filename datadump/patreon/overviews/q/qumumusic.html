I love making music, and I would be ecstatic if I could actually do it for a living one day. It usually takes tens of hours for me to finish a cover and upload it to, so a lot of time and hard work goes into making the tunes you can hear on YouTube and SoundCloud. The way I produce music is very software and hardware oriented, so being able to acquire new instruments and update my equipment is very important if I want to produce higher quality music, which you as a listener will benefit from. YouTube ad revenue can be pretty unpredictable, so I would benefit from some extra income to use on gear. In short, Patreon provides an excellent opportunity and motivation for me to increase the audiovisual quality of my work.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI want to express that the Patreon page will in no way, shape or form exclude people from the content that I create. Every finished mix will be uploaded to YouTube, and anyone will be able to enjoy my covers on both there and SoundCloud as usual.
