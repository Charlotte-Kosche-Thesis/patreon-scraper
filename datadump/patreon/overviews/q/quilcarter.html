Writing is my life and my full-time job, and since 2014 I have released 8 massive books ranging from 290k words to 570k words (to put it in perspective, GRRM\u0027s biggest book is 422k).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been a challenge being able to keep my head above water financially and recent on-going medical issues and living expenses has made that more difficult than it was in the past (despite being a complete and total cheap ass) and Amazon\u0027s constant trimming of the KU page count certainly hasn\u0027t helped. So, with your help, even if it\u0027s something small, I can continue making writing my full-time job, and in exchange, I can say thanks in my own personal way (no, not like that... get your head out of the gutter)."
