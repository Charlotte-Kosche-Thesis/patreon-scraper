    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m \"a quiet misdreavus\". You can call me Grey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past few months, I\u0027ve been hanging out in \u003ca href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Rust community\u003c/a\u003e, writing some libraries, contributing to the project some, but also teaching people in their \"#rust-beginners\" IRC chatroom. In #rust-beginners, you get all kinds of skill levels and backgrounds, from seasoned programmers looking for a new tool, to hobbyists who want to try Rust for their next project, to even the occasional person who is brand new to coding and decided to jump in with this Rust thing they\u0027ve heard a little about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of their background, I\u0027ve taken a lot of pleasure in helping them through whatever hurdle they have that day. Every time I get a \"lightbulb moment\", every time someone says they\u0027ve been unblocked and can keep working, heck, even just when someone says \"oh, that makes sense\", it brightens my day. In hanging out in #rust-beginners, I\u0027ve found something I absolutely love. If it didn\u0027t sound too trite and overblown, I\u0027d call tutoring like this my calling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to this page. This is sort of a shot in the dark, to see what kind of response I get asking to support this kind of activity. Over time, I can expand my scope, and tutor/teach coding more broadly. If you consider this worth supporting, I cannot thank you enough.\u003cbr\u003e"
