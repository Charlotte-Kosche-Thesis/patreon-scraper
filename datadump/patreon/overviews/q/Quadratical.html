I\u0027ve been around on a variety of websites for quite some time, giving my thoughts on games and other various medias. I did some writing here and there, a few small reviews of music and movies, but I never really got pulled into those the same way I did with video games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAbout 6 years ago, before I got swept up in university, I got a game capture device, and since then, I\u0027ve been recording videos in one way or another. For nearly 3 years, I created playthroughs of various games - NieR, Tales of, and all sorts of other series! Sadly, university pulled me away eventually, and while I did graduate with a degree in Game Development, I still had the urge to come back to creating content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd so I did! I started streaming once again, on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitch.tv/quadratical\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e this time instead of solely through\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/user/QuadPlaythrough\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e. I added in some commentary, upgraded some microphones... and here I am today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, while I have income, it isn\u0027t nearly enough to allow myself to continue to stream at the rate I do. I want to be able to do this for a living, so I decided to reach out to you all and see if there\u0027s any way I can continue to do this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou probably have a few questions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003eWhat makes you different from other streamers?\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo be honest, other than the types of games I play, there isn\u0027t a whole lot! I\u0027m pretty laid back and generally try to interact with the audience as much as possible, and my sessions are pretty long - and frequent!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWhat does the money go towards?\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRight now, it pretty much goes towards supporting me! As is, I\u0027m close to being able to continue with this, but without that final push, I won\u0027t be able to stream nearly as often as I do now!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWhat other plans do you have?\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCurrently, I\u0027m mostly focused on my stream sessions. In the future, if I can support myself, I\u0027ll consider doing some podcasts with friends, discussing more current events in gaming, or more reviews, or other styles of videos (top 10, non-stream videos, etc.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThat essentially sums things up! Any contribution helps me work towards streaming more often and making this dream a reality. And if you\u0027re still here, thanks for taking the time to read! It means a whole lot to me.\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
