None of the Above movement in TX to oust the current establishment executive government \u0026amp; some legislators - notatx.org\u003cbr\u003e2. developing a sustainable teaching community based on post patriarchal concepts - to give space to build replacement models of governance and collective liberation\u003cbr\u003e3. hosting an encuentro to build collective collaboration amongst divided organizations that mrch together chanting \"the people united will never be defeated\" but leave and return to being divided\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever none of them will succeed unless I have someone to rely upon to get these tasks I physically struggle to do accomplished.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did try to use Dragon and the built in Windows speech control, but they are don\u0027t work together, can ve infuriatingly slow, or unresponsive, or i can\u0027t speak loud enough at times to be heard.\u00a0 All in all it was way too frustrating \u0026amp; time consuming (\u0026amp; i lost dragon when my hard drive failed-discs missing - no resources to replace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo basically, if you think i should be doing more and working towards the end goals we have been working toward for two decades, kick it down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd make suggestions for what i should provide in return!\u003cbr\u003e"
