    "summary": "First of all, thank you. Even if you\u0027re not a patron yet, you\u0027re probably here because you listen to my music, and that keeps me going and helps me make even more music for you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThis is how we\u0027re going to tour the world, making music!\u003c/h3\u003e\nBy we, I mean you and me! This is a team effort! With your help, I\u0027ll be traveling from the Southern most tip of Africa, up through Africa, into Europe, across to Asia, up to North America, and all the way down to South America! Along the way, I\u0027ll be gigging and collaborating with musicians of all styles and all genres along the way. I\u0027ll be releasing the recordings of this journey on YouTube for all to see, but you\u0027ll be the first to see it here if you become a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/h4\u003ePatreon allows you to support people that are making things that you enjoy. I\u0027ve set up my Patreon to work with a monthly contribution. This means that whatever you pledge will be charged to you every month. I\u0027ll be using the money to cover the costs of making music, and eventually the costs of the world tour!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhy should you pledge before the world tour happens?\u003c/h4\u003eI still need funding to make music. Guitars, strings, production, all of these things cost money. Any excess funds will go into saving for the trip, so even before the trip starts you\u0027ll be helping to fund it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat am I going to do until the tour starts?\u003c/h4\u003eI\u0027m still going to be making music, releasing it across all major platforms including free platforms like YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhen is the tour going to start?\u003c/h4\u003eAs soon as I reach my goal of $3000 dollars a month, I\u0027ll start the tour! If this goal isn\u0027t met, I\u0027ll still try to make the tour happen, but this will probably only be in 2023 if I have to fund it myself. Basically, it\u0027s happening by hook or by crook, but I\u0027d like it to happen with your help in a reasonable time frame.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eHow long will the tour take?\u003c/h4\u003eI\u0027d like it to last 4 years, with about 9 months on each continent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e"
