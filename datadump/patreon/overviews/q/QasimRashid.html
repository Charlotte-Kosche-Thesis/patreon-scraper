    "summary": "I believe our country is stronger when we dialogue with each other and learn from each other. It\u0027s why I\u0027ve dedicated my life to fighting for civil rights for people of all faiths and of no faith. My books, lectures, Op Eds, and advocacy all point to promoting education and protecting universal freedom of conscience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month I receive thousands of messages, emails, and questions from people of all faiths and backgrounds, asking about Islam.\u00a0Our country and our world has not had the needed opportunity to learn about Islam from practicing Muslims.\u00a0Study after study shows that those who know a Muslim, and those Muslims who know Islam, are far more likely to rejected terrorism and instead promote peace, love, compassion, and pluralism. They\u0027re more likely to serve humanity, give charity, and stand against bigotry, hate, and violence. That\u0027s the world I want for my children, your children, and our country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to write my narrative of education and freedom, and to combat the all too common ignorance and fear of Islam, I\u0027m launching the Islam 101 Podcast. The Islam 101 Podcast will cover everything you ever wanted to know about Islam in a clear and easy to understand manner. What does Islam mean? Who is a Muslim? Who was Muhammad? What is the Qur\u0027an? Can non-Muslims go to heaven? What does Jihad mean? What rights to women and men have? And many more. From the very basics to intermediate and complex ideas\u2014my goal is to skip the media and politicians, and present independent podcasts on a consistent model. I believe this will allow you to learn from each podcast but also jump around as you\u0027d like to explore different concepts in Islam.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLikewise, in general, the Islam 101 Podcast on Islamic topics will only be 15 minutes long. They will be high impact and detailed enough to answer your questions, and also concise enough that you can listen to them in full on your daily commute or during your break at work. In addition, every month I\u0027ll have a bonus podcast with a guest activist, celebrity, or scholar\u2014these podcasts will run longer to capture our dialogue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m launching the Islam 101 Podcast because I want to create a future dedicated to education, pluralism, and progress. If you believe these things are important, and you want to improve your knowledge of Islam in a positive, progressive, and engaging environment, then I hope you become a supporter. Your support will provide the resources to research and build each podcast, create the corresponding videos when appropriate, and provide tech support. But most importantly, your support will help turn the tide of ignorance and hatred and instead promote education and pluralism. And hopefully, you\u0027ll make a new Muslim friend out of it.\u00a0The Islam 101 Podcast is the true Jihad of the Pen that I invite you to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support and for your friendship. Peace be upon you."
