We maintain a database of games that represent queer perspectives and feature queer content, and we also provide links to further resources and research regarding representation of sexuality, gender, and relationships. We are working on extensive research behind the scenes, both in the area of representations of queer identity in games as well as queer game studies more broadly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are two key reasons why Queerly Represent Me is an important and valuable resource. Firstly, the database allows members of the queer community to familiarise themselves with and access more texts that represent them. This can act as a supportive gesture to those who are comfortable with their identities, or can assist in the formation of self-identity for those who are questioning their sexuality or gender. Secondly, the site allows those who do not identify as queer to broaden the pool of games that they play or to form new understandings of games that they have already accessed, while developing empathy for the queer community and the issues we face. Additionally, Queerly Represent Me is an important resource for those researching queer representation in games academically, journalistically, or for their personal growth.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOngoing discussion around the representation of queer identities, and what constitutes a positive representation, is vital and Queerly Represent Me seeks to be a key voice within this conversation.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/8be2f3a5eec61256b99ae658b61a6ed6/tumblr_ozw6rt8zlO1vla1vho2_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nYour money will be supporting the creation and maintenance of a huge number of projects.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQueerly Represent Me has developed a \n\u003ca href=\"https://queerlyrepresent.me/database\"\u003evisual database\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://queerlyrepresent.me/database/spreadsheet\"\u003espreadsheet database\u003c/a\u003e that display approximately 1,000 games featuring queer representation, from the mid-1980s to this year.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have conducted multiple \u003ca href=\"https://queerlyrepresent.me/research\"\u003eaudience surveys\u003c/a\u003e since we were founded in May 2016, and we are analysing the data from those surveys so we can publish articles and papers discussing the way audiences respond to queer\u2014and other diverse\u2014content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe attend conferences and conventions around Australia and, with further support, will be attending international events to discuss our ongoing work and research. We also \u003ca href=\"https://queerlyrepresent.me/research#talks\"\u003epublish articles\u003c/a\u003e based on our talks, as well as guides for how to better engage with queerness and diversity more broadly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe host \u003ca href=\"https://queerlyrepresent.me/projects/jess-qgj\"\u003eJess\u0027 Queer Games Journey\u003c/a\u003e where Jess Zammit discusses lesser known games that she has played while researching for our database.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery Wednesday, we publish new interviews in an \u003ca href=\"https://queerlyrepresent.me/projects/interviews\"\u003einterview series\u003c/a\u003e with queer folks working in the games industry. We are using this information to gain a better understanding of the ways queerness affects the work of queer devs, and the roadblocks that might be preventing them from excelling in the games industry.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are working on our first publication of a \u003ca href=\"https://queerlyrepresent.me/projects/zine\"\u003ezine\u003c/a\u003e, which is currently accepting submissions and will be published in 2018. It will feature stories of intersectional diversity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have additional \u003ca href=\"https://queerlyrepresent.me/projects/outreach\"\u003eoutreach\u003c/a\u003e programs, including exhibitions, which we hope will connect the public to queerness and games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd we maintain a list of \u003ca href=\"https://queerlyrepresent.me/resources\"\u003eadditional resources\u003c/a\u003e that people can engage with that were not authored by the Queerly Represent Me team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are currently establishing ourselves as a not-for-profit organisation, and work as a paid consultation company on issues of representation and diversity within games, studios, and events.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe rely heavily on our community for tips and suggestions, and your support\u2014through connecting with us, sharing us with your networks, and ensuring we can pay our bills\u2014makes a world of difference.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/288f1d561256803dca2401b81f5a69e4/tumblr_ozw6rt8zlO1vla1vho3_1280.jpg\" width=\"540px\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nYour Patreon support will help us to continue producing all of the resources, research, and initiatives listed above.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are currently using donated funds to help us establish as a not-for-profit company, trademark our name and logo, and establish additional methods of financial support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur next goal is to afford to pay both our founding director (Alayna Cole) and our executive officer (Jess Zammit) for some of the research they are contributing to the organisation. This goal would cover a fraction of the work that they contribute to Queerly Represent Me, but it will go some distance towards supporting them for the time they spend updating the database, analysing data, and responding to emails.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur primary aim with this Patreon is to make the money required to pay our staff and contributors for their work. So many hours go into making Queerly Represent Me what it is (and ensuring that all of the resources we provide are free to access for the public), and your Patreon support is what keeps us going.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you can afford to donate, that is greatly appreciated! If you cannot, there are other ways you can support us. Check out our tips \u003ca href=\"http://queerlyrepresent.me/support\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e."
