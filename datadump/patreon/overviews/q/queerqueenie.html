    "summary": "Hi, so. You might be wondering what this is all about. See, I like writing stuff. Words, even. And sometimes, those words form coherent sentences, and sometimes even, they form a couple paragraphs. And that, kids, is how a blog is born, and that is what I\u0027m here for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut seriously, hey. My name\u0027s Lauren, and I do like to write things quite a bit. If you wanna see what I do, I post most of my stuff on my blog: \u003ca href=\"http://queerqueenlywriting.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003equeerqueenlywriting.wordpress.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTypically about video games, sometimes about social and queer issues, writing is a pastime I really do enjoy quite a bit. With that in mind, I figured, it couldn\u0027t hurt to give people the chance to support this pastime if they so choose. As well, opening a Patreon will help a bit on the budget, and will certainly help my ability for me to do things like buy more games, and work towards things like website hosting or tech purchases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIt\u0027s not all about me, though. I will be giving some rewards to those who donate, which you can see on the side. Rest assured that all my usual content isn\u0027t going anywhere. If you donate, here\u0027s what to expect: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I\u0027m shooting for 2-3 articles a week. I may not always meet it, and you are completely free to pull your pledge if you are dissatisfied with the work. No judgement here. It\u0027s your money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I\u0027m going to primarily be writing about video games, with the occasional other topic thrown in. This is an ongoing process of what I want to write about and how i develop it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- If you wanna check out what the $5 tier will be like, here\u0027s an example piece: \u003ca href=\"https://queerqueenlywriting.wordpress.com/2018/02/27/why-write/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://queerqueenlywriting.wordpress.com/2018/02/27/why-write/\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I may mess things up. When that happens, I will be at the forefront of trying to make it right. That\u0027s a guarantee. I don\u0027t want to be a big scary presence. I\u0027m a cool person online making stuff and you guys are cool people who wanna help. You deserve care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that should be about it! Thanks for taking the time to read, feel free to donate if you so please, and I\u0027ll see you around on the magical land known as the internet! May it choose to let us live another day longer.\u003cbr\u003e"
