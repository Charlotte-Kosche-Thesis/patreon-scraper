I make genre-crossing fiction, including Science Fiction, Fantasy, Magical Realism, Horror, Literary, Bizarro, Fairy Tales and more! On top of that, I do some non-fiction work and am a contributor for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://bookriot.com/author/laura-diaz-de-arce/\"\u003eBook Riot\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m also one of the founding members of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.smokingmirrorpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSmoking Mirror Press\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing in a semi-professional capacity for about the past five years and these past two years I\u0027ve made an effort to put my work out for publication. I love writing and want to continue to craft stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I use a lot of social media, it\u0027s difficult to target your work to a specific audience. My hope is to cultivate a community that is invested in my work. I want to reach the people who like what I do and keep providing them with my stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbove that, I still have bills to pay and in order to keep writing more creatively instead of purely freelancing or taking a second job, any additional source of revenue will help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor as little as $1 a month you get the chance to view a lot of my behind-the-scenes work, previews of upcoming publications and chapters, and patron-exclusive posts. Higher tier perks include: collaborative influence in the form of voting, monthly Q \u0026amp; A\u0027s and even free e-books. As our community grows, the perks may also grow and evolve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027m Working On \u003c/strong\u003eUpdated as of April 2018\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really excited to launch my first short-story collection this July with Smoking Mirror Press titled \u003cem\u003eMonstrosity\u003c/em\u003e. It will include both previously published and unpublished material. I also have a science fiction novel in the works tentatively titled \u003cem\u003eRecord for the Dead \u003c/em\u003eplus a fairy tale collection I hope to have ready by Christmas 2019. There are other projects I have had to drop for time, including a fantasy noir, but may be able to pick up again with your generous patronage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for visiting my patreon and for your support!"
