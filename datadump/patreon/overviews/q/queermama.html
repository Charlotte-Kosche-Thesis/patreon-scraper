Read more about how we got here below, check out our rewards to the right, and most importantly, watch the video!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE SHORT VERSION:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe create free videos on YouTube about being queer parents (how we conceived, challenges we face as parents and queers, and other topics of interest to parents and non-parents alike!), \u00a0As new parents, running our own business, and without childcare, it\u0027s hard to make these videos. That\u0027s where you come in. Your donations will allow us to keep making these videos. And they\u0027ll let us connect with you more via live streams, Q and As, and more. We\u0027re grateful for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur very first video, in case you\u0027re new to us:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ElmF8gU5EU8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE LONG VERSION:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn early 2015 Simone and I (Haley) started our YouTube channel to chronicle our journey to get pregnant and have a baby. We did it for two reasons. One, we\u0027re artists, we can\u0027t help ourselves! We\u0027re both career storytellers, and we wanted to make art about this, one of the most important stories of our lives. We partnered with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.autostraddle.com/queer-mama-episode-one-meet-haley-284849/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAutostraddle\u003c/a\u003e, an independent online magazine for LGBT women and one of the best places on the internet, to release\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJMHdQnysocd7HSbHIlfYlkaamsoNArl3\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour first series\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second reason is\u00a0there is still so little content out there about queer families. Doing research before we got busy trying to conceive made this very clear. We realized if we wanted to see media about families like ours, we had to make it. Since our launch, we\u0027ve heard from hundreds of you about how much it means to see queers making babies. This is the power of storytelling. Sharing our stories connects us to each other. It gives us hope when we can\u0027t find a way. It makes us cry when we need to, and laugh unexpectedly. We want to do all these things with YOU!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimone and I have been so moved by the responses we\u0027ve gotten to our videos. Thank you for all your views and comments and emails and all the times you\u0027ve stopped us on the street to say our videos meant something to you. It\u0027s the greatest compliment for an artist. And given all that, we can\u0027t imagine stopping this series now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve released 65+ (!!) videos since we began last April, but we did it all on stolen time. Nights and weekends and anytime we weren\u0027t creating content for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://movingportraits.tv\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour actual video business\u003c/a\u003e. Now that we have a ONE YEAR OLD (how did she get to be one?!?) it\u0027s a lot harder for us to take the time away from our paid filmmaking work to create these videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we need your help. If you want to support us with just a wee bit (or a lot, we won\u0027t stop you ;) ) of your money, we can keep making the videos you want to see. Your pledges will directly support the production of the Queer Mama YouTube series, and hopefully some new and exciting content to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQueer Mama roadshow tour, anyone!?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your generosity. We\u0027re honored to be in community with you and are so grateful for your support of our little family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd one more video, just because:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GVZ41BjMjEo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
