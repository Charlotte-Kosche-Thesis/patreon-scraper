Students from 5 years old to 85 have been learning from me for years. I teach music full time and love it! Ideas for video lessons come from my local and online\u00a0students. When you tell me what you want to learn that\u0027s when I\u0027m at my best.\u00a0You can get help with specific songs, songwriting, music theory, and improvisation too!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can also sign up for lessons here.
