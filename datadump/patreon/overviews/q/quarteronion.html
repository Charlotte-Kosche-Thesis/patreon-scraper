Our target platforms will \ninitially be mobile and PC, with expansion into console when the games \nbest supports it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur first game will be Warkeep, a side scrolling tower defense game \nthat combines elements of tile-matching puzzle solving to build a keep \nwith the traditional flair of a top down tower defense game. Two other \nprojects are in conceptual stages that will build off of Warkeep and \nprovide the framework for interaction between all 3 games in exciting \nnew ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the demo launch, we would like to invite everyone that enjoys \nthe demo and wants to see more to become our patrons.\n We\u0027ve put many long hours into Warkeep to get this to a state that we \nfelt happy with in this demo, but there are many more long hours in the \nfuture. Particularly, we have had to use placeholder art in this demo \nwhich has hit its limit in allowing us to complete the envisioned story \ncampaign as well as other features we have planned. Our goal is to be \nable to bring in an artist or two to allow us to really flesh out \nWarkeep as well as our future games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur patrons will have access to a special Discord channel where you \ncan speak directly to the development team about whatever tickles your \nfancy. While we always keep are channels open for everyone as best as we\n can, we also need to juggle time for development, so we\u0027d make extra \nspecial care to be able to respond in the patron channel asap. We are \nalso providing access to the latest builds of all our games, and the \npotential to get all of our games (and all extra content we think up for\n them) forever. Awesome, right? (We hope, at least. Let us know, in the \npatron Discord channel.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom everyone at Quarter Onion Games, we want to thank you for visiting our Patreon page, and we especially want to thank our patrons who through their support allow us to build the best possible games for our community.\u003cbr\u003e"
