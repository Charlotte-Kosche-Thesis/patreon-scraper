The monsters that live inside my head melt in oil on canvas, pen on paper, guitar in hand. They are defeated with deep study, analytical writing, and flinging glitter at sculpture. There is not a creative endeavor I have not found an outlet in, and now I am finally plucking up my courage to ask for my fans to trust me, while I trust them, and get the communal support I need to keep creating, and keep slaying the monsters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome on this journey with me, it is such an amazing leap of faith, and realistically, I will be creating either way. This way, I will have the time to create much much more."
