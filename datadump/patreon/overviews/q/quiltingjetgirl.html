The challenge with big goals is that sometimes they require financing.\u00a0This is where you come in. Your support not only means more time for me to work on my projects, it also means I can make more rewards for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLooking into 2018, I am going to be transitioning my business to become more mobile. What does that mean? Well, I hope that it means in a few years you will be able to book me teaching in your local quilt store as a result of the hard work and groundwork I will be laying. Some of the investments that I will be looking to make are in transitioning away from a desktop computer to a laptop (so I can travel and give presentations!). Other details of this mobile transition are a little bit top secret at the moment, but if you support me as a Patron, you will be the first to know of these details!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I will be offering in return.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can choose the level of support that you are most comfortable with. In return there are bonuses for each level of support (check out all the options to the right).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon site will allow you to comment directly on all of my posts, as well as make suggestions and ask questions.

If you join up later in the month, you may not be charged until the following month. Once your pledge clears, you will then be sent links to the premiums such as the unique PDF quilt pattern and tutorial files.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you have any questions about Patreon?
