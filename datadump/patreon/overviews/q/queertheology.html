    "summary": "You were on our minds when Fr. Shay and Brian created QueerTheology.com, even if you didn\u2019t know it. We had this gut feeling that there \u003cem\u003emust\u003c/em\u003e be others like us out there: LGBTQ folks and straight cisgender supporters who were yearning for a faith that made sense in the 21st century, that was radically inclusive, that left room for questions and doubt, that was unapologetically centered on justice for the oppressed. You were the reason that we created everything here at Queer Theology\u2014the courses, the articles, the magazine, the podcast. We knew, just knew, that there were folks out there looking for these resources. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing that you\u2019ve asked for over and over again is an online community. We held off because we wanted to make sure that when we did it, we did it right. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are so excited to announce Sanctuary Collective, Queer Theology\u2019s online community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll find inside:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOnline discussions.\u003c/strong\u003e Each week we\u2019ll pose a new question for discussion, offer our own perspectives, and moderate the discussion.

There will be an on-going textual discussion as well as a Google Hangout\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExclusive monthly hangouts.\u003c/strong\u003e Google Hangouts were a popular part of Queer Theology in our early days but they got \u003cem\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e popular and now we have to do Hangouts On-AIr. We\u2019re hosting monthly Hangouts exclusively for Sanctuary Collective members. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFree access to Reading Queerly.\u003c/strong\u003e Enjoy free access to our premium online course, Reading Queerly for as long as you\u2019re a member of Sanctuary Collective\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFree subscription to \u003cem\u003eSpit \u0026amp; Spirit\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e Get access to our every back issue of \u003cem\u003eSpit \u0026amp; Spirit\u003c/em\u003e and free, early access to new issues\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFiguring out the technical, logistical considerations was one of the major things that was holding us back from launching an online community sooner. Then we realized we already had everything we need in Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo join Sanctuary Collective, all you need to do is become a patron of Queer Theology at $1/month or more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re taking a risk here. Folks have told us that an online community is worth more than $1/month to them. And we know that keeping it running is going to take \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e of work on our part. If you can support the work of Queer Theology through Sanctuary Collective at a higher amount, we will be so grateful. We even have a few additional perks for supporters at those levels."
