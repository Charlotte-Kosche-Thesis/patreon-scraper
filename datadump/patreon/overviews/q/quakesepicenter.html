    "summary": "As the 2018 MLS season approaches, I am excited to share a project with you all in collaboration with several members of the Earthquakes community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have had the wonderful opportunity to cover the team as a journalist over the past few years and to get to know a lot of people within and around the club.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat I have learned is that nearly all of the individuals that cover this team or have covered this team do so in their spare time and out of a passion for the club. An advantage of this is that San Jose has developed one of the strongest grassroots journalism and media communities in the league.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, there are a number of disadvantages that we seek to address. There is no regularity with how or when Quakes-related content is released, there is no journalist that regularly covers away matches, and overall the Quakes are simply very under-covered by national media outlets.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe first thing that we are doing to address this is that we are bringing on Joel Soria to be our Managing Editor. Joel has done an exceptional job covering the Quakes and the US Men\u2019s National team for SBI Soccer for the past year, while also co-hosting the 24/74 Show, a podcast centered around the San Jose Earthquakes. Joel will be running the show from here on out, and I am confident that he will do a great job with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe will also be bringing on a number of regular contributors, many of whom Quakes fans will be familiar with. You should keep an eye for content from them in the coming days.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNext, we are launching a Patreon to help cover some of the expenditures of our operation. Some of the expenses that we want to cover through this Patreon include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTopDrawerSoccer, MLS Live, WyScout, and other subscription-based things that would improve our content.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDomain name and website hosting costs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEquipment for podcasting and video content.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReaching a point where we can pay all of our contributors.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTraveling costs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProviding extensive coverage for the team, at home and on the road.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe eventually want to provide the team complete coverage for all road matches. We want to provide the sort of wall-to-wall coverage that other Bay Area teams like the Giants and the Warriors receive - with opinion pieces, game recaps, analysis pieces, podcasts, video content, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether or not you choose to support us with your wallet, we cannot express how much we appreciate you reading, watching, or listening to our content. As MLS evolves and as the Earthquakes evolve as a club, our content and coverage will evolve as well, and we cannot wait to share that with you this season.\u003cbr\u003e"
