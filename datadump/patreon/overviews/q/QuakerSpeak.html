    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWhat is QuakerSpeak?\u003c/h3\u003eQuakerSpeak is a weekly Quaker video project\nfrom \u003cem\u003eFriends Journal\u003c/em\u003e. We interview Friends from all different backgrounds and\ncover topics ranging from the basics of what you\u2019ll experience in Quaker\nMeeting to frequently asked questions about Quakers to highlighting stories of\nFriends today who are following their leadings.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQuakerSpeak videos come out every Thursday. You\ncan follow along by subscribing with your email address, or following us on\nFacebook, Twitter, and Instagram. And of course you can subscribe on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho is the audience?\u003c/h3\u003eThe audience ranges from loyal fans to people who typed something like \"nonviolence\" or \"worship\" into Google and are having their first encounter with Quakers through these videos. Since we release a video every week, we get to\ncover a wide range of topics.  Some of our most popular videos are aimed\nat newcomers, while other videos take a deeper dive into a topic of interest.\n We hear from Friends and seekers all over the world that the project introduced\nthem to the Quaker faith or is helping to deepen their understanding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy are we asking for support?\u003c/h3\u003eGetting the message out about Quakerism is\nimportant. There has never been a better time than now or a more effective tool\nthan YouTube for sparking conversations among Friends and seekers worldwide. And that means you have a tremendous opportunity to help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe believe in authentic conversations and in\nkeeping our videos accessible to all. That\u2019s the philosophy that\u2019s gotten us\nthis past a million views worldwide and we hope, the philosophy that will get\nus to the next million. While the expenses of the project are modest, they are real. \u003cem\u003eFriends Journal\u003c/em\u003e employs a videographer/producer and has to get him, his cameras, and his gear to Friends with stories to tell. Then once the videos are ready, it takes money to advertise and promote the videos to a diverse audience. It adds up, but it\u0027s worth it. With your help, the project will continue to grow and thrive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow Does Patreon Work?\u003c/h3\u003eIs having QuakerSpeak in the world worth a\ndollar a video to you?  If your answer is \u201cYes,\u201d we would be so grateful\nfor your support. Check out the categories in the right-side column and\npick the one that fits your budget!  Patreon will ask for some information\nfrom you, and your card will get billed at the beginning of each month.\n In addition to our deep gratitude, you will get the perk that corresponds\nwith your level of giving!  Anyone who becomes a Patron \u003cem\u003eat any\nlevel\u003c/em\u003e gets access to our Patron-only feed, which will include outtakes,\nextras, and a monthly chat with director Jon Watts. Plus you\u2019ll get a free\nintroductory subscription to \u003cem\u003eFriends\nJournal \u003c/em\u003eonline (if you\u0027re not already a subscriber!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCan I Make a One-Time Donation?\u003c/h3\u003eYes!\u00a0 Any one-time donation for QuakerSpeak can go through our parent organization, Friends Publishing Corporation.
