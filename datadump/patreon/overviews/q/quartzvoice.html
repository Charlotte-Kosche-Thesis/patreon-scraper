With over 17,000 subscribers right now since its inception only a mere four months ago, the channel is seeing incredible growth, and you can easily stake your claim in it by pledging today! Even a few dollars will assuredly help it climb to the very peak of the pack among FGO-related content creators--and it isn\u0027t far off now! Don\u0027t you want to be part of something big? Something big enough which perhaps might actually make a positive impact on the franchise? Pledge now!
