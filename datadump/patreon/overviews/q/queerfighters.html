Friday night classes are usually filled to the brim\u2014the demand has been ever growing and it is clear that our community needs this type of specialized training more than ever. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s time to expand this program and also make it FREE for the community!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201c\u003cem\u003eI\u0027m a trans woman and this class is saving my life.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I always got pushed out of martial arts as a kid (kung fu, fencing, even tai chi). While I was a good student \u0026amp; the instructors loved me, traditional pedantic/disclipline-based teaching styles is bad news for people with dysphoria and I certainly wasn\u0027t game for the toxic masculinity of sports culture. As an adult I wanted to learn self-defense in order to survive my day-to-day life as a queer/trans person, but I was too nervous to be hazed by the girls in existing women\u0027s self-defense courses who don\u0027t see me as one of them, and I also hate the token useless advice from men who don\u0027t understand the realities of transmisogynist violence.\"\u2014Scout\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://fourelementsfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/fourelementsfitness-oakland-166.jpg?id=6742\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU for joining us in providing something that is dearly needed. With Patrons like you, we will be able to cover the cost of space expansion, top notch training, equipment, gear and clothing (since many of the program participants cannot afford workout attire).\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hold classes at FOUR Elements Fitness in Oakland, CA, which is a women-of-color-owned combat arts studio which has provided full and partial scholarships to many of the students. Most traditional fight gyms are unsupportive, uncomfortable or unsafe for trans and queer folk, so let\u0027s work together and change this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you want to make a large, one-time donation?
