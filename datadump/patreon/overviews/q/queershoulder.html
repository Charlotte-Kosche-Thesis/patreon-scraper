Thanks for taking a moment to check out my Patreon page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA little about me \u0026amp; my work:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am\n a writer, performer, writing instructor, and cultural worker from San Francisco, with deep roots in both local \u0026amp; international queer \u0026amp; trans, sex worker, and disability communities. Presently, I\u0027m hard at work on \u003cem\u003eHow To Have A Body\u003c/em\u003e, a book of experimental prose \u0026amp; poetry about the intersections between sexuality \u0026amp; disability; and \u003cem\u003eThe Hustle\u003c/em\u003e, a non-fiction narrative about navigating U.S. government social services as a disabled person living in poverty in my rapidly gentrifying hometown. Please take a look at my \u003ca href=\"http://howtohaveabody.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp; \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/queershoulder\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efcbk\u003c/a\u003e page for a more in-depth \u0026amp; comprehensive look at my last 20 years of writing, performance, teaching, cultural production, and activism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m here:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am disabled by several\nchronic illnesses (including fibromyalgia \u0026amp; CFIDS/ME), and am unable to work full-time. As of June 2017, after over 3 years of waiting, my Disability case was (again) denied. I have filed an appeal, but these processes unfortunately move at a glacial pace; actually receiving Disability benefits is likely to take literal \u003cem\u003eyears\u003c/em\u003e at this juncture -- if it happens at all. \u003cstrong\u003eI am currently living off of an \u003cem\u003eextremely\u003c/em\u003e modest government benefits package ($425/month, \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e of which goes towards my rent); \u003cem\u003eas of June 2017, this is my only source of income\u003c/em\u003e. I have created this \nPatreon page to help make the ends meet while living with debilitating chronic illness \u0026amp; chronic pain and without a safety net. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you\u0027ll get as a monthly supporter:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Original writing (from \u003cem\u003eHow To Have A Body, The Hustle,\u003c/em\u003e and other works in progress).\u003cbr\u003e- Original performance/reading videos \u0026amp; vlogs (everything from me on an actual stage to me reading into my webcam from bed).\u003cbr\u003e- Original writing prompts (if you\u0027ve ever wanted to attend one of my writing classes, but aren\u0027t local to the Bay Area, this is a lovely way to work with me from afar).\u003cbr\u003e- Other content as time \u0026amp; energy allow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so very much for your interest \u0026amp; support! \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
