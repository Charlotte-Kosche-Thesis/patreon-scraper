    "summary": "OH HAI LOVE. How are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Tommy and I\u0027m an Essex boy, living in Brighton, Queer Artist making theatre that pushes the barriers of conversation. My work is extremely personal and makes me confront subjects I\u0027d rather leave hidden in a box at the back of my wardrobe. As an artist, I think it\u2019s important to push conversation and delve deeper into what we can speak about in the traditional theatre space. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy debut show, Homophobe, hit London and Brighton to critical acclaim in 2016. I even won an award so I can now add award winning to my job title now. The press also said some lovely things about me. Here\u0027s a few of my favourite lines...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"The Queer Historian does not only have an incredibly wide range of talents, but he is also able to bring a deeply personal experience in front of an audience in a heartfelt way\" Arts Award Voice\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"It\u0027s incredibly important that voices and stories such as Tommy\u0027s are heard in theatre.\" A Younger Theatre\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...but I\u0027m not going to lie. Making work is expensive. People need to pay their bills (can you pay my bills? can you pay my telephone bills? can you pay my automo-bills?) and while I funded the last show out of my own back pocket, I can\u2019t keep doing it. I don\u0027t have that kind of money just laying around. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile me and my little team secure funding for the future from grants and the strange pockets of cash that\u0027s available for emerging artists like me, I still need to find roughly 10% of each of my productions budget and so here I am looking for that dollar. So if you\u0027ve got a bit of loose change at the bottom of your account that you want going to a good home, I can promise you this - each project is going to be bigger, bolder \u0026amp; braver and you will be helping me create some good work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh and if you\u0027ve just come here for a nosey because you\u0027ve seen this on my social channels then here\u0027s a picture of me deep throating a balloon for art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s23.postimg.org/uxuefel5n/Homophobe_7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotographer: Matt Golowcynsk.\u003cbr\u003e"
