Hosted by intelligence analysis and counter terrorism expert Tom Quiggin, The Quiggin Report gives behind the scenes insight into the world of intelligence and how western governments deal with, the growing phenomenon of extremist groups, gaining influence within western governments.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NjkufhM.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWe can\u0027t do this without you... From years of experience, Tom knows that the best way to fight for our freedoms is knowledge. For this podcast, Tom is on a mission to bring you the most up to date and accurate information. To do this we need your help to support the show and share with your networks Tom\u2019s insights, ideas and experience. This way we can keep the show independent and out of the control of the very organizations that wish to distort the truth.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn our ever-connected world it\u2019s important to be able to provide unfiltered, unedited insights and evidence. This is exactly how Tom presents his expert analysis and data to countless courts, intelligence agencies, military personnel, and now with this podcast, you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is your chance to contribute and actually support the production of a podcast dedicated to help open people\u2019s minds to the real truth based on critical analysis and facts from an expert. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany people have already been drawn in to embrace antithetical ideas, through reasons that perhaps on the surface seem logical and appealing, but are founded on false information and motives. These same people would likely reject these ideas on recognizing the undeniable and evidence backed truth which Tom is providing here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u2019s important to understand that on the whole those who currently support issues such as censorship, are well intentioned. However, they fail to see the consequences or understand the many grave concerns our security forces are currently faced with. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo win this battle, people need access to the truth and the evidence to support it.

This is similar to a Netflix\u2019s subscription, only that access to our material is free, and by showing your support you become part of our team to create this important content. \u003cbr\u003e\nIt is important to remember that the content shared on The Quiggin Report are also Tom\u2019s professional recommendations to legislators and government representatives. With your support for the show these parties can clearly see you share their concerns, and they should not fear to speak openly and honestly about many of the sensitive topics covered on the podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nIf you share our interests and concerns please help in bringing them to the attention of people across the globe. We understand that many of you cannot be seen to be vocal due to your chosen career, family beliefs or peers. However, you can still join the fight by helping us lay the path for others in similar situations and legislators fighting stigmatization and public shaming tactics of the far-left Islamist and secular Islamists lobbying to quash free speech and free ideas. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSign up \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eanonymously\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e on Patreon right now.\u003c/strong\u003e Help us continue this fight for all of our freedoms and civil liberties now, and for future generations to come.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBACKGROUND\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nA former Senior Fellow at S.
