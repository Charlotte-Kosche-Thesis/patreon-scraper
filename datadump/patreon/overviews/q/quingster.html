    "summary": "Hi everyone! Thanks for checking out my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Nathan Langford, and I write a comic called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://quingcomics.com/Chronicle\"\u003eChronicle\u003c/a\u003e and also have a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://quingcomics.com/blog\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e where I sometimes post stories and other interesting things. Check them out! Meanwhile, I\u0027m also working on a bunch of other projects, like a text adventure. By becoming my patron, you will be financially supporting these endeavors!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"But Nathan,\" you ask. \"You seem to be creating stuff just fine without money. Why turn to Patreon?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy response is simple. I enjoy money. I like being able to buy things. Many of these things that I buy go towards creating more interesting creative stuff. Some of these things go towards staving off the inevitable specter of death. By creating a Patreon page, I gain access to another source of money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Okay,\" you say, hesitantly. \"I get that, I guess. Will my becoming your patron actually affect the quantity or quality of your work in any way?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s a good question. In a way, doesn\u0027t everything affect everything? Think about it, won\u0027t you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"That wasn\u0027t really a satisfactory answer,\" you respond, getting increasingly agitated. \"Will I at least get anything for supporting you?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes. You will get the satisfaction of helping to support me in my creative endeavors. If you want something else out of it, let me know, and maybe I\u0027ll add that as a reward of some sort. That said, I wouldn\u0027t hold my breath. Remember that the whole purpose of this is for me to get money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"That sounds sort of greedy and self-centered,\" you say in a huff. \"I\u0027m not sure I want to be your patron. If I don\u0027t, will this affect me in any way?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s a good question. In a way--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Really?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, fine. The answer is no. My comic will remain free, as will my blog. Nothing\u0027s changing, and you\u0027re probably not even missing out on anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Good. One last question. Will you be making any more GTA stunt videos?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think you may be confusing me with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/kilianexperience\"\u003esomeone else\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
