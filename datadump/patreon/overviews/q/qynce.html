    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Qynce! I\u0027m a 20-year-old college student pursuing physics and art, and I\u0027m a transmasculine nonbinary person who started hormone replacement therapy (testosterone) on 8/11/2017. My goal is to document this new phase in my life through comics, and I want to do that in a couple ways.\u003cbr\u003eFirst, I intend to make a series of comics documenting the year or so of my life leading up to me starting T. It was kind of a struggle to get the ball rolling, and I had a lot of support from some people in my life, and not a lot from others who were important to me, so it\u0027s really kind of a story of me deciding that this is something I need to do for myself and deciding that I would deal with the negative consequences of it instead of avoiding them. It\u0027s also a story of me growing into myself as an adult person, and figuring out how to be more independent from not just my family, but my friends as well. It\u0027s a lot of fun!\u003cbr\u003eSecond, I\u0027ll be creating (mostly) daily journal comics documenting my transition. They won\u0027t all be explicitly about me being trans, a lot of them will probably be pretty average daily life stuff, because I mean, that\u0027s the life, y\u0027know. But I really want to make sure I remember this period of my life, and documenting it on a regular basis seems like the best way to go about that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/4092da670516e9b262710ded3fecbe95/tumblr_ounoofIVi21r51qoro1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo! If you subscribe to this Patreon, you\u0027ll get access to my (mostly) daily comics, and any behind the scenes development stuff for the comic about me starting T. And, maybe, some other stuff, too! I have a lot of ideas for comics that I want to make eventually, and when I get to work on those, you\u0027ll be the first to know! The money I get from this patreon will pretty much exclusively go towards helping me live my life. It\u0027ll help me pay for T, food, and general living expenses. So by subscribing to my patreon, you\u0027re helping me continue to be in a position where I can create art on a regular basis! Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe art that I post online has always been accessible, as in I\u0027ve never charged money to view it. I think art should be accessible to everyone, while I also think artists should get paid for the important work they do, and, y\u0027know, it\u0027s hard to put both of those things into practice and balance them. My best idea on how to do that here is to make my art viewable only to paying patreons, but only for the first month that it\u0027s posted. After something has been up for a month, \u00a0the post will be available for anyone to look at!\u003cbr\u003eSo even if you can\u0027t pledge money, definitely follow this account so you can keep up with my posts as they become public!"
