    "summary": "The Quality Production Squadron began with one idea:\u003cbr\u003eWhat if people actually wanted to listen to us?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat thought spawned \"A Quality Interruption,\" the flagship program of our fledgling network. Started in 2013 (technically), \"A Quality Interruption\" is a podcast dedicated to the midnight movies of the world. From French classics to trash zombie movies to kung fu flicks and chambara epics, we will watch them all. Sometimes despite our best judgement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext came \"WORLD\u0027S A MESS.\" Hosted by Alex Smith and James Kislingbury, \"World\u0027s a Mess\" focuses on the dumbest news that we can possibly find. From people getting bit in the junk by spiders (or snakes or spiders again) to fast food fights to mass die offs of animals, \"World\u0027s a Mess\" has it all. The real news. The real dumb news.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, podcasting isn\u0027t a free as we would like it to be. There are costs: Equipment, hosting, gas money, editing time, renting films, Cruz\u0027s grocery store bought pastries, on and on and on. Plus, we gotta keep Alex in pain killers and high-powered, military-grade laxatives. And it adds up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating episodes under the aegis of the Quality Production Squadron is something we\u0027ll be doing for the foreseeable future, regardless if we ever get paid for it. With that said, we want to make this show the best that we possibly can. That\u0027s where you come in. By helping us improve our equipment, keep our shows up and running, and letting us know that there are fans out there who care, we can strengthen the quality of our show in ways that we simply cannot do ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome on. Let\u0027s do this thing.\u003cbr\u003e"

AQI stars Cruz Flores and James Kislingbury and focuses on the kind of movies you watched half-drunk at two AM and wondered if they actually existed or not. It sounds like it too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, we have \"World\u0027s a Mess,\" a program dedicated to the news too shit to print. Alex Smith and James Kislingbury dive deep into the American weird so that you don\u0027t have to. The world is dumb as hell and about twice a week, we make a bad show to hammer this fact home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hit hard and we hit fast and we do it just about every week. We\u0027re big fans of our own work and we\u0027d love for you to come with us. Come on. Let\u0027s do it.",
