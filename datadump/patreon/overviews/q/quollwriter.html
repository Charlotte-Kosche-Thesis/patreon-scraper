    "summary": "I\u0027ve been working on Quoll Writer for close to 7 years now but it\u0027s been a hobby project, something I do to help facilitate my own writing. \u00a0The problem with Quoll Writer being a hobby project is that I can\u0027t devote much time to it. \u00a0In the past I have either worked on a QW release in my spare time or on my stories and first book. \u00a0During that time I\u0027ve had a full time job that paid the bills but last November my circumstances changed and I moved to working part-time. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeizing the opportunity I decided to complete\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://quollwriter.com/user-guide/editor-mode/overview.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEditor Mode\u003c/a\u003e with my newfound extra time. \u00a0It was a vanity project, something I really wanted to do because I believe it provides a function that writers have needed for a long time. \u00a0But now I\u0027m at a junction. \u00a0Going forward I need to make a choice. \u00a0Either I continue developing QW for the majority of my time and have writing as my hobby or QW becomes my part-time hobby again and development slows to a crawl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in! \u00a0With your help I can devote the lion\u0027s share of my time to QW. \u00a0The recent explosion in interest has introduced a large number of new users to Quoll Writer and many of them have made feature requests. \u00a0I want to push ahead with QW\u0027s development but I need funding to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a brief list of the major features I\u0027d like to add to QW in the future:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdd documents to assets and characters\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIntroduce scene and chapter planning\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHave a timeline allowing you to plan events and timings in your story\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIntegrate with publishing tools and websites (such as Amazon, Lulu and Smashwords)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReal HTML export\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGenerate\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.wordle.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eword clouds\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrint preview with better print handling and options\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eODT/PDF file import/export\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIntroduce a \"text tidy\" that would allow you to format your text according to configurable rules, for example \"2 spaces after a full stop\" or \"use this quotation character\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore metrics/statistics and visual representations\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBeef up snapshots to be real backups\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProject/chapter versioning\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuild on and improve Editor Mode\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate a \"Find an Editor\" website service\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMove QW to use\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/get-started-tutorial/jfx-overview.htm#JFXST784\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJavaFX\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe list of minor improvements is so long I won\u0027t even attempt to list them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut let me be clear. \u00a0Development of Quoll Writer will never stop while I have breath in my body and at least 1 finger that can use a keyboard. \u00a0I use Quoll Writer for my own writing and I NEED Quoll Writer. \u00a0It is only the pace of development that is changing. \u00a0With your help I can keep the pace high and make QW even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat about a Mac version? \u00a0I get a lot of requests for a Mac version but I believe that since it is a standalone project it would be better handled with a Kickstarter rather than as part of the normal development of QW. \u00a0It also allows Mac users to get QW rather than non-Mac users having to pay for it. \u00a0If you would be willing to fund a Kickstarter for a Mac version please let me know."
