    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very excited to introduce the Partreon page for people who would\n like to invest in The Modern Manhood Podcast, and hopefully start a \ncommunity surrounding healthy masculinity. That\u0027s always been a bigger goal of mine, to have a community of like minded males. I have been very fortunate to make the podcast, and to have the following that it has. I have also noticed that a lot of people want more information, and to work on specific goals they have in mind to better themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked with youth and males in a\n human service capacity for 5 years plus. It was one of my passions to \nhelp out males of all kinds in their quest for their own perfect \nmanhood, and to be a better ally to the many marginalized population in \nEdmonton and beyond. This podcast I felt was one way to reach out and \nhelp. This Patreon page is for more than just the podcast, but it is also a way for people to invest in the podcast itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first tier is for people who just want to help the podcast and be a part of the credits in the show. It\u0027s a really small gesture that helps me out big time! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt goes on from investor to grower, with each step someone who wants to help and will make me work harder to help you. Know that I don\u0027t have all the answers but I can rely on people I know to give one. This will also give you access to exclusive content, and google hangouts with me and others who are invested in COMMUNITY. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope we can grow together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
