Those who come here from the site where I predominantly publish my stories know me to some extent. For those who don\u0027t, let me introduce myself formally:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe artist name \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003eMeakashi\u003c/span\u003e came to me quite randomly around ten years ago and replaced my previous one - illfourte. It\u0027s a Japanese term that refers to detectives during the Edo Period of Japan - which has nothing to do with what I stand for. Instead, I prefer to break it down into its parts, which literally mean Eye and Bright. Bright Eyes!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWell, that\u0027s in complete contrast to the depths and darkness of my imagination (and the Internet), where I find some of the blackest, most morbid and perverted themes, which I shamelessly employ in my stories with no regard for decency. Nothing is taboo for me. This means I can write, unfettered by common sense, and create humor that might even make you question whether you should be laughing or not. And then laugh anyway, because Schadenfreude is best enjoyed when served in black comedy, sprinkled with plenty of people\u0027s misfortune.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI guess you want to know what I create, then?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy currently ongoing main project is\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eMaou Shoujo Magical Chaos\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (Demon Lord\u0027s Girl, a play on Mahou Shoujo - Magical Girl). It\u0027s a story about a girl reincarnated as an amorphous, shape-shifting, tentacle-sprouting Eldritch Abomination that grows stronger by swallowing and dissolving people in her unscientific, \"bigger-on-the-inside\" body. And as you can expect with tentacle monsters, there is going to be tentacle-on-helpless-victim action. And with shape-shifting, you can expect some creative forms of sexual plays.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBut what puts this aside from the strange Japanese obsession with tentacle porn, you ask? There\u0027s a story.\u003cbr\u003e...\u003cbr\u003eNo, seriously, there\u0027s a story in there somewhere!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAlright, jokes aside:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMaou Shoujo Magical Chaos is the tale of a perfectly normal, albeit tomboyish, Japanese high school girl who goes to sleep after an exhausting inter-high school marathon and wakes up as a tentacle monster in a fantasy world of sword and magic. And she also happens to be the child of that world\u0027s tentacle monster demon lord.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThat demon lord teleports her to a random location in that world\u0027s wilderness with the condition to return in three years, so that she has a claim to the demon throne. With everything pointing to her having died in her sleep and reincarnated, she can only try to survive the dangers of the world with wits and her extensive fantasy game knowledge. Despite consciously denying that she feels the urge of sitting on the throne, her secret Chuunibyou heart beats faster at the prospect of becoming the next demon lord one day.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHow will her bizarre story unfold?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFollow the story on RoyalRoadL:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://royalroadl.com/fiction/10381\"\u003eMaou Shoujo Magical Chaos\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eSo, you may be asking what I\u0027m using these donations for?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be perfectly honest, writing is my life blood, and I\u0027d like to be able to do it full time.
