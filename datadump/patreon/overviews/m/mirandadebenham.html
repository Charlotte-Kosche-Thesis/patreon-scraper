I\u0027m a theatre producer based in London, producing work in my spare time, evenings, weekends and annual leave! I also work for a theatre company, managing their website and doing marketing.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you make?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI make theatre that I believe in. Not a very helpful definition, really, so let\u0027s try and narrow it down. I make theatre that changes people, or that tries to change people. I make the kind of theatre where at the end of the play there is a moment of silence, when the audience tries to remember that it was only a dream, just before they start applauding. I live for that moment. I make theatre that is fun, that is serious, that tells stories and makes you laugh, or cry, or shiver.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore concretely, I make theatre from new writing, or devised pieces, or very occasionally from existing scripts, always with a new twist. I don\u0027t make the theatre which will sell the best (that would be Frozen: The Musical or possibly Oliver!), but I make the theatre which I think should sell the best.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s your big crazy dream?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo I ask a lot of people this question. It\u0027s a fun question. It means, what would you do if money was no object, if you could go anywhere and be anything. If you were a kid again. And my answer is always the same: my Big Crazy Dream is to own a theatre, and produce new writing for everyone to see. To make it possible for new, upcoming playwrights to have their work produced without having to tame themselves, or censor themselves, or be more acceptable. To find and nurture the next Kate Tempest. To make theatre interesting, affordable and relevant again. That\u0027s the dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I become your patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eBecause I\u0027ll really do it. I follow through, I run as far as I can with what resources I have, and if I have more resources, I can do more things. Having a regular and reliable income for my theatre work would enable me to work comfortably, and consistently, instead of frantically and in fear of failure. It would give me room to breathe, and to grow my practice, and in practice that means more shows, more often and in better venues. It means shows with more rehearsal time, more editing time and better conditions for the cast. It\u0027s the difference between making theatre \u003cem\u003edespite\u003c/em\u003e, and making theatre \u003cem\u003ebecause\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are you on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get asked this a lot. Why use Patreon? Why not just Kickstarter each production separately? The answer is, because stability is important. More important than you might think, if you\u0027ve always had it. And because with stability comes freedom, which is the most important factor in creative work.\u003c/div\u003e"
