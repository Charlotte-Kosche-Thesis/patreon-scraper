    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eGreetings and welcome to the Morrowind Modding Showcases patreon page. We\u0027re a YouTube channel dedicated to showcasing and celebrating the works of modders in both the Morrowind and Oblivion modding communities, and maybe someday we\u0027ll expand to covering the works of other games as well. Our main show, Morrowind Modding Showcases, is dedicated to featuring 13 Morrowind mods just about every week, and we also have a number of other series, including the only regularly broadcast spoken modder interview series, where we interview modders for The Elder Scrolls games and talk about their creative process, modding accomplishments, and where they\u0027d like to see the modding community go in the coming years. Our other series include everything from mod trailers for major projects like Tamriel Rebuilt, Morrowind Rebirth, and Skyrim - Home of the Nords, tutorial videos that explain how to create and install mods, and also promotional videos for modder\u0027s looking to release indie games and novels outside of the modding realm called the Modder\u0027s Kickstarter Corner. Our channel is here to serve the modding community in all things, from mod showcases, to helping modders realize their dreams outside the realm of modding. Modding is after all one of the greatest creative hobbies one can partake in, and that deserves celebration and support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for why we\u0027re on Patreon and why we need help, much like every YouTube channel, Morrowind Modding Showcases has a number of monthly expenses, and new equipment to improve the quality of our videos is never going to be free. So that\u0027s where you guys hopefully come in, you can pitch as little as $1 a month, and that\u0027ll go a long way to keeping Morrowind Modding Showcases on the air with improved content in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get in return? Well, as a YouTube channel, there\u0027s not really a whole lot that I can reward you guys with, since the content we create is to support modders, and making it exclusive to only one-platform (like patreon supporters) would be completely contrary to our purpose. So instead, here\u0027s what I can offer you, as a reward for helping Morrowind Modding Showcases stay on the air, I\u0027ll take any and all suggestions that you guys might have for new video series (though I\u0027d do this anyway), and I\u0027ll make pilot episodes based on your suggestions and some of my ideas for new video content, and let you guys (patreon supporters) decide if any of them will become full-featured series on the channel. This way you get a say in what content gets produced on the channel without neccessarily pay-walling anything for everyone else. And of course, if you guys have any ideas for some better rewards, do let me know and I\u0027ll see what I can do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMorrowind Modding Showcases has been around since July of 2014, and in that time we\u0027ve featured nearly 600 mods and interviewed over 24 modders. With your help, we\u0027ll keep Morrowind Modding Showcases going for a long time to come, featuring more mods and interviewing more modders, and celebrating that wonderful creative hobby known as modding!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, and thanks for supporting Morrowind Modding Showcases!\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions regarding Patreon and Morrowind Modding Showcases, feel free to stop by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://darkelfmodding.com/forum/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eour forums\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MMSMods\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esend us a tweet\u003c/a\u003e, or stop by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MWShowcases/timeline\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eour Facebook page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"

Modding is a great pastime, and I firmly believe everyone should embrace their creative side and try it out sometime.",
