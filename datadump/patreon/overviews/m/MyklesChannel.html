I\u0027ve always had a passion for these things, and strive to do them full-time. I create 100% original work as well as parodies, that tend to be family friendly. I love creating comedy in my work that is both safe for kids, yet clever enough for adults enjoy! Most content online (especially parodies) tend to use their comedy by taking a family friendly property, and making it as inappropriate as possible to get a laugh. I strive to make my content show that you can still be funny and clean at the same time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent far too much time working multiple jobs at the same time, and rarely have time to do what I\u0027m truly passionate about; creating funny and entertaining content for \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e! Years ago I used to create video games and YouTube content on a regular basis. Typically creating gaming related videos, whether is be a review, Let\u0027s Play, or something off the wall with very heavy extensive video editing. Eventually I started doing more videos on camera and creating unboxing videos and doing voice impressions. A few years back, I finally decided to learn how to animate. Ever since then, life hit hard, I\u0027ve worked several hours everyday and I rarely create videos anymore. As a result, I\u0027ve basically become a shell of my former self. Although I still have very loyal followers, I went from gaining around from 3,000 - 20,000 views per video, down to around 500 due to lack of content and consistency. I was recently given a rare opportunity to have about a month or 2 of free time, in which I\u0027m taking advantage as much as possible to work on my craft in the meantime. Patreon and your support can help me to potentially keep it this way, without going back to working myself to exhaustion and not having time or energy to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can make multiple content on a weekly basis, and also eventually hire artists, animators and programmers to help create even higher quality work, and even longer animated videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make it happen!\u003cbr\u003e"
