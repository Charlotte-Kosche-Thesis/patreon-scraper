    "summary": "Murder Ballads is the folk/blues/whatever-we-feel-like-playing duo consisting of Catt Kingsgrave and Adam Fromm, who are cursed by the geography gods to live several hours\u0027 drive apart. The distance leaves us once a month tops to either (a) rehearse, (b) record, or (c) perform, which in turn leaves us not enough time to do any of the above. At the same time we\u0027re hitting a creative sprint with scads of new material pouring out of us every time we get together, and having spent a year trying to fund and record our first CD, \u003cem\u003ePretty in Scarlet\u003c/em\u003e, we don\u0027t want to wait that long again before letting our new stuff out into the wild.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where this Patreon comes in. Our purposes are twofold: one, to let our fans hear what we\u0027ve been up to during our overly long radio silences; and two, to help fund our next studio recording sooner than later. To that end, we are offering up a combination of demo recordings (ranging from rough to not-so-rough) of the new songs we\u0027ve been working on and performance videos both formal and informal, from concert appearances and living-room sessions with friends and loved ones. Our focus will be on material we\u0027ve not made available elsewhere, with perhaps an occasional live performance of a fan favorite if we find it exceptional. We are offering these up on a per-item rather than monthly basis, as that damned geography will likely hinder any sort of by-the-clock regular posting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking us out here and at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://murder-ballads.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eour website\u003c/a\u003e, and we hope you\u0027ll join us on this little journey. We can\u0027t wait to share with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eCatt and Adam"
