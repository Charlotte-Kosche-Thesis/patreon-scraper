I wanted more than anything to be able to draw \njust as well as the artists that designed those spectacular box art \nimages for games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, rather early in my youth I began\n to develop medical issues that slowly, but surely, resulted in more \nproblems that have landed me in the situation I am in today. Unable to \nwork due to 3 different sleep disorders, crippling monthly pain, \nanxiety, depression, knee injuries and Adjustment Disorder (a less severe form of PTSD), I rely heavily on\n my husband for support. And I feel just so bad! I really want to help \nmore...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite all my struggles, I have worked tremendous hard \nto get where I am today. It has taken me 5-6 years of agonizingly \npushing myself, but I am finally on a much brighter road, and I will \ncontinue to work towards becoming healthier, and ultimately \naccomplishing my dreams!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am really behind. Unlike \nmost people, I wasn\u0027t unable to finish college due to my failing health,\n and sadly government financial support is very difficult to get because\n so many people have taken advantage of the system, leaving people like \nmyself to suffer even though we legitimately NEED the help. Regardless \nof the circumstances, I am determined to stay positive and fight for my \ngoals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help support me in my journey by encouraging, \nchatting, donating, or watching my account for regular updates! \nConstructive criticism is welcome, but please be gentle? Haha. I really \nDO want to improve as much as I can though!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do Patreon for Patreon! Message me if you are interested, or select the corresponding reward! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWishing you lots of love and happiness!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eMREcartoonist\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove love!"
