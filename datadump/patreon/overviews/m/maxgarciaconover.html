    "summary": "hey thanks for coming to this page -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethis week i wrote a new song, recorded it, paired it with a simple video, and sent it directly to the people who have joined this page (they\u0027re called patrons).\u00a0i try do this most weeks and it\u0027s my favorite work to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyou don\u0027t have to be a patron to find the weekly songs - anyone can listen, watch, \u0026amp; download them for free (you can find them on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://maxgarciaconover.com/patronblog\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://maxgarciaconover.com/patronblog\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis blog\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-B3s6E0cWZ-j7tI23mZnh5Zxs5lWokfp\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis playlist\u003c/a\u003e).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebecoming a patron is for people who find value in the project and want to help keep it going.\u00a0patrons choose what amount they want to support per song (most people choose $1) and patreon automatically charges them at the end of each month based on how many songs i posted that month (never more than 4). you can put a cap on the amount you\u0027ll be charged each month and it\u0027s easy to change your pledge amount.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eit\u0027s hard to overstate how important patrons are to this project and how grateful i am for their support. as a thank you, i send out a signed, handmade album and lyric book every 10-15 new songs. these albums are only available to patrons and all patrons also get the secret link to download all past volumes. if you want to support the project at a higher level, there are some additional rewards in the right column.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eok. that\u0027s the pitch. thanks for hearing me out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyour grateful songmaker,\u003cbr\u003e\nmax\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEDIT #1: patreon now requires a minimum $1 contribution per song, which is lame (used to be you could join for a penny). you can still put a monthly cap on your support, so the minimum pledge is now $1 per month. and if you\u0027re already a patron you can stay at whatever level you\u0027re currently at even if it\u0027s less than $1. my hope is that this project will go on for a long time, so please join at a level that is totally comfortable for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEDIT #2: the video says the weekly songs albums will be sent out every 10 songs, but that\u0027s since been changed to every 10 to 15 songs. and the lyric book may not always be handwritten. (it was getting difficult to send these albums out to patrons every few months while still being a full-time touring musician, so i\u0027ve scaled my ambitions back a bit.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
