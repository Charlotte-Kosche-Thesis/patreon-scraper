When I was younger storytelling\ngot me into a lot of trouble. And now that I\u0027m older, it still gets me into trouble\nif I don\u2019t choose my audience carefully. This is why writing is a godsend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut enough about me. Let me tell you about the story\u2026.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI began writing \u003cem\u003eBrood Parasites\u003c/em\u003e with a clear ending in mind, and a\ngood one I thought. However, the story thought different, and it bucked and\ntwisted as I tried to force it towards what, in my opinion, was a solid\npre-determined conclusion. The story told me who was boss and that a new ending\nwas inevitable, and that necessitated a rewrite. So here I am, excited and eager\nto see how this story will end, and I want to take you on the ride with me.\nThis will be a journey of discovery for us both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should I Patreonise you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can patronise me anytime you like. But why should you become a Patreon?\nBecause you like good fiction, you like adventure and fantasy, and most of all,\nyou like a good story well told.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ll be posting 1 - 3 chapters a month which will be free to one and all.\nBut if you patronise (the other meaning) $1.00 per month you will not only be\nmaking me strive to be the best damn writer I can be, you will get the chapter\none week before it\u2019s posted here and with links to files of your e-reader of\nchoice. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd more than that, this will be a collaborative process.  Which characters would you like to see more\nof?  How do you think it will go?  Let me know, speak up!  This is your chance to influence the\ndirection.  As I said, this is a journey\nfor both of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you come with me on this journey and like what you see, when the novel\nis fully released I will compile physical copies and provide the files to\nbackers free of charge, and will offer signed physical copies at minimum cost.\nIf anyone falls in love with the world of Europa as much as I have and is flush\nenough to donate $75 I will write your own story set within the world around\nthe subject of your choosing. How many other people would make you heroes of\nyour own story?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, Enough of That \u2013 What\u2019s the Novel About?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m glad you asked. \u003cem\u003eBrood Parasites \u003c/em\u003eis set in the canal city of\nDunholm, on the edge of the war-torn continent of Europa. The nation of Gallia\nhas overthrown its monarchy and is invading its neighbours one after another.\nSo far Dunholm has been spared by the sea separating it from Europa\u2019s mainland,\nbut as the final nations opposing Gallia fall, that defense will not last\nforever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs the government of Dunholm prepares to secure its borders a smuggler receives\na mysterious delivery, sending into motion civil unrest which could leave\nDunholm defenseless in the face of a Gallish invasion. Only a hired thug\nrunning from his military past, a young government aide fearful he will never\nprove himself a man, and a witch of ambiguous motives know of Dunholm\u2019s danger,\nand whether they will act upon it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo What Now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow we begin.  On the front page of this project you will\nfind the first chapter of \u003cem\u003eBrood Parasites\u003c/em\u003e.  Please, go read it, let me know what you\nthink.  How do you think it will go?  Who do you think will survive to see the\nstory\u2019s end?  If you\u2019re willing we\u2019ll\nfind out together, and I can\u2019t wait.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMichael\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot-So-Frequently Asked Question\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Wait, so\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI can effect the story\u0027s arc?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbsolutely. One of Patreon\u0027s features is the open discourse between writer and reader. \u00a0If you like one character over another, let me know in the comments. \u00a0Tell me who you\u0027d like to follow, what you think they\u0027ll do, what they\u0027ll find, and that could effect the narrative as I write. \u00a0Think of it a little like an adult choose your own adventure story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"How long will the project run?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be posting 2-4 chapters per month, so we\u0027ll see. \u00a0If there\u0027s ever\u00a0a month that my output isn\u0027t as high (two children and paying work take up a rather large portion of my time) I\u0027ll turn off the payments for that cycle, but the story will continue. \u00a0And I promise I\u0027ll make it up to you guys somehow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Stretch goals! \u00a0We wants \u0027em!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll gets \u0027em, just as soon as I figure some out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Chocolate of vanilla?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeopolitan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
