    "summary": "Campfire Stories is a web platform for films that inspire change towards a world in ecological and social balance. The films focus on the roots of the converging crises of our time, which means asking: \"What\u0027s created the conditions that has allowed these problems to materialize?\", and from there shine a light on alternative, fun, grueling or amazing stories, solutions, people, inventions and ways that lead towards a more beautiful world, a less lonely world, a sustainable world \u2013 all set within an environment that isn\u0027t for sale to the highest bidder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site can be found here: campfire-stories.org. Welcome to have a look at the films already created. It takes me between one and three months to produce each film, since I\u0027m doing other work parallell to cover my expenses.\u00a0With your help I\u0027ll be able to continue growing the site, produce films more frequently, find other filmmakers to collaborate with and hire an editor/co-creator. My goal is to eventually be able to produce a new film every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being part of this journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
