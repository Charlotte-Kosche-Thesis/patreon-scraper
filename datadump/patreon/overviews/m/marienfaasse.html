    "summary": "My Background is being an organic, environmental and participative architect. Especially the studying of restoration gave me an archetypal approach. Throughout my life I build myself as a free educationist; taking the opportunity to create a vision and developing practicabilities \"outside the box\" for the school system and the perception of school in general. My main connection in the last years is working with education in Uganda in projects; in a local school up-country, in a private city school and the most extensive: an international school in Kampala. I thank my supporters, then the effort that my venture takes, means working on bridging many gabs and building mental, affective and practical bridges, there where nobody even was thinking of a connection. Also through most important areas of \"approach-engineering\", where funders can put underlayment by providing basic income and coverage for materials and tools for engineering and some allowances for hands-on troops.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "1000 dollar for income, 1000 dollar for requirements, travel costs and support troops.\u003cbr\u003eI am now prepared, but with this patreon engaagement I am equipped for my my goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal is breaking\nopen the way of educating, \u003c/strong\u003enot so much about discussing the \u201cwhat\u201d of the\ncurriculum, but the \u201c\u003cstrong\u003ehow\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor me education is and should be for the child: about \u003cstrong\u003efree understanding\u003c/strong\u003e the content of the\nwhat matters in society and the world around you, thereby getting to understand\nyourself, exploring your talents, unleashing your hobbies and interests and\ngiving you a multi-aged company to deploy and discover yourself socially in\nbreak  \u0026amp; playtime, in projects and in\nteamwork. With competition not as a goal, but as an energizer and to coach\ncompanions where everybody tells you that you are so good at that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe contextual\nanalysis of the situation\u003c/strong\u003e in most schools in \u0026lt;st1\u0026gt;Uganda arises the concern that \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nthe curriculum is thought, leads to crammed and not understood knowledge that\ncocoons you, creating a \u201ctunnel vision\u201d by the pupils. This \u201ctunnel\u201d is caused\nby the chain: curriculum\u0026gt;syllabus\u0026gt;teacher who passes knowledge via the\nblackboard to the kid\u0026gt;that copies it in exercise books\u0026gt;followed by a\nsimilar situation in filling in test and exam papers. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eEffect is that \u003c/strong\u003epupils\nare in danger to develop a separated reality for the school subject content,\nnot connected with the outer reality or the own life reality of the child. This\nis in fact quite similar to hospitalization by a child having to stay too long\nin a hospital.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeachers maintaining this situation are mostly continuing\nthe tunnel situation and vision out of their own school time or keeping up at\nleast a lazy copying practice on auto-pilot modus.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe so gained knowledge is a \u201cnot-ledge\u201d, gives you not\nan interactive reflective supportive side-bedding to your stream of life; it is just\nnot \u201calive\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eRisk is: \u003c/strong\u003eevaporation\nof reality. In fact it would not matter if the content would be just another\ncontextual lie (as these are quite common practice in the nowadays by Western influences spoiled African culture), or the\ntruth, it fits in the context of passing the exam. In this way in education we\nare becoming thieves of the life of children.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn my practice I develop approaches and modules for\nchildren and teachers to break this open. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy going outside, by quizzes, puzzle tours, life big\nboard games on the playground. By creating\nexpression practices in many ways, like presenting on exhibitions and bringing the children in the lead of\ntheir own understanding of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShaping situations where children can unfold themselves\nin well set conducive topic-environments instead of trying to pump abstract\nfacts into them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn a thus enhanced environment you see them like breaking\nout of the cocoon, coming out of the tunnel within 2-3 months. And them seeing\nthat learning is actually about the world outside you, even inside you and at\nthe same time deploys you socially. Yes, that looks quite like the\ntransformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow it is the case to disseminate good practice, to train\npromising child workers and getting the attention of the government.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo work on this, in my position I need a support on my\nmonthly income and I need a working budget for creating (self-made and children\nmade) practical-creative educational tools and educational materials, as well\u00a0as some paid hands-on helpers and transport costs.The footsteps on the way I will share at least monthly\nwith my Patreon community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI see the way forward in\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTraining existing teachers. Bringing them in a\ncombination of personal development, didactic development, and interactive\ndevelopment. \u003cbr\u003e-Bringing\nthem by their own resources.\u003cbr\u003e-Finding\nways of making changing habits lighter, more respected and cooperatively carried out.\u003cbr\u003e-Awaken\nbackground leaders in them to become creators of new educational unfolding\nambiences, to replace the nowadays push and pull settings, molding them towards the plug and play exam-society connection.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFind new \u201cunspoiled\u201d promising child workers to train\nand coach them as trainers of trainers of a vitalized approach.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCreating training modules and training courses.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBuilding coalitions with similar initiatives and\nstakeholders and advocate towards the Ministry of Education.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSupporting potential role-model teachers and\ncreating model-situations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDissemination of results, experiences and didactic\n\u201ctools\u201d, even play materials.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;/st1\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e",
