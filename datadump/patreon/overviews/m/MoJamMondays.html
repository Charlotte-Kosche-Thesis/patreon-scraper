Every Monday from 9:30pm-2am, Seattle artists and musicians gather for a no-holds barred jam session. We have artists who improv paint and create while the improv music goes on.\u003cbr\u003eWe have been sponsored by Brother Thelonious, a beer from North Coast Brewery in California. A local Seattle distillery called Dry Fly. American Music is our newest sponsor and now provide a drum set, guitar and bass amps. We are trying to spread the word, because we realize the community needs a space like MoJams. And Patreon will enable us to share this with the world!\u003cbr\u003eMo\u0027, the drummer, creator and hostess, was just endorsed by Mo Drumsticks, a drum stick company in New Jersey."
