    "summary": "Hello, Mark Does Stuff friends and fans! In order to help keep the Mark Does Stuff online universe running smoothly, I\u0027ve decided to start using Patreon. For the most part, my work reviewing book and television series unspoiled (and recording evidence of that for all to see!) has been a one-dude show. It is getting to the point where this is physically and logistically impossible, just because the sheer amount of work is overwhelming. My Patreon will provide me with the chance to get some more professional help so that I CAN WRITE MORE FOR ALL OF YOU. This will help me free up time to provide:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore reviews. I desperately need time to do Double Features on Mark Reads, since there are many books that need to be covered.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore bonus things for YOUR ENTERTAINMENT.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore touring / live events. After having to cancel nearly 30 events this year due to time and money constraints, I\u0027d like to begin rebooking everything, but this costs time and money I don\u0027t have now.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSPECIAL SURPRISES I\u0027VE WANTED TO PULL OFF FOR YEARS BUT COULD NOT DO SO UNTIL PATREON CAME INTO MY LIFE.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWork on my fiction career! I have a YA Contemporary novel out in 2018, and this will allow me to take some time off as needed to focus on writing.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these things would be possible with regular contributions to my Patreon account. I would love to provide a method to support me monthly to my fans who perhaps aren\u0027t interested in commissions or video passes, but would like something special from me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
