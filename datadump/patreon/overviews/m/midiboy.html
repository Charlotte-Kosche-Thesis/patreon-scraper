This is really cool to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will currently be using this page to promote the upcoming Midiboy album \"Revitalized!\" which will be a \"Greatest Hits\" with a twist. \u00a0Rather than throwing a compilation of already recorded songs from \"back in the day\" together, I am going to take all my best songs and fan favorites and completely re-imagine and redo them. \u00a0\"Revitalize!\" them if you will. \u00a0"
