    "summary": "Hello I am Meshell Baker, best known around the world as \u003cem\u003eThe Congruency Catalyst\u003c/em\u003e, has big\nadventures ahead. On April 3, 2017, I am launching the #DreamBigBus Tour, a 1-year speaking tour with a twist. The tour will begin with a limited launch across 10\ncities, and will include organized speaking events, workshops and media\nappearances. I\u2019ll be traveling from city to city in a 22-foot Class B\nrecreational vehicle, decorated with one burning question: \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat would you do if you knew you\nwould not fail?\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMany have never truly considered this question. It\u2019s\nestimated that only 3% of the population ever writes a goal, so it is\nunderstandable that most people don\u2019t experience the fulfillment of dreams in\ntheir lifetime. My mission is to empower as many people as possible to experience joy and\nexcitement for their lives through my unique VISION Development Process. I\u0027ve built my career around enlightening people around the power they possess to\ncreate circumstances and opportunities, and establish a vision so compelling\nthat it propels them past obstacles, setbacks, fears and doubts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy hitting the road via RV, I am putting motivation in\nmotion. I;m excited to live a mobile life, traveling this great country\nmeeting, speaking, and working with people to help make their VISION a reality.\nBy painting my key question on the RV, I am inviting people to engage with me,\neven if we\u0027ve never met. \u00a0I am looking forward to tracking the sparks\nthat the question ignites using the hashtag #DreamBIGBus. Whether people hear me speak or just wave as they drive by, I\u0027m planning to evoke conversation\nduring this adventure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn each city, I will schedule at least two Value of Your\nVision speaking events. \u00a0I will also be available for to facilitate my signature\nVISION Development Workshops, during which participants can begin to craft\ntheir own unique VISION Billboard\u2122, and 1-2 day VISION Mastery\u2122\nIntensives with individuals or teams, where they can work together to create\nand express a clearly defined vision and purpose. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAudiences can find inspiring content, social media links,\nand event dates and locations Join the #DreamBigBus Facebook Group at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/dreambigbus/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/groups/dreambigbus/\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the\nmoney will be used for:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCreating and delivering the rewards.\u003c/strong\u003e They all take time and money\nto produce.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHosting and MailChimp.\u003c/strong\u003e These virtual homes aren\u0027t free, and\nexpenses grow as the audience grows.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTravel expenses for RV upkeep.\u003c/strong\u003e I don\u0027t want transportation costs to hold\nme back from encouraging and empower people to find their purpose.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eContributing to VISION Development Workshops.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027d like to offer a\nfew seats at the workshops to a professional or start-up with funding\nchallenges.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWriting.\u003c/strong\u003e Capturing experiences and insights to create curriculum\nand books.
