Patreon is a platform which allows you, dear readers, to support me on a monthly basis so I can keep doing just that. Patreon is similar to a smaller, sustained kickstarter campaign, in which you send in money in advance of the things that you will later receive- in this case, access to the Patreon-locked blog posts, postcards, welcome packets, and other stuff which I will be sending out to you all :) You can jump in for one month of support or multiple months, and you can change the level of your support or cancel all together at any time. I\u0027ve been supporting a handful of other artists on here for a couple of years, so I can attest that it\u0027s a very easy site to work with. I\u0027m happy to answer questions about it if you have any! Thank you so much for concidering becoming one of my patrons~\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAll the best, Maia\u003cbr\u003e"
