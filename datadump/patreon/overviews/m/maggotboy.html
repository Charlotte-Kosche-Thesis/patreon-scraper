Thanks for taking a look at my Patreon campaign!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Maggot Boy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here I\u0027m gonna assume you already know, but just in case;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.maggot-boy.com/wp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMaggot Boy\u003c/a\u003e is an online dramedy webcomic set within a sprawling city left under quarantine behind huge walls post zombie apocalypse. The story revolves around Davey, aka resident wannabe superhero Maggot Boy - an undead blessed with the power of cognitive thought - his friend/sidekick Chainey, an undead of the same make, and a young necromancer by the name of Sam.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaggot Boy is a sequential ongoing story comic which has been around for years now. It\u0027s available for free online at the above URL, and will continue to be available for free - however I would like to try and mitigate some of the ongoing website costs. Hence, this campaign!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often would I be paying?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a per-page campaign; the money would come out depending on how often I update. This is usually at a rate of around once a week, however my schedule is fairly erratic due to the hectic nature of my life. By funding MB, even if just at a rate of something like 25 cents a page, you\u0027ll be helping to push my drive to create in my spare time, ease the costs of running the website, and will also receive sketch updates, concept art, line art, scripts and other little developmental tidbits as the story progresses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs the site pay-only now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABSOLUTELY NOT! As I mentioned before, Maggot Boy is, always has been and always will be a free online comic! Donating to this campaign is completely optional, and you can opt out of donations at any point in time with no repercussions."
