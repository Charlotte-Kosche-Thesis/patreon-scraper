My name is Misty Vixen. (Not really, but it\u0027s what I call myself.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write stories. I started writing seriously in early 2015, and pretty much just wrote erotica. When I began, short erotica was the way to go, and I managed to carve out a living for myself doing so. Unfortunately, I locked myself in the golden handcuffs: I had to keep writing at a breakneck pace in order to keep paying my bills, making me unable to work on what I really wanted to, which was novel-length, more story-driven narratives. With a lot of sex, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, after a long, winding road of ups and downs, (mainly downs), I\u0027ve finally arrived at a place where I can provide exactly that! Going forward, for the near future, my two primary goals are to re-release my older, episodic content in novel format and to write longer, more in depth and narrative focused stories that feature romantic, casual, and open relationships, and a whole lot of sex.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I have four universes that I write in: Science Fiction, Fantasy, Paranormal Contemporary, and Post-Apocalyptic. I have plans to expand into a few more universes, but these will be where my stories take place for quite awhile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, to answer the question some people might be asking themselves: If I\u0027m doing pretty good selling my books, why do I have a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I was recently screwed over by Amazon. If you want to read the whole sad tale, please check out \u003ca href=\"https://www.mistyvixen.com/blog/2018/5/13/mid-crisis-update\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.mistyvixen.com/blog/2018/5/15/pulling-out-of-the-kindle-unlimited\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e, \u0026amp; \u003ca href=\"https://www.mistyvixen.com/blog/2018/5/18/ive-successfully-pulled-out-of-the-kindle-unlimited-whats-next\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e blog post. The short of it is that Amazon falsely accused me attempting to manipulate the Kindle Unlimited, briefly suspended me, and even threatened to terminate my account, which would effectively cut me out of a massive portion of the eBook market.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, this scared the shit out of me. And it pissed me off. They didn\u0027t fully explain what it was had led them to believe I had done this, and although I was allowed to defend myself, which I apparently did successfully, as I was given my account back, the threat still hangs there. It\u0027s still possible that whatever malfunctioning AI or algorithm they have scanning for \u0027illegitimate activity\u0027 will be tripped up again and I will have no way to defend myself again. (I\u0027m not the only person this has happened to. There are a LOT of other authors dealing with this apparently.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNaturally, this got me thinking about how I could properly prepare for something as catastrophic as this. One thing I was forced to do was to pull entirely out of the Kindle Unlimited. This also led me to think about just creating my own subscription-based service, and as such, I revamped my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is a constantly shifting and fluctuating landscape, and none of it has to do with fairness, all of it has to do with luck. So it made sense for me to have a few backup plans. Plus, I like to be able to give bonuses to the fans, and to allow more hardcore fans to support me further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the spirit of that, I would like to be clear that there will be NO Patreon-exclusive content. Everything written can be purchased individually outside of Patreon, and nude alternates will exclusive only for one month before I release them to my Twitter and my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy my content, and if you feel like supporting me, then thank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Misty\u003c/div\u003e"
