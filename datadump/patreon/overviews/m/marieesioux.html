    "summary": "Mariee Sioux was raised in a small gold mining town in Northern California and is of Indigenous and Polish Hungarian ancestry. She prefers to be known as a storyteller, and a voice for the natural world and trials of humanity through song. For the past 10 years she has been sharing songs she often hardly remembers writing and explains them more as gifts passing through from the Creator. Growing up going to Bluegrass festivals, with a father in a bluegrass band, she was exposed to melody, harmony, and the way music brought community together since childhood. She deeply values the medicinal qualities of music and believes that gathering to share her songs is ultimately for healing purposes. Her finger picking guitar has been compared to the greats of Nick Drake and Bert Jansch and her high ethereal voice bends in realms of the sacred and aches with haunting sensitivity. Her songs have been described as medicinal, hallucinatory, and haunting, with a trance like performance. She has 2 studio albums and has toured extensively over the years, but the struggle is real a lot of the time, she has given up ever living a in a place for long, usually doesn\u0027t, and has minimal means for travel and supplies or musical gear, and basic living expenses. She loves her work her art her path SO DEARLY and would love to be able to do this all with a little more peace of mind and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe has found herself at Patreon as it is harder and harder for songwriters to find enough means through digital airplay and albums sales to make a very steady living. Shes been booking and managing herself her whole career,(with some booking help in France!), She has a deep connection to playing live, it is her life line with spirit to sing for people, hopefully to open hearts and grant some access to healing through sound. She is wanting to tour more, create more, which requires resources she often falls short of having, and is looking for support in helping her get to more places to share the songs live more often, and have the ability to keep her car maintained for travel and to obtain gear that is often needed for touring and PA rentals for concerts sometimes. Shes hoping to continue to play at least a few shows a month, get some new press photos, special live video performances, and videos, and then begin working on her new studio album fall of 2017, with it\u0027s release in early 2018 :) !!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means to world to her to continue to do this meaningful work, she feels like her life depends on it, sharing song, sharing medicine, being together in song and healing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
