I\u0027m a poet who writes bedtime stories in poetic form, and also shorter poems. Your support will back up each story I post, so there are no worries of a monthly billing if I so happen to not post anything!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s my site:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.masopoems.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.masopoems.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut Who is MaSo?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, curious person, MaSo stands for Masoko Ng and Somako. Although I use two names,\u00a0I\u0027m a single person, and these are my pen names. The reason is simply because I\u0027d like to more easily distinguish the piece you\u0027ll be expecting when looking through my poetry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMasoko is the one who writes bedtime stories, while Somako writes poetry. If that were the only difference, it\u0027d seem a little redundant, but they also write about different things. Since it\u0027s more common for people to expect consistency in content, I think that giving me different names helps the audience in distinguishing who they\u0027re more interested in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLong term goals.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I have two books in the works (One long one, and one bedtime story, both poetry). But I also have a bunch more I\u0027d like to write! Sadly time isn\u0027t the easiest thing to come by (college), but if this works out, I\u0027ll be able to fully work on continually providing you guys with free bedtime stories, and eventually, full-fledged poetry books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need monies?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell currently I\u0027m attending college, and it seems the more time I spend there the more I wish I were writing something instead. So if possible, I\u0027d be incredibly happy if I could make a living out of this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless, I\u0027d love if you came over and read a piece or two and I\u0027d be more than glad if you just enjoy my pieces. Also as overused as this sounds, if you\u0027d like to support me but don\u0027t have the resources, it\u0027d be beyond helpful if you share the pieces you like!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to support me, I full-heartedly thank you, and if not, I still hope you enjoy my poems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Masoko \u0026amp; Somako\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not really the best with coming up rewards, so if you have any suggestions I\u0027d be more than glad to hear them out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
