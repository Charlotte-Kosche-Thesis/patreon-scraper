Thank you so much for checking out my Patreon page.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAges ago, I became the artist that I am now by creating fanart\u00a0for my favorite fandoms. Hell, I even worked with fanfiction writers and always got myself involved in their wonderful stories. It\u0027s how I improved as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time went on, I stopped due to life and just being busy. I started drawing for big companies and their advertisements. But it wasn\u0027t the same as creating fanart for the people that genuinely love and find comfort in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is my way of trying to find a way to come back to the fandoms, the people that gave me a chance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you are interested in \u003cstrong\u003emy procedures\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ethe brushes I used\u003c/strong\u003e (man, people asks this a lot), or \u003cstrong\u003ejust generally want to see me draw more\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0-- I will go beyond and above to return your support to you. Thank you again for everything, even if it is checking this page out, I look forward to sharing you art that I love again. \u0026lt;3"
