I also make videos encouraging women over 40 to embrace their age. I need help financing both those ventures.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way to join your favorite creator\u0027s community and pay them for making the stuff you love. \u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xN0HubzkaII\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere is the long detailed version:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI turned 50\u003c/strong\u003e which is (yikes!) a huge milestone. I made the decision to move back to California and follow my dream of being an actress. Hollywood is not known for being kind to 50-year-old women and I moved back to LA to pursue an acting career at an age when most women run screaming from it. Along that vein, I decided to embrace my age and not fight it. Most of the women that I know who are 50 years old are trying very hard to look 35. But if a movie or a TV commercial wants a 35-year-old there are plenty of \u003cstrong\u003ereal 35-year-olds\u003c/strong\u003e so I decided to stop trying to look younger and to embrace my age. In Hollywood, there is a shortage of 50 year old women who look 50 years old. Going gray is a business decision. I think it will lead to more work and that\u2019s what I made the move for. To do the work that I love!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSociety takes it\u2019s cues from what is seen on our TV screens and movie screens. When the only gray hair seen on TV is on senior citizens, we automatically view gray hair as \u201cold\u201d. The only way to change that is to get people on TV and into movies that are young and vibrant with gray hair. That\u2019s what I am here to do. I\u2019m here to represent. Hopefully, to implement a change in how society views those of us with sexy, silver locks! \u003cbr\u003e\nI was asked about my hair so much, I started making YouTube videos for other women and men who are considering going gray or who have gray hair and want to enhance it and themselves in this platinum chapter in their lives.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere your money goes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI found so much satisfaction in creating these videos that I have decided to make it my \u201cday-job\u201d. Instead of working in a restaurant serving food, or as a bartender or any number of temp jobs that so many actors must do to stay alive and pay the bills, I have chosen to make videos that make older women feel better about themselves. Helping them feel like they are being represented in the media. Offering a friend, who is going through the same things they are, as we inevitably, age. I treat it as a full time job, putting out 4 or 5 videos each week, shooting them and editing them myself.  In order to do that, I need a space to shoot in (my apartment) I need electricity and internet. I should probably eat some fresh fruits and vegetable now and then for that whole staying alive thing. I\u2019d like to be able to purchase new products to test and review and not rely solely on sponsors to show my viewers products that can make their lives better. Acting class. Headshots. All the stuff that it takes to keep an actor in business. Better equipment to improve video quality.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPlease don\u2019t contribute if it will be a hardship in any way! This is purely voluntary! I am going to keep on making videos regardless. I\u2019m going to keep on trying to make it as an actress no matter what. If you like my videos or you just want to help support an actress, a dollar or two once a month will really help!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNaturally there are rewards!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledge $1 or more per month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027re officially a patron and will receive one very thankful virtual hug.
