    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Michael Krieger, and after a 10 year stint working in finance on Wall Street, I quit my job in 2010 upon becoming disgusted by industry practices and the unconscionable public betrayal perpetrated by the U.S. government via its massive bailout of the few at the expense of the many. In short, the government sacrificed the long-term health of the U.S economy and the nation\u0027s overall social cohesion to save a corrupt and unethical industry, all for a little short-term stability.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI immediately knew the country would never be the same once the public recognized the extent of this swindle, and I began warning about it in my writings, which quickly started being published across various popular websites. This inspired me to launch my own site in 2012,\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://libertyblitzkrieg.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLiberty Blitzkrieg\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor a more detailed telling of my story, see the following video.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DcqMN-FXCIE?rel=0\u0026amp;controls=0\u0026amp;showinfo=0\u0026amp;start=52\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I Launching a Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I first started Liberty Blitzkrieg I didn\u2019t have a plan for monetization. While I believe people should be compensated for hard, useful work, I decided to focus all my time and energy into reading, writing and thinking instead of putting much attention on the \u201cbusiness side\u201d of running a blog, which just felt more like a nuisance and wasn\u0027t something I had any passion for. I still don\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat changed since the early days is that passively putting third party code like Google Adsense on a website doesn\u2019t really earn someone like me any money. While it was never a significant amount of cash in the first place, it wasn\u2019t a total zero. At this point it has become basically worthless, but that\u2019s ok. I\u2019m not going to complain about Google. Google doesn\u2019t owe me anything and neither do the corporations that use the network. It was never a smart way for writers, particularly anti-establishment type writers highly critical of our economic system based on cronyism and fraud, to earn money. It never really made any sense, but I went down that road anyway because it was easy and allowed me to focus on what I really cared about, my work. But things have changed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAdvertisers have begun to flex their muscles over the past year or so, with YouTube demonetizing videos with any sort of unconventional political bent. From the advertisers\u2019 perspective this makes perfect sense and there\u2019s no point in complaining about it. This has forced many content producers to shift to a more reader/viewer supported model, which I think is far more empowering and healthy in the long-term anyway, despite painful short-term hits to revenue. Indeed, we shouldn\u2019t trust any media that relies on large corporate advertisers to fund their \u201cjournalism,\u201d as the product will be more like public relations than any hard-hitting truth-telling to power. We\u2019ve already seen advertisers are willing to flex their muscles when it comes to content they don\u2019t like, and we can expect much more of that going forward.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve had one-time donation options available on Liberty Blitzkrieg for a while, and those will remain; however, with my shift in focus toward reader-supported work, I want to make as many contribution options available as possible. Some readers feel awkward about making a small one-time donation of only $5, but would gladly give $5 every month. Patreon is perfect for this and has been recommended to me on several occasions. I hope you\u0027ll consider becoming a patron!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Are My Goals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe first thing I\u0027d like to do is eliminate the Google Adsense network from my website. I pledge to do this once I get to $1,000 per month in patron support.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeyond that, I really want to focus on value added material which brings ideas, concepts and content to your attention that you\u0027re unlikely to see in corporate media, or even alternative media blogs, many of which seem increasingly focused on clickbait or themes that tend to divide members of the public against one another as opposed to bringing them together.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nKnowing I have a certain amount of patronage coming in every month will inspire me to focus on high-quality work, since I will be confident that people appreciate my efforts enough to support them. One of the most rewarding series of articles I put together earlier this year was on an esoteric topic called\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2017/02/10/why-increased-consciousness-is-the-only-path-forward/\"\u003eSpiral Dynamics\u003c/a\u003e, which really connected with many readers on a deep level. This sort of material is the antithesis of click-bait, and I hope to do more such work in the future if readers are willing to support it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeyond my typical caustic social commentary, I\u0027d really like to focus on concepts related to consciousness and what all of us can do in our own lives to make the world a better place. After all...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://libertyblitzkrieg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-29-at-11.44.41-AM.jpg\" style=\"width: 477px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your consideration and generosity,\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMichael Krieger\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
