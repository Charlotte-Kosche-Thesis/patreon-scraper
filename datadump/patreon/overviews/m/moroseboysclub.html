Conduits are seen as mentally ill and or unstable, and are often referred to as \"psychopaths\" and other extremely ableist terms. Ableism is the discrimination or prejudice against people who have disabilities. \"The Facility\" spreads lies about conduits and makes them out to be unstable people who need to be cured, and people will send their conduit children off to \"The Facility\" thinking that they\u0027re helping them, but, in reality, they\u0027re treated with such brutality that the majority of them die, and the ones who make it out are changed forever, and their powers are taken away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Holy shit!

The two boys face common problems in the punk scene, high school drama, abusive relationships, and deal with tough situations at home like transphobia, abuse, homophobia and racism, while also struggling with their own mental illnesses and other problems like eating disorders, dysphoria, and just, plain out hating your body, because that shit fucking sucks, especially when you feel alone.

Definitely some of that, too. I also wanted to talk about the sort of problems that go on in the punk scene as well, as a huge fan of music, this is something I definitely wanted to cover, as someone who\u0027s had a ton of experiences that were pretty unsavory in the scene, especially for women, queer individuals, and people of color.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, you\u0027ll get a bunch of art and cool gifts and stuff every month, and if you pledge enough, I\u0027ll even feature you in the comic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, do you think you\u0027d like to pledge and see how the story unfolds, stranger?\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\"Hmm...\"\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1f/1ff19fe44bc6f2f74c6ee7510d104fb3352fe648943791a1eb9ef7df6182993f.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey!
