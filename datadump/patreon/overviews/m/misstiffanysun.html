    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(38, 38, 38);\"\u003e7 years ago, I was living in Shenyang, China. It\u2019s a city that I\u2019ll never forget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was miserable, I was depressed. I couldn\u2019t speak a word of Chinese or understand its culture. The only reason why I stayed was because I wanted to support my ex.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe had been together for 7 years since high school. And I knew China was going to be a stressful life, but how it ended up was nothing I could\u2019ve imagined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did everything I could at the time to support my ex. Anything that could make his life easier and happier, I did it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would cook him 2-3 meals a day.\u003cbr\u003eI would massage his back if he felt stressed.\u003cbr\u003eAnd anything he asked of me, I did without question to the best of my abilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut somewhere down the road, he began to change.\u003cbr\u003eHe started becoming more impatient and demanding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe began telling me what I should change. He told me I was no longer allowed to hang out with any of my guy friends. He told me I didn\u2019t look good enough, that I had to put on better makeup and to find better-looking clothes. And more often than not, he\u2019d call me stupid. Which hurt, a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite all that, I hid how I felt and took everything in because I knew work must\u2019ve been stressful. I did what he asked. I wanted to prove to him that I could be better, that I would be someone he could be proud of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did everything I could to change, but he still wasn\u2019t satisfied.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then it happened. He suggested a 1 year dating plan where we\u2019d see other people anywhere for a few months up to a year. I remember him saying,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"margin-left: 2px;\"\u003e\u201cTiffany, I know we had been together since high school. We been each other\u2019s sweethearts. How would I know if you\u2018re the one and I\u2019m the one for you if we never explored and saw other people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow would we know?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(38, 38, 38);\"\u003eI didn\u2019t agree at first, but he was relentless. He kept insisting that we try the new dating plan over and over again, to the point where I felt like that was the only choice I had, because if I didn\u2019t agree\u2026 he would leave me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt didn\u2019t make sense to me. Why would you have to date other people when you know who you really love?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy heart sank. I was confused and hurt. I didn\u2019t understand why this had happened. Even though I didn\u2019t want to go with his request, I told him I\u2019d give it a try because I didn\u2019t want to lose the person I had been with for a third of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut as soon as I agreed, he completely changed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe started drinking more. He started going out late at nights, ignoring my messages. He wouldn\u2019t be home most of the week and messages asking him if he\u2019d be home for dinner went unanswered. I was home, alone, in a country whose language I didn\u2019t speak a word of, in a relationship I wasn\u2019t sure would last. I felt depressed. I felt like my entire world was falling apart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe moment when I thought things couldn\u2019t get any worse, he took it one step further. He showed me pictures of the girls he had been flirting with, asking me if I thought they were pretty. I didn\u2019t know how to react, but it was rude and disrespectful. He had disregarded the full 7 years of our relationship and it hurt me to my core knowing that this is the person I had once loved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWas this still the same person I knew? Why did this happen?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe\u2019d become a complete stranger within a few months of agreeing to his request. He was no longer the person I once knew.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis continued on for weeks until one day, he told me that he had booked a ticket for me to return back to the states\u2026 because I\u2019d be an inconvenience to the girls he wanted to bring home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy heart broke into a million pieces. My mind fogged up, I couldn\u2019t think. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I had a feeling this was eventually going to happen but it hurt me more than I could\u2019ve ever believed possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u2019t know what to do with my life. I had nobody to talk to. Family and friends didn\u2019t understand. They kept pitying me and telling me that I\u2019d find someone else eventually.\u003cbr\u003eBut that wasn\u2019t what I needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I needed was to find myself, to discover who I could be and what I was capable of.\u003cbr\u003eI had lived life giving my everything to someone who didn\u2019t appreciate me and in the end cast me away. I had never given myself a chance to discover what it was that I wanted and what my passions were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started writing because I needed a way to channel out my thoughts and feelings, to vent my frustrations. It was the hardest thing to do coming out from a failed relationship, and scary because I lacked confidence. I knew I wasn\u2019t good at writing, but I did it anyways. I told myself I had to at least try. \u003cstrong style=\"\"\u003eI knew that as long as I set my mind on it, I could do anything. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo day after day, I wrote \u2013 even when I was sick, even when I was tired, even when I was crying and wasn\u2019t in the mood. I kept writing anyways. All I had was time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, I started gaining traction on Medium. I started getting some side money.  Publishers began to ask me if I wanted to write for them, an honor I\u2019ll never forget and remain thankful for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting has helped me realize that I\u2019m a lot more capable than I had initially thought. It has helped me voice my thoughts, express my feelings and allowed me to discover a part of myself that I never knew existed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting has changed my life, but it wasn\u2019t enough. I decided to travel because it was something I had always wanted to do but never had a chance to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI packed my bags, booked a one way ticket to Southeast Asia and never looked back since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u2019t know what\u2019s next or what I\u2019m going to do, but I\u2019m going to keep rebuilding my life. I\u2019m going to discover who I am and figure out what it is that I want to do, while writing in Southeast Asia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my story.\u003cbr\u003eThis is the beginning of how I\u2019m rebuilding my life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e"
