The other half of the year I get to hang out with my amazing dog and make All The Glass Things. I love my job, and I especially love when I have some hare-brained idea that involves glass, kilns, torches, metal, polymer clay, or all of the above. To come with me on my glass art journey, (I promise you \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ecannot\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003ecatch fire through a computer screen!), sign up to become one of my patrons, and walk through the \"looking glass\" with me as I make magic happen in glass. (And hey, thank you.\u00a0 I wouldn\u0027t be making cool things if it weren\u0027t for my amazing patrons, customers, and support network.)\u003cbr\u003e"
