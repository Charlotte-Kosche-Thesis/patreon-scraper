As an independent rescue, 100% of your donations will go into vet care, vacinations, spay/neuter, and much more for our rescue kittens. As Mini Cat Town grows, we want to strive to take in as many at-risk neonatal kittens as possible. We realize that your support means everything to us, so we are asking for your help to make our dreams a reality! Our biggest dream is to, one day, purchase a piece of land and build our very own state-of-the-art rescue facility. We have always created a safe place in our home for all animals that pass through. Now, we\u0027re thinking big and want to create a place where we can accept more at-risk animals, with a big focus on the most at-risk animal population, our beloved neonatal kittens. The work is grueling, but in such a short span of time, we are able to make a life or death impact on their little lives. Please join us in making the world just a little bit better and brighter for animals in need.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe understand that not everyone can commit on a month to month basis, so some one time donations can be made through our PayPal:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/LilotheHusky\"\u003ehttps://www.paypal.me/LilotheHusky\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother awesome way to help our kittens is donating an item from our Amazon wishlist:\u00a0http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/2VQT4VQEYU6F2\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/ls/?ref=navm_em_mobile_menu_lists\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThank you so much for yourk support!\u003c/div\u003e"
