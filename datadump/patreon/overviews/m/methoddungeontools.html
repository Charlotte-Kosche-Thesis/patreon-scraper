    "summary": "Hey! My name is Nnogga and i love to create AddOns for World of Warcraft. I play competetively in the hardcore pve guild\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.method.gg/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMethod\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eand have recently started taking mythic+ more seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of the mythic+ community i have been alpha testing the Method Dungeon Tools since late february 2018 and have received great feedback from the testers. During this period the list of features that i want to implement into the AddOn grew extremely fast and now i am reaching out to you to help me further develop this project. As a student who is currently finishing his computer science degree i need to make sure that i can continue putting as much time into the development of this AddOn as i have in the past.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the page for the AddOn on the Method website\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.method.gg/dungeontools\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/w68W6Ts.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstall the AddOn with the Twitch Desktop App\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/method-dungeon-tools/download?client=y\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Lot092i.png\" style=\"width: 240px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind the lates alpha version of the AddOn on my GitHub page:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/nnogga/MethodDungeonTools\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Logo.png\" style=\"width: 238px; color: rgb(17, 85, 204); float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter blizzard hosted the first Mythic Dungeon Invitational the interest in high mythic+ skyrocketed and there was a sudden demand from new and experienced players for guides and tools to help them get better at it. Even though some resources attempted to guide players through the most common dungeon routes i was unsatisfied with the situation and felt the need to create what is now known as the Method Dungeon Tools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently one of the main aspects of being successful in mythic+ is to be time efficient with your pathing and making sure that you only defeat as many enemy forces as you need. The main purpose of my AddOn is to give the user the ability to perfectly plan out their dungeons down to the last npc.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started playing World of Warcraft in Vanilla beta and have loved the game ever since. I always like to improve the \"meta\" aspects of my gameplay for example user interface modifications to help with the way information is being displayed or spreadsheets to plan out my character and raid progression. One could say it was only a matter of time before i started building a tool like this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeatures completed:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaps for all legion dungeons\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNpc positions for all dungeons including extra teeming npcs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatrol paths for all patroling npcs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEnemy forces for every npc and dungeon\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePreset management including export/import via paste strings\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eFeatures planned:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaps for Battle for Azeroth Dungeons including npc positions\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePreset sharing ingame via chat links\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eParty syncing to allow users to work on a dungeon preset together in real time\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCompact view of the pulls to use during a dungeon run\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMap features such as notes, icons, paths, arrows to allow user to further improve their presets\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDrawing custom shapes on the map\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDamage calculator for dangerous enemy abilities\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSpeedruns and historical tracking\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eParty unit frames specifically made for mythic+ with cooldown tracking\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of these planned features are really ambitious and will take quite a bit of time to implement so i am asking for your assistance to make my ideas become a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
