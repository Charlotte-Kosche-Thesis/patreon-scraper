    "summary": "Hi!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was four years old when I discovered that stories weren\u0027t handed down from On High, but created by human beings. Once I found out that you could grow up to be a writer, that\u0027s all I wanted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, a writer or an astronaut. If NASA calls, I\u0027m open to negotiations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent the decades since then working on my writing. I published \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/2w8FHsy\"\u003erole-playing games\u003c/a\u003e in the early 1990s, veered into \u003ca href=\"https://www.michaelwlucas.com\"\u003etechnology books\u003c/a\u003e in the 2000s, and added \u003ca href=\"https://www.michaelwarrenlucas.com\"\u003escience fiction and thrillers\u003c/a\u003e in the 2010s. In 2014, I leaped head-first from a cozy career in the technology industry into writing for a living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to my fans, I\u0027m doing pretty decent. Life as a writer is wonderful. I set my own hours. I have no meetings, no conference calls. My co-workers have four feet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIncome as a writer? Not so much. Compared to most writers I\u0027m doing great, but compared to my days as a systems administrator or network engineer it\u0027s mediocre. The good news is, my expenses have plunged. When you work at home, nobody cares if all your shirts come from conference swag bags. Plus, I\u0027ve always believed that socks are a tool of the oppressor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI knew what I was signing up for when I changed careers, and have no complaints. I\u0027m amazed every day that I have enough fans and readers to pay the mortgage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill, a little financial stability would be nice. That\u0027s where my amazing patrons come in. You reassure me that no matter what happens with royalty checks and sales channels, my light bill gets paid. Which is a wonderful certainty to have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[Note on shipping rewards: depending on book release schedules, I reserve the right to delay books a couple weeks so that I can send multiple books in one mailing. I\u0027ll also bundle my occasional print short stories into other shipments, so I don\u0027t go broke.]\u003cbr\u003e"
