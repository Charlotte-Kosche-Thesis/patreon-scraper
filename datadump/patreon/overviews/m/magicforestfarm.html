    "summary": "We are Joan and Jason, partners and owners of Magic Forest Farm. We live and work on our land where we have created a wide range of sustainable land-based projects and host people who want to learn our way of life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe offer hands-on homesteading experiences and share farm-based arts and skills. We do not teach in a traditional format with structured courses in classrooms. Much of the sharing of knowledge comes through the cultural exchange that happens when so many people from different places in the world come together to experience our \u2018simple way of life\u2019. The continual evolution and synthesis of the whole makes this project fresh and exciting all the time. The different influences from each person who come to join us adds to the richness of the experience, with the basis being to work together cooperatively to produce what we need to live and create sustainable income from our land.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nProject experiences that we share include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrowing food: \u003c/strong\u003eplanting, growing, harvesting, preserving, experimenting with niche crops, rare fruits, and heirlooms such as lotus, pawpaw and persimmon.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCulinary:\u003c/strong\u003e improvising with what\u2019s in season and abundant, preserving for later, wild foraging. Sharing recipes and techniques from around the world. Sharing meals together is one of the highlights of being here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMohair fiber:\u003c/strong\u003e from goat to garment. Our beloved angora goats are funny and friendly. They eat our weeds and turn poison ivy and thorny bramble into lustrous curly locks. We shear our goats, clean, dye, card and spin the fleece into yarn. We knit, crochet and weave the yarn into products we sell here on the farm. Once you go through the entire process you can truly appreciate how much time and work it takes to make a piece of clothing that exploits no one. The connection to the garment you make and wear is one you cannot achieve through buying mass produced clothing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBirds:\u003c/strong\u003e our friendly chickens and ducks are free to roam the property clearing ticks, unwanted pests and fertilizing the soil. They give us fresh eggs and endless entertainment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDairy:\u003c/strong\u003e milking a cow and making Kiefer, yogurt, mozzarella and ricotta cheese, cream sauce, pudding, crepes, custard, etc etc. When our cow is milking, there\u2019s an enormous amount of milk to use or preserve. You begin to see how just much one cow could provide for a small community. We love our cow, Saucy. She\u2019s one of the family. To hand milk a cow, brings new meaning to dairy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMushroom production:\u003c/strong\u003e we grow seasonal varieties of oyster mushrooms in bags of straw. During winter months, we grow an indoor variety. Mushrooms are our \u2018meat\u2019 since we are vegetarians. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAgroforestry\u003c/strong\u003e (forest farming): maple syrup, shiitake mushroom logs, firewood and lumber.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePermaculture\u003c/strong\u003e design and techniques\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuilding:\u003c/strong\u003e using sustainable, local, natural and recycled/repurposed materials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEssentially we are working on \"practical arts\" such as growing and preparing our own food, processing our animal fiber into clothing, building/construction and wood working.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy offering this venue for coming together to learn these basic skills, our approach to sharing these experiences with folks who visit the farm leads to community building, cultural exchange and creative collaboration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have found that people come here not only for the practical hands-on learning experience but also seek the benefits of living this lifestyle; Health and wellness through working with the land. Farming requires one to wake up early and go to bed exhausted. Small scale farming inlcudes physical exertion, creates meditative states through repetitive farm tasks, offers silence/alone time, brings the satisfaction of being part of cooperative tasks, fosters helping care for one another, produces top quality food, and allows participants access to clean air/water/land. A stay at our farm offers a place to transition and ultimately re-establish a connection to nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat was once a common reality, small scale farming has become an esoteric and sadly, a fading way of life. In a time when farming has become a massive specialized industry swallowed up in big business regulations and heartless capitalist goals, as \u2018modern homesteaders\u2019 we represent a niche market and idealistic lifestyle that is lost to most in these times. For us, we are living how we need to in order to be healthy and happy. We are fortunate enough to own pure land and have the resources to eek out a life on our hillside acreage. After a decade of restoring decrepit buildings, reclaiming overgrown pasture, managing forest and sustainably raising animals, we have become something that people love to be a part of. Our volunteers come from all over the world, and our tourists come mostly from New York City or Boston. We are inspired by their enthusiasm and appreciation of what we have become used to; our day-to-day lifestyle of living in seasonal cycles with the land. We love to share our experience, and find that opening people up to this land-based reality is so rewarding in these times.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk, so now that you know what we do here, it\u2019s time to explain why we need funding from you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have outgrown our backyard-scale start-up projects and need to expand our infrastructure to accommodate more visitors and activities. \u003cbr\u003eListed below are many of our exciting ideas that we want to bring to fruition, and with a little help from you, could see the results much sooner than if we were going at it alone. \u003cbr\u003eWe will use your generous support to fund these projects: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll season housing - yurts\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFarm store\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreative camping cabins\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArt  studios/workshops - fiber, ceramics, wood working.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA stage for events/performances\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA\u00a0\u2018sugar shack\u2019 for maple syrup production, and upgraded equipment.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eKitchen/cafe for processing farm produced food to sell, catering onsite events and hosting visiting chefs to create farm-to-table seasonal unique culinary experiences\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLab and warehouse for increasing our mushroom production\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGreenhouses, Orchards and berry patches\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore animal shelters and fences\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShelters for equipment, tools and supplies\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u2018The great hall\u2019 - an indoor community and event space\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCamp pavilion - a meeting place for inclement weather\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVisitor bath house\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWells for more water\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRoads for more access, and the resources to create sustainable power\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA new computer so I don\u2019t have to do all the updates on my iPhone! \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe thank you for joining our farm project!
