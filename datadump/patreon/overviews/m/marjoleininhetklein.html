    "summary": "Hi there,\nI\u0027m so honored that you are visiting my Patreon page! My name is Marjolein,\nI\u0027ve been blogging about my adventures on the road to living tiny since early 2015. I realized\nmy dream of living a green lifestyle in a 20 m2 self-sufficient Tiny House in\nAlkmaar (The Netherlands) in May 2016. During this time I have become an ambassador\nfor the Tiny House movement in the Netherlands, being the first Tiny House\ndweller and blogger in the Netherlands. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI absolutely,\n100% believe in this type of housing and way of living and invest almost all my\ntime in making it possible for other people to own and live in a Tiny House as\nwell. Something that is not very easy to do in the Netherlands due to\ncomplicated legislation. I love to write and inspire people with my blogs about\ndaily life, off-grid technology, the Tiny House movement, cooking, books, and\nmy take on how humanity is dealing with our beautiful planet and with each\nother. I think we have a lot of room for improvement \ud83d\ude09\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince November\n2016 I took the plunge, decided to quit my day job and invest all my time in\npromoting the Tiny House lifestyle. Quite a leap of faith for me, but I also\nvery much believe in following your heart and this is the direction mine nudged\nme to. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBlogging is\none of my big passions. Since February 2015 I have been writing one blog per week\non average and through them I freely offer a treasure trove of information\nabout tiny living. I will continue to do so and keep my content publicly\navailable. Support from my patrons means a lot to me and I like to involve you in my creations by asking you for early input in my projects. Thank you so much for being my Patreon and supporting my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarjolein\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewww.marjoleininhetklein.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
