We had it all, or at least a LOT of it!\u00a0 Yet we just felt purposeless, blah, and empty.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What was I needing, what was I looking for? \u003cstrong\u003eWhat I was looking for was God\u003c/strong\u003e,\u003cstrong\u003e but where could He be found?\u003c/strong\u003e I never saw Him or felt His presence at the churches I attended!\u00a0 What was God doing in my life?! I\u0027ll tell you what He was doing, He was making me miserable. Just kidding!\u00a0 God was bringing me to the end of myself!\u00a0 He was getting me sick of myself and sick of the life I was living. I felt restless, I wanted something that would fill the void in my life. \u00a0I wanted God!\u00a0 I wanted to know about God, I wanted to know God\u0027s favorite food, \u003cstrong\u003eI wanted to know why God did certain things and didn\u0027t do other things!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 I wanted to know if what people said about God was true.\u00a0 I needed a Savior and I needed a friend! \u00a0I needed God!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What did you do, Matt?!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My wife and I quit our jobs, sold a lot of our possessions, packed a small truck and moved across country with our three small children! \u00a0Yes, everyone we knew said we were crazy/stupid! \u00a0\"Matt, you gave up your six figure income, you lost your house, you did what???\"\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What was across country that I would be willing to uproot my whole family and leave that which was familiar and predictable?\u00a0 A small Bible college in the middle of no where that believed that God\u0027s word \u003cstrong\u003ewas\u003c/strong\u003e God\u0027s word! \u00a0 We found God, but not in a classroom, but in a still small voice in the middle of nowhere!\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eGod spoke!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e Do Tracey and I now understand the mysteries of the universe? No, we understood that God was always there for us and that God had always loved us.\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eWe found what we had been searching for!\u00a0 We found God!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e We now had a meaningful relationship with our Lord! Something that had eluded us during the majority of our lives. It was not religion that I was looking for, it was a relationship with Jesus Christ, God.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Within the years at Bible college and seminary we felt God\u0027s call upon our lives to full time ministry!\u00a0 God had first called us unto Himself, and now he was calling us to serve! \u00a0\u00a0 But How?\u00a0 Here\u0027s how; we turned the whole thing over to God and said, use us anyway you want!\u00a0 We said like Isaiah, \"Here am I, send me,\" and He did!\u00a0 He took us up on the offer that He had placed within our hearts!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We served, worked, cleaned, cooked, taught, and I preached at too many churches to mention!\u00a0 What a headache!\u00a0 \"Hey, Matt that doesn\u0027t sound very spiritual!\"\u00a0 You\u0027re right!\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eI was so burned out and sick of people who claimed to know the God I served!\u00a0 Not judging, just had my fill of hypocrites, liars, thieves and the deceptive.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eYet, not everyone was like that, there was still a remnant of those who loved God and served God on His terms!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 So what was the problem,\u00a0 Matt had the problem? \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The problem was that we were not resting in Christ as we were working for Him!\u00a0 I can\u0027t give what I don\u0027t have!\u00a0 I was spent!!!!\u00a0 \"Crash and burn, baby!\" That was me!! \u00a0 I loved God\u0027s people, I just could not deal with them 24/7.\u00a0 I loved to preach God\u0027s Word and Tracey loved to teach His Word, but it was the other 95% of ministry within the church that almost killed us!\u00a0 We cried out to God, \"Please, Lord, Please help us.\"\u00a0 He did!\u00a0 We ending up moving back to the same town that we had left 12 years earlier to the day! (God\u0027s Sovereignty) God sent us back to where we began. It was in the desert where no one was around, and now instead of preaching in a church to people, I just preached to trees and rocks and lizards and cactuses. I thought, \"His word won\u0027t return void!\" I loved it!\u00a0 What I despised before, I now loved and embraced.\u00a0 Man, could I preach to the lizards and turtles! Honestly!\u00a0 No one was around, but God!\u00a0 It was so therapeutic, healing and no one was complaining! Victory!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 One day my son said, \"Hey, Dad, why don\u0027t you film yourself preaching in the middle of nowhere to lizards and turtles, and put it on YouTube!\"\u00a0 Out of the mouth of babes!\u00a0 Thus the ManCave idea evolved!\u00a0 Preach the truth of God\u0027s Word to whoever will hear it. You don\u0027t like it, turn it off!!\u00a0 Dress like I want, take orders only from God, I loved the idea!\u00a0 Welcome to the \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/AVFYJFXWvPg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eManCave\u003c/a\u003e!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Goal now is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ full time on YouTube; no matter where people are in their lives!\u00a0 Some hate church, some are mad at God, some are in the middle of a messy divorce, some are in the middle of a storm of their making, some are hurting because of the loss of a loved one, some have lost everything!\u00a0 Wherever a person is in their journey with God, that is where we meet them!\u00a0 All are welcome in the ManCave, a place where no one can judge you. Yet, no matter where you are in life, you are encouraged to get up off the ground and move in the direction of God. The ManCave is there to build, strengthen, teach, rebuke and inspire; not to pity.\u00a0 The ManCave is a healing balm to those who have been hurt by others, those who were supposed to care the most and hurt us the deepest.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e However, don\u0027t be fooled, the ManCave is Raw and not there to impress anyone.\u003c/strong\u003e It is what it is and I am what I am by the Grace of God.\u00a0 The Mancave is there for those who truly want to hear the Word of God without all the extras that are not of God! \u00a0 All are welcome, but few will stay! \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMatt, where are you going and what is your goal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for asking! It is our Goal to eventually get to the place where we have enough \nfinancial support to do ministry through the Man Cave full time! Although YouTube pays a little, it is not even close to sustaining us on an ongoing basis. I have so many ideas in regards to the ManCave that the Lord has given me that are just not feasible right now with our current obligations. That will change because where God guides, God supplies!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you charging for the ManCave!? Absolutely Not!!! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so against pastors, teachers, and evangelists who charge for God\u0027s Word! Personally it makes me sick.\u00a0 What if the Holy Spirit charged us?!\u00a0 Everything on the ManCave is free, just like salvation. This Patreon page is here for those who have asked for a way to support the ManCave and feel led by God to give.\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eWe do ask that you would pray for our small ministry, regardless of any financial support. \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Thank you so much for all your prayers!\u00a0 We appreciate it more than you can imagine and it really helps!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
