    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eUPDATED: SEE BELOW / LONG TEXT\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi you might know me as Mailamea/Mailamea10 or Mhia/Mia, What brought me here in Patreon is mostly regarding the modding community, when I discovered this I wasn\u0027t so sure how it works until I tried it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUhmmm so yeah, I\u0027m mostly in Loverslab, then nexus, then occasional VGU. I make mods mostly playable characters, like those followers and companions I modify them to have a playable version. But I\u0027ve got my hands into collab mods and stuff. Back then I made mods as well that has gameplay changes like destructible environments, animations, companions, concept mods, as well some other stuff, most of which are seen at my youtube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this patreon is mainly for request and my focus to finish said request. It isn\u0027t really necessary to make a payment for the mod, since eventually it will release, What this will help with is to focus on which to prioritize and release at a very early timeframe like 3-5 days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who will be pledging, Thank you very much, not only it will help from daily budget/cost of living, it would keep me motivated to do modding work. I will truely and deeply appreciate all the help and communication I can get.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlayable Characters of Skyrim : \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs an upcoming content that will be available for the public. Basically every month we will get 2-5 characters that you will be able to play as. Either in terms of playing a follower or a custom new character entirely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the difference of this vs Racemenu Preset and ECE Preset?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe aim and main goal of this content is to make everyone play as the character they want without having to download around 100-900mb of file requirements to load the preset you like make it Racemenu or ECE.\u003cbr\u003eAnother is this characters will be uniquely their own, they won\u0027t share any meshes any textures, they are their own separate folder, you wouldn\u0027t need to ever worry about conflicts or compatibility ever again, you can easily customize textures meshes swap them out entirely without affecting your mods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the patreon for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this has been an ongoing question and issue lately, just recently returned back my reddit posts to be unbanned after discussing and getting into the terms, as well as recently getting this thread open again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PLEDGE\" \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll content will be available to the public, \"ALL\" the purpose for pledging, is firstly for supporting me, if you like to help out, I\u0027m currently living on my own and spending around 12 hours from work, bills stuff like that, thats why content recently has been halted, unreleased mods from previous games as well as destructible stuffs. By giving support I will be able to lessen my overtime work and can basically live in the house and produce more content. \u003cu\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2ND\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/u\u003e to help out with beta/alpha testing, It isn\u0027t like early access but the main point as well for those who are currently pledged is because I\u0027m constantly asking them for feedback, bug reports, issues. For example racialcompatibilities with vampire, where your character becomes a vampire, without the bug report, I wouldn\u0027t have known that theres a big issue with it. Which is fixed for future releases now. 3rd to give feedback on which to do next which to focus on, and basically to get to know me talk, chat, communicate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what about permissions?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis one is already fixed, this is where I spent my whole week, right after the thread was hidden by moderators. If you are a modder of the follower that you don\u0027t want your follower to be a playable character, feel free to inform me. Your content will not be turned to player series.\u003cbr\u003eThis is the best part : I spent my week gaining permission from the most popular and the most recent follower releases. You guessed it, I\u0027ve got them. I have a whole inbox of approval pm on my nexus, twitter, reddit, tesgeneral, LL account.\u003cbr\u003eUpcoming follower content and all previously released ones except one companion, have all permissions already been given. A short example are HHaleyy\u0027s new follower/Quest, and Overknee\u0027s entire follower series and all upcoming ones, Tania, Maya, Natalie, and a whole shit ton more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
