Every thought, idea and thing, all beings living and dead, the sum of all the universe is calling out for your attention. A sisyphean task just to stay the course and finish your day.

Brian Lemmerman and Cory Hardaker are mindfulness teachers who put mindfulness and meditation in the context of our impending doom so we can focus on the important things in life. They offer practical tips, geeky banter, and deep anecdotes to help listeners find their inner peace and live joyfully, despite the apparent meaninglessness of everything that has ever existed. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e Why Doom?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Why Doom?\u201d is one of our most frequently asked questions. \u201cYou guys are pretty cheerful.\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDon\u2019t sweat it, Mindfulness of Doom is not as dark as it sounds. Sure, we joke about the end of the world in every episode, but reminding ourselves about our limited lifespans motivates us to be the best \u201cus\u201d we can be right now, and we use this podcast as a platform to discuss the various ways we use the tools of mindfulness and meditation to develop ourselves and live the most fulfilled lives while we\u2019re alive!

With that in mind, we have an opportunity to be present to all of life - that which we want to experience, and that which we don\u2019t find so pleasing. We give thanks for our time on earth to feel everything because\u2026 well, the dead don\u2019t feel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you find the lessons in this mindfulness podcast to be valuable in your life, please consider supporting us with an ongoing monetary contribution right here on our Patreon Page.
