    "summary": "Several months ago, I started making youtube videos. Just about random subjects, no big deal. Then January hit. Making a Murderer premiered on Netflix, and the world sat in horrified silence as they watched injustice in it\u0027s purist form. When I watched it, however, I saw things that I knew the general public didn\u0027t grasp, because they didn\u0027t know. I have an extensive criminal justice background as well as knowledge of law enforcement procedures and protocols, and I was able to put the pieces together on how bad this really was. That is when my videos changed. I started to tear the case file apart, breaking down the legal language and showing the viewers what should have happened, why and how. As a result, I have been asked to review more cases, which I am only too happy to do. However, supplies are expensive. Ink cartridges, paper and highlighters are only the start. File folders, boxes and other assorted supplies and equipment are needed to keep things straight. All I ask is assistance in helping me to cover the cost of supplies. Anything over that will be donated to defense funds and educational charities or scholarship funds for Criminal Justice students. I am not looking to profit from my work, only help in making it happen.\u00a0"
