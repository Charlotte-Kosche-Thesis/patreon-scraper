She earned a spot within the independent music scene in March\u003cbr\u003e2012, when she showcased her original music during Canadian Music Week, at the Royal YorkLibrary Bar. She was invited back to perform two showcases at CMW 2013. She launched herfirst full-length album UNBREAKABLE in April 2013. Melanie followed that up with a triumphant\u003cbr\u003eNXNE showcase and a successful Southern Ontario tour.Melanie initially moved to Toronto to pursue a career in acting. Between acting jobs she often picked up the Gibson guitar her father had given her as a parting gift. She then began the secondleg of her artistic journey: songwriting and performing her songs live. Melanie followed her release of \"UNBREAKABLE\", with a 6 song cover EP titled READ IT ON\u003cbr\u003eTHE RADIO, which was part of a six week digital download campaign in which Melanie releasedone new cover song every week.\u003cbr\u003eWith assistance from FACTOR, Melanie Peterson, once again teamed up with producer and band mate Mitch Girio to produce and release her sophomore album \"ANYWHERE FROM HERE\" in March of 2016.\u003cbr\u003eThe album feedback has been positive and Melanie toured through Ontario and Quebec this past summer. She also played shows in Edmonton and Vancouver in the fall thanks to the Via Rail\u003cbr\u003eArtist On Board Program which allowed her to \u201cplay her way across the country\u201d. Melanie recently received her second FACTOR artist development grant which she used to record an original holiday single, which was released to radio stations across Canada. The single, titled\u003cbr\u003eSanta\u0027s Sleigh, was produced by award winning producer Chris Birkett (Sinead O\u0027Connor and Buffy St. Marie).\u003cbr\u003eContact Melanie Peterson: melanieacts@hotmail.com\u003cbr\u003e",
