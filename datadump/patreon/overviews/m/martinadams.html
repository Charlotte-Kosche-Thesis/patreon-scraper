    "summary": "To most of us, the economy is a mystery. We don\u2019t understand how it works. We don\u2019t understand:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhy so many people work hard and long hours and yet still can\u2019t get ahead,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ewhy poverty doesn\u2019t seem to disappear, even as cities and communities are becoming more and more prosperous,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eand, most importantly, that it is possible for every single human being to make a decent living doing what they love, serving other people.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSome of you might already be familiar with my book \u003cem\u003eLand: A New Paradigm for a Thriving World\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(see unitism.com). Its message both inherently simple and radical: it spells out in doable terms how humankind might be able to create a world that works better for all. The time has now come for me to share the economic principles upon which this book is based via the medium of film.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe film involves\u00a0a blending of visual landscapes on how the economy in modern society creates poverty for some, even as it also creates prosperity for others. It reveals the hidden dynamics of what creates wealth inequality, and looks at how our current form of capitalism is destroying nature by incentivizing the conversion of nature into property. It features\u00a0interviews with several economists and and delves into the history of how classical economics via the lineage of Henry George was warped into today\u2019s neoclassical perspective. It includes educational elements that explain what causes land to have a financial value, how banks make money from land via mortgages, how landownership impacts wages, how an 18-year real-estate cycle causes economic booms \u0026amp; busts, and how our current system of landownership encourages urban sprawl as well as the destruction of nature. And finally, the film proposes new models of what might make human communities truly sustainable in their relationships with each other and the Earth, with a\u00a0focus on the natural interconnectedness of all life and how that interconnectedness might be reflected in practice;\u00a0solutions such as land-value taxes, land leases, as well as community land trusts will be examined, with a shared emphasis on why the value of land has to be collected for the common good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe total amount needed would be about $30,000.\u00a0The equipment will cost approximately $3,500, while travel expenses are likely to be $10,000 or more, plus a reserve fund for unforeseen expenses. Filming locations will be California, Colorado, potentially\u00a0Alaska (oil dividend) or Norway (Norwegian Pension Fund Global), Hong Kong (land leases), Taiwan (land-value taxes), Australia. I won\u2019t be drawing a salary from contributions\u2014all of the money would go into production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy making a pledge, you are giving me the unprecedented opportunity to share the same economic principles espoused in \u003cem\u003eLand\u003c/em\u003e via the medium of film so that its message of happiness and justice for all can reach more people whose lives could be changed for the better\u2014it could be yours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a deep gratitude for all that is to come,\u003cbr\u003eMartin\u003cbr\u003e"

As a child, it pained him to see most people struggling while a few were living in opulence. This inspired in him a lifelong quest to create a fair and sustainable world in collaboration with others. As a young adult, groomed for a career in finance, he opted not to pursue a career on Wall Street and chose instead to dedicate his life to community enrichment. Through his non-profit work, he saw firsthand the extent to which our economic system causes human and ecological strife. Consequently, Martin devoted himself to the development of a new economic paradigm that might allow humanity to thrive in harmony with nature. His book \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.unitism.com/\"\u003eLand: A New Paradigm for a Thriving World\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e is the fruit of his years of research into a part of this economic model; its message stands to educate policymakers and changemakers worldwide. Martin is executive director of \u003ca href=\"http://www.progress.org/\"\u003eProgress.org\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
