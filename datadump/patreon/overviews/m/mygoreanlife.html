    "summary": "Tal and thank you for visiting our page on Patreon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a german couple, inspired by the \u003cstrong\u003egorean lifestyle\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and living accordingly since 2005. We have been living in the Caribbean several years, which was great for our way of life. Currently we are living in our home country, however, we are planning to live in an RV and travel around in Europe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst, what is gorean?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe gorean novels from John Norman are talking about another world called GOR, where men and women live in a\u00a0very different way from most people of Earth. Men rule that world and women respect men as superior.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut wait, is that not science fiction?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, the novels are science fiction, however, for some people it is \u003cstrong\u003emore than just fantasy\u003c/strong\u003e. Very typical in the gorean lifestyle, but not exclusively, is a relationship between a Master and his kajira (what we actually are). A kajira is a girl, who loves to serve her Master. She serves with joy and passion and inner peace and of course willingly. Beside that, it is also about acting and interacting in general, with honor and responsibility. \u003cstrong\u003eBehind the gorean lifestyle stands a whole philosophy\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe see it as one way to \u003cstrong\u003efind ones inner and true self\u003c/strong\u003e. We are not only living the lifestyle by ourselves, but we are also meeting other like-minded people. We even have a vision of a real gorean village, where \u003cstrong\u003egorean inspired people are living together\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are traveling around to meet other people and to organize gorean events. Also we are running an online community including an online academy. Beside that online academy, we are also organizing practical training in real life training events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGorean Life is our vision and it is our LIFE\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat brought you to Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of our fans told us about Patreon and that people like him would love to support us in our special way of life. Well, here we are! Thanks to our first Patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs our patron, we take you with us in our world. We are uploading podcasts and videos about our journeys, about everyday life, about kajira training and everything relating to our (future) RV and van life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoin us and see a Master with his kajira on the way to their vision.\u003c/strong\u003e"
