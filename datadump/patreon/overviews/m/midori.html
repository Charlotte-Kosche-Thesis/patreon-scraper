I run an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://catwithbenefits.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eunpopular blog with dumb posts\u003c/a\u003e but some people seem to like it all the same. I also occasionally translate Japanese pictures and comics and make them not Japanese but instead English. Sometimes the comics are even a bit lewd. No let\u0027s be honest, most of the time they are a bit lewd. Many of the lewd ones you can\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://acatwithbenefits.imgur.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eread here\u003c/a\u003e. And then most of the not lewd ones\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://e621.net/post?tags=user%3AMidoriTranslates\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eare here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess I will be blunt. Finding work as a professional translator or anything pertaining to my skills and experience is hard. Actually finding ANY work is hard right now. The purpose for this Patreon is to support my blogging and translations which I do put a surprising amount of time and effort into. For the time being I view this purely as a gesture of kudos. You are saying you enjoy the content I provide and want to support it. I cannot put up a pay wall for the work I do nor do I have any interest in doing so. However much you want to contribute is up to you, as is how long you want to contribute. I honestly appreciate anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot promise any goals or rewards for the time being. Down the road I am thinking of implementing a system of letting patrons vote on which works I choose to translate (outside of commissioned work). Since I know my translation prices are a bit steep for the typical person, this will allow you some sway in getting something you like translated. I would also be happy to hear from my supporters things they would want me to consider doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me you bring value to my work, and you help take the financial strain off of my routine costs such as my phone bill and prescriptions. With enough support I may be able to become more independent. Nevertheless, I don\u0027t expect to accrue anything close to a living wage with this. This is simply your thanks for what I do, and once again, I absolutely appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your consideration!"
