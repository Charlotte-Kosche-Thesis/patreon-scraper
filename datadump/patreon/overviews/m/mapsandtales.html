I\u0027m going to make this stuff whether or not you click the button to sign up, but if you \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e make that choice, rest assured you\u0027re one of the greatest people on the face of the earth, supporting the ramblings and doodles of a\u2026what? What am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen it comes down to it, I\u2019m a storyteller.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eAt least, I \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to be a storyteller. The problem? Way too often, the stories that want to be told never leave my head. I daydream and I scheme. I write and rewrite in my mind and \u003cem\u003eoccasionally\u003c/em\u003e jot something down, but mostly I keep them all to myself. A lot of these stories and fragments of stories take the form of maps, scenarios, or other RPG-related ephemera, because these are the things (in part) from which my inner storyteller were formed. They boil in my skull-cauldron, festering and metastasizing. In a very real way (to me), they haunt my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mapsandtales.com/\"\u003eMaps \u0026amp; Tales\u003c/a\u003e is my attempt to exorcise the ghosts and manifest them, to bring something new into the world rather than just consume. Please join me as I explore the nooks and crannies of my haunted mind-palace and see what I can dust off and bring back to life. A contribution from you, no matter how small, will encourage and support me as I embark on this adventure and document what I find.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat to expect from Maps \u0026amp; Tales\u003c/h3\u003eEach week, I\u0027m going to try and share 3 to 5 posts of either original content or my take on something else that has caught my eye. Most of the time that will take the form of a small map or doodle, an adventure hook that popped into my head, or a story idea. I also hope to share longer, more polished short stories, as well as complete RPG encounters or other supporting materials. Long term, who knows? I\u0027ll likely continue doing this as long as I have ideas. Your contributions and feedback will help decide where I go from here, and how often I\u0027m able to make updates."
