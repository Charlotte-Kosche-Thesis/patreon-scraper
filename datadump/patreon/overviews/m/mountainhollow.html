     "about": "I am a Medicine Bag Maker, Plant Worshiper, avid gardener and homesteader, Intuitive Earth Worker, Teacher, Graphic Designer, Reiki Master/Teacher, Medicine Person and Spirit Weaver. I am ever evolving. I have been working in the spiritual shamanic world since I was eight years old, under the guidance of my fairy godmother \u003ca href=\"https://mountainhollowmedicinals.com/s/AnneeFlyerFinalpg1.pdf\"\u003eAnnee White Eagle\u003c/a\u003e and I am grateful to have had so many incredible teachers along the path. I have seen through the veil since I was three years old beginning with my first memory of my Great Grandfather visiting me after he had passed on to the spirit world. I am clairvoyant, clairsentient and clairaudient. My intuition is wide and I can listen into the ethers. This has been at times a burden, but is truly a gift. I have learned over the years that the construct of separation is only and illusion. We are all a part of everything that exists around us.\u003cbr\u003eAt a very young age I began learning Native American traditions and have continued honoring this all my life. I researched immensely into Native American history, indigenous cultures, oppression, and the history of women in the world while earning my masters degree at Vermont College of Fine Arts. During this time I found that my deepening draw to Native American culture had a real and visceral connection to my heart and soul. After receiving permission from a member of the Yaqui tribe to make the medicine bags I began making them for others and this process has changed my life. I continue to commit to living in the practice of compassion in all that I do in my life. Spreading the light of Reiki for the highest healing good, forgiveness, and love as far as I can. Compassion is my compass.\u003cbr\u003e",
