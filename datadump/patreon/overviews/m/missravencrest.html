My journey into cosplay started back when two of my cousins and I decided we wanted to dress up as an anime character for Halloween! We had no idea what cosplay was and I personally didn\u0027t think that would start this crazy journey to where I am today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy first convention was a tiny little thing at a Scottish Rights Center, maybe the size of 4 houses put together. I closet cosplayed Misa Amane and was amazed that people recognized. There were fantastic cosplay all around me and I had no idea what was going on, but I was HOOKED!\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I have been evolving from buying cosplay into making full blown cosplay with props and lights. In such a short time I learned so much, thanks to all the amazing friends and cosplayers I know and love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout the years I have gone from just going to a local convention in ebay bought cosplay to attending Blizzcon and competing on stage with 99 other cosplayers who are all stunning and talented. I went from knowing a handful of people to having a family of too many to count, each person cosplayer and not. The support I get from my friends and family has helped me to venture outside my little bubble of shyness and out into this stage of cosplay.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUsing patreon, with your support, I will be able to add an extra fluff to my cosplay funds.
