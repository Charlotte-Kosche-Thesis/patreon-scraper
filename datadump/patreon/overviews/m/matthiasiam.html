    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eMy Patreon is shutting down, I know, this is really, really strange, especially RIGHT after we launched it. Before I go ANY further, everyone will 100% get the reward they backed for, without doubt (If you want a refund, please request it, Patreon doesn\u0027t let me force refunds on my end). After reading the comments on the video that I released on Friday, my doubts about my use of the platform and how we launched it were confirmed. Before starting up this Patreon I had some serious doubts about it, I was worried I wouldn\u0027t be able to communicate why we were on the platform, and I was worried it wouldn\u0027t make sense to you.\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you long time viewers know, I had a Patreon in the past, a ways back, and I closed it. I don\u0027t like the idea of \u0027donations\u0027, I believe in working for my money. This is NOT to say you shouldn\u0027t ask for help when times are hard, but for us right now, despite even YouTube throwing every problem they can at us to make it difficult, times are still ok. Back when I had a Patreon about 3 years ago times were actually hard, it was just Amanda and I, and we almost didn\u0027t make rent because I lost my job. Patreon made sense then, and I will forever be grateful for the platform and for the amazing people that helped us in our time of need. Once the YouTube channel supported us fully, I closed the old Patreon account because I didn\u0027t feel right about people \u0027donating\u0027 for something they could get for free, or donating to people (us) who were possibly making more than the the person who was even donating.\u003cbr\u003eSo if you don\u0027t need Patreon and your business is doing ok, why are you on it again? Simply diversification. I wanted to make sure **if** the YouTube ad system crumbled, my amazing and hard working team wouldn\u0027t be left in the dust, and their families would be safe. I thought I communicated that, but I failed, and the criticism I received in the comments was completely justified because of this failure. I hope I can regain your trust, my motivation was not \u0027greed\u0027, in fact quite the opposite, one of my particular passions is to distribute the wealth I receive to create real jobs for other passionate people. Hi5 Studios grew fast, maybe too fast (I\u0027m not a business genius, this stuff is harder than it looks), but we are stable, and doing well. Profit isn\u0027t the only metric we use to determine our success. \u003cbr\u003eI believe what we do at Hi5 Studios provides value, making videos to bring families together and make people laugh. I stand behind that mission more than you can possibly know. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s the craziest thing in the world to support content you enjoy, but when it\u0027s available for free to the world, it heavily undermines the value. \u0027Donations\u0027 are a confusing and awkward thing, and to be perfectly honest, I\u0027ve never wanted to get them or ask for them, I want to provide goods or services that are worthy of your hard earned money. I was hoping that\u0027s how I could leverage Patreon, more like a service than a \u0027call for help\u0027, but that is not what came across to you guys and I apologize. I totally see how scummy it must look to be asking for these donations but objectively be living an awesome life of unboxing crazy things and shooting NERF guns. \u003cbr\u003eI look up to RoosterTeeth and their \u0027RoosterTeeth First\u0027 platform for being able to successfully diversify from YouTube. The truth is what I said in the video, YouTube is incredibly volatile, until we make our own platform like those guys, we really have no control (Just look at the volitility of my views on socialblade). About 4 months back I began to invest in creating a platform for Hi5 Studios, something that would allow us to give you guys real value that you want, while allowing *us* to control our fate, not YouTube\u0027s algorithm. That is still a ways away, and I would LOVE any and all the thoughts you have on that, I want to get it right so it works for ALL of us. That\u0027s what I was hoping Patreon would be in the meantime, but I got that wrong. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m probably blowing this up way out of proportion, but I want you all to know my heart is in this for my family, my team, and you guys. Hi5 Studios will only be successful in my eyes if it works for each of those three things. I really appreciate all of you and how much you support what we do, sorry I got this wrong, but I hope you can trust me in the future to get it right.\u003cbr\u003e- Matthias\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
