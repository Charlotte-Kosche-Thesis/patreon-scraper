Why only 1 dollar? Because these\ngames are really short and I believe in giving people more than their\nmoney\u0027s worth. I want you to feel like you are getting far more than\nyou are giving. That\u0027s why each time we reach a milestone here on\nPatreon EVERYONE\u0027S rewards increase. For every funding milestone we\npass you\u0027ll get more and more for your $1 donation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to give\nmore than $1, I\u0027m incredibly grateful, and I do have some fun extras\nto thank you for your generosity. Your donations help me to afford\nthis expensive hobby and continually improve my  artwork and games.\nIf you can\u0027t afford to donate, but still want to help, faving my\nworks on Deviantart helps me to reach a larger audience and is always\nappreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all of\nyour support, in whatever form it takes, it truly means the world to\nme.
