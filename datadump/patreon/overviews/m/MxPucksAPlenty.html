    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eIntroduction:\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u003c/h2\u003e\nI am Mx. Pucks A\u0027Plenty and I\u0027ve been involved in the Seattle Sex Positive Community for over five years now. I am an educator and host workshops on various sex positive/kink/polyam topics as well as hold discussion groups for parents in alternative lifestyles and those new to BDSM and kink.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPart of my journey in the world of Sex Positive Culture led me to burlesque. I am performer in the Seattle area. Mx. Pucks A\u0027Plenty also known as, Pucks, is a creation of all of my political fire, my sex positivity and body love! I am queer femme of color and a vocal member of the kink scene. I know that my politics, my body, and my sex are always potent and radical. Through dance, spoken word and written word I am creating art that is representative of the world I am a part of. A world that is full of intersectionality, queerness, sex positivity and body positivity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThings I Create:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBurlesque:\u003cbr\u003e\nI perform in 5 to 7 shows a month. The cost to obtain and create new costumes as well as the cost on upkeep on my existing costumes starts to add up. My burlesque performances are typically political in nature exploring discrimination, racism and prejudice. My performers also play with gender, highlight nonconformity\u00a0and bring intersectionality of POC (People of Color) \u0026amp; BDSM/Leather culture into the mix. I am also a part of a troupe and production team Booty Magic Burlesque. We are branded as a queerlesque group and produce shows quarterly. We are \"tearing down the patrichary one pastie at a time\".\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWorkshops \u0026amp; Education:\u003cbr\u003e\nI attend 3-4 conferences a year centered around kink/BDSM/Leather/Sex Positive Culture. Some of these conferences I speak at and would like to expand into doing this more. Most of the events I attend are in the Pacific Northwest, but I\u0027d like to have the ability to attend\u00a0Cleveland Leather Annual Weekend (CLAW), Blackout (hosted by ONYX), International Ms Leather, and Dark Odyssey. Covering the expenses for copies for my workshops and at some point investing in a small projector for my Powerpoint presentations would be ideal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvents \u0026amp; Organizations:\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently in the beginning stages of starting a burlesque troupe as well as a quarterly cabaret show. The cabaret would be a non profit organization with the mission of sponsoring different sex positive and burlesque events, helping people pay for attending burlesque education conferences, \u0026amp; helping people pay for attending kink/BDSM/Leather/Sex Positive Culture conferences. Covering expenses for a part time accountant for the non profit would be very beneficial at some point.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nArt:\u003cbr\u003e\nMy art is burlesque as well as my writing. Currently working on an anthology of short stories and poetry involving my experiences as a newcomer into the world of\u00a0kink/BDSM/Leather/Sex Positive Culture. Also working an e-book erotica series focused on D/s dynamics that are not normally represented in erotica.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am looking forward to you joining my exclusive community. You get to be a part of helping me create\u00a0visual art that is strong, powerful, political and sexual! It is going to be a fun ride, so enjoy the access to the process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
