My name is Micha\u0142 Dawidowicz, but you probably know me better as \u003cstrong\u003eMoczan\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ve been creating free video games since 2012, most of them being playable right in your browser. It\u0027s always been a hobby of mine, but now I want to take it a step further and make games full-time! In 2017, I\u0027ve managed to release \u003cstrong\u003e6 new games\u003c/strong\u003e that\u0027s been played \u003cstrong\u003eover 1 million times\u003c/strong\u003e and it\u0027s been my best year so far.\u003cstrong\u003e Let\u0027s make 2018 even better!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently most known by my work in idle/incremental genre with games like \u003cstrong\u003eUltimate Five-Leaf Clover \u003c/strong\u003eand\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ePixels Filling Squares 3.0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ebut there are other genres I would like to explore in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy goal is to provide a \u003cstrong\u003ehigh-quality video games\u003c/strong\u003e that can be played \u003cstrong\u003efor free\u003c/strong\u003e by as many people and on as many devices as possible. Unfortunately, advertisement revenue is too small to support small game studio on it\u0027s own. With direct support from my Patrons, I can focus on making games \u003cstrong\u003efun and entertaining to play\u003c/strong\u003e, without compromising my work with in-game payments or putting them behind a paywall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money from Patreon will go towards improving my games: hiring additional people to create better graphics, sounds, music or additional content for the game; buying hardware that will enable me to test and publish games on more platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst of all, a big \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e if you decide to join my community!
