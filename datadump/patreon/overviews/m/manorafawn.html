I already have a body of work to showcase what I can do and have several wearable art collars ready to sell and will design and create a piece just for you on a commission basis. The sizes of my beaded art projects varies from pin/pendant/hair piece to large pictures. I am the High Priestess of a local coven and also paint sacred statues, make painted symbols to hang on the walls of our temple, find plaques and statues at the local second-hand stores and renew them by painting them to bring out their beauty. I want to devote more of my time to my art so I can leave a legacy of beauty. I am always working on something, and will post my projects as I create them (both the smaller and the larger ones). You can follow the progress of my more complex pieces and see how I go from sketch to pattern to finished project."

     "about": "I discovered my art form accidentally when I read an article in Bead and Button magazine about making wearable beaded collars. I started off making my first collar for my mother. My mother is a Celtic harpist so I called her on the phone and tried to find out what she wore for performances, what colors she liked and so on (thinking I would make a Celtic knot design). She wouldn\u0027t give me the answers I was looking for, so finally I had to tell her what I was doing! She suggested that I make a Celtic swan knot, as the swan was the harper\u0027s symbol. I then spent months looking at books, buying celtic knot design CDs, desperately trying to find a swan knot (I can tell you they do not exist!) and finally found a bird knot (definitely not swans) and modified it to be swans by changing the neck and head of the bird. I love celtic knotwork designs! They are intricate and complex, and doing them in beads take some practice, but I was pleased with my first collar. I used Lacy\u0027s Stiff Stuff for the beading surface and the backing is ultrasuede. I was exhilarated. I have a good sense of design, space and color, and an excellent imagination, but had never found an art form that satisfied me because my imagination has always been much better than my ability to produce the results I was after, but this exceeded all of my expectations! It is something I can touch, I can watch it grow before my eyes, I can see how every small decision I make on how I lay the beads affects the entire piece, the types of beads I use, the colors, how I lay the beads on the fabric to create different results. It is exciting to me to see it take shape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then I have done a hummingbird collar (with a fuscia in the center), two winged pegasus flying in the night sky collar, a humpback whale with lighted water on counted cross stitch picture, a western dragon collar (for which I took 4th place as a piece of art in the Oregon State Fair), a celtic tree knot collar (was a wedding gift to my daughter-in-law), a tiger with two fairies collar, a celtic dragon collar (which is mine), and an Isis collar and a celtic water horse collar (both of which are for sale). I have also created some smaller pieces (a hair piece butterfly design, a celtic rose knot pin/pendant, some magickal patches) and am currently finishing a large peacock picture (having found a thick interfacing that doesn\u0027t limit my work to an 8 x 10 inch sheet). I have a series I am creating for our temple to represent the four elemental directions. The peacock is the first of these images and is for water. I have already begun the design of the next one which will be earth, and which will be a larger piece than the peacock and will have a celtic knotwork root system, a male and female face in the trunk and be half rowan and half oak at the top (to represent the celtic myth of woman being created from the rowan and man being created from the oak).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other part of my life is about service. I am the High Priestess of a local coven, teach classes to both beginners and more advanced practitioners, am in the process of trying to start a Pagan Community Center with a lending library (for those who are curious, but can\u0027t afford to buy) and a place to hold classes in whatever subjects people are interested in. I hoping to network with different types of neopagans and create a dialogue between different traditions. Our group hosts six open ritual events a year to facilitate education and fight misinformation about the various traditions in our community. I volunteer every two weeks at the local prison and host a circle for the inmates that are interested in learning more and whose spiritual needs would not be being met otherwise (and that part may be expanding with other practitioners starting to donate their time as well). I am the leader of a paranormal team (we call our group \"Healing What Haunts You Paranormal Investigations) and we volunteer our time to help those who are living in the midst of paranormal activities. We specialize in residential situations, but have also helped businesses in the area. I am a healer. As a massage therapist (graduated in 1990 from the Holistic Institute in Emeryville, CA) I specialize in injury recovery work and helping those who are in extreme pain recover from their injuries or surgeries. \u00a0Supporting me does not just support my art form, but it allows me to spend my time helping others who are in need.",
