The land of milk and Bacon - we produce a lot of gigs :-) I have been working with IT all of my adult\u0027s life. But I am really educated as an Electronics technician, and was really suppose to be designing circuit boards. But someone messed up, and put an elective in Server Infrastructure in there. I never found my way out of that maze. Back then it was Novell Netware and edirectory\u2026 I did like that big red logo.\u003cbr\u003eNever got back to the electronic professionally, and three dayes after I finishing my education, I had a nice IT job. That is just over 20 years ago now. Started out, managing 800 PC\u00b4s, that grow in years to 1000 PC\u2019s and 200 printers. I Often say that God created the PC, and the devil made the printer, and that insurances work for all of us. Since I have moved further away from the client side and now I am 100% over to the server side of things - they had cookies!",
