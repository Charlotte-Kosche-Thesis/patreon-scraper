Contributions will always go first to defraying current hosting costs. Cost\u00a0information will be publicly available. Patrons will have the \u003ca href=\"http://mspsocial.net/\"\u003eMSP Social\u003c/a\u003e admin\u0027s ear for ideas about improvements or ways \u003ca href=\"http://mspsocial.net/\"\u003eMSP Social\u003c/a\u003e can serve the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSurplus contributions will be set aside to cover costs during months of deficit. The server is being administered through volunteer labor. Presumably this can continue indefinitely, but if the size or complexity of the project grows, Patrons will be informed before anything changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, Patrons may also support using surplus funds to give back to contributing community members. This is a possibility that hopefully can be explored, but only if contributions reach a level that exceed the monthly hosting costs, so that the platform itself is sustainable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the long-term, surpluses could also go toward costs of building a sustainable, accountable organizational structure, e.g., fees to organize and register as a nonprofit. The size and scope of what is possible and appropriate will all depend on future growth and what the community wants out of the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for considering supporting a community-based, non-commercial platform!"
