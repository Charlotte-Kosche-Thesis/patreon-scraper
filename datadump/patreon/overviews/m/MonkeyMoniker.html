    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JRHo5n3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood day, Patrons! My name is MonkeyMoniker and I\u0027m a self-taught artist! I am a small-time content creator, making\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Voidmare1862\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://monkeymoniker.tumblr.com/archive\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eArtsy\u003c/a\u003e stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA year ago, I also made a comic (which can be found/read\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tapastic.com/episode/214972\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e) and was really happy with the response seeing as that was the first time I\u0027ve ever done anything like that! Unfortunately as time went on, I was unable to keep making pages as \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eLife\u003c/span\u003e got a hold of me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, I realized I needed to take some big leaps of faith. Over the past year, I\u0027ve been surviving primarily on commissions and unfortunately I\u0027ve hit a dry spell where that is concerned. With that in mind, I came to Patreon to setup a page of my own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the support of Patrons, I will be able to create more comic pages, make more videos and focus all of my attention on my craft instead of say, planting potatoes for survival... on earth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/WGqEJ4p.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you want to do with this money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, for starters - survival. I can\u0027t and won\u0027t make fancy promises I don\u0027t intend to keep, so for a start, I decided to set up a monthly \u0027survival\u0027 goal. This will essentially help me keep food on the table, and the power running so I can focus on writing stories, making videos and improving my skills!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruth be told, I really want to do -so- much more. But again, this is what I have to offer for now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou should do \u0027x\u0027 with your comics/videos/draw porn! Then you\u0027ll get more people coming in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027d love to just run with it if I\u0027m completely honest. But I believe in doing something only if you believe it. Without pretending to be someone you\u0027re not. So yeah, that\u0027s just the way it is!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you have a plan for the future?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes actually! I\u0027ve got a really big crazy plan of one day making a site for content creators. But it\u0027d be less focused on signal-boosting but more on giving content creators a chance to have their voice be heard. To explain, it\u0027d be a site dedicated to up-and-coming artists, artists who want to learn more, or for people who just need encouragement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of the whole reason why I\u0027m involving myself in so many things is because I need to learn them myself first! It is a long process, which again is why your support is so vital!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, as things usually go, things may change, ideas may evolve, and concepts may improve. But at the core of it, I want to lend hope. There\u0027s enough fear, anger and chaos to go around already, but a shortage on what\u0027s good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough. Again. This will be waaay off into the future. Once things are stabilized, work can begin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClosing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time and patience in reading my post! There is much more that I wish to do, but everyone\u0027s got to start somewhere. For that matter, I thank you for taking the time to read and/or view my page. Here\u0027s to a bigger dream! Bless you~\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
