    "summary": "We are Megaweapon. an indie punk band from Long Island, NY. With influences ranging from 90s ska and pop punk to today\u0027s modern indie pop and rock, we write songs that are about overcoming mental illness but still show our friends a good time. With our three part harmonies, good vibes, and trusty keytar, we plan to release a full length album and tour down to SXSW by March 2017.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis year, we are heading into the studio in Port Jefferson NY to work at VuDu Studios to record a full LP. VuDu Studios has brought many amazing albums to life for an array of artists including the Pixies, The Dear Hunter, and More. We\u0027ve chosen to work at this studio with our good friend and producer Nicholas Starrantino.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Your support will help us put out our first full LP. Some of the content we will be creating over the course of the year beyond the original music on our LP we will be recording includes \u003cbr\u003e-studio update videos\u003cbr\u003e-acoustic cover videos \u0026amp; recordings\u003cbr\u003e-merch personally printed by our singer\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-instrument playthroughs of songs by each member\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to raise $1000-$4000 (that\u0027s $111 to 444 per month in total) between Patreon, live streaming of concerts, teaching lessons and merch sales to help us produce our full LP. This would lighten the load of the personal amount of investment we are putting into our album from $3500 per person to somewhere between $1500-2500 per person. Or if by some miracle we raise more, it would mean the world to us to be able to have a project funded by people who believe in it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s some updates on what we\u0027ve been doing so far this year\u003cbr\u003eAs of June 2016, we have raised $265 toward our goal of $1000.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we understand that other projects are also putting out similar content, we full-heartedly believe that you always have fun if you choose to support us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
