I aim for these interviews to be entertaining and useful to other artists, whether it is by providing insight into a technique or simply knowing that other people share the same challenges in creating their work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can cover the slow but steady costs of hosting the website and the podcast files.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith more support, I can afford to upgrade my equipment and travel to interview UK-based artists in their studios and you get to listen in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I\u0027d like to be able to afford to pay for transcription of all the episodes. Not everyone is able to listen to these interviews and this is one way of making these interviews more useful to more people.\u003cbr\u003e"
