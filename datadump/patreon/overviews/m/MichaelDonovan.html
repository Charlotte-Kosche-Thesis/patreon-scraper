    "summary": "Aloha!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making podcasts for over two years. I\u0027ve covered culture, spirituality, art, life, environment, psychology, fear, death and many of the invisible aspects of our human experience that shape our perceptions of reality. I\u0027ve been completely independent in this process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs more people reach out to me, I have realized there is real value in the show that transcends what I imagined.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY I\u0027M DOING PATREON NOW\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want the show to grow. The audience has tripled in size over the last 3 months and it\u0027s starting to reach more hearts and minds, so I want to sink more time in to this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve begin experimenting with some new formats that are more time consuming - receiving donations will allow me to dedicate more time to this.\u00a0I\u0027d like to upgrade equipment (this computer is nearly dead!) and I\u0027d like to expand the amount of time I can create some of the experimental episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW PATREON WORKS\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar: it\u0027s a way for us to balance the karma. You, the listeners, sponsor the show. Each month you pitch in an amount you\u0027re comfortable with. I receive that dough so we can all grow! It\u0027s like Netflix but you\u0027re subscribing to one artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... listening to Walking Home and itching to balance your karma? Wanting to help the show grow? This is the easiest way to contribute to MDWH in a way that is simple, quick, consistent, and easy!\u00a0Listener support is the way I\u0027ll be able to keep the message pure and full of love! The more the you and the gang contribute, the more I can focus on you and the guests.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMORE WAYS TO SPONSOR\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou can also bookmark my \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/?\u0026amp;tag=studiodonovan-20\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eamazon link\u003c/a\u003e.
