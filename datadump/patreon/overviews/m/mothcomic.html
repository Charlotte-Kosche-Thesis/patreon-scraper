But I\u0027m just getting up and started and living in the big city, and finances are very very tight right now. I need some support if I\u0027m going to be able to continue doing this story justice as I move into this new phase in my life. With your pledge, I will be able to continue uploading 1 beautiful, often partly animated, page every week, on Saturday - that\u0027s 4 a month! Help me get my start as an independent creator, and look forward to more and more high-quality sotrytelling and more ambitious projects in the future, as my fanbase and income from my personal work continues to grow!"
