I painted a bunch of murals in Baltimore, MD and my first comic, \u003cem\u003eIn the Hands of Boys\u003c/em\u003e, got a Xeric grant!

Issue #1 first appeared in black and white at Small Press Expo in 2009 and the next three issues were released in limited print runs, sold at conventions, independent comic book shops, and online. The webcomic was launched on Thursday, December 10th, 2015 starting before the beginning and taking us through the story again - this time in color! I love the webcomic process - each page gets a moment in the sun. After a year of posting I decided to join with Stela and reach an even wider audience. As a freelancer I support myself illustrating, flatting, and coloring comics for companies like Stela, IDW, Image, and Dark Horse. I take commissions, organize exhibitions, paint murals, and garden. The support of my patrons and fans is so important to the creation of my original content. Thanks for joining the adventure!\u003cbr\u003e"
