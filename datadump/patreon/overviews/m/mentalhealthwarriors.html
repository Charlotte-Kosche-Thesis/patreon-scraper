I want to assemble\nthe most complete and diverse set of perspectives on emotional and mental\nhealth and well being anywhere on the web. PERIOD. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy first wife Cindy, was diagnosed with Bipolar\nDisorder at the beginning of 2006.  She\nhad been sick for a long time before that. \n4 years later, in 2010 she took her own life.  The only option anyone ever offered\nCindy was all kinds of medication, electro-shock therapy and\ninstitutionalization.  I now know that\nthere are infinite of options available for healing.  Every single one of us is unique.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPeople aren\u2019t broken and in need of fixing.  They are \u003cem\u003ehurt and in need of healing\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMHW has a had a great start and has developed an enthusiastic audience.  In the past months, I\u2019ve recorded over 50\npodcast episodes and the MHW podcast and community has become almost a full-time\njob (labour of love) for me.  I know two\nthings now:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1) I want MHW to go on for a long time. The proof is in. MHW is changing lives. I\u0027m obsessed with\ntalking to and learning from people and teaching you in the process \u2014it\u0027s the\nmost fun I\u0027ve ever had doing anything. This should continue for a long time, in\nsome form or another.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2) I need to make MHW self-sustaining for\nthis to work.  The \u201cfund and grow MHW out of my own pocket\u201d is not sustainable.  If MHW is going to go on for a long time and\nto help more and more people, it needs to be self-sustaining.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve receive generous donations from listeners eve\nand people have been telling me about Patreon so I\u2019m trying it out\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe way Patreon works is a listener can donate\nwhatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after\nthat. So anything, from $1/month up, is hugely helpful to the cause.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat We\u0027ll Use the Money For\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy initial goal is $5,000/month. That money will\nbe enough to keep MHW going, indefinitely.

I share my successful journey in discovering how to embrace vulnerability as a sign of strength, courage and wisdom. I provide a road-map to help dads to debunk the traditional definition of vulnerability; experience a deeper connection with himself and other people; and demonstrate how the new definition of vulnerability fuels stronger relationships with his spouse or ex-spouse and his children.
