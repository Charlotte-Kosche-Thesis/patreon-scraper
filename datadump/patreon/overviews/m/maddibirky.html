I decided to make a Patreon account so that I can get a little money from doing what I love and get my work out into the world. On the right, you\u0027ll find all my patron rewards for each level, and on the left are my goals. As of right now, I have the donations set to monthly, although in the future I may change it to per creation, depending on how much I\u0027m writing and creating.\u003cbr\u003eI like to write science fiction and fantasy, for the most part, although I do also enjoy writing realistic fiction that deals with current topics that are important to me. Short stories are my forte, since they\u0027re what I have the most time and patience for, although I have a few novel-length ideas stewing in my mind. When it comes to videos, I\u0027m still not sure what I\u0027ll have time to make, but I would like to do cooking videos and book review videos, as well as original short films.\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to look at my page, and I hope you decide to support me!\u003cbr\u003e"
