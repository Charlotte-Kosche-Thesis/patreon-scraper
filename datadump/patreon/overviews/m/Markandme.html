From its first episode with Kevin Smith\u00a0I have recorded 33 episodes (at this time) with guests such as Neill Blomkamp, Jason Mewes, Sherilyn Fenn, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Corey Feldman, Carl Gottlieb, Ralph Garman, Tommy Wiseau, The cast of the Room, Michael Winslow, Jessica Hynes, Jon Heder, Zach Galligan and many many more...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I still want to do so much more... But I need your help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming part of my Patreon family, you\u0027ll be assisting me with not just the day-to-day operations of Mark and Me, but also helping me plan for the future. With your patronage, you\u0027ll be allowing me the time and resources to not only produce the bi-weekly show, but also create much more content, purchase better equipment, design new merch and get out on the road to conduct interviews and attend many events!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Break Down\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore content:\u003c/strong\u003e I am looking to step up production on more interviews and bonus episodes. These take time and a lot of work to produce. I am also looking to develop different projects including new shows, a video series, and much more.   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBetter equipment: I\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0think the show sounds good, but everything can always sound better. Your patronage will help me acquire better mics, mixers and other recording gear. The show has come a long way from where I started -- but it can always sound more polished. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDesign new merch: \u003c/strong\u003eWith your patronage, I will be able to follow through on new merch ideas and hire the right people to get them made. Who\u00a0doesn\u0027t\u00a0want a Mark and Me keyring?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGet out on the road more:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI love conducting interviews via Skype and telephone, but there\u0027s nothing more rewarding for me than doing interviews in person. Whether it\u0027s at a film screening, a press junket, award ceremony or comic convention I want to get to more events to get you more podcasts\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your patronage, I hope to be able to cover all the costs that go into recording face to face interviews which includes travelling, \u00a0lodging, venue fees and, for some live events I have planned, film licensing! I would like to be able to cover all corners of this planet and venture even further to record material all over the world, and beyond!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut what do you get out of this, you ask? \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell a lot more\u00a0podcasts, so the thing you\u0027re going to get out of becoming a patron of Mark and Me is more and more content! plus some nice shiny extras along the way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the very beginning, Mark and Me has been fan-driven and fan-supported. First and foremost I do the show for you, the listener. Without you folks, there\u0027s no reason to even do a show in the first place. But time is moving on, and I have realised that if I\u0027m going to turn Mark and Me into something even greater, now is the moment to do so!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am super excited about all the new ideas and directions I have planned for the Mark and Me podcast and I can\u0027t wait to have you on board for the journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch thanks for being there for me then and being here for me now,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMark\u003cbr\u003eThe Mark and Me Podcast\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
