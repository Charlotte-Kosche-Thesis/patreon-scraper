Want stories starring trans and nonbinary people? Asexual romances? Poly relationships? These are just a few examples of the types of representations (not limited to gender and sexuality alone) that I want to explore, but can only do so with your\u00a0love and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to all of those that have shown such amazing support so far. It\u0027s because of you that this is possible.\u00a0My plan is to start with serials or novellas (30,000 words and under) and work my way up to novels (around 50,000 words or more) once certain goals are met. I will do my best to post updates/content at least once a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a patron today so that we can bring positive stories to those that need it most. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
