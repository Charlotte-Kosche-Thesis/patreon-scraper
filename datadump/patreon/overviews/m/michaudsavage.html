The thing is, unless you see it, it\u0027s hard to know it\u0027s there; your support during the meanwhile really makes it a whole bunch easier to keep on keeping on.

As a composer, my works include compositions for guitar, chamber ensembles, orchestra, electronics, Max/MSP, and performance art. I\u0027m also stepping into a role which I\u0027ve largely abandoned in past years- as a singer and songwriter.
