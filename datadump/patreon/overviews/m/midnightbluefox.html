    "summary": "Thank you for taking the time to check out my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always loved writing but just recently is the first time I\u0027ve ever shared it online. And in doing so, I\u0027ve met so many amazing people, readers and fellow writers. I wanted a way to share more of my content and interact with my readers, and Patreon seemed perfect for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other thing I wanted, besides sharing content for my stories, was to meet more writers online. I love the idea of creating a positive writing community where writers can share their content, get feedback, discover other stories and make friends with similar interests. That\u0027s where the Discord server I\u0027ve created comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe server is called The Writing Den and will feature several things; a space to share your online works, prompts and contests, and an area to ask for feedback or help, among other things. I want fellow writers to come and connect with others inside of a positive, helpful, fun writing community. All online writers will be welcome, whether you write fanfiction or an original story on Wattpad or other platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I will offer rewards and content specifically for patrons, there will also be things uploaded for general viewers. I want support and donations to be a choice, not something you feel that you have to do in order to get any new content. And anyone is more than welcome to join my\u00a0Discord group, access will not be withheld or used as a reward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sort of content you can expect to be posted on here include deleted scenes, sneak peeks for new chapters or stories, and scenes from the POV of other characters. As a patron, you will get more of these than posted to the general public, early access, and the opportunity to vote in polls in future stories you want to see and choices in my current stories. There will be other rewards, as you can see in the reward tiers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate any and all support. As anyone who writes on the side knows, it takes time and can be hard to squeeze into a busy schedule. I don\u0027t have the words to describe how much it means if you choose to become a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read all of this and consider my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiscord Link:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/mErzxrU\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/mErzxrU\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContact Me: midnightbluefox23@gmail.com"
