I venture into abstract photography from time to time, and I also produce the occasional figure study. (Figure study, of course, means that I photograph the human form. I do so with artistry and empathy for my subjects, but I know that not everyone cottons to the form. If you\u0027re contemplating donating, I owe you that heads up.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd What is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowdfunding platform that is similar to Kickstarter, with one significant difference: rather than giving one large donation towards one large project, Patreon allows you to give ongoing support to artists who are creating content on a regular basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonations are made on a monthly basis, and patrons may decide how much they would like to (or how much they can afford to) contribute. As a bonus, varying contribution levels also receive small gifts as a token of my appreciation. (In that sense, my Patreon page vaguely resembles your local NPR affiliate. Minus the on air pledge breaks and banter.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn turn, artist creations are posted each month to their Patreon webpage - or on a more regular basis, if the artist opts to post more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Why Am I, the Artist, on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI see Patreon as one tool in a metaphorical toolbox that helps me continue to create. One of the hard truths about art is that it costs money to produce, and that the cost versus income ratio rarely results in a profit. For photographers, those costs usually encompass obtaining new or replacing old equipment - lighting, lenses, backdrops, cameras, filters, memory cards, batteries - as well as printing and matting costs, getting studio space, etc. Even for stingy photographers like me (I hold on to old equipment for what feels like forever), it all adds up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, asking for donations from anyone has never been something that I\u0027ve been especially gifted at, or comfortable with. (You know those fundraising drives at school, where you had to sell magazine subscriptions? I was terrible at those.) And that\u0027s especially true when I\u0027m talking about \"Art\" - a term with a very subjective definition. (Everyone defines it differently.) So if you do decide to donate, thank you! But only donate what you can afford, or are comfortable donating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTimes are Tight. Can I Put a Cap on my Total Donation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbsolutely. To find out how to limit your total donation, consult Patreon\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\"\u003eFAQ page\u003c/a\u003e. And if you are inclined to give, thank you! But please: only donate what you feel comfortable giving - even if it\u0027s only one dollar. (Really!) Times are tight for many of us, and every dollar counts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers, folks.\u003cbr\u003e"
