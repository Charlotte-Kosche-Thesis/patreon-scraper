You can just log in to change or cancel the account whenever you want.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\u003c/h3\u003e\nBecause Patreon is a USA based website, everything is written in $US dollars, but you can use any currency and it will be automatically converted. If you live in a country outside of the USA like England, Canada or Australia for example, you can pay using your local currency, however your payment will be converted into $US dollars with the current exchange rate on that day.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCheck your countries Exchange Rate with the USA\u003c/h3\u003e\nI live in Australia, so whenever I buy a product or service from the USA, I always check the exchange rate before I make a purchase. Google \"USD to \u003cem\u003eyour countries currency code\u003c/em\u003e\" and you will be able to calculate what your pledge will actually cost you per video. If you are unhappy about the exchange rate difference, I suggest you limit the amount you pledge each month, that way you gain back control over how much you spend.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWho are you and what is your background?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.moviestudiozen.com/images/about-me/me-and-rainbow-serpent-returns.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.moviestudiozen.com/about-me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDerek Moran\u003c/a\u003e and I have been making tutorials about how to use Sony Movie Studio Platinum and Vegas Pro, since 2008. When I taught myself how to use Sony Movie Studio Platinum in 2008, there were hardly any good video tutorials to watch. It was incredibly frustrating to find solutions to basic problems and I chucked in the towel over and over again. I abandoned the program for a few months, but when I came back one last time, I experienced a massive \"A-Ha\" moment and suddenly it all made sense. At the same time I realised there must have been many other people feeling the same way and wanting to give up. This gave birth to Movie Studio Zen and I began to teach how to use the program.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPainting is my number one passion. The picture above is the first large painting I ever completed and it is titled \"Rainbow Serpent Awakens\".\u00a0I have had a serious health problem all my life, which has shaped the person I am today. I live simply, enjoy being of service and try to radiate peace and calmness.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is Movie Studio Zen.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your support! I really do appreciate it :)\n\u003cbr\u003e"
