As you can see from my cover photo, I am attempting to raise money for my organization, Write around the Bend, which feeds directly back into the community. I either offer, or wish to offer, each of the following to our community: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---WRB Book Club for readers,\u003cbr\u003e---WRB Writing Circle for writers,\u003cbr\u003e---WRB Readers\u0027 Series for writers, \u003cbr\u003e---Poetic Donations: give any amount, and I will give you a poem in exchange. All monetary donations then are used to support families in the community who are in need of food, clothing, and toys, around the holidays (primarily around Christmas and Easter),\u003cbr\u003e---WRB Youth Program: a free program of creative writing classes for K12 students (future), \u003cbr\u003e---SHARK Literary Magazine (future), and \u003cbr\u003e---The Mackinaw House: The Writers\u0027 Retreat (future). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, everything is coming out of my pocket, and I need help. I provide food and drinks for the meetings for our book club and writing circle, I pay for the venue for the readers\u0027 series, and I donated over half of the proceeds for Poetic Donations this year, so that we could care for an additional family of ten in our community. As for our Youth Program, Literary Magazine, and Writers\u0027 Retreat, I can\u0027t pay for these costs alone. For the Youth Program, I need supplies, books, and food for my students, as well as a little to give back to the volunteers. For the literary magazine, I need a printing budget, as well as a little money to give back to the volunteers. And finally, I can\u0027t even purchase the home of my dreams for the Writers\u0027 Retreat without your help, let alone renovate it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease. Any amount you can give would be beyond useful. I will write as many poems for you as you want, in any style you want, at any length, at any time. All of these funds are going back into our community. Help make my dream come true; help me make others\u0027 dreams come true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my love,\u003cbr\u003eMcKenzie\u003cbr\u003e"
