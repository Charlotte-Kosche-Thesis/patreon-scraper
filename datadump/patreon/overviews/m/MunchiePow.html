Consisting of Lalin (a small creature with big dreams) and Eamon (a big idiot with a small IQ), us test-tube rejects love to talk, chat, gabble and chinwag our way around the globe, making unsuspecting foreigners put up with the cancer that is our sense of humour. Our YouTube channel has been a long labour of love, creativity and that wonderfully bleak depression that always strikes at 2pm on a Tuesday. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there\u0027s one thing you should know about us, it\u0027s that we are as poor as we are fun! And to put that into context, we are superMEGAULTRA fun. I\u0027ll let you do with that information what you will, wink wink. To put it another way, the two of us are also registered on the UN\u0027s Fragile State Index because our personal GDP is just that low! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe live off our channel and with your support we can afford the basic necessities needed so we can put our full effort into creating more videos without worrying about starving in between posts. Plus we can eventually purchase bigger and better camera and editing equipment so we can put out more videos at higher quality. We are just starting out and we have given up everything to follow our dreams. I hope you follow along with us too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeautiful vistas, inoffensively offensive personalities and enough references and one-liners to make Lord Mountbatten pop a monocle from sheer disgust! What more could you want?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "This is a beast of a goal for a beast of a trip, beyond the scale of anything we have attempted before. In late 2018 AD, starting from our base in Sri Lanka, we plan to take the Trans-Siberian Express all the way through Russia (A continent with GIRTH), travelling across Mongolia (Marco Polo was amazing!) and ending in China (Where literally everything wonderful originates). We will be spending 2 weeks in Russia, followed by 7 full days of vlogging/sleeping/suffering on a train, and then 2 more weeks in China (Great Walls of Pandas!) before heading back to Sri Lanka.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe expense of this trip is due both to the length of the adventure and its continent-spanning nature, with all the associated costs. It will involve: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7 days of train vlog, \u003cbr\u003e6 countries visas, \u003cbr\u003e5 weeks travel time, \u003cbr\u003e4 hostel bookings, \u003cbr\u003e3 airline flights, \u003cbr\u003e2 railway tickets \u003cbr\u003eAnd a partridge in a pear tree~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChristmas song parodies aside, the reason we put the goal money so high is because it turns out that travelling a quarter of the world is quite expensive (Crazy, right?), even with the cheapest hostels and flights we could find. We\u0027ve almost been stuck in foreign countries because we underestimated the sheer cost of tourism and didn\u0027t bring enough money. Instinctive financial panic notwithstanding, this meant we missed out on doing so many things. Hence the lofty goal, which will cover the costs of this massive undertaking and allow us to try unique, foreign activities (Like Russian saunas where they beat you with shrubs or wrestling a Mongolian, if we have the chance) and weirdly tasty [we hope] exotic foods (Like rat! Delicious Bubonic plague is delicious), which we will then post for your viewing pleasure with all the associated praise and scorn!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all said and done, with all your help, whether great or small, we can craft an amazing vlog adventure (with our signature unfunny commentary) that will blow you away with it\u0027s scale and beauty. We look forward to doing it as much as we hope you will to watching it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. Also Lalin has never seen snow. Through various weird circumstances and wacky hi-jinks, we have failed 3 times to find snow for her. Understandably, this is horribly depressing. Hopefully 4th time will be the charm, eh?\u003cbr\u003e",
