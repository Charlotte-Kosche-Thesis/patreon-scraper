    "summary": "Hi! If you don\u0027t know me, I am a Detroit based artist and photographer that specializes on film and alternative process photography. More specifically, I experiment with transferring photographs on as many different types of surfaces as possible. As an artist, I really play with using photography as a method to move complex ideas, especially in relation to anxiety, depression, and overall mental health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately, I\u0027ve felt like I\u0027ve been in a bit of a rut with my work, so I decided to start my Patreon page as a method of motivation. I want to create more artwork, but I also want to create more content to engage with you! I\u0027m working on behind the scenes videos and extra content, so you can see how these processes work and fall in love just like I have. \ud83d\ude0d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working towards having more opportunities to travel the country and create more images. If you decide to subscribe monthly, your help will push me even closer towards my goal of traveling the Pacific Coastline for my first photography devoted trip. I\u0027ve also thought of other fun ways to engage, including live videos, behind the scenes access, contests to win original art, and more. Thank you so much for being here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
