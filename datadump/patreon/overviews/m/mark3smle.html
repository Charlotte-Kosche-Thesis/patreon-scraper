    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eSix years ago I started the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJMYY9kMcb6vdNLYSddfPA\"\u003eMark3smle\u003c/a\u003e YouTube channel. Since then, what had been a way to come out of my shell has blown up into an occupation onto itself with support I never thought would be possible in a million years, let alone half a dozen. All this was possible thanks to viewers like you, as my content has and will remain free and unattached to any corporate interests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere at Mark3smle, I review firearms of all kinds and I also go on about side topics like reloading and gun builds. I give little known firearms a chance to shine and mainstream firearms an objective look free of fan-boy bias.\u003cbr\u003eNow in this new year, 2017, I have decided to harness the power of Patreon to give my many loyal viewers what they would like to see... and some content that will come as a surprise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Terril Hebert and I have been the host of the Mark3smle channel since the very beginning. A native of south Louisiana, I am primarily a fiction author and manager, but it is fair to say the lion\u0027s share of my energy is spend on YouTube. You can also find some more in-depth details of my work on the channel at \u003ca href=\"https://mark3smle.com/\"\u003emark3smle.com\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.guns.com/author/terril-james-herbert/\"\u003eguns.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Support Me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are countless YouTube firearm channels out there and many of them are well received. That begs the question: Why support me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere at Mark3smle, I vowed from Day 1 to be all about firearms and to leave politics out of it. Despite that firearms and politics are intertwined, I believe the fascination with these machines can supersede arguments. I approach everything with a bit of a learning curve, so often times you are learning right along with me. I strive for greater videos and all \u003cstrong\u003ead-free\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ewithout corporate\u003c/strong\u003e interests and intervention. You don\u0027t see only the good, you get the bad too without irrelevant blabbering. I am not the be all and end all of gun channels, but no one is either regardless of subscriber count and views. It will always be me putting out good content and responding to every reaction, personally. Call it being\u00a0old-fashioned. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is in store for 2017? Here are a few of my goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Content on a bi-weekly basis\u003cbr\u003e2) More ballistic gel testing (modern cartridge and muzzle-loading platforms)\u003cbr\u003e3) More modern handgun reviews\u003cbr\u003e4) Winter Hunting videos\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is in it for You?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor a $1 per month contribution, it will allow me to bring on better content. Tests the myths and give the information that is too tedious or niche for the big channels to bother with. You get unbiased opinions and real world shooting. But you will also get:\u003cbr\u003e1) A vote in project polls conducted on a monthly basis.\u003cbr\u003e2) An equal stake in an exclusive quarterly Patreon giveaway--five chances to win any number of random prizes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jP8blHu-0C8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"
