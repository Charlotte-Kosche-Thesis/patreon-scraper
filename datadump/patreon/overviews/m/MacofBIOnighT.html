Read below to find out how...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi everybody\u00a0 :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is \u003cstrong\u003eMac of BIOnighT\u003c/strong\u003e, from Italy. I\u0027ve been composing and recording music since I was 16, and I\u0027ve been releasing it since 1999.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eI am mostly known for my Berlin School and Ambient albums, but in reality I record every kind of music.\u00a0 If you check out my website\u00a0 ( \u003ca href=\"http://www.macvibes.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.macvibes.com\u003c/a\u003e ) and have the patience to go through my vast catalog, you will find jazz, Italo Disco, symphonic, soundtrack, horror, piano, drone, Berlin School, Ambient, ethnic, and basically every other kind of music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.macvibes.com/PICTURES/patreon%20pic%2001.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am my music, and I believe that if you share what you are so it can become a part of other people\u0027s lives and enrich them, then you\u0027re doing what you should as a human being. Patreon is one of the ways what I am and what you are can interact\u00a0 :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.macvibes.com/PICTURES/patreon%20pic%2002.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s very simple.\u00a0 Basically, you pledge to send me a small amount of money (which might be as little as 2 dollars) every time I release an album (the payment happens automatically, you needn\u0027t remember about it)).\u00a0 It is, in fact, like a subscription to a magazine or something - you get the magazine every time it is released and can enjoy it without missing any issue, and at the same time the magazine can count on a certain number of readers that will support it. It\u0027s a win-win situation.\u003cbr\u003eIn your case, you will get each one of my albums for just a fraction of its price, which is pretty good, I think\u00a0 :)\u003cbr\u003eYou can also set a maximum monthly limit (for example, you might be willing to invest four dollars - or even just two - a month on my albums, but no more than that, you can just set that as a limit), and you can also stop the \"subscription\" whenever you want.\u003cbr\u003eI do not release more than one album per month, so that\u0027d be like buying a coffee to a friend once a month or every two months, except that every time you\u0027ll get an album of adventurous music to keep in return, and you\u0027ll make sure that my music keeps enriching your life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, when you subscribe you can choose TEN \nalbums from my back catalog and receive them for FREE (as mp3 and wav \ndownloads), if we include taxes, that\u0027s about 85 dollars worth of records, just let me know which ones you want   :)\u003cbr\u003eWhat more could you ask for?\u00a0 C\u0027mon, subscribe and let\u0027s continue this journey together\u00a0 :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eMac\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
