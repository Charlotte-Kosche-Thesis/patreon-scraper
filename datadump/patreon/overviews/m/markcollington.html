My first book was published in 2014, a science-fiction mystery novel called \"Kingdom Come.\" I\u0027m now working on the first novel in a fantasy series, and can sometimes even be seen writing in daylight hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first novel is no longer published owing to some problems that the publisher ran into. My current plan is to complete the first novel in the fantasy series, and then shop both novels around to agents. The purpose of this Patreon is really to help me survive while I write and then search for an agent, without having to resort to working (yet) another job, or selling any organs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m originally from the south-east of England, but I spent my teens and early twenties living in Wales, and I received a BA in English with Creative writing from Bangor university. Since then I have moved to the States, completed an MA at UAlbany in upstate New York, and I now live near Atlanta, Georgia.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
