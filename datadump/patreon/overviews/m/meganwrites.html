    "summary": "The number one thing to know about me is, I have always been a reader. From my earliest memories, my life has been surrounded by books and stories. (Ask me about the time my dad told me to, and I quote, \u201cPut down the book and go watch TV with your brother!\u201d) I love reading for the same reasons as most: to relax and center myself, to escape, to inhabit points of view and worlds I would not come into contact with otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I also love reading because I am a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI process the world and my experiences in it by telling stories, real and imaginary. As a writer, reading is how I study. I approach a book like a painter approaches art in a gallery. I tilt my head to take in all the angles. I get up close and stand back. I examine the overall structure as well as the brush strokes. I do all of this to learn to improve myself when I practice my craft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo further enhance said craft and learn how to think of my writing as a professional endeavor, I recently started the MFA (Masters of Fine Arts) in Creative Writing at Oregon State University - Cascades. That was part of the inspiration for starting this page. What\u0027s more professional than being paid to write? The other part was the fact that I need accountability to keep me productive, and, let\u0027s be real, the validation would feel pretty good too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter graduating from UC Davis with a Bachelor of Arts in Communication and Political Science, I went on to work in marketing/communications where I wrote and edited web content as well as press-related documents for political campaigns and nonprofits alike. I spent a few years feeling like I just couldn\u2019t find my passion anywhere in my work. So I shifted my attention back to my first love: storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSwitching tracks from marketing to publishing, I worked as the in-house editorial assistant for Seal Press, in addition to completing UC Berkeley\u2019s Professional Sequence in Editing. I worked as a developmental editor for a few years since then, helping underrepresented writers strengthen their skills as well as their stories. But, you see, I set out to be a writer who supported herself by providing editing services, and I woke up one day to realize I took other people\u0027s writing so much more seriously than my own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am! In addition to access to my current writing projects, as a member of this community, you\u0027ll also get access to my brain and any expertise you might find useful therein. Plus you\u0027ll get to see and support me as I learn and grow as an artist, live and in living . .\u00a0. text, with each story and essay I write and share. I hope you\u0027ll join me on this adventure. There\u0027s nothing I love more than getting to know my fellow storytellers."
