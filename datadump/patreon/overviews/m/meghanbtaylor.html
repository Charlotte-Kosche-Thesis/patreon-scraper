With your help, I can not only get those stories finished faster and better, but I can spread them to a wider audience and give them real life. That\u0027s the dream.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI currently have four separate novels trapped in my head and wanting to get out. As a patron, you can access my world-building sketches, read what I write before anyone else has a chance to see a word of it, and even get a chance to offer feedback and make those stories even better before they\u0027re released into the world. Since 2010 I\u0027ve also been creating a serial webcomic called The Prophecy of the Circle, and here you can both watch me create it and read it earlier than anyone else. You can watch me make art. You can get a shot at directing what I sketch during the month. You can help me in so many ways.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd if I reach enough funding, the reward is that I can do even more. Money is time, and if I could spend all of my time on making new things for others to enjoy, you absolutely bet that I would. You can make it happen, and, to play off an old and obnoxious but true adage, most of it costs less than a fancy drink from Starbucks. At its most elaborate, all this costs is about equivalent to two really fancy drinks from Starbucks! One for you and one for a friend.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for reading! I hope you enjoy what you see.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBonus Materials Note!\u003c/strong\u003e I also often appear on my boyfriend\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/timmcosplay\"\u003eTim\u0027s Patreon page\u003c/a\u003e where he creates cosplay costumes and props for the both of us."

This is almost guaranteed to be \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive outside of artbooks\u003c/strong\u003e (and there\u0027s no guarantee that I\u0027ll ever be able to afford to publish one of those, so it might be \u003cem\u003etruly \u003c/em\u003eexclusive).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this level there will also be a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly Suggest-A-Sketch post at the end of every month\u003c/strong\u003e, where you guys have the opportunity to give me ideas to draw from for both this tier and for the $3 tier for the following month. There\u0027s no guarantee that I can sketch all of what\u0027s suggested, but I\u0027d sure as heck try. :)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027ll be slow to appear, but \u003cstrong\u003eafter several rounds of editing, my fiction will also periodically appear in this tier\u003c/strong\u003e.
