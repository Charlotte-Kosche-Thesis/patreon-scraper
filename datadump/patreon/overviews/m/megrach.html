    "summary": "WAKE is aiming to be a bi-monthly print publication based out of Toronto, ON. An independent publication, WAKE strives to bring forth a new and inspired way of re-imagining the print medium featuring works by local and up-and-coming writers, artists, photographers and contributors. \u003cbr\u003eWAKE is not strictly a zine, nor is it strictly a news publication - it\u0027s rather a healthy mix of both ideologies to create a wholly unique publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe writing will introduce readers to new, alternative ideas in everything from politics to the arts, a focus on the local effort put forth by those working to create something themselves. It will also give the writers a chance to hone their skills and find their own style through their writing, creating a tangible voice for readers to recognize and discuss.\u003cbr\u003eNot only with there be thoughtful and interesting feature pieces, in each issue WAKE will offer:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eshort stories\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003epoetry\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eopinion pieces\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003epersonal essays\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\"Discover\", profiling new, under the radar musicians, artists, filmmakers, writers and organizations/collectives within Toronto\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e+ more\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBringing artwork into the forefront is also important to WAKE. Featuring large, full-colour pages of artwork created by emerging artists and photographers, WAKE will become as much of an art collection as it is dedicated to the written form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWAKE is forging partnerships with \u003ca href=\"http://www.currentsessions.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCurrent Sessions Productions\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/YoungInspirations\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYoung Inspirations\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.headquarterscooperative.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHeadquarters Cooperative\u003c/a\u003e - three other fantastic local, independent efforts dedicated to fostering the emergence of up-and-coming musicians.\u003cbr\u003eYou can see these names in issues of WAKE in the form of ads, upcoming events, and even content generated by those involved. Each issue will be sold at their events, including the official launch party on October 25th, the first WAKE+Current Sessions event.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverall, WAKE needs YOU, the consumer.\u003cbr\u003eThis is first and foremost, a D.I.Y effort. Everything done for this publication is on an entirely volunteer basis by all contributors and editorial staff. \u003cbr\u003eTherefore, printing costs will be the key financial need.\u003cbr\u003eMoney charged for each issue of WAKE will purely go back into the funds to continue printing future issues. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e(You rock, don\u0027t ever change.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Megan Rach, Editor and Creator\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: if you want to become involved with WAKE in anyway (contributor, partner, etc.) you can find a bunch of information \u003ca href=\"http://meganarach.wordpress.com/2014/07/22/mandate-and-information-regarding-a-brand-new-publication-effort/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e"
