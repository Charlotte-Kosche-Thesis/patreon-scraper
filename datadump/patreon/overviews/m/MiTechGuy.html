    "summary": "Hi guys, it\u0027s MTG here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for even checking out this page. The fact that you clicked the link shows me that you appreciate and acknowledge all of the time and effort that it takes for me to upload videos at the quality that I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Support Me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027m an undergraduate student at (MIT) the Massachusetts Institute of Technology majoring in Aerospace Engineering with a concentration in Engineering Management. I am also double minoring in both Business Analytics and Economics. My course load is already very ambitious, but I have always striven to do my best in whatever situation it may be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn terms of my YouTube channel, I will not make a video unless I know it will not only help inform my viewers about new tech, but also will present itself in a way that is very visually pleasing, clear, and concise. I push myself every day to succeed in every facet of my life, and I know that this channel will be successful. But I also know that without my supportive YouTube community, family, and friends, creating these videos wouldn\u0027t be as fulfilling as it is right now, so thank you for even taking the time to read this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will the money support me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a really busy schedule throughout the year, so it is difficult to balance YouTube, school, and also jobs that I need in order to start paying off my student loans and also to buy everyday necessities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, every phone that I review is paid for by my own money. Generally speaking, whatever I make in YouTube revenue goes directly towards new phones that are requested by you, my viewers. This Patreon page will allow me to review the phones that you want me to review and also branch out into more consumer electronics in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the everyday necessities and new phones, the money will help me improve the channel faster than it would\u0027ve otherwise. I would be able to use more professional equipment and potentially have a studio and not have to film out of my dorm room. It will also help me improve my graphics, logos, and intros/outros.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong story short, I won\u0027t let a single dollar go to waste and I will continue to strive to improve this channel. And the more time that I can focus on my channel, the quicker I can reach my goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture Aspirations:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strive to one-day be a leader in either a major aerospace Corporation, or a founder of my own. I am also still deliberating on whether or not I want to pursue an engineering PhD. Either way, I \u00a0will always make time to create my tech videos because I really have a great time talking about new, innovative products and sharing my thoughts with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve said this many times in the past, but words cannot describe how thankful I am for my YouTube audience, family, and friends. It means a lot to me that you guys take the time to watch my videos, and also find them informative enough to feel inclined to subscribe. I\u0027ll always strive to improve, and right now is just the beginning. Thank you for going on my YouTube adventure with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTLDR:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Thank you so much for even checking out this page.\u003cbr\u003e- The money will help me dedicate more time to producing these videos and also improve my equipment in order to help make videos more frequently\u003cbr\u003e"
