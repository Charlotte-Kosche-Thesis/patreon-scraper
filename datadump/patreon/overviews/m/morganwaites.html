    "summary": "Hello! My name is Morgan Waites and I am from Montgomery, AL. I am a recent college graduate from the University of South Alabama, where I received my Bachelors degree in Professional Health Sciences. I am excited to announce that I have been offered the opportunity to serve as a Christ in the City missionary in Denver, Colorado for a year. Christ in the City is a nonprofit organization that strives to know, love and serve the poor. With accepting an offer to become a missionary, I have now accepted the great journey of fundraising. As missionaries, we fundraise all of the money we need so that our housing, food, and travel expenses will be provided once I arrive in Denver. When people think of fundraising, they tend to shy away because they do not know where their money is going and how it will be put to use. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money raised on this account will allow me to serve the poor freely, while also being able to pay off student loans, cover personal expenses and basic needs! With your help, we can help change the culture of serving the poor and restoring their dignity that has been taken away. Any amount is welcomed! My goal is to raise $300 a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMathew 25\u003c/strong\u003e:34 Then the King will say to those on his right, \u2018Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, 36 I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.\u2019 37 Then the righteous will answer him, saying, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? 38 And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? 39 And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?\u2019 40 And the King will answer them, \u2018Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.\u2019"
