I like to make\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mikeypod.com\"\u003epodcasts\u003c/a\u003e and have been doing so since 2006. I like to cook vegan food and make weird videos about it on Snapchat and YouTube. I like to make solo theater pieces with all of these forms of media and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current stuff I am making is a book and album based on my original multi-media show called \u003cem\u003eThe Animal Show\u003c/em\u003e. It began as a collaboration with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tamerlainefarm.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTamerlaine Farm Animal Sanctuary\u003c/a\u003e in Montague, New Jersey where I served as their first ever artist-in residence. For an entire year, I traveled to the farm once a month and worked with the rescued animals with the goal of learning about them, and more about me, and thinking more carefully about how we humans regard animals. \u003cem\u003eThe Animal Show \u003c/em\u003eis a collection of stories, sound, music and video collected from and inspired by my time at Tamerlaine. On June 21, I will be releasing a book and album of music, stories and sounds from The Animal Show. This project is a co-creation with publisher/designer luke kurtis of bd-studios.com and the fine members of my Patreon community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like the stuff I create, please consider supporting its creation (and creator) with a monthly pledge to my Patreon.

     "about": "Brooklyn-based composer and performer Michael Harren combines elements of classical composition with experimental electronics and storytelling to create hypnotic and boldly intimate work that walks the line between Laurie Anderson, Peter Gabriel and Dead Can Dance.\u003cbr\u003eIn his solo show, \u003cem\u003eTentative Armor\u003c/em\u003e, he combined piano, synthesizers, various electronics, and live musicians with his unique storytelling, resulting in a deeply moving, highly entertaining performance. Through his resonant, powerful, very personal stories, Harren envelops the audience in a funny, poignant, highly intimate tour of his own self-discovery through spirituality, sexuality, and grief. Music, text and photos from the show were released in an album and book of the same name.\u003cbr\u003eMichael Harren has toured as pianist with Sandra Bernhard, is the musical director for Cabaret for a Cause, and has performed at Dixon Place, (le) poisson rouge, Joe\u2019s Pub, Judson Memorial Church, Manhattan Theater Source, The Duplex, Don\u2019t Tell Mama, The Laurie Beechman Theater as well as numerous venues around the country.\u003cbr\u003e",
