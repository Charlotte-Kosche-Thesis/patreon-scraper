    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI am a retired University Grant Administrator, who is finally living my dream of being a full-time, self-employed artist. I am fortunate enough to be in a co-op on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state where 6 artists share a space and take turns working 3 days a week, making art and selling it there. We all do something different so there is no conflict of interest. I love to draw and have become enamored with the concept of Zentangle-inspired art. It is putting a pen to paper without a sketch in mind and ending up with a lovely piece, something that comes from inside your mind....black pen on white paper or white pen on black paper....it is striking!! \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I also enjoy working with alcohol based ink. The colors of this medium are vibrant and the ink is so fun to work with. It can look like watercolor, or a gel, or oils, or any number of things when you work with it. I love the way it looks and it is very challenging. I feel like I have a long way to go before I consider myself very good at it.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I work with canvas and many different mediums as well as findings and make beautiful collages. This has become a real love and I\u0027ll be doing many of them here. I hope that you will enjoy them as much as I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have added an airbrush to my list of \"things to work with\" this year. My daughter gave me an airbrush for Christmas and I have played with it a couple of times and got a book on some ideas but really need to practice with it. I am hoping that you will help me feel more motivated to work with it more often! ~smile~\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

I always wanted to \"be an artist\", and now that I am doing what I love 24/7, I am finding that what I need the most is a web site. People are always asking me for my web site address. Many people who come through my studio are travelers and they can\u0027t purchase anything then, but would from my web site when they return home, or for someone\u0027s birthday or holiday, etc. I would be very appreciative for your help with this major need. I can\u0027t commit to this monthly expense on my own, but with your help it could become a reality. Thank you so much!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e",
