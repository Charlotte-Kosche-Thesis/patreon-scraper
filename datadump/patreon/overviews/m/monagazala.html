I run the Second Sight Project in Columbus, Ohio. What motivates me to get up every morning is passion. Passion to create, passion to build, passion bring attention to issues that matter. But passion won\u0027t fix a leaky tub, nor replace a busted window, nor pay an electric bill. That\u0027s where you, my Patreon friends, come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With your support, I can continue to \"fight the good fight\" for social justice and keep creating really relevant art that speaks to people and reaches people in ways that words cannot. At the same time, I have a wealth of behind-the-scenes stories of my life here in Franklinton, and stories of what motivates me to create, that I think will hold a lot of value for you; and I\u0027m excited to share them with you in exclusive Patreon updates!"

My current work\nfocuses on the struggle between progress and preservation in my Franklinton (Columbus,\nOhio) neighborhood, with particular focus on the long-abandoned Bellows School\nbuilding across the street from where I live. I use an archaeological aesthetic\nto draw parallels between discarded architectural elements from gutted/demolished\nbuildings and ancient artifacts from other civilizations; challenging viewers\nto think about how we assign value to urban structures, urban neighborhoods,\nand the people in under-served communities. My work also draws on imagery from\nmy own Palestinian heritage and blurs together those narratives that exist among\ndifferent displaced or marginalized peoples.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eMona Gazala is the founder of the Second Sight\nProject, an inner-city community-based arts organization that reclaims\nabandoned and disused homes for creative/community use. Gazala acts as an\nadvocate for the low-income residents of the neighborhood in the face of\naggressive gentrification efforts by the city and land-development interests.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
