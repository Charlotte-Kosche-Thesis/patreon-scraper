I\u0027m an artist that likes drawing my own cute characters, and I have a very strong penchant for soap bubbles - you\u0027ll see them almost everywhere in my art!\u00a0Aside from bubbles, I just generally like themes of flight, of comfort, of dreams and vibrant colors.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, until recently, I didn\u0027t think I was worthy of people\u0027s support... I used to be so scarce and scattered with my art - trying to live up to ridiculous productions standards for a few weeks, then being completely burnt out for the next few. I thought my art wasn\u0027t good at all either, and that I would seem like I was relying on my preffered themes too often as a crutch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut no -- I really, really like drawing beautiful and cute characters playing with bubbles. Not even i can take that away from myself. So here I am now ~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I would really, really like to thank all my friends, fans and patrons for putting up with me all these years in which I was a flimsy artist, and for continuing to love my work. Y\u0027all are the best ;-;"
