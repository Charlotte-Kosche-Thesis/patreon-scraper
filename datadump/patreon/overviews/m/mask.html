We are a subscriber-supported, ad-free online publication and podcast network. Our focus is lowbrow style and culture; we strive to be a platform for empowering struggle and solidarity across different places, scenes, and sentiments. We do so by covering the views and experiences of fellow antagonists in the form of interviews, personal narratives, style editorials, columns, reviews, cultural criticism and whatever else we feel like. We pay all contributors, as much as we can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen we launched in February 2014, we started from scratch. Today, our yearly audience comprises 750,000 people, we have published nearly 200 emerging writers, and recently founded a podcast network, \u003ca href=\"http://mask.fm/\"\u003emask.fm\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this with zero revenue from advertisements.\u00a0That\u0027s by design. We believe per-page-load advertisements are destroying the world of small publications, so we\u0027re experimenting with a different model.\u00a0To keep the magazine as accessible as possible, we sell subscriptions at a voluntary sliding scale with options of $3, $5, and $10 per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re at the top of the staircase, but the door is locked.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMost radical periodical projects don\u0027t make it this far. So far, we\u0027ve been able to sustain incremental growth by putting all subscription revenue back into the project \u2013 paying our contributing writers and artists, a handful of contributing editors, buying equipment, and covering publishing expenses. Even though we take this more seriously than any job we\u0027ve ever had, we don\u0027t pay ourselves. Instead, we work full-time jobs and sometimes finance Mask with our own money. We\u0027re at a bottleneck where we can\u0027t take full advantage of our positive reception because there are only so many hours in the day. That\u0027s where you come in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy supporting our magazine you can help us build the foundation for a self-sustaining media business. With your help, we can zoom out of the day-to-day race of running an \"always on\" website and think about where we\u0027re going and how we\u0027re going to get there.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFirst priority: Compensate Our Team\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinancially support the team behind Mask Magazine so we can keep going. Currently, our subscription revenue goes to paying our freelance writers and covering other publishing expenses. We don\u0027t pay ourselves for our work. We could change that. There\u0027s a lot of work to be done, and it\u0027s only feasible for us to do this work if we can compensate ourselves for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThanks for taking a moment to consider supporting our project, becoming a patron at any level would mean the world to us, and help us sustain this labor of love.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2013 Tyler Reinhard, Hanna Hurr, and Ripley Soprano, co-owners of Mask Magazine\u003c/em\u003e"
