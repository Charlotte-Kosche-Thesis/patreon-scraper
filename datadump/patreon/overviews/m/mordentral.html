Due to the monotony of coding for applications I took up Game systems / Modding and tools as a programming hobby a good 15 years ago to keep me grounded.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIts been a fun 15 years of working with various games and projects but I have settled down on UE4 plugins and resources now. UE4 is an amazing tool and is the perfect base for ongoing experimentation and modifications.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy current heavy focus is in the area of VR interactions and multiplayer, I run and update a tool suite / ongoing VR research plugin to attempt to integrate as much high end VR interactions into UE4 as possible. It is an ongoing project of mine that has ballooned past research project into a time consuming framework used by a growing base of developers to help them create their VR experiences, from games, to tools and corporate experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also currently maintain a secondary plugin that provides more advanced multiplayer sessions support to UE4 blueprints that has become popular and widely used over the past two years.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe plugins that I manage take up a lot of my free time providing support and updates to them, enough that I honestly can\u0027t entirely keep up with the requests for additional features and updates without sacrificing the majority of my free time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have a newborn, a baby \u003cdel\u003eon the way \u003c/del\u003e(now born!)\u00a0and a 12 year old, so fully giving up my time outside of work is out of the question.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have always fully believed in open source projects and have a hard time bringing myself to close off and sell my work because of this. However it has hit the point where maintaining everything as well as providing constant new features is difficult with a full time job.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal would be to get enough funding to be able to drop a few hours here and there with my day job in order to work on the plugins and not feel like I am not providing full support for my growing family.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I offer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCommunity driven development (with feature requests) on UE4 tools and plugins, as well as examples and tutorials for hard to grasp concepts that are requested of me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOngoing long term support and contact regarding the plugins and tools that I make\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGuidance on UE4 systems and best practices (as I see them) to the best of my abilities."
