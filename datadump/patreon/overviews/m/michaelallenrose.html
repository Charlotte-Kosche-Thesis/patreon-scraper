    "summary": "Hi! My name is Michael Allen Rose, and I\u0027m a Chicago based author, musician and performance artist. I\u0027ve worked in a variety of mediums, but the things I\u0027m most proud of and known for are probably my books, such as \u003cem\u003eParty Wolves In My Skull\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eEmbry: Hard Boiled\u003c/em\u003e from Eraserhead Press and \u003cem\u003eBoiled Americans\u003c/em\u003e from Bizarro Pulp Press. I make and perform industrial music under the name \u003cem\u003eFlood Damage,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0collaborate with other musicians such as the Slow Poisoner, and play in the Nine Inch Nails tribute band \u003cem\u003eNow I\u0027m Nothing\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eAs far as performance projects go, I\u0027m mostly interested in creating funny, crazy readings from my stories and books. I also occasionally work in the theatre as \u003cem\u003eRoShamBo\u003c/em\u003e, host the Ultimate Bizarro Showdown at the annual BizarroCon, and create burlesque with and without my partner Sauda Namir. It\u0027s incredibly fulfilling to play in so many sandboxes and connect with so many different artistic communities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see more of all the crazy stuff I do first-hand at my multi-media website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.gerbilprobe.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last decade or so, I\u0027ve been working my way up the corporate ladder in the real estate industry and working in compliance, but in February 2017, I lost my job unexpectedly. It\u0027s a little scary, and you can imagine how uncertain I felt about everything. I thought a lot about what I might do next, from substitute teaching to driving for a ride-share service, to freelancing as a copy editor or a production assistant. I may end up doing all of the above, trying to make ends meet, but what I really want to do is lean into the things I\u0027m passionate about. Things like my stories and songs and creative projects, and the things that fill my soul with happiness and fulfillment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t plan to leave corporate America, but I\u0027m looking at this as an opportunity instead of an obstacle. With the help of my friends, fans and community, I plan to put out a ton of new content. The plan is to live the artist\u0027s hustle without the stability of my 9-to-5!\u00a0I have so much crazy creative stuff I want to share with people, and I\u0027m very excited to connect with the folks who like what I do. Believe me, I understand how much it means if you contribute to my patreon. Your hard earned money means something, and all I can promise is that I remember the people who support me very dearly, and I plan to spoil you as much as possible with content and connectivity. It\u0027s time to embrace my art and change my life. With your help, together, we\u0027ll make art happen!"
