    "summary": "Hey moviegoers! Welcome to our Patreon account. First off, we want to thank you for visiting this page! We are a YouTube channel that provides commentaries in the form of movie reviews for new and old movies as well as break down trailers for upcoming movies. We are always trying to improve whether it be in terms of content, delivery or equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith your help through Patreon, we hope to accomplish the following:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eIncrease quality:\u003c/strong\u003e Creating content on a weekly, sometimes daily basis for YouTube comes at a cost and sacrifice as both of us work full time jobs. There are times that one of us may be late to work due to a video needing to be uploaded to YouTube. With your help, the burden of sacrificing quality for quantity will be lifted and we can provide higher quality and more quantity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. More Series: \u003c/strong\u003eAs our YouTube channel continues to grow, we want to branch off into more series than just movie reviews and trailer breakdowns. One idea is to have a series where Karen and Mike argue about movies to find out which is better. For example, Mike thinks Star Wars Episode 2 is better than Episode 1, and Karen thinks Star Wars Episode 1 is better than Episode 2. Anpther idea floating around is a movie trivia show similar to the Schomedown show on the Collider channel on YouTube. This will feature 2-4 competitors at a time competing to be the movie trivia champion. Yes, we know other channels are doing the same, but this one will be different, both in style and format. We also want to do more Top 10 videos, but these can sometimes get in the way of movie reviews and trailer breakdowns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider joining us in creating content for YouTube that entertains and explains. Thank you very much for reading all of this and thank you for considering supporting us through Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e"
