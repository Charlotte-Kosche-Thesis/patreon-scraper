    "summary": "Greetings beautiful people, First of all, thank you for finding me and my page. I\u0027m really excited about you joining my exclusive community of Patreons, where you will see inside the mind of a writer, me (be warned, it\u0027s not always pretty in there).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT ME\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello. I\u0027m Melanie. I\u0027m an author of Young Adult and middle grade fiction and dabble occasionally in painting.\u00a0I am originally from Australia, but moved to Scotland and then London over 10 years ago. I came here for 2 years, but was so inspired by this country, the landscape (urban and nature), that I stayed. I love Australia, it is wild and untamed, but in a different way than the UK. Here I think of faeries and sprites. I feel the trees talking to me when I walk in Greenwich Park (which has deer by the way - I\u0027m not sure if that excites you as much as it still excites me).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve published a short anthology of poems. I am in the process of editing the first book of my first \u00a0series and will be finishing the first book of my second series. I\u0027ll be publishing them on as e-books on amazon. I\u0027ve given myself a deadline to publish by 2 December and I need help to make this happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI quit my very full on job late last year, so I could write and it has made a difference, but I have burned through my savings and am working a number of different jobs to pay the rent. But that doesn\u0027t make the magic happen and it doesn\u0027t leave a great amount of time for the creator in me. My aim is to write full time and to be able to pay professional editors.\u00a0The story the author creates is just the beginning of the journey. There are so many steps to make a book publishable. Writing is my passion and there are children waiting for my stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love for you to join my exclusive community and come on the journey with me. In return for your patronage, \u00a0I\u0027ll give access into the writing process and you can see the world through my eyes as I become inspired. Where I get my ideas from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome find faery hills with me, explore the streets of London and Scotland and help me come up with names of characters. I want you to also see what sparks my attention and the ideas that I put away for later (there is always an idea). Have exclusive access to my process. My doodles. My scratchings as I explore a character and a chapter. Come explore the world of my characters and stories with me and help me make them come alive. I would love for you to help make this happen. So I can publish these stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcerpt from the White Willow:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoo, Jake and Jilly about to enter the fae lands......\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe three of them looked at the entrance to the dark tunnel. Graffiti claimed every inch of its concrete walls, no light entered or exited. As if all the light was sucked into the tunnel and what oozed out was darkness. It was a void and where they needed to go to find the entrance to the fae lands. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cIs there another way in?\u201d swallowed Roo. She tightened the jumper around her waist wishing that the knowing would tell her something, anything, but it stayed annoyingly quiet. The tunnel looked like a thick cloud of black smoke, something she could almost touch. She really didn\u0027t want to go in there.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoo is in the Forest of Sighs and is learning that the trees do have a heart. Luke tells her how the spirit of a tree in fae land in born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cA spirit is born. It chooses the ground that it wants to grow in and then inserts itself in the ground. The tree then starts to bloom out of the ground and that\u0027s where it stays. It\u0027s roots connects with the trees around it and it becomes part of the forest.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThat\u0027s beautiful,\u201d said Roo looking at the trees more closely pondering if each of the spirits were unique, what did they feel, what did they see. She reached out to the tree closest to her and placed her hand gently on the bark, not sure what she was expecting to feel. It took her a moment to realise what the sound in her ears were. \u201cThump. Thump. Thump.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u201cIt has a heartbeat,\u201d whispered Roo in awe. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
