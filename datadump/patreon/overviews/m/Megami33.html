    "summary": "Welcome peeps! My\nname is Corinne Sudberg! I go by Megami33 on Youtube! I\u0027m a parody\nmaker, voice actress and I also make English adaptations of\nanime/video game songs! Some of my most popular covers include Alola\n(Pokemon Sun \u0026amp; Moon) and Boogie Back (Dragon Ball Super)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lQgt6Po.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon helps\nsupport artists, entertainers and more (especially those on Youtube\nlike me) to continue creating quality content by donations people can\ncontribute through here. You can choose to pledge any amount you\u0027d\nlike per song/video ($1, $5, etc) and in return, you will get some\nawesome rewards for your help! You will be charged once a month and\ncan set a limit of how much you\u0027re donating, no matter how many\nsongs/videos I post. You can read more on what it means to be a\nPatron and what Patreon is all about here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq\"\u003ehttp://www.patreon.com/faq\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AHxTVjf.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making\nYouTube videos since 2006. I started out by making song covers and\nalso Sailor Moon Abridged! Since then, I can be heard among various\nNew Media, indie games, animations and more! I\u0027m also part of Team\nFour Star, providing some voices for DBZA, Hellsing Ultimate and FF7:\nMachinabridged! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYouTube has always\nbeen a part of my life and has helped me to express myself in many\nways. I learn how to edit, sound mix, voice act and more because I\nwanted to be involved with entertaining people. With new advancements\nadded each year, making videos takes a lot of time, effort, sacrifice\nand of course, money. I\u0027ve only been able to make videos part time,\nbut I hope to eventually make this my full time job so I can make\namazing, quality covers for you. There\u0027s lots of songs I love to sing\nand with your support on Patreon, I\u0027ll be able to raise enough to\nhire more mixers, musicians and even animators! It would also help\nfund future projects like full version covers, original songs, parody\nskits, reviews and eventually maybe animated music videos! The sky is\nthe limit! I hope you can join in helping me make this big step in my\nlife! I want us to reach for the stars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate all the\nsupport and love I\u0027ve gotten throughout the years, whether through my\nown content or with TFS. Any donation, no matter how small, will help\nin the long run. I love entertaining people and I am grateful that I\nam able to do so, especially through music. I wouldn\u0027t be able to get\nas far as I did without all of you. Whether you donate, share this\npage or just watch my stuff in general, I just wish to thank you all!\n\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/5VZnkkF.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
