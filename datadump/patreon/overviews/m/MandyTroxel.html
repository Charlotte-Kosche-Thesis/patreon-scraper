    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI love to write songs.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/em\u003ePages and pages of song lyric chickenscratch\nlitters my counters, the kitchen table, the couch. Hank Williams said once that\nif a song can\u0027t be written in 45 minutes, it\u0027s not worth writing. Well, I\u0027m no\nHank Williams. If I can get a song written in 45 minutes, I\u0027m pretty sure it\nstinks (although sometimes I\u0027m pleasantly surprised). But usually, in the end, I\u0027ve got a\nlittle songbaby to send forth into the world, and I\u0027m as proud of it as any new\nparent. It\u0027s a little miracle every time. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nBut songwriting is an inconvenient calling.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I love this\nstory about  Tom Waits -- he\u0027s driving\nalong the LA freeway, wrestling with traffic, running late, and the muse swoops\ndown and drops a song into his head. And he\u0027s frustrated, grumbling \"Can\u0027t\nyou see I\u0027m driving?!\". \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is the universal pain-in-the-butt truth about\nsongwriting - it requires your full attention. It doesn\u0027t care if there are\ndishes in the sink, a work deadline looming, bills to be paid, kids to be fed. In\nmy life, I\u0027m spinning a hundred plates, scrambling in the effort to make ends meet.\nAllowing myself to set things aside and write is accompanied by a real\nundercurrent of worry. But I think that there\u0027s a balance in meeting the day to\nday necessities while also nurturing a deeper calling.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe\u0027ve all heard the phrase \"It takes a village to raise\na child\". Perhaps that applies to song-babies too. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEnter Patreon. Here\u2019s how it works:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou subscribe to my Patreon site on a \u201cper song\u201d basis. You choose an amount you would like to pay \u201cper song\u201d, and then are billed each month based on how many songs I uploaded during that time period. Just so\u2019s you know, my goal is one song a month. If I really go crazy, I\u2019ll manage two a month. If I don\u2019t upload any songs, you don\u2019t pay a thing. Or, if I pull a fast one on you and upload 10, you can put a cap on your amount so your account isn\u2019t billed more than you would like. Patreon makes all this very easy, walking you through it as you sign up.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSongs will be (usually) demos, which right now means just me and my guitar singing into my phone. Once I meet my first goal towards better recording equipment, I\u2019ll be able to record songs with background vocals and further instrumentation. But really, the goal here is to introduce us all to each song in its barest form, which is usually the best way to hear what it has to say.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDifferent amounts give you different rewards. I\u2019m catering this Patreon page to be specifically about songwriting, and the rewards reflect various depths into the world of how I write songs. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne of the things you\u2019ll be hearing most from me on this Patreon page is gratitude. Thank you so much for your presence and support in my songwriting and music-making. Your investment in my work is an honor and a motivator. Let\u2019s see what happens!"
