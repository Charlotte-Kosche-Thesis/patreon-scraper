Menla\u0027s mission is to offer a \nworld-class spa and integrated healing system, combining the best of \nWestern integrative medicine with elements of Tibetan medicine, \nAyurveda, and other holistic traditions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA non-profit called the Aesclepius Foundation purchased the land and \nstarted to renovate and upgrade the buildings with the intent of \ncreating a healing center, modeled after an ancient Greek healing \ntradition. People with illnesses would travel to the Isle of Delos in \nthe Mediterranean, hoping to have a dream of Aesclepius, the Greek god \nof Healing. In that dream, he would appear to them and reveal both the \nroot causes of their illness and the cure. Phase One (of three) of the \nrenovations was complete when the patrons of the Foundation very \ngenerously decided to donate the property to Tibet House, US in 2002 \nwith the understanding that it would continue to be a healing center."
