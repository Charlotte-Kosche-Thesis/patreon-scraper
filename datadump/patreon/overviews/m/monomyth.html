I\u2019ve been working as a freelance character designer for the past several years and it\u2019s been overwhelming to me to see the kind of community that the animation industry attracts. It\u2019s full of good, kind, excited people who are passionate about the art form. This page is a way for you to show your support for what I\u2019m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond creating characters for clients, I have several projects that I\u2019m excited to develop and get out into the world. As patrons, you\u2019ll be part of the community of people who know about those projects and get access to content that others simply won\u2019t have for a while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe project I\u2019m currently working on is called \u003cem\u003eMONOMYTH\u003c/em\u003e, which you can read about below.\u00a0It\u0027s been overwhelming to see the support that \u003cem\u003eMONOMYTH\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0has received over the years, and it\u0027s incredibly gratifying to see people coming together to help make it a reality.

In the short, a man named Erasmus works his way through the gods\u0027 most secure prison in order to free one prisoner: Prometheus, the Titan whom Erasmus hopes will help him in a grand quest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT THE WORLD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eImagine a world where all ancient mythologies are real. The gods of every culture are looking down on the world with cold, calculating eyes, using the people of the world to their own advantage like pieces in a game. What must that be like for an average person like you or me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gods are all-powerful, and they\u0027re as different from one another as the people of earth. And because the gods are also all-seeing, they can look down at the world as a chessboard to manipulate however they wish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe heroes of the story go on a dangerous quest to gather three relics that will hide the world from the ever watchful eyes of the gods. The heroes are opposed by everything from ninjas, monsters, and Titans, to the gods themselves; but this small group of characters ultimately proves that the spirit of mankind--the spirit of freedom--is one that will never be defeated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"MONOMYTH\" is a story that I\u0027ve been working on for several years. The idea has grown and evolved to become something that I believe will be a powerful story when it\u0027s brought to life in the right way. An animated series would be the ideal format to tell it in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT THE CHARACTERS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAURECH\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- Aurech is half frost giant and half Norse god.
