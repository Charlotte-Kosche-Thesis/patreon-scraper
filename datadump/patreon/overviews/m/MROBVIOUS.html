In a world where free speech is under attack and society finds itself lost, I hope to fight the good fight and help make a difference.

You have my thanks, I hope to create many more keys to a better world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI give thanks to all of my patrons and everyone who contributes. Platforms like YouTube routinely demonetize my videos. I have plans to expand my content. Such as crafting a mask and fabricating an outfit, which I will wear for live action content. With crowdfunding such projects will become possible. I will also be able to make more content and get better equipment. If you become a Patron and connect your discord account to your Patreon account you will also get an automated invitation to \"Fight Club.\" (patron exclusive discord server)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank everyone for supporting my work and tuning in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
