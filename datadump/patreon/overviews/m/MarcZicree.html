    "summary": "We\u0027re creating something new and wonderful thanks to the amazing support of generous people like you! SPACE COMMAND is a new science fiction franchise I created to tell the kind of stories I knew fans wanted to see and weren\u0027t available anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stories follow the adventures of the United Planet\u2019s Space Command, a dedicated group of scientists, soldiers and adventurers exploring the solar system. The series is reminiscent of the space operas of the golden age of science fiction that had an optimistic future and a belief in mankind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSPACE COMMAND set a record on Kickstarter and received worldwide press attention, including stories in VARIETY and THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.  It has attracted an unprecedented collaboration of talent from Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5 and Doctor Who. The US Air Force has offered production support. Through all of this we\u0027ve maintained our independence and commitment to high quality. That\u0027s only been possible because people believe in this project, and support Space Command in any way they can, from money to space ship parts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution goes into making the episodes, from digital artists to color grading to epic music. We\u0027re in post-production and it looks amazing! We need to finish the first show, and I need to finish writing the first six films. I already have scripts, the series bible, and outlines for the grand design!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can pledge your support for as long as you\u0027d like. If you need to pause, you\u0027ll always be welcome back.\u003cbr\u003e"
