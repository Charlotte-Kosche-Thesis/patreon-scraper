    "summary": "We\u0027ve been producing podcasts since 2009, and audio content long before then. But this is \u003ca href=\"http://guidetothewhoverse.libsyn.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMostly Harmless Cutaway\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, probably one of the most unique \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e podcasts in the galaxy. Like others, we cover new series episodes of \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e and occasionally record episode commentaries plus other fun things. But that\u0027s about all we share with other \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e podcasts. What makes us different are our contributors, our personalities, and our style. Not so much a by-the-numbers reviews, as much as a conversation. And we don\u0027t say this lightly: you\u0027d be very hard-pressed to find a more diverse \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e Podcast anywhere. Try to think of a perspective and somehow it is covered by either the main hosts (Eric, Josh, and Cat) or by our frequent regulars, who themselves are all members of other \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e podcasts you\u0027re probably aware of. Raised on classic, teeth cut on new, people of (many) colors, female, gay, chosen, east coast, west coast, gulf coast, down under, arctic circle, across the sea... you get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re looking for passion, you\u0027ve come to the right place. We get into deep thoughts, deep feelings, couched in deep understanding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContent on our podcast feed can sometimes vary wildly. There are the core episodes, but there are extra cutbits, question-mark eps, mini shows done on the fly, and other archival oddities. This Patreon acct will be set up so that only core \u003cem\u003eMHC\u003c/em\u003e episodes are added to the pledge count. Consider all the rest of our content as SWAG.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMHC\u003c/em\u003e has been running since 2010 completely free of cost to the listeners. \u003cem\u003eMHC\u003c/em\u003e will continue to run indefinitely, free of cost to the listeners. But for those who\u0027d like to lend a little bit of extra assistance, here is your opportunity. Patrons\u0027 support will primarily go to feed fees. Simply meeting operating costs alone would make the producer extremely happy.\u003cbr\u003e"
