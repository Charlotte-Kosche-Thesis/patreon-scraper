    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI love everything about video games and want to spend my time supporting, researching, and creating them. You are my chance.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been lucky enough to work with other game developers and programmers as a graphic artist and designer on several games and assets. I\u0027ve contributed to the visual design of everything from branding for AI programming assets to interfaces for medical games designed to teach incoming anesthesiologists how to properly perform on liver transplant patients. In my spare time I\u0027ve created many game prototypes and tools, like \u003ca href=\"http://www.metkis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGAMEBRIEF\u003c/a\u003e that help developers focus their game development based on principles in graphic design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent the last two years learning about IDEs and designing prototypes while trying to support other independent developers. I want to keep doing that, but I also want to do more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had a lot of luck because of the kind people around me. I want to spread that while creating the content I would like to see in the gaming space and feel is woefully missing. This includes games that I want to exist, assets for game creation, media surrounding the kinds of people that make games, tools that help others learn about games and help create them, and community-oriented projects like my game jam \u003ca href=\"http://itch.io/jam/nar8-jam\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNar8\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy being a patron you get first access to news updates about my projects, the patron-only feed, sometimes exclusive assets or access to prototypes, and you help me spend my time supporting others that are interested in game development and games. I\u0027ve also previously made some game assets available royalty-free, and I would likely do so with more in the future. Overall, I want everyone to get access to what I\u0027m making, so the lion-share of content you help fund will be available for everyone, unless it\u0027s paid content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere will the funds go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunds will go to any software, hardware, hosting, or otherwise needed to develop games, assets, tutorials, or otherwise. It goes to making a life spent on video game content more feasible and hopefully someday sustainable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Words\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrowd-funding is a new world for me. Patreon is a solution that I hope to one day no longer need. Even if you don\u0027t support me,thank you for taking the time to read about my work and the work I hope to create. Without the community\u0027s continued support and acceptance, I would never have gotten this far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
