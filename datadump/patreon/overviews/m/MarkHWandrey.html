You are the reason I have had any success at all, and you help me to pay my bills so I can write more books. \u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who don\u0027t know me, I\u0027ve been a writer all my life. It has taken me a long time, but I\u0027ve reached the level of skill where I get exceptional reviews, and my fans can\u0027t wait for more, but I barely have time to write. I just pray for the time and freedom to pursue my art with the years that I have left. I have a nearly-grown son and am married, but my wife is ill and cannot contribute much. Your kind monthly donation can see me to my goal of writing for a living, and in exchange you will get first looks at the incredible sci-fi that I produce! I\u0027ll also populate my worlds with a tapestry of characters using your names, towns, and suggestions as time goes by. Please help my dream come true? Thank you for taking the time to look at my story and I hope to get to know you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

I have had some success over the last few years, and am now at the point where I would like to quit the day job and just write. Your support will help me to worry less about the everyday bills and at the same time to write more books. I am married and have a nearly-grown son who is mosly self-supporting, but my wife has an auto-immune issue and cannot work a normal job, so she runs a small sewing business from our home. However, her business isn\u0027t yet at the point where she makes enough to contribute much to our support.\u00a0",
