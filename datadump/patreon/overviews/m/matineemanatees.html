(To be clear: we endorse them, they do not endorse us.)\u00a0 Because, you know, why not?\u00a0 We all do what we want, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA note on Donor Rewards: donor rewards for podcasts tend to involve withholding a certain amount of content from everyone but donors, and we\u0027d really rather everyone who wants to listen be able to.\u00a0 But we do plan on doing listener request episodes, and donors would be empowered to suggest and vote on movies for future episodes.\u00a0 We also plan to distribute any gifts that we receive from conservation charities to top donors.\u00a0 And, finally, any new donor who requests it will receive a shout-out on the show, and new donors at higher levels will be able to request short messages to be read on their behalf.\u00a0 Whether you\u0027d like to use this as an advertisement, a message to loved ones who also listen, or just an inspiring quote, it\u0027s up to you. Just, nothing likely to offend other listeners, you know?\u00a0 We\u0027ll talk if there\u0027s a problem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for helping us continue this ridiculous project we like so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e... I love you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-The Matinee Manatees\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttp://www.matineemanatees.com/"
