I want to share the wonderfulness of them and the happiness that is given back to me with the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFull story:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eIn the days of my deepest depression in the past year, Tom set up a bird feeder outside our bedroom window. Everyday house finches, titmice, house sparrows and pigeons would come and feed on seeds I provide. They brought me joy, life, and inspiration that helped with my recovery.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThen it came our anniversary. After discussion, we brought Kiwi home, and it made such a huge difference of my life. Before, I couldn\u0027t get up until I have to, but after, I couldn\u0027t wait to get up and take care of her; before, I couldn\u0027t sleep because I feared passing another day without accomplishment, but after, I had to because otherwise the light and noises would disrupt my little birdie baby\u0027s sleep schedule. Kiwi made me smile with her cheerful demeanor and acrobatic moves. She likes to be on our shoulder and our head wherever we go. Kiwi loves to watch the wild flocks that come to us; sometimes for hours at a time...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s when I realized Kiwi need a friend.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn 8/6/2017, Kiwi, Tom, and I made a trip down to Stamford, CT, and we brought Honey home. Kiwi and Honey took to each other immediately. Despite being of different species, they appear extremely friendly with each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m making recovery from my depression, accompanied by my wonderful family. I hope my story would inspire someone out there, and Kiwi and Honey\u0027s cheerfulness can be spread to the world. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease support my Patreon, to give Kiwi and Honey an ever better living condition, and to give me encourage me to create more content.\u00a0Your contribution will go to building a better life for Kiwi and Honey, as well as camera, video-editing software, craft and art supplies with which I will create pieces of cards and arts that are inspired by our happy life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJialu\u003cbr\u003e8/11/2017\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
