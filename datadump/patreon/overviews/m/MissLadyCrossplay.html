I\u0027m an avid crossplaying girl that enjoys working with her hands and isn\u0027t afraid to get dirty. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOf course, I started with the basics.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI started cosplaying in 2010 when I became involved with Stephenie Meyer Day, now referred to as Forever Twilight in Forks \u2013 the biggest \u003cem\u003eTwiligh\u003c/em\u003et fan convention in the world. Since then, I\u0027ve been invited back every year as a special guest to portray Bella Swan and participate in panels. \u003cbr\u003e\nFrom this massive fan community, I\u0027ve met so many passionate cosplayers with the most incredible talents and stories to tell. Thanks to them, I expanded my knowledge on the culture and basically hit the ground running. \u003cbr\u003e\nFrom there, I became a \u003cstrong\u003eprop smith\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003earmorist\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eseamstress\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 put tools in my hands and I will create something with them! \u003cbr\u003e\nAnd then\u2026 I fell in love with crossplay. By accident, really.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWait \u2013 what \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e crossplay?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCrossplay is\u2026 well, crossdressing cosplay! Basically, it\u0027s a type of cosplay where you dress up as a character of a different gender. My first crossplay ever was \u003cstrong\u003eHarry Potter\u003c/strong\u003e, which I put together on a whim for a midnight showing of \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect was this: crossplaying Harry Potter lit such a passion within my creative soul that I had to keep going. \u003cbr\u003e\nAnd I have been. Since then, I\u2019ve crossplayed Levi from Attack on Titan, Kirito from Sword Art Online, Qrow from RWBY and more, with plans to crossplay Bakugou from My Hero Academia in future. \u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve also been producing a lot of super cool work, whether it be weapons and armor, costumes, or both. The support I get from fellow fans on social media is incredible, and I want to continue to keep giving everyone great quality work that will only continue to improve! In addition to producing more cosplay photos, I plan to create DIY videos, work-in-progress videos, con and cosplay music videos, all of which I may not be able to do on my own. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWith that being said, this page is a tip jar! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you love the work I create and want to donate \u2013 and cash in on some sweet perks \u2013 to help me make even more and really take it to the next level, thank you! If not, that\u2019s totally cool too! I appreciate your interest in my work and your support on social media! \u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much! It\u0027s because of all of you I can continue to create, learn, grow, and maybe even inspire someone else to do something incredible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fbed1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12687879_976715365755986_4822412286884046588_n.jpg?oh=f29ef5d06c2e7b0064553aefd942d755\u0026amp;oe=5A5429A7\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
