Manitoba Hal makes music with a ukulele like no other taking his audience from the deep south to the islands with songs that are mournful, hopeful, silly, romantic and introspective. He proves that the uke can be small but mighty as he pulls out powerful blues riffs and melodies adding subtle but important background beats with looping technology showcasing his extraordinary ukulele strumming and riffing. Many wouldn\u2019t associate the ukulele as a blues instrument, but Hal takes out all the hula, leaving only room for deep blues to prevail. Hal\u2019s own blues tunes breathe with hints of cajun, rock, gospel, and folk. He is influenced by artists like Robert Johnson, Taj Mahal, Keb Mo, Colin Linden, and Big Dave Mclean.\u003cbr\u003e",
