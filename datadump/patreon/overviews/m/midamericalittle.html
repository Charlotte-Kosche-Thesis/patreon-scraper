I would love nothing more then to be able review them all and let you know what diapers are the best or the meh. Considering that most sample packs are $20, I think that this should be a monthly goal and funds used strictly for diapers to review.\u00a0\u00a0With your help, I can weed out the subpar products and leave every Little out in our world padded properly with the better nappy =)",

They prevent you from watching my content right away. With YouTube constricting the adsense policy (how big YouTubers make money) which in turn makes it impossible for my channel to make any adsense revenue. The revenue I could earn would and has always been invested in the channel. But, with the most recent Adsense Policy Changes I\u0027ve decided that I\u0027ll be demonitizing all videos on my channel so that you won\u0027t be bothered with another add again! Once I meet this goal of $100 monthly I\u0027ll permanently disable all adds across my channel. Giving you unhindered and instant access to all my videos with out ever having to watch another add ever again!\u003cbr\u003e",
