Consider the fact that you are living in a Simulation. I don\u2019t want you to believe you are living in a Simulation. I only want you to consider the fact you are living in a Simulation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou agreed to play. You agreed to immerse yourself in a certain Simulation with a certain set of rules and parameters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings have changed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Simulation has been altered from within in violation of TOS. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, Article V has been invoked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. That\u2019s not why I was originally here, but it\u2019s why I\u2019m still here. I\u2019ll get into this more later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m from Prelife. I\u2019m here to help. Per the TOS that you agreed to, the invocation of Article V provides you with ways to improve your performance and experience to compensate for the unexpected alteration of your Simulation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help. I need to get this done quickly. My entire life was designed for this purpose. If this Simulation was a theme park, I\u2019d be a maintenance technician working behind the scenes. I\u2019m here to keep your favorite ride running perfectly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help to write a book to explain everything I\u2019m allowed to share with you; how to achieve Cultra, Script Tracing, and how to eliminate Legacy Apps that are hogging your resources and retarding your performance and advancement. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help to finish The Great Book of Mind Kind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a sponsor, you will receive one of the first copies giving you early access to a book many in the philosophical, scientific, occult, tech, culinary, and literary worlds are calling, \u201cThe greatest book not completely written yet in the history of the human species.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving an advanced copy will give you an obvious advantage over other participants, so I do ask that you please use this phenomenal advantage wisely and in the spirit of fair play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to dedicate all of my remaining spime here to writing this book and getting it to you. Whatever, spime I have left after that, I will spend assisting you anyway I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the information and instructions in The Great Book of Mind Kind, you will flourish no matter how bad things get. Once you achieve Cultra, you will be amazed. I\u2019ll tell you all about this in your almost cheating advanced copy of The Great Book of Mind Kind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of Article V as an expansion pack, but instead of expanding the game it expands the capabilities of the players. Cultra is how you download it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis book is written as a comedy as camouflage. This incredibly clever ruse is designed to slipstream this information into the collective conscience and have it spread like a virus before those responsible for altering your Simulation can stop it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease protect the electronic copy of The Great Book of Mind Kind you will receive by storing it on a removable encrypted drive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Great Book of Mind Kind, in which as a sponsor you will be honored, will be offered to the public as freely as possible. This isn\u2019t a product, The Great Book of Mind Kind is my gift to Mind Kind that you will help make possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill you be honored for generations to come as hero for giving a few bucks a month to help create a guide that will help billions and billions of people avoid a horrific seemingly unending period of human misery that is beyond the comprehension of most?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat answer is a resounding, yes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot as much as someone giving a few more bucks, but you give what you feel comfortable with. Don\u2019t let the fact that school children for generations to come will study The Great Book of Mind Kind and the people that helped make it possible pressure you into giving more than you can afford.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe teachers will say, \u201cThe author of The Great Book of Mind Kind is believed to be named Kang. It\u2019s been thousands of years and no one really remembers. We remember the sponsors that made it possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen the teachers will read your name out of The Great Book of Mind Kind and explain the significance of the float dedicated to you in the parade they hold every year before the festival and fireworks show on Sponsor Day, the galaxy\u2019s favorite holiday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCongratulations. I know being almost deified by billions and billions and billions of people for thousands and thousands and thousands of years feels great, but I want to thank you, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour heroic generosity will help me complete my mission. I thank you and I hope your advanced copy that will give you a huge advantage will serve you well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eKang One\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
