    "summary": "My name is Moomal Munir Soomro,\u00a0I am a self-taught freelance Illustrator and coloring book author currently living in Karachi, Pakistan. I love video games, drawing, singing and Italian food. I also have obsession with cartoon movies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI joined Patreon as an opportunity to fund my personal artwork, which will prevent me from joining the 9 - 5 pm crowd and be my own boss. It will also give me inspiration and motivation to update my social media with art and brand new projects, also to connect with you through blogs, live streaming, videos and exclusive Work In Progresses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support allows me to focus on coming out with 2nd volumes of my Coloring books like \u003cstrong\u003e\"MIniDalas\" \u003c/strong\u003eand\u003cstrong\u003e \"StarLight Fairies\". \u003c/strong\u003eAnd other projects, collaborations, and all the other ideas that are ready to come out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a self-employed artist, most of my time is spent in looking for freelance projects, job searching and self-marketing. Sadly it leaves a very little time to work on my own projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your I will not only be able to spare more time to my coloring books, I will also have enough to have them printed on a better quality pages as well as buy better equipment for editing and recording. Also to buy important art supplies for tutorials, pay website fees, and best of all, I will be able to give my full time to creating more art for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20); background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eIf you are brand new to the world of Patreon - Welcome! Follow \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH-IDF809fQ\"\u003ethis link\u003c/a\u003e for a really handy video explaining how it all works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, Patreon is a crowdfunding tool a lot like Kickstarter. The main difference being that, rather than funding one large project that has a set financial amount as its end goal, you are subscribing to help fund a creator to create artwork and projects on a regular basis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron you are also gaining access to a number of perks and rewards; not to mention the warm, happy knowledge that you are regularly contributing to helping an artist create brand new work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhat would the patrons get?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eIf you like my artwork and would like to support me to create even more and frequently, or you would like to gain access to the \u003cstrong\u003ePatron-Only \u003c/strong\u003eposts which will include exclusive Patron only content that you will not find on any other social media platform such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy music\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOnline Live Streaming\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWork in Progresses (Drawings)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWork on current projects\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBehind the scenes (including bloopers)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll you have to do is become a patron and choose how much would like to help with per month (even $1 gets you something in return).
