    "summary": "Hey\ny\u0027all, thanks for supporting the arts, and more specifically, thanks\nfor supporting my writing.  About six years ago, it became\npretty clear to me that the 9-5 lifestyle didn\u0027t work for me, or I\ndidn\u0027t fit into it, or we were somehow mismatched.  Since this\nrealization, i\u0027ve devoted myself to writing and doing volunteer work,\nin researching alternative ways of living with the land and living in\ncommunity with other humans, and trying to create an alternative reality that takes care of the life cradled in this big blue planet.  I live a pretty unconventional\nlifestyle and want to document my travels, my thoughts, my poetry,\nand create how to guides for folks who want to live alternative\nlifestyles. My life\u0027s work is championing the message \"YOU MATTER\" to folks who feel like they don\u0027t. \u00a0You matter. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost\nof my work is compiled in Do It Yourself style collaged zines that i\nmake by hand.  I still use glue and scissors and distribute my\nwork myself.  I love zines and am attached to having a physical\nthing to hold while i read.  In today\u0027s reality, having\nsomething to hold on to, both literally and figuratively, is becoming\nincreasingly rare and increasingly more crucial for more and more\nhumans.  My adamance about printed books has been mediated by\nthe death of trees used to make paper, and a reluctant embrace of the\ntechnological era.  The ideas I am grappling with run the gambit from\nbuilding community, to rewilding, to systemic racism and oppression,\nto how capitalism has failed the single mom, how to make medicine\navailable to the people, and how to survive in an increasingly toxic\nand uncaring world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am interested in having uncomfortable\nconversations, in questioning my privilege, in co creating a culture\nwhere we can take feedback and call in radical change.  The way of\nlife we have been handed as \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201ccorrect\u201d is\nrelatively new in the grand scheme of human history, and it doesn\u0027t\nwork for me.  The more folks I talk to about this, the more I\nrealize, it doesn\u0027t work for most of us.  The way we live is\nstressful, isolating, and counterintuitive to our very human nature. \nSo what do we do? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am about to be thirty. \u00a0I\u0027ve lived a lot of different lives. \u00a0I\u0027ve hitchhiked around meeting humans from all walks of life. \u00a0I\u0027ve lived under a tarp in the national forest, in a tent in someone\u0027s yard, in collapsing abandoned shacks, in sheds, in a van, a truck, and slept in all sorts of sketchy places. \u00a0I was an academic and studied in institutions of intellectual pursuit, I stayed up until four am arguing about Marx and Derrida, i screamed poems into the sky on rooftops in alphabet city. \u00a0I toured the country performing and teaching writing workshops. \u00a0I ran an underground press, hosted literary salons and open mics. \u00a0I don\u0027t ever want to stare death in the eyes and wish i had done more, done differently, taken that risk... \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy whole life i\u0027ve been a bit... well, different. \nI have opinions, and big ideas, and I value humans over the almighty\ndollar.  I am trying to get more comfortable with valuing the work I\ndo in the world, the healing I facilitate, the skillshares and\nwriting groups and workshops.  I am trying to come back toward the\nmiddle now that I have found yet another extreme (no income! No home!\nNo participation in anything that at all harms any human or\ncontributes to suffering and oppression!  As it turns out, completely\ndisengaging isn\u0027t possible, and also means disengaging from some very\npositive aspects of normative life...). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\nfound my home, my solace, my temple, in books and art, in the words\nof people who were thousands of miles away, or hundreds of years dead\nand gone.  Life rafts can look a lot of ways, and over the years\nI have gotten a lot of feedback about what my words have done for\nfolks.  We never know the far reaching impact our words and\nactions can have, but I know whose writing I clutched to my chest in\ntears, and I know what this connection has spared me from. I\nhave been asked to engage in the technological world so my writing,\nphotography, and the chronicling of my adventures is available to\nmore folks.  So, I am going to start a new blog with more travel writing, poetry, prose, rants, photography, and inspiration. My zines will\nbe available electronically, on this blog, as well as in print, and I am going to\nchronicle the next chapter in this crazy adventure. \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn\nbecoming my Patron you do a lot more than support my art work, my\nphotography, my drawings, my writing and rants.  You provide a\ndissident voice to the mainstream propaganda that tells us, in every\nimaginable way, that we don\u0027t matter, that we are alone.  When\nyou become my Patron, you say, \"yeah, i think this idealistic\nweirdo should spend the majority of their waking life volunteering\nwith children who\u0027ve been labelled \"at risk\", and yes, they\nshould continue to fundraise to help single moms, and yeah, i think\nproviding free counseling to survivors of assault and other violent\ncrimes is more dire than some dead end job at a fast food joint.\"\n When you support me, you cast a vote that says art matters.\n Writing matters.  The expression of love and anger and\nhope and dissatisfaction and heartbreak and beauty that erupts out of\nme, matters.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks\nfor stopping by my page!\u003c/p\u003e"

     "about": "Boots is twenty-nine for a few more months. They grew up in the suburbs of New York City, briefly attended art school after graduating high school, then went on to get three degrees in literature, creative writing, and rhetoric. They spent a summer at Cambridge University studying poetry, and after earning their Masters they got to design their own college course. Studying political discourse and literary theory in the institutions of intellectual pursuit lead them to the conclusion that they must disengage from the disciplinary systems at play. They are a J of all trades; the past few years they\u0027ve been moving closer and closer to what their ideology tells them is how they should live. They split fire wood, build things, educate folk, do manual labor, dissect the gender binary, dismantle patriarchy, host workshops, edit, paint, garden, work trade for gatherings and festivals to eliminate the paper money middle person, hitchhike and ride their bike, live in their van; they barter and collaborate. They are a teacher and an activist, an artist and a mediator, a healer and a writer. They are a part of the communities movement, the radical self reliance counter culture, they hold themself accountable for their actions and inactions, and believe in the positive potential of destruction and collapse. They had a rough go of it in their earlier years and have a soft spot for all things damaged. They refuse to contribute to systems of oppression and the suffering of humanity rubs them raw at every turn. Incapable of hardening against the cruelty of the world, they\u0027ve made it their life\u0027s mission to alleviate it as much as a human is capable of in their short lifetime. They volunteer, work with kids, explain to other white people how racism is a systemic oppressive force, and think fierce love is revolutionary. They moved into the woods a little over four years ago to live in an Ecovillage in the mountains of western North Carolina and heal wounds they didn\u0027t know they had. They felt like a magnet in their chest was about to rip them open, like a homing device was somewhere and summoning, so they moved out of their hut and bought a van. Now they follow the magnet, the compass that points to some unfathomably wonderful life. They refuse to make plans, and refuse to make decisions from a place of pain, fear, or emotional poverty. They have no money, no job, no four walled domicile to call home, and they\u0027ve never been happier. They have family all over the world and places that feel like home. They cry when they need release, dance their butt off, sing when things get dark and overwhelming, and read poems out loud in a way that makes everyone drop what they\u0027re doing and sit in a circle around them. They refuse to accept the world in its hopeless broken state. They are a vulgar, crass, beautiful little punk who hits the ground running and is getting more and more comfortable with being a potent catalyst.",
