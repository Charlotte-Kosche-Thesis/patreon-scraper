I\u0027m usually a fanfic writer on FanFiction.net, but I also post some stories on devientArt, and a long, long time ago, I was the creator of a flash series called Shadow and Vegeta Unite! But that was a long time ago. No, I wish to write more original stories and become my own writer. To do this, I\u0027ve started a Patreon, as you can obviously tell. All I wish to do is write and write and write and write, because that\u0027s what I tend to do for most hours of my life, honestly. And this way, I can get income for doing so, and hopefully provide better stories. And who knows, maybe make them physical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this, and I promise, nay, swear, that if you back me, I\u0027ll make it with your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUh... not in \u003cem\u003ethat \u003c/em\u003eway, though, mind you.\u003cbr\u003e"
