    "summary": "I film, edit and present for a living. More recently I have been filming and editing for some of your favourite YouTubers. I can see viewers really like how I film and edit the content on others channels... I should make my own too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to work on better projects and be able to pay people\u00a0involved, like camera person to help me film videos that are harder to film myself - I can\u0027t always be my own camera lady. I want to continue the level of quality on my videos and be able to spend more time on them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eI would love to do weekly content, but it\u0027s not always viable with my current work/life situation - Sometimes I can, most times I can\u0027t afford to take a day or two and commit solely to a video. Patreon could make this possible! \u00a0Exciting times we live in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eAs a fun fact I make a loss every video at the moment as I PAY for the music I use legally with a licence. I am legit yo\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e. I do pay people for the work they do to help, whether that is filming or music. It\u0027s a passion project basically. YouTube adsense is worth nothing, and the pennies I make from that do not cover the basics. It also does take time out of my work schedule and I hate putting out a shoddy product for you guys - you can tell when I am rushed and for that I am sorry. A little bit helps me dedicate some time to make something worthy\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eof your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eF.A.Q\u0027S\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in Dollars?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0As this is an american based website, everything is written in Dollars, but you can use any currency and it will be automatically converted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many videos will you release a month?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI am aiming for 4, BUT DON\u0027T WORRY! You can set a monthly maximum when you sign up so that you never donate more that you can afford. This site is nice like that. I mean I know what it\u0027s like to be skint... I am here...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t have much money, can I still become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0INDEED YOU CAN! Please only donate what you can afford. Even $1 or $2 per video I upload. It makes difference and greatly appreciated .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my videos are free to watch but this allows me to have the freedom to work on videos as hard as I work on everyone else\u0027s and focus on making content that is worthy of your patronage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery patron gets access to the exclusive news feed, downloads and get an exclusive podcast - Bing and Mandy. I am not trying to \u0027make it big\u0027 or whatever, it\u0027s about creating something small and sustainable...SO ONLY GIVE WHAT YOU CAN! Every bit helps.\u00a0:D\u003cbr\u003e"
