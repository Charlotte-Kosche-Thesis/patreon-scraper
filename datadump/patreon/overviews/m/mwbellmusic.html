     "about": "Born on July 1st 1988 in London, I moved around a lot spending most of my youth both in and around London and the Sound East. As a child I would often spend hours listening to music of many genres with my parents regularly finding me routing through their record collection looking for new music to explore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first memorable experience with film and music was watching Disney\u2019s Fantasia; laughing now I can remember hiding behind the sofa as soon as I heard Mussorgsky\u2019s \u2018Night On Bald Mountain\u2019 played along with images of the devil summoning evil spirits. Come to think of it, I think the music scared me more than the picture!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen my father purchased his first Yamaha home cinema sound system in around 1995, I was in awe, experiencing surround sound for the very first time. I remember feeling transported from the front room straight into the picture and would always look forward to watching another film with him. Although unaware at the time, my experience with surround sound, my love of music and watching the latest movies with my Dad would create an interest for music and sound within film which I didn\u0027t really discover until later in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a teenager I discovered Heavy Metal and started playing the electric guitar for \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://icenialbion.bandcamp.com/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eIceni\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, a Brighton-based metal band as their rhythm guitarist. After a few years with the band, I decided to study Music Production with the aim of becoming a live sound engineer. I got off to a good start and began by producing \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/hatriotism-single/id441786840\"\u003e\u201cHatriotism\u201d\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e a single by the then Brighton-based metal band \u003cem\u003eDemental\u003c/em\u003e; but ultimately I stumbled upon a passion for creating music for film during one of my many assignments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2011, I scored my first short film, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsTeZ9DDesk\"\u003eFrancis\u003c/a\u003e\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e which led me to rethink my career options. For my third year at University, I enrolled on a Composition for Film \u0026amp; Media course at the University of Brighton.
