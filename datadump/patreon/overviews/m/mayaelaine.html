My name is Maya Elaine. I\u0027m an artist, photographer, \u0026amp; designer currently living and working in Pittsburgh, PA. I work primarily in digital mediums like photography, photomanipulation, digital painting, code, etc., but am also trained in several traditional mediums that will sometimes pop up in my work now and then. I am heavily involved in several fashion communities as well and will also be sharing modeling and styling work in addition to my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you like my work, please consider becoming my patron.\u00a0Even the smallest bit of help can open up endless possibilities for my work and future as an artist. Plus, you\u0027ll get to join me for the journey and you\u0027ll unlock some cool rewards too. \u2661\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/imLQnyk.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhat is patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon is a digital tip jar for artists, but patrons like you get rewarded too! It\u0027s sort of the contemporary version of how long ago there were ~patrons of the arts~ (except patreon is way less expensive and much more rewarding). Your small monthly contribution helps me spend more time creating and gives you access to special content that only my patrons can see, including works-in-progress, tutorials, downloadable assets, high-res versions of final works, and more as the journey continues! As part of my patron community, you can make posts on my page, share your ideas, and let me know what you want to see more of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7TODn7Y.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhy am I here?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI am a student currently finishing up my senior year of college. I love my creative work more than anything else in the world but finances are rough for a college kid and I\u0027ve been spending less and less time creating work in favor of keeping rent paid and food on the table. Between work, school, and getting dealt the awesome hand that is having narcolepsy, finding time to create consistently is the biggest threat to my ability to keep producing work. Having support from patrons like you allows me to securely set aside time to keep creating and to create more frequently. I\u0027ll be graduating soon and I want more than anything to be able to keep making. Even the smallest contribution goes a long way towards letting me allocate more time in life to create work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/p4OWPza.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eHow does your contribution help?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eYour contribution helps me buy supplies, upgrade my equipment, try out new mediums, and to continue learning and growing as an artist. Most importantly it buys me precious time that I can set aside to work on drawings, paintings, videos, photography, and more. Time is like gold to an artist. Without your support, my work time is limited to rushed spurts at 3am between work, school, and sleep. Your help lets me have peace of mind that setting aside time each week to create is not going to hurt my ability to pay my bills each month. By becoming a patron, you are becoming the lifeblood of my work. You are the reason I can make. I can never thank you enough for that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VqKUEYT.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhat about instagram / facebook / tumblr / etc.?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI am never going to stop posting to my other social media.
