    "summary": "Minor League Doubles is the Rocket League eSports Organization for the gamers who LOVE the game of Rocket League but are not at the \"Pro\" level. We WANT to give these players the SAME type of experience that the \"Pros\" get when they compete. The Players who come home from work tired but still have enough in them to get in a couple games or a few short hours of RL. The Players who plan all week for a RL marathon where you and your buddies just play for hours. The Players who dream about being in the RLCS and for some reason struggle to climb the ladder. Wouldn\u0027t it be nice to have a League where no matter how many mistakes you make, you will always feel welcome and will always have a chance to compete every single week? Wouldn\u0027t it be nice to finally get away from the TOXIC players online who spam \"What A Save!\" when you whiff on a save and be surrounded by, not only nice, respectable players that understand, but surrounded by players who WANT to see you succeed and will HELP YOU with your game and cheer you on! Well guess what? That my friends is the MLD!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe already have a SOLID CORE that makes up the BEST Rocket League community in the WORLD! We have 24 teams, a fully functional website, Games Streaming On Twitch every single week during the season, our League and ALL of our teams on Twitter plus League Merchandise! But with all good things, not everything lasts forever and the MLD cant last that much longer without the financial support we need to carry on. Our staff puts in well around 40 hours or more a week to make sure this organization is run the best way possible, each player is tended to and almost every game is streamed and broadcasted. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help we can take the MLD to places it has never been before and with financial stability for our staff we can REALLY have that time to focus on improving the league every single day of the week. If you believe in us, please support our efforts and help us make our dreams come true!\u003cbr\u003e"
