While most of these guides contain enough relevant information to retain \u003cem\u003esome\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0value to the reader, their detailed notes and comparisons are not kept maintained, and the guide falls into a sorry state where it makes recommendations that are simply not longer relevant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason why? \u003cstrong\u003eIt takes an incredibly long amount of time to research, test, and verify changes then write about them.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I know this first hand because I\u0027ve kept my Olaf guide up to date for over 36 months across nearly 100 patches. I\u0027ve invested hundreds upon hundreds of hours writing, re-formatting, and otherwise updating my guide, and thousands more in order to read, research, \"lab-test\" and \"live-test\" with runes, masteries, items, matchups, strategies and so on. By spending that much time, I can create the best, most thorough guide for my readers - providing small nuanced insights that most guides don\u0027t cover at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZDDz7Ta.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of my articles have a similar goal: I want to help you learn the things that other people either don\u0027t know or don\u0027t talk about. My Olaf guide covers niche items that absolutely have their place in some games, when most people don\u0027t even \u003cem\u003emention\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0most items. When there was no authoritative confirmation about armor buffs applying to air units in Rise of Nations, I went and tested it, then included that information in a related article. When nobody had a comprehensive list of commands for Discord\u0027s Airhorn Solutions bot, I put one together myself and manually verified the list against the bot\u0027s source code to ensure it was not only both accurate, but also complete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my analysis I want to help you to understand \u003cstrong\u003ewhy\u003c/strong\u003e one thing should be picked over another, and \u003cstrong\u003ewhen\u003c/strong\u003e. I aim to create discussion about choices \u003cem\u003ethat I myself want to read,\u003c/em\u003e and I hope you do to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you empower me to keep making this content. If you want to see my content continue, please consider adding your support to me and my work. Thank you \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/sq9EP9Q.png\"\u003e"
