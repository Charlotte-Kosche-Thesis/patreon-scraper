It is my passion and of all the things, creating music and telling stories with it, makes me feel alive.

     "about": "My first recorded contact with music was years ago back in the beginning of 1990\u0027s. I shaked my baby-butt as if dancing when my dad was listening to rock from the radio. There is also a photo where I am \"playing\" an electric guitar with my dad around the same period. In my teen years I wanted to become a performing musician, a guitarist in a band. I composed and played in some groups. That was the most crucial time in my musical history. My high school years with my amazing friends left a mark that could never be removed. The last thing happened when I was in Sweden as a missionary from 2011 to 2013. It dawned on me that my passion is music and especially composing. In the beginning of 2014 I decided to pursue a professional career in the art that makes me feel \u003cstrong\u003ealive\u003c/strong\u003e.",
