Now I pay it forward by posting YouTube tutorials for my own designs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here is where Patreon comes in. Patreon lets me keep making free videos, but also allows anyone who wants to show their gratitude monetarily to do so. By becoming my patron, you pledge to give me a small amount each time I release a new tutorial. Pledging to support my videos lets me know you appreciate my work, have found my designs or techniques useful or helpful, and that you want me to make more tutorials. Your support will help me buy a new computer for editing my videos, better lighting, and a backdrop to make my videos even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can pledge a little, or a lot. It\u0027s rare that I release more than one or two tutorials a month, but you can also set a monthly cap just in case I go crazy and post too many tutorials in a month; I don\u0027t want you to give more than you can afford or think my content is worth. That\u0027s why I don\u0027t charge by the month - because I don\u0027t always put out a tutorial every month, and you shouldn\u0027t have to pay me if I didn\u0027t release anything new.\u00a0Thank you for considering becoming my patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout me: In 2015, I was honored with the Balloon Excellence Rising Star Award from one of the fathers of modern balloon twisting, Ralph Dewey. He said he was giving me the award primarily for my YouTube videos, which are helping spread the art form and teaching a new generation of twisters."
