    "summary": "My name is John and just to tell you a little bit about myself, I started making videos on January 27, 2011 with Fight! Iczer-1 The Abridged Series. I continued making abridged content until 2012, but felt unsatisfied and unrecognized, as the abridging community at the time was not an easy place to market parodies of old/obscure anime. At the end of 2014, I started a new channel and picked up abridging again with Orguss abridged. It got very good reception but no views, then, after 3 episodes, copyright strikes started coming in. Again, I dropped abridging. In the summer of 2017, I decided\u00a0to make a series of videos talking about weird/interesting fun facts I knew about my favorite shows. The satisfaction I got from making these videos was greater than any abridged video I\u0027d ever done (and it was a million times easier to edit).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter restarting my channel with an approach towards educational and editorial videos, I\u0027ve had more people show/share an interest in my favorite shows than I ever saw doing parodies. My goal is to continue making the videos I do now, but expand into making a live-action show and podcast where my friends and I will give our hot takes on new and old anime."
