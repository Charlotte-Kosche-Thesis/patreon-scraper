The show will be\npublished in iTunes, and will also be available on our website\n(\u003ca href=\"http://mtp.dog\"\u003eMTP.DOG\u003c/a\u003e).  The episodes will be recorded from the road as my wife\nand I travel, in our van, from California to Alaska to Tierra Del\nFuego and back. We are seeking to explore the beauty of nature, the\nvariety and commonality of humanity, the strangeness of time, and the\nlimits of our abilities.  While meandering from the top to the bottom\nof our planet, it will be our goal to meet people along the way,\nrecord their stories when possible, and produce podcasts with a true\nvariety of content and character. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough we have saved enough money to fund our journey, we are currently seeking funds to produce this podcast. \u00a0Joining our little community goes a long way to making this dream a reality! \u00a0Your participation will make possible a steady stream of funny, touching and ridiculous stories from the people we meet on our journey. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
