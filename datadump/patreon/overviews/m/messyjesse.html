This is something I have been dreaming of for a\n long time and I am sooooo excited to be creating it now to share more \nof what I have to offer with you, in ways that are fun and playful and exciting for all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an intuitive artist, creating what I like to call cosmic artwork, because so often the symbols and images that come through feel very cosmic or even galactic. As a starseed, remembering my connection to the stars and my family \"out there\", this influences and ties into my art a great deal. Art is one of the ways I express and explore this aspect of who I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a peek at some of my more cosmic, galactic pieces... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://messyjesse.studio/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cosmic-Family-Reunion-Collection.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn upcoming project will be the Cosmic Family Reunion Collection of paintings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a few common themes in my art that I am excited to explore more through putting together Collections of paintings with common themes, messages or intentions. And I\u0027ll be sharing those right HERE as they unfold. I\u0027ll even take you behind the scenes so you can see my creation process, hear the story behind the paintings, and get a sneak peek at what\u0027s coming up in the Studio before \u003cem\u003eanyone\u003c/em\u003e else knows. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current painting collection project is the \u003cem\u003eBlood Mysteries Collection\u003c/em\u003e, and you can find the first couple of paintings right here in the patron-only feed (click the Become a Patron button above to get access).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://messyjesse.studio/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Blood-Mysteries-banner.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy process is often messy, and I never know exactly how my creation is going to turn out. As I follow the flow of intuition and inspiration I am often surprised and delighted by what comes through. Each painting I create has a message to share, offering insight and inspiration on various topics. I enjoy doing intuitive readings with my art cards, or interviews with my paintings - it is amazing the things they have to share!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a web goddess / web designer and online marketer, and will be bringing this aspect of me to the party as well. Patrons will have the option to hire me as their web goddess or to be part of the Marketing Magic Collective to get support with creating their own marketing flow. I will also be sharing intuitive art that has messages to share about marketing and building a business that is fully aligned with your true self.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYep, ALL of this in one place. And even more, as I explore what other parts of me want to come out to play here in the virtual Studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am excited to share my artwork and other gifts and skills with you, my fans and patrons. Join my exclusive community to play with me in the Studio and get access to goodies like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003edownloadable (and printable) artwork\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eintuitive readings\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003einterviews with paintings\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ebehind the scenes videos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eguided meditations \u0026amp; art journeys\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003enature photography (from beautiful British Columbia!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emarketing magic tips \u0026amp; support\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand more!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClick the orange \"Become a Patron\" button at the top right, and then you\u0027ll be able to choose the membership option that works best for you.\u003c/strong\u003e You can get access to exclusive content with just $3/month, or get even more amazing goodies with other membership options.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re brand new to Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e: it\u0027s a membership site platform for creatives \nlike me, that helps us get to create AND get paid for it.

Click the Follow button on the upper LEFT for that option.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll funds raised here on my Patreon page will go to pay for my living expenses such as rent and food, so that I can keep making art and playing with you here in the virtual studio. Once I reach my financial goal of covering all of my basic living expenses, I will be CELEBRATING by creating a giant painting (bigger than I\u0027ve EVER done before) and inviting my Patrons to be a part of it! If you\u0027d like to help me reach that goal, then go ahead and become a Patron at whatever level feels good to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so excited to share and play with you in this way.
