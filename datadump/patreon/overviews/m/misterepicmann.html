Ever since the channel blew up in 2013 it has been through A LOT of changes. Ownership changes, creative changes, etc. In the process, the channel lost it\u0027s identity AND it\u0027s fans. \u00a0As of just recently, I\u0027m back at the channel with full creative control and I would LOVE to do it right this time around. Patreon is a platform which will allow us to create a strong community, as well provide us with the support we need to make these videos full time. We would greatly appreciate your help as we regain our lost fans and find new ones! If you cannot help financially or simply don\u0027t want to...no Worries. We appreciate you just being around. Thank you.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Nick"
