Most of you that will arrive here already know me, Gary, as the guy who has been making MacMost video tutorials for more than 10 years now. Obviously, I enjoy making them and helping people get the most from their Macs!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eTHE STORY SO FAR...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past decade I\u0027ve created more then 1,300 tutorials. To give you an idea of how many that is, if I wanted to make that into a DVD box set, it would need to be put on more than 55 DVDs! Most of the videos are how-to tutorials, teaching you how to get something done on your Mac, iPad or iPhone. I like helping people in this way -- teaching \"how to\" instead of being more like technical support, something that Apple covers nicely with the Genius Bar anyway.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eCHANGING DIRECTION\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAll this time, MacMost has paid its bills mostly from the ads on the pages. But that revenue has been dwindling over the years. Plus, the ads seem to get worse and worse. If using Patreon brings in enough revenue, I would love to get rid of those ads! Plus, then I would feel like I really am making the videos for YOU, the audience, since MacMost would be audience-supported. It would be wonderful for MacMost to be supported completely from Patreon and educational materials like courses and books.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eREWARDS FOR SUPPORTERS!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo you\u0027ll notice that starting with the $5 reward, everyone becomes a member of what I am calling \"Club MacMost\" -- just my fun name for the group that will consist of me plus MacMost\u0027s best supporters. I\u0027ll be posting to that group some special things. I\u0027m sure it will evolve over time, but I was thinking that these would be short off the cuff videos and posts about various Apple-related topics. Maybe a tip or trick that I discovered, or how I feel about a recent piece of Apple news or a rumor. I could see posting interesting photos or videos I have taken with my iPhone and which effect or app I used. Maybe I\u0027ll even mention some apps, services or other Apple-things that I use or like. It will be more personal than the regular MacMost videos. As a small community-within-a-community, Club MacMost will change over time with suggestions from members and as we interact with each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eTHANKS, BUT NO THANKS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what about if you don\u0027t want to contribute, are unable to support MacMost, or just don\u0027t like this Patreon model? Well, my plan is to keep MacMost pretty much what it is right now. I\u0027ll still post the regular tutorial videos to the site, and I\u0027ll still send out the newsletter for free. You don\u0027t have to contribute. I know things like Patreon aren\u0027t for everyone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eOR, JUST GIVE IT A TRY\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is easy to start with Patreon, and it is also easy to cancel. I welcome you to try out the $5 \"Club MacMost\" level and then I promise you won\u0027t hurt my feelings if you decide to cancel later on. In fact, I\u0027d appreciate your feedback.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eONWARD, TO THE FUTURE!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m very excited about this. I envision a future where I can make videos and post content to MacMost knowing that my viewers are supporting me, not ads from large corporations that don\u0027t even know that MacMost exists. Here\u0027s to the future of MacMost!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
