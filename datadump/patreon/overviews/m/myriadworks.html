    "summary": "I write about and research so many, many things, even over the course of a single day. I think of something, I dive deep trying to figure it out, I write little wisping fireworks of story seeds and the bones of plans and the faintest ideas of an idea. Writing is as natural to me as breathing. I learned to type about as soon as my chubby little fingers could hit the right keys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo when I say I find it terribly difficult to write this description, I say that not because of the act, but because of the subject - me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can I say about \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt might help to say what that \u0027me\u0027 contains, which is by no means a short list: I am brown, I am mixed-race, I am Jewish, I am a first-generation Canadian, I am the child of immigrants, I\u0027m a party to the centuries-long colonization of indigenous land. I\u0027m queer, and genderqueer, and just kind of out of sync with the concept of bodies (together or singly) generally speaking. I\u0027m disabled; I have severe Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, I have a variety of anxiety and agoraphobia given the charming title of Social Phobia, I have a small host of issues that plague me with chronic pain and fatigue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I suppose I can say a lot about me, but all of that is a framework - a lens through which I view the world, and a lens through which others can view me. For better or for worse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat lens does not always make things clearer, but it does offer me a unique perspective.\u003c/strong\u003e And to help clarify things further, I write about them. I try to share my story with others, and share their stories in turn. But we don\u0027t live in a world that makes it easy to regularly commit to even that simple of a goal; storytelling is not ranked highly in terms of productivity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have always tried to make my writing as accessible as possible\u003c/strong\u003e - I post it freely online, or when in zine form I sell only slightly above what I need in order to recoup the production and distribution costs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis has worked to some degree, but the more I write, the more I find I have to say. The more I want to say. The more I want to be able to share those stories, as far as possible. And so I\u0027ve come here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that if you like what I have to say, and have the means to give, you\u0027ll be generous enough to help me keep writing and sending those words out into the world. It\u0027s that simple.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if all you can give is the time it took to read this far -\u003cstrong\u003e thank you\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
