    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Misty Macallister. Welcome to my Patreon page, yay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t already know, Patreon is the place where Patrons (hopefully, you!) support Creators (me, me, me!) by giving them money (MONEY!!!), but I\u0027m guessing you already know that since you\u0027re on Patreon looking around. Then let me tell you what you  most likely don\u0027t know, like who I am and why I need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I\u0027m a self-published writer, and I write sexy stories, and suspenseful stories, and sci-fi stories, and mystery stories, and every other kind of story you can think of. But writing isn\u0027t all I do. I do all my own editing, so if there\u0027s a comma missing blame me. I also design my book covers. I\u0027m very proud of my covers, so go to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mistymacbookstore.com\"\u003eMistyMacBookStore\u003c/a\u003e and take a look, then come back and tell me your favorite! Also, I model for the covers - so yes, that\u0027s me you\u0027re seeing on the covers of my books - and I take most of the photos. Oh, and I run my own bookstore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoy, I\u0027m busy!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s me: writer, photographer, book cover designer, cover girl, and online bookstore owner. But all this doing, the writing, the photo taking, the photo posing, and everything else, is a whole production, and production takes time and money. Good photos require a good camera and expensive equipment - lenses don\u0027t buy themselves - and looking good in the photos requires buying beautiful lingerie because thongs don\u0027t grow on trees. And processing photos requires a computer with a smart processor and a ton of memory. And writing requires a fancy mechanical keyboard, and notebooks, and pens, and chocolate. And then there\u0027s the wine; you can\u0027t create without the wine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, your help will make it easier for me to take care of the costly production, and with the worries of production taken care of, I can write more stories and take more photos and make better covers and make everyone who reads my stories happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s in a nutshell why I need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOK, that\u0027s the who and the why of it. Now it\u0027s time for the sell. This is where I roll up my figurative sleeves and convince you to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHm...well...um...to be perfectly honest, I\u0027m not sure how to convince you. I\u0027ve thought about it, and then I\u0027ve thought about it some more until there was nothing else to think about. I came up with the tiers and the rewards for the patrons who decide to support me. I wrote down my goals because Patreon assures me that showing specific goals helps convince the patrons. I made a video (what do you think?). I\u0027ve done all these things, but is it enough to get me your support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know. I hope so (big grin)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn any case I\u0027d like you to know that I appreciate any support, even the moral kind (big grin).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003eMisty\u003cbr\u003e"

You know, the basic things a writer uses, paper, pens, chocolate, maybe a bottle of wine that\u0027s not on the bottom shelf of the grocery store. I\u0027m not going to even mention monthly Photoshop charges (the Photoshop I\u0027m horrible at using) and my yearly Word bill. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is starting to sound dreary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBills really tap my creative spirit, but you can help free my spirit so it can fly free like a bird. Help my spirit fly like a bird, or maybe like a bat, or possibly like a butterfly. If you did that, I would write the best stories I possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
