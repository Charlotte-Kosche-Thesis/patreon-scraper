We have a limited amount of funds for equipment and living expenses as we have dedicated ourselves 24/7 to making quality life-affirming music that we want to share with you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is our life\u0027s calling. We compose a wide variety of electronic dance music styles and embrace technology. We are also currently releasing the alpha versions of a VST/AU plug-in for all OS (Windows, OSX, and Linux) to control the Roland JD-Xi synth from a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and as a standalone editor. We are going to be updating with new sections for the Roland JD-Xi VST/AU controller each week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also mentor and teach other aspiring electronic artists. Due to our current lack of representation from an A\u0026amp;R firm, we are paid small amounts for gigs and being paid royalties for publishing music does not cover over all (ok, any yet, TBH) expenses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you personally come in and if we can get a minimum of 200 people to donate just $1 a month, it would empower us and help us do what we need, love, code, and want to do without the worry of the what-ifs that come from everyday living. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you cannot donate, at least stop by our Facebook page and give it a \"Like\", say \"Hi!\" and get to know us and share the music. But most importantly share this message and get the word out, help us get the music out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe ask everyone who is a fan of Memory Splice\u0027s love and energy to share this and get the signal here boosted and keep the music made no matter what. It belongs to you and is for you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!"
