    "summary": "Thank you so much for making your way to my Patreon page and\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003econsidering being my patron\u003c/strong\u003e. From as little as $5 a month, you can help me reach more people with practical, easy to follow ways we can improve our health, the health of our communities and the planet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Morag Gamble - I live\u00a0 simple living and permaculture. At the end of 2015 I started a blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.our-permaculture-life.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Permaculture Life\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and in mid 2016 I created the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/moraggambleourpermaculturelife\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Permaculture Life YouTube Channel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. I am so blown away by how popular they have become. \u003cstrong\u003eLiving a simpler, healthier, less stressful life that nourishes ourselves, our families, our communities and the earth is the aspiration of many. My goal is to practically show people how to make the shift.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor as long as I can remember, I have been passionate about caring for the earth and nurturing positive communities. I live it, I teach it, I write and film about it and am always trying to find the best way to share enjoyable, do-able and constructive \u003cstrong\u003eways to make positive change in our lives to contribute to positive change in the world\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have travelled to over \u003cstrong\u003e20 countries in the past 25 years\u003c/strong\u003e teaching, designing, filming and researching about simple eco lifestyles, permaculture and local food initiatives. Since 1992, I have been based at the world-renowned Crystal Waters Permaculture Village near Maleny in the subtropical part of Queensland, Australia. I live here with my husband and 3 young children. \u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027ve built our own place and created an award winning edible landscape and are mortgage free.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was excited to find that I could invite you, the readers of my blog and watchers of my youtube channel, to \u003cstrong\u003ehelp me continue to offer free, practical, authentic and high quality content WITHOUT the ads\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love sharing this information with you and I really hope it helps. Until recently, everything I did was face to face teaching - an oral tradition - sharing ideas at workshops, seminars and at peoples homes, in the community and school gardens. \u003cstrong\u003eMore and more people started to ask me to actually write it down, film it and share it further\u003c/strong\u003e. I was reluctant at first - I didn\u0027t know where to start, but now, I am so glad I\u0027ve begun, but I do need your help to continue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn Our Permaculture Life, I write at least three practical blogposts a week about living a permaculture life. \u003cstrong\u003eIt matters to me that what I share with you has integrity - that it is from my own experience and independent research, and you know that you are not being marketed to.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more I delve into writing and film-making, I realise just how much I have to document. \u003cstrong\u003eCreating this original content has become a full time job for me, but I do need to have an income - even though I am mortgage-free and living simply. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you appreciate the content I am making, I would love you to become one of my highly valued patrons. As I mentioned above, being a patron means committing just $5 or more a month - \u003cstrong\u003eevery little bit counts.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0There are some \u003cstrong\u003egreat bonuses for patrons too\u003c/strong\u003e - extra information, courses, livestream chat with me and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is one of the videos from my youtube channel where I take you on a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/ADCtCjnn2M4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etour of my permaculture\u003c/a\u003e garden.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
