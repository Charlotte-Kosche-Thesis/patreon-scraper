It means a lot, so thank you ^^ We had waited for quite awhile to make a Patreon. We were very hesitant at first, but a handful of you guys kept asking us to set one up. You all want to support us so much, and we don\u0027t even understand why! But we are truly, truly grateful. We\u0027re currently students and both our majors are molecular biology \u0026amp; genetics, so becoming a full-time YouTuber or streamer really isn\u0027t possible for us at that moment. With a Patreon, however, we would be able to create better content as well as releasing it at a speedy pace. We did want to make it clear though - please do not feel it is essential to become a Patreon. Any of your support means beyond the world to us whether you choose to pledge or not. Even just dropping into our streams or even watching our Youtube videos... We never expect you guys to feel like you have to pledge to us in order to be able to support us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003e...

I\u0027m having a lot of personal obstacles and hadn\u0027t been able to really focus on my content for a while. It\u0027s difficult to have a consistent stream schedule because my grandma can need my attention during my stream times and essentially, it\u0027s too difficult to do both. This year I\u0027ve decided to put a lot of effort in my content and streams. I also want to start getting involved in Cons and making videos on them for you guys as well (like the one I made about GIST). I want to be able to make content that I\u0027m satisfied with, and although I know a lot of you will support me no matter what kind of content I release (btw thanks, I love you guys so much for that), I want to be able to make content that is of quality our little monster community deserves. I know it\u0027s a little petty, but I\u0027d want to make things that you guys will be surprised with every time.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eMeko\u003c/span\u003e is currently in Ohio working/studying still.

     "description": "\u003cbr\u003e$250 is the total amount that would cover the costs for Meko and I to compete in the EVO championships in Las Vegas. We\u0027re really confident in our skill and I believe I would pull really well during the Tekken and 2 Super Smash tournaments (as I\u0027ve won many). The ticket to Las Vegas alone costs me about $1000 USD as well as the hotel costs, so, any amount to help with the competition aspect of our EVO trip would mean a lot. Also, there will be exclusive vlogs and snaps!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
