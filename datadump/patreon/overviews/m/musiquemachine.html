    "summary": "Musique Machine is a non-profit \u0026amp; proudly ad-free music/ media webzine- that\u2019s been running since 2001. We post around six to eight new reviews a week, as well as at least one interview/ article per month. And over the years we\u0027ve\u00a0 had more high profile interview with the likes of Japanese noise legend #Merzbow, respected \u0026amp; prolific Spanish\u00a0sound artists #Francisco #L\u00f3pez\u2019, English\u00a0ethno-ambient originator #rappon, Anchocist -punk legend\u00a0 #Steve #Ignorant( ex #crass), \u0026amp; respected doom-mister \u0026amp; #Sunn O))) member #Stephen #O\u2019Malley. As well as host of more obscure\u00a0artists, who have had the exclusive\u00a0interviews with the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince its start, the site has strived to review all manner of genres of music/sound, been one of the most eclectic music/ sound sites on the internet. Where else can you find death metal, sitting alongside long-form ambient music, outsider pop music, blends of space rock \u0026amp; heavy metal, dense walls of noise, occult folk, and avant jazz?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn more recent years we\u2019ve adding reviews of cult \u0026amp; horror films, as well as books \u0026amp; related media- to try \u0026amp; expand our focus \u0026amp; coverage even further. \u003cbr\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eThroughout it has been virtual \u0026amp; important for the site to remain ad free- as the type of stuff we cover \u0026amp; feature is often very artists based, in small pressings, and extremely niche. So advertising would be both detrimental to the freeness of the ethos of the site, and of course who really wants to look at ads for skinny designer jeans, flashy cars, big corporations- when reading about edgy, odd, and weird sounds \u0026amp; visuals?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe idea of pateron was put passed all the present writers of the site, and it was whole heartily agreed to go ahead. As we\u2019d all like to see M[m] carry on reviewing distinctive, sometimes changeling, yet always thought provoking sound \u0026amp; media for as long as possible. Because really a lot of this stuff gets little or no coverage anywhere else on the internet or anywhere else in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo are you able to help out?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe are not looking for huge pledges, or try to raise unrealistic amounts of money- we know we\u2019re niche, and we\u2019d like to stay that way!. \u003cbr\u003e"
