    "summary": "Senpai is back now. After fixing my life up and getting the work done to fix myself up. I\u0027m feeling much better now, and I\u0027m ready to start to working on my videos again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that out of the way. My name is Mentor Senpai. I\u0027m an experienced writer, with a natural gift for writing. I am talented for being known as a creative writer among my friends, and family members. I enjoy writing and it\u0027s something that I love doing in my spare time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also someone that enjoys anime and manga. However, my views and thoughts are different, compared to majority of people who like anime and manga now these days. I will be making videos talking about my honest thoughts and feelings about different topics.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy major videos are the, Visiting the Past series, Present Day\u0027s Fortunes and Troubles, and discussion videos. I do make writing tips videos, but those are locked behind as a patreon reward. Since, I\u0027m a very busy person, and I like to keep myself doing only one project at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be making improvements and changes to my videos, and channel as time goes on by. I do plan to create some official writing video in the future soon too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless, thank you very much for looking at my Patreon page. Take care, and have a good day.~\u003cbr\u003e-Mentor Senpai.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I\u0027m pretty sure you were expecting something like an intro, or formal greeting from me? Sorry, I\u0027m not really use to doing that as often anymore. Just partly because I find it very hard to use my emotions, or be formal with people now these days. Mainly from my own past experiences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Mentor Senpai, currently, a small YouTube channel with big dreams of becoming a big channel, and sharing around my wisdom, knowledge, and experience to many different people. I\u0027m a professional, talented, and creative writer that has over 15 years of writing experience behind me. Along with a long living passion (over 16 years) for anime and manga.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though I\u0027m a small channel, I still feel that I need to make sure that my content that I create here on my channel matches up to my own standards, and exceptions that need to be met, well, at least to myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping to sharing my writing experience to help many new, old, and young writers. Mainly so, that they can learn how to become better writers, and improve overtime. While also, avoiding making many common mistakes that many writers make themselves too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn most of my videos, I often talk about anime related content, but I\u0027m not afraid of telling people what are my thoughts on different things that I feel bother me about some things. Sadly...I haven\u0027t managed to make much progress for myself lately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is mainly because, I suffer from my own problems, and issues that surround my own personal life, and my work effort to get my videos done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I was a young child, I\u0027ve been dealing with my autism for many years. Many terrible things have happened to me, through bullying, because people made fun of me for being different. With my own autism, it\u0027s really hard for myself to find much reason to display, or express any kind, or form of emotion. I\u0027m more of rational, and logical thinker, who often avoids letting his own emotions get to himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom those times from being bullied so much, once I entered into college. I started to become more distance, and I didn\u0027t really bother trying to be near people. Overtime, I started to develop a fear, general mistrust, and\u00a0suspiciousness of people around me. This is mainly because, I developed having a disorder called, paranoid personality disorder. The second main issue that I deal with every single day, that also saps away my own energy to get work done for my YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the first two may seem common to most people, the other two issues that I deal with every single day are much worse. Don\u0027t laugh at me please for saying this...but, I have an emotinoal scarring, and phobia towards women. This is all from a few of my past relationships with some women I use to date. Some of them were abusive in different ways. Emotionally, mentally, and verbally. Even though, those memories are painful, I still try to pull myself together and stay comfortable near women. Even though, I still shake a bit, and get really scared whenever a girl comes near me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe last one is much more personal, and something that I often don\u0027t like admitting up. I have a form of lovesick-ness that has been affecting me for most of my life, and how I generally feel about love, and loving my own self. This is mostly because, it often focuses solely on making me feel depressed about myself, and I often feel like I hate myself for who I am as a person. Questioning a lot, if people really do care about me, or if everyone hates me in my everyday life. \u00a0Most of these days, it\u0027s really hard for me to overcome this a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, of course, there\u0027s a lot behind me that makes me want to be the person that I am to this day. However, I don\u0027t want to hide it that this is who I am, and how I personally see the world around me. I still want to keep making YouTube videos that can help me build a future for myself. Which is why, I felt it was important for me to express myself, and what I deal with every single day. Whenever I try to get a video done, I\u0027ve often dealing with these issues. And before you ask, yes, I am getting help right now. I just don\u0027t feel comfortable not telling the truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, the main question still comes to mind. \"Why should I support you here on Pateron? I mean, yes, it is sad that you deal with all of that. But, why should I still consider supporting you on Pateron?\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy answer is simple. That\u0027s your own choice. It all comes down to if you wish to support me, or not. I simply don\u0027t like forcing people to make a choice. I want everyone to make a choice for themselves, and think for themselves about what they personally feel, and think about me, and my own content. This is why I\u0027m currently keeping most of my rewards very simple. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just personally feel that is important that everyone makes a choice, and goes through with it. If people like my content, and they want to help me get somewhere better in my life, they can support me. If they don\u0027t want to, that\u0027s fine with me. I don\u0027t mind if someone else doesn\u0027t want to support my channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m mainly creating a Pateron, so, not only am I getting supported to make more content for my channel. But, it\u0027s also to please the other side of me, the greedy side of me that is hoping to make some form of money, done in some way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsidering how YouTube\u0027s ad money is being reduced a lot right now. I only have two choices of ways to get the most money right now. Patreon, and PayPal donations. Even after completing my years at college, it\u0027s still a huge test to me to get money now these days. This is also because, I\u0027ve been a shut in most of my life. This again, is from my own personal problems, my autism, my disorders, and my mental illnesses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always have questioned myself a lot, and my own worthiness, if I should be supported, or not. Should I get paid for what I do? Or, should I just keep doing my YouTube videos as a hobby to myself? I want YouTube to become one of my main jobs, where I get paid, but also feel happy about it. I mean, being honest, I feel happy making a video, and getting it done. But...there\u0027s one major issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince, I\u0027m still a small YouTube channel. I feel like not many people notice how much work I place into these videos. Sometimes, it takes me days, weeks, or even a month to get one video done! This goes into my planning of the videos, writing up the rough and final draft of the script, voicing and adjusting the tone of my voice, and finally, taking a lot of time to get the editing done for one video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll after all of that hard work? Barely anyone, not even close to 1,000 views, watches my videos. I\u0027m not the greatest whenever it comes to trying to be fancy, or have cool looking editing styles. This is mainly because, I\u0027m a writer. Not a fancy, high class editor, who edits videos and makes a living off that. And, it breaks my heart not seeing many people support my channel. This is why, I don\u0027t feel a strong need to make videos as much. If not many people are going to watch my videos, I don\u0027t really have a reason to keep posting so many videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, these are all of my honest feelings, and I personally feel about myself, my own worth, and how I picture my channel right now. I always aim for\u00a0quality over quantity on my channel here. I\u0027m not a big time YouTuber right now. I don\u0027t have tons of money to pay editors to get my videos out faster. I\u0027m just a lonely guy, who always deals with his own problems and issues, and wishes to become successful sometime...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really sorry that I had to type out such a long essay, that could be a novel that define me, and who I am. But, you can tell for sure by now, that I wasn\u0027t joking about being a talented, and creative writer. The professional part is...just a saying to myself, so, I can make myself feel a bit better. Even though, it is true that I am professional with most of the works that I do on my channel...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, this is just my long story, explaining, and expressing who I am as a person. Why I want to keep creating content on my channel, but I need to fill the other part of my desires, and greed to move on. I\u0027m a selfish, human being for asking for support like this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to consider supporting me after reading everything, all I have to say is this. Thank you...it means a lot to me. However, if you did read all of this, and still don\u0027t wish to support me and my channel. I will not judge you. I will not question why. I will not let my doubts get to me, and question why you have done so, or chosen so. I will respect what you have chosen, and what you wish to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read all of my long story, and all of this useless, information about myself. My name is Mentor Senpai. And I thank you, for listening, and considering to support me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a good day now.\u003cbr\u003e-Mentor Senpai.",
