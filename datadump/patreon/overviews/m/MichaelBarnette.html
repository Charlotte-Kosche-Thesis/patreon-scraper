    "summary": "Hi and welcome to my Patreon. I\u0027m Michael Barnette, bestselling author of a wide range of fiction, all of it with an erotic edge as my banner says.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started out writing erotic gay fiction about 12 years ago, with my first story of manlove being written on a dare by my cousin. That first story, Zoner appeared in Wired Hard 3 from Circlet Press and was picked up by Montidore Editore for their Idols book in Italian. I\u0027ve been writing erotic fiction ever since and have, over the course of those 12 years, written over 30 novels, novellas and short stories with more completed in conjunction with my writing partner, Auburnimp.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the closure of so many small publishing houses, the loss of my prior method of distribution for my Shadowfire Press books--All Romance eBooks--and continued problems regarding that other big name distribution method, I decided to try Patreon as it seems like the best option for authors at this time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be releasing never before seen content here. Things like the 3 never before published Mercykill books about my Japanese rock band turned assassins. My newest story, a serial set in a post-apocalyptic world called The Last Marine, as well as other projects I\u0027m working on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I\u0027ll be posting all of my old, out of print content here too. Many of these books haven\u0027t been available to readers for over 5 years, and some had such limited releases--Ragnarok Tango and Sinner, Mercykill 2--that few readers had a chance to purchase them before they were no longer available.\u003cbr\u003e"
