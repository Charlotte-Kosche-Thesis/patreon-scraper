    "summary": "Well, hello there! If you happen to be reading this then chances are you probably know who I am and what it is I do. If you don\u0027t, then how the the heck did you find this page! Alright, okay, let\u0027s start simple. The name\u0027s Michelle, but everyone I know calls me either Kit or Nomi - feel free to pick your favorite name or just call me \u0027that crazy author who won\u0027t shut up.\u0027 I\u0027m on \u003ca href=\"http://ibelieveinahappilyeverafter.tumblr.com/\"\u003etumblr \u003c/a\u003eand \u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/Ibelieveinahappilyeverafter\"\u003eArchiveOfOurOwn\u003c/a\u003e under ibelieveinahappilyeverafter and\u003ca href=\"http://fanfiction.net/~1337kitsune\"\u003e FanFiction.Net\u003c/a\u003e under 1337kitsune. Yes, I did make that account in middle school. Yes, I do regret the name. No, I\u0027m not changing it. I have a brand to protect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong story short, this Patreon was made so you can donate money to me. Why would you donate money to me? Well, for starters, I\u0027m pathetically poor and only have a part-time job as I go to college - doing both wears a person thin! Not a good enough reason? I\u0027m a writer! If I can get money from this then that will give me more incentive to write which means more fiction for you all! I write for various fandoms - far too many really - and ship just about anything and everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt isn\u0027t just fanfiction I write, either, but novels of my own! I haven\u0027t finished or published any yet, but I have things planned for fantasy coming into everyday life, werewolves, steampunk, and a thousand other ideas!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s not all. If you pledge a certain amount to me each month then you unlock bonus content! Cheesy sounding, I know, but you get to vote on polls on what ideas should be used in a story or drabble, you get chapters a week in advance, discounts on any books I choose to publish in the future, and links to all the documents to fanfiction stories that are currently published and being worked on - that means you can see notes and chapters sometimes weeks in advance! I also post links to old stories that are being rewritten so you can see the original and how it all began!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always going to be a writer, but this Patreon allows me to make money to help support myself and devote more of my time to writing instead of working so many hours at my job.\u00a0So feel free to donate as little as a dollar or as much as you want! This is Patreon, YOU\u0027RE in charge of how much you give me! Pretty neat, huh? This is a place for creators to make their dreams come true and for Patrons - that\u0027s you guys - to watch those dreams unfold. You get to be a part of the action from the very beginning if you want. Sounds fun, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if I\u0027m the type of person you\u0027d be willing to spend a few bucks on for a monthly meet in a coffee shop to jabber on about fanfiction, then do so! I promise I\u0027ll do my best so you don\u0027t regret it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you think a dollar is too little, please trust me, it is no way too little. Little stones make for great change.\u00a0"
