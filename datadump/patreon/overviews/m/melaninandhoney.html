It\u2019s to give people in our community to validate their experiences through creative expression. It\u2019s to give evidence to reality of being in a community our non-white counterparts in other areas of the United States and the world sometimes forget exists. And it\u2019s to create a safe online space to exist, because so many spaces are dangerous for people who are not white, and are not cisgender men.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stories told here are meant to leave you shook. To inspire elation and despair; to put you in the heart of those who our society so often silences and dehumanizes. Patreon subscribes get access to special content - videos, merch discounts, podcasts, special event invites/discounts, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA big thank you for following and subscribing to the blog and the content - I wouldn\u0027t be able to do the work I do without you, so thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
