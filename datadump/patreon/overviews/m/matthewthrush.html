    "summary": "Hi. I\u0027m Matthew. :) Thank you for joining me on our next adventure. I can\u0027t wait to start this new journey together and create amazing new stories that leave you up all night turning that next page. There\u0027s nothing like finding a book you can\u0027t put down and regret when the you turn the last page. That\u0027s the workings of a great story!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about me and what you can expect as an honored patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an Amazon #1 bestselling author with over1 million reads with my breakout post-apocalyptic novel, \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2136-Post-Apocalyptic-Novel-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B01MTF1D3A/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1507828858\u0026amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e2136\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. I first posted 2136 in August 2015 on Wattpad as an experiment with writing a post-apocalyptic story in first person and from a female\u0027s point of view. I\u0027ve always loved reading dystopian stories and watching TV shows or movies like The Walking Dead, The Maze Runner, the Divergent Series, and even things like The Martian, The Book of Eli, and Waterworld. 2136 has since accrued over 791,000 reads with a growing following of 54,000. Needless to say, it\u0027s been an amazing ride and blessing! The best part is connecting with readers and making new friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea of a destroyed world like our own with mankind struggling to survive is liberating. It\u0027s not the chaos or the mayhem that I enjoy, it\u0027s the sensation of us working together to live and gain freedom. I\u0027m sure many of you can relate with the struggles and stresses of life. They\u0027re everywhere! But, when you find a book, a show, a movie, or song that can remove you from that chaos and pain for a moment, you never want to go back. That\u0027s how I feel about stories and why I write. I want to liberate others with my words; encourage them; lift them up; and create a world that they can escape to even if it\u0027s only for a moment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not the years that wear us down, it\u0027s the small moments that make all of the difference. Let\u0027s focus on the small things to impact the big things for good. I do my best to speak and write to encourage others to remind them why they are special and unique and that they are loved. By being a patron, you join me in that quest to not only create riveting stories that leave you breathless and craving more, but to reach the millions of people in this world that feel alone, forgotten, and unloved. Help me spread love to the world through stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for my professional career endeavors and journey, I work as a ghostwriter for a few publishers creating bestsellers for them. I\u0027ve also written and published eleven of my own stories, hundreds of poems, short stories, essays, blogs, and articles for various clients over the years. You can see some of my work in Literary Magazines, the Same Houston State Review, Storychick, Radish, ABIS, and AllThingsRelax to name a few. I also translated Arabic for the United States Navy for six years. My time serving was one of the highlights of my life thus far and I met many new friends. If you have the chance to serve, do it! You won\u0027t regret the memories you will create, the friends you\u0027ll make, and the life experiences and knowledge you\u0027ll gain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI joined Patreon so that I could give back to readers (you). I\u0027ve been blessed with success on Wattpad, but I want to reach a larger audience. God has gifted me with the ability to write and to use my words to bring healing and freedom to others. If I am not using my gift for the benefit of others, then I am wasting it. I want to change lives and remind people they are worth much more than they believe or that society tells them. I\u0027m doing this because the best part of writing and sharing stories is not the story or the writing but connecting with readers and making new life-long friendships. Books are just the bridge that I use to interact. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons enable me to do what I was called to do on this world; that was to tell stories and encourage others with kindness and love. You empower me to do that with your monthly support. I\u0027ve since learned that being generous and helping others always repays you with multiplication. It\u0027s not always about the financial gains because seeing a smile on a child\u0027s face will bring you more happiness than a lifetime of riches. Having a mindset of servitude and generosity is what enriches the world and the people around you. We are blessed to be a blessing to others. And with your support, we will do that to millions of people around the globe one story at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that you enjoy my stories and that they\u0027ll provide you with some momentary joy and excitement that leads to permanent freedom from stress, struggles, and the burdens that life can throw at you. Cheers to the beginning of our new friendship! I look forward to hearing from you. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBONUS for Avid Readers!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you an avid reader who can\u0027t seem to get enough books to sedate your hunger for stories?
