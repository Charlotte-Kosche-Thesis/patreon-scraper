My goal is to write tales that transport the reader into new realms on the backs of beloved characters. Do you remember the last time a book or short story filled you with awe? Made you cry? Kept you awake at night dreaming of impossible worlds? This is what I want to do for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to make writing my primary job, and that means mastering the craft of storytelling.\u00a0Your patronage ensures that not only will I keep writing, but that I will keep getting better and better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $1 per story, you get download access to my newest work. You get to read them before they\u0027ve been published in any literary magazine or anthology. And you get to send me your feedback. I love to get constructive criticism, so don\u0027t be afraid to tell me exactly what you think. But if you just want to praise me to the stars, I\u0027m ok with that, too. \u003cstrong\u003eThe more I hear from you, the more I understand how to hone my craft to give you my absolute best!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, my emphasis is on stories dealing with some aspect of witchcraft, magic, and our \"spirit-haunted world.\" But I will often branch out and explore new things that excite me. I love the surreal and hallucinogenic, the fantastique and the bizarre. And at times, I will push myself to be personal, vulnerable and expose my own shadow through the work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStories will typically be between 3,000 and 8,000 words. Anything shorter than 3,000 words will end up as something in addition to larger work for patrons donating $2 or more.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my stories, patrons donating $10 will get access to artwork inspired by my writing, from my close friend and creative accomplice, Roxanne Cowles-MacPhail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://cubeupload.com/im/9FZfHB.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://cubeupload.com/im/9FZfHB.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.cubeupload.com/9FZfHB.jpg\" style=\"width: 286px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor each story, a high resolution ink sketch will be uploaded to the gallery. Some of these sketches will become full-fledged paintings, which will also, in due time, become available for viewing. \u003cstrong\u003eIf we end up with at least 15 subscribers to the $10 tier, Roxanne will turn some of my stories into short graphic novels. \u003c/strong\u003ePatrons at this tier will receive PDF copies of the comics, and may donate higher to receive print copies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Cl7DBWxF310/TWwuf84O_TI/AAAAAAAAAKo/Gv8gJCs2EaU/s1600/IMGP0577.JPG\" style=\"width: 356px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
