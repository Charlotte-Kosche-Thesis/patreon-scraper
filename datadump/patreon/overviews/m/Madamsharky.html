I\u0027m a Youtuber, voice actress, artist and a derpy nerd. I entertain through let\u0027s plays, sketches, and dubs, and I create photoshop magic with photomanipulations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eThat\u0027s nice, but why are you doing this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eFor those of you who don\u0027t know, I create content for fun and love to entertain others. \u00a0While there\u0027s been a demand for more of my ideas, I also must work at a day job. \u00a0This really cuts into time I could be spending not only on my videos, but to hire others to make some really epic stuff I have planned! \u00a0This Patreon is to be able to hire and pay a crew to do those big projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is NOT something I need to fund my living expenses.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0That is what my day job is for. \u00a0My videos on my Youtube channel will still be uploaded regularly for free, and I am financially secure. \u00a0I don\u0027t need this to survive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I DO want to make sure anyone I get on board to my projects is paid fairly. \u00a0All too often amazing talents can\u0027t find work that compensates them for their time, and this Patreon is to ensure that doesn\u0027t happen with my projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhat other projects do you have in mind?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eI\u0027ve got a couple of projects that I\u0027m developing, but I don\u0027t want to spoil the surprise. Once I have a more official project ready to go, I\u0027ll let you know and I\u0027m confident you\u0027ll love it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of our biggest goals is \u003cstrong\u003ean original film series possibly up to 15 episodes long and some indie games I want to develop (I already have scripts for two)\u003c/strong\u003e. Unfortunately, this kind of project is not cheap. Hence: Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhere would my money be going?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eLike I said, I have a day job, so I don\u0027t need this money for myself. \u00a0All of the money earned will be put into an account to fund the projects to better the content for the Youtube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally, I was hoping for Youtube to be able to help pay off the funding, but with the recent changes Youtube has placed, I felt like Patreon might be a more realistic option.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that in mind,this funding will go into bringing new people on board, i.e. \u003cstrong\u003ewriters, camera crew, editors\u003c/strong\u003e, etc. That money will also help us improve the quality of our current work through \u003cstrong\u003ebetter equipment and software\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s difficult to nail down an exact cost for these expenses, especially on a monthly basis, so for now the numbers are estimates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be 100% clear here. \u003cstrong\u003eThis Patreon campaign will not affect the videos that are uploaded regularly on Youtube! It will not take away any videos, either\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0This is solely for the purpose of pursuing bigger projects to compensate the crew accordingly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything beyond the amount I need? Well, thank you so much, you\u0027re helping me save up for bigger projects in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t stress this enough,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI am not asking you to pay for my living expenses or my Youtube videos\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m not here to try and force your hand for content that I provide to you for free on a regular basis. My channel is a labor of love, and always has been, and I want to make sure that you continue to enjoy it while I try to expand. I promise I\u0027m fed and fine! \u00a0No need to worry!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eAnything else we should know?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the first time I\u0027ve set up a funding account like this, so I\u0027m still learning and adjusting. There will always be moments where I will derp in terms of production, finding new people for projects and managing new deadlines. So with that in mind, please give me your understanding and patience, and I\u0027ll keep doing my best to create great content for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027re excited as I am for the amazing things coming up! Thank you all so very much!"
