At the time I really had no idea what I was doing or getting myself into. All I knew was that I loved helping others in a way that others had helped me in the past. I set out on a crusade to show the Internet that, \u003cstrong\u003eno matter how bad you were at a video game, all you needed to succeed was a little direction. \u003c/strong\u003eAnd so I began to make dungeon/raid guides for \u003cem\u003eFFXIV: A Realm Reborn\u003c/em\u003e.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy passion for content creation and our community grows every day but I\u0027ve been struggling finding balance. The current YouTube monetary system seems to favor and reward channels that produce a mass amount of videos catering to popular trends and flaunt borderline click-bait titles. I pride myself in offering quality over quantity but this is becoming increasingly difficult. This is where Patreon comes in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows me to work on the best possible content that you want to see without having to worry about \"making it\" in this broken system. You choose what to give. You\u2019ll see exactly where the money goes. \u003cstrong\u003eThis is an opportunity to help support the growth of my channel and an excellent way to be heard. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon contributions will allow me to freedom to put out projects that I\u0027ve been dying to work on, but never had the opportunity to do so. It also \u003cstrong\u003eallows supporters to back certain projects and help me make the videos YOU want to see.\u003c/strong\u003e"
