    "summary": "First of all, thank you for stopping by! I hope you find something here that will help you, or help someone you love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI suffer from major depressive disorder on the bipolar scale, as well as from suicidal tendencies and psychotic breaks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt sucks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut... I\u0027m still alive, and considering what those \"quirks\" of mine do to a person, that\u0027s not a small thing at all. My wife pointed out that a lot of people who are suffering depression - whether chemical or situational in nature - could perhaps be helped by hearing about My War on Suicide... and so this channel was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be posting weekly here - about my difficulties, my triumphs, the things I do to get through rough days, and the things I DON\u0027T do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to be candid. Not that I\u0027m going to talk about things that are better left to chats between consenting adults or anything like that, but if my week has sucked, I\u0027m going to talk about\u00a0 that. If it was great, I\u0027ll talk about \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMostly, I want people to know that I\u0027m still here. Because if I\u0027m here, maybe \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e can stick around as well. The world has enough death in it. Let\u0027s try not to be a part of those who jump into that pool on purpose. Together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, let\u0027s make suicide our enemy. I call this My War On Suicide, and as in any war, allies can make all the difference. I hope I can be yours, and knowing you\u0027re out there, too... that makes you mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best,\u003cbr\u003eMichaelbrent\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS Below is an article I wrote about the personal nature of one of my struggles... and (hopefully) a bit of hope behind it. More like this will be inside, as well as day-to-day looks at this disease, and one person\u0027s attempt to beat it - or at least hold it off.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Song of the Rafters \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e We moved a few years ago, and I was thrilled. Not because of the great neighborhood (though it was great), not because the new house was nice and big (though it was nice and big), not even because it came with its very own trampoline (boing!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e No. It was the garage. More to the point, it was the garage ceiling. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e See, in my old place, the garage had one of those ceilings with exposed rafters. You know the kind: perfect for shoving stuff that\u0027s not quite nice enough to actually have out, but not quite nasty enough to throw away. Keepsakes and mementos from some birthday you half remember; boxes just in case you move again; kids\u0027 toys that the next one in line will probably use. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The new place didn\u0027t have the exposed rafters. Which meant no more extra storage. The boxes would stick out like a sore thumb, right in the middle of the new garage. The keepsakes and mementos would have to find new homes -- or be thrown away outright. Old toys would be given away. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e But I was happy. Because in the old garage I spent hours looking up at those rafters, wondering which one would be the right one, the heaviest one, the strongest one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Which one would be the best one to hang myself from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Now, in every important way I have a pretty great life. I have a wife who is better than I deserve. I have children who fill me with wonder, and who make me laugh. I have a job that most people would kill for. So it\u0027s not like I should be trying to escape. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e But I also suffer from major depressive disorder with psychotic breaks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e This last part sounds scary. But don\u0027t worry: if you ever visit you don\u0027t have to worry about me trying to make a wallet out of your face-skin or anything. It just means that sometimes I am utterly incapable of understanding my proper relationship to the rest of the world. I can\u0027t conceive of a universe where I in any way belong. Of an existence that needs me, or where I have anything but a negative effect. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e So I would go to the garage. Or maybe I would stand in a corner and slap myself, because some dim part of my brain hoped that the physical pain would drive out a small bit of the far greater mental and emotional torment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The new garage doesn\u0027t have those rafters. It\u0027s just blank ceiling. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Although I suppose it doesn\u0027t really matter. I still get that way sometimes. Sigh. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Chances are that anyone reading this either suffers from or knows someone who suffers from depression. What do you do to help someone like that? Someone who has forgotten this one basic truth: that we all have value. That we all are special. That in our humanity lies a kernel not just of greatness, but of inestimable beauty. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I will tell you what my wife does. She isn\u0027t just my Dream Girl -- I could never have dreamed up something like her. She\u0027s my Better Than Dream Girl. And when I\u0027m at my worst, this is what she does, this is her magic: she follows me.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e She goes with me to the garage. She stands with me in my corner. She holds my hands firmly so I can\u0027t hurt myself, but not so tightly it hurts in and of itself. She whispers how she loves me, how she can\u0027t let me leave because that would be a wound to her and to the world. She says things she knows I cannot believe, but that I will look back on and remember -- things that will build a reservoir of strength for the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e She stands with me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e She eventually puts an arm around me and leads me to a couch or a bed. Still embracing me, she helps me to sit or to lay down. She holds me. Perhaps scratches my back in silence. The words are done. There is only the fact that she is there, that she is not going anywhere. The silent reminder that in this moment, in this small now... I am not alone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The great tragedy of depression is a crippling loneliness. A conviction that we are not and never can be worthy of anything but isolation. That the world has cut us off from all human connection -- and that that is a good thing, because any other person coming in contact with us would simply suffer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e What to do then? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Stay with us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e When we are ready, hold us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e And in so doing, show us that we have that spark of worth, that potential for beauty. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Depression will not allow us to believe in our value. It forbids us any hope.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e But... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e But I have found that -- with the right help, with the right friend -- it will allow the hope of future hope. And in that we may walk away from the rafters. We may move to new, safer places, and find brighter paths. \u003cbr\u003e"
