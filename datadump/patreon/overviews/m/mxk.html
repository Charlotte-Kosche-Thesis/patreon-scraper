I\u0027m an agender queer artist based in Los Angeles - so they/them pronouns only, please! I\u0027m a multimedia artist with a degree in English. My work is both cathartic and informative, with much of it focused on navigating the world as a nueroatypical genderweird artist. Special attention is given to areas of personal interest, including mythology, economic inequality and gender expression, among others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My ultimate goal is to survive on what I create, whatever form that takes at any given time, but until I can do that I\u0027m just going to keep my nose to the grind and try and make what I can in my spare time. A little bit can go a long way in helping free up the time, resources and energy I need to continue my quest for creative enlightenment, human connection and the amplification of ~love~ for all creatures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have ADD-1. It\u0027s obvious in the way that I work. I\u0027m not happy unless I have a handful of projects to work on simultaneously - that\u0027s what makes Patreon a perfect place to connect with my audience.
