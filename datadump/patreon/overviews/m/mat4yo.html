My name is Matteo.\u003cbr\u003eI create raps and tutorials under the name \"Mat4yo\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always strived to break the mold in a static medium. If people were following a certain pattern, I wanted to create a new one for people to feel more welcome in. That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to do here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a society that rewards simplicity and mindlessness, it is a struggle to create such in-depth content with consistency and results. Many creators find revenue pouring in from multiple easy-to-make videos daily, while one 6-month-long project doesn\u0027t even pay me back what I paid to make it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently have an innumerable amount of jobs, and half of them are unpaid. YouTube requires more work than most of these jobs. However, since there is no way for me to support myself by making videos due to a small audience, I need to shackle myself to stupid jobs that waste time to make money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of this Patreon is to allow me to keep making content before I graduate college...and if there\u0027s enough support here, I\u0027d have YOU to thank if I never have to stop making content! That\u0027s what I\u0027m looking for: sustainable content to educate and inspire the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support.
