    "summary": "Hello friend!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m admittedly a little nervous about asking for things but my music is becoming too major a part of my life for me to focus on much else so here goes: I\u0027m going to try to do this thing and live off of art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was scary to make the leap but I\u0027ve done a lot of crazy things, like grab my guitar and go live in my van in Los Angeles, so why not try this. So far I\u0027m getting by but now that I\u0027ve made the switch from living in the car to sharing a little studio apartment with my boyfriend (who also lives off of his art patreon.com/ericMesquivel) and I\u0027m commuting all around this big city to play gigs and practice with the band, the costs are higher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is weird. I\u0027m here asking you, you good people with jobs, to support my being an unemployed artist, to live off of what you give me. But you\u0027re so kind to me. You make me feel like it\u0027s important for me to make my songs. You tell me that you appreciate what I do. (And you kids ask me ALL the time if I have an album. Not yet - but I\u0027m getting there!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s what I ask: Help me stay afloat and I\u0027ll give you my all. The more you empower me to go forward the more I can make for you. Donate a few dollars and I\u0027ll be able to get out there and play little shows around town. Donate a few more, and I can create quality content like recordings and videos that you can take with you and make a part of your life. Donate maybe a few more and I can hit the road again, come to your city and play house shows in your living room. Let\u0027s make some cool shit.\u003cbr\u003e"
