So how\u2019s your\njourney so far? I have no idea how your story started but the sure thing is we\nare all bound to speak Korean- may not be today but one day. That\u2019s why you are\nhere and there is no turning back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDo you still remember the first time you scribbled\nyour name in Hangeul, took down a few expressions, and kept some notes about\nstuff you are good at now? It all started in a notebook and there\u2019s no way it\nwon\u2019t make its way to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are sharing our notes\nto everyone in the world who are as passionate as us in learning and teaching\nKorean. We may not be the best language resource around, but you never know until you try.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are trying to keep this blog unique by\nsharing things we learned from teaching English and learning Korean at the same\ntime. Cross-examining languages is a fun thing to do and it takes you beyond\nthe horizon. You will realize that what is true to one language may not be true\nto another language and what matters is not only grammar but nuance as well.\nSometimes, you will be flustered by the number of ways a single term has in\nanother language and that what MKN is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe hope you enjoy our compilation of notes and\nillustrations made by yours truly. If you find any error, please let us know.\nYour help makes this project better. For queries and concerns, feel free to reach\nus through the contact form and Facebook. We are just a click away.\u003c/div\u003e"
