    "summary": "Before you read this -- if you want to -- check out my music at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gullveig.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBandcamp\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0Check out my website, too, if you want to know a little more about me and stuff I make: \u003ca href=\"http://miriampultro.com\"\u003ehttp://miriampultro.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe it takes denying your own art to generate it. Maybe it takes a new kind of desperation to ask for help. This, I suppose, is my version of asking for a raise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe it took getting kicked out of my house, having to borrow money from a dear friend (as well as my partner), and the desperation of having worked -- I counted -- *twenty-five* since moving to Melbourne in 2015. Only two of which I quit. Only one unceremoniously. Because of an abusive male boss. And one of which I lost mere minutes before relaunching this campaign in June 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could go on and on about the pros and cons of monetizing art, but all that really remains to be said is this: I extend these Things to you, and hope you like them. If you feel compelled to give monetarily, please do. I could use it. I am a hardworking bitch who\u0027s worked harder the last two years than ever in her life, but I still need help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s how this works: you will be able to download all of the music, writing, film, and artwork I release for free, whether or not you pledge to support me monetarily. You can donate $1 a month to help support me. Or $5. Or $10. Or $50. You\u0027ll be charged monthly, on the 1st of each month, and you are able to change or cancel your patronage at any time. Even if you cannot give money, please still download all the music I release, and enjoy it, and share it online!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money you pledge will help me survive -- pay bills, eat, and generally Not Die. :) But it will also help me find time to rest instead of working 40 hours a week in a kitchen after 30 hours of classes. To spend the care and time shaping my musical (five songs nearly complete written and five more begun). To write, to practice, to produce, to make. To give. To spread. To share. (To see, to sell, to get, to bring ...)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love you. I support you. You are seen, you are worthy, you are an artist, you are valid, you exist, you create, *you are successful.*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc9c\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~ Miri ~\u003cbr\u003e"
