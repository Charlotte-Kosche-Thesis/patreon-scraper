If you\u0027re here, you most likely will know who I am. For those who don\u0027t, I\u0027m best known for doing fanart in general.

We all have bills to pay and we all work hard to earn a living so even a dollar is very precious. If you pledge at least that dollar and show your support, it\u0027ll help me pay a bill or two, devote the extra time I could have spent working for someone else to get the same amount of money towards my art so you can enjoy more of it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"61\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4I1L4y42xbA4kRXtPUKSyNfui84-EEseSD8pXMq6Z7t11nLIns7rcItUfP_4G-KVcTCINr__XYduKe4UK_Lo9GdsZ24xRnEueUSfhUgTMQRwl8daZRUBeRi6rJnRI6OKXM8M5FlW\" width=\"624\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how it\u0027s going to work.

It isn\u0027t about making people pay for paywall content. It isn\u0027t just about the rewards.

That\u0027s the main incentive. However, I don\u0027t want you to think like that. It\u0027s about supporting your favorite artist. If you insist, the other incentives are being able to see my art in high resolution and getting previews of the pictures in progress every now and then. I also include commissions and public posts, if any, in high resolution as a bonus.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, I\u0027ve been pledged for more than a month now and I haven\u0027t seen you post this reward picture publicly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t post all the reward pictures publicly in one shot. I spread them out throughout a span of 1-2 months. Ideally, I can post them all before the month\u0027s over but there are sometimes pictures that do not get posted for a few reasons.\u00a0\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI just haven\u0027t gotten around to it and I \nend up forgetting it even existed. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI feel that it\u0027s not ready to \npost. Some pictures are not fully fleshed out or aged enough for me to \nspot any potential flaws with them. When this happens, I won\u0027t be able \nto post it until I fix them which I usually don\u0027t have time for. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI \nfeel that the picture will not get a lot of attention so it remains at \nthe bottom of the barrel. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou\u0027re not on the right platform that I \nposted the picture on.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut I like the picture and so will others.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, but I have to like it too.

Once your pledge goes through, you\u0027ll be able to gain access to the Patreon feed where I post the rewards. It\u0027s recommended you pledge in the first half or close to the beginning of the month because you will be charged the beginning of the following month and each month after that if you stay pledged. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs there a way to see past rewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePast rewards are available to their respective tiers on the Patreon feed. They are also posted publicly outside of Patreon but has no indication that it\u0027s a Patreon reward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you have 2 Patreon pages?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis page is SFW and once \nyou set NSFW on a Patreon page, it gets treated differently than SFW pages. There are also people who only want to see one of the two, \nespecially the people who doesn\u0027t approve of NSFW at all and only want \nto see SFW content. There\u0027s no easy way to mix the two. Having 2 pages \nisn\u0027t a greedy attempt to get more support. I don\u0027t want to maintain 2 \npages either.\u003cbr\u003e"
