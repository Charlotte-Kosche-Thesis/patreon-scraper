Well, our\nMental Health system in general could use some help. \n\n\nYou wouldn\u0027t believe how a single therapy session or good assessment can dramatically change a person\u0027s life for the better. Fortunately, it doesn\u0027t take a ton of\nmoney for other Community Therapist or myself to make that happen and you can\ntotally help me with that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI already\nspend entirely too much time in Juvenile Court or placing kids in long-term\nresidential treatment because they didn\u2019t get the services they needed. The new\nhealth care reform is set to cut more than $60 Billion from the federal\nMedicaid budget. Aside from the overall lack of funding this will cause, mental\nhealth services will likely suffer significant defunding, not to mention\nPrivate Insurance premiums and coverage increasing. Mental health diagnosis are\nbeing considered \u201cpreexisting conditions\u201d which puts them at risk of not being\ncovered.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want Match Point Community to be an resource for people in the event\nthey don\u0027t have the means to get the services they truly need. \u00a0I\u0027ll trade\nyou all of these goodies for pledges to fund my \"Pro Bono Adventures\"\nso I don\u0027t have to turn down needy families when they come looking for help.
