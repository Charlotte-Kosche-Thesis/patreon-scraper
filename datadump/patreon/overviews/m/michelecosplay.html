    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi there!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Michele, I\u0027m a 22 year old Cosplayer from Germany. I started cosplay in 2016 with my Lara Croft Tomb Raider Legend Cosplay! Beside Cosplay I do also streams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe origin behind my Cosplay Story lies many, many, many years ago - Better said when I was 16. I played a lot of games (since now), was a very shy person and didn\u0027t really had friends except of those, that I met on the internet. Since I was six years old I adored Lara Croft. A strong, independend woman. I always wanted to be like her. \u003cstrong\u003eThen I found a page called Laracroftcosplay.com where I saw tutorials how you can make your own costume!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAnd there was this word\u003cstrong\u003e \"Cosplay\"...what is cosplay?\" \u003c/strong\u003eAfter research I felt so overwhelmed and was very interested in this \"Cosplay\". But I knew that the current conditions won\u0027t allow me to do this. So I waited three years. Read and saw techniques how to make different cosplay stuff. It was like a school to me.\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e In 2015 I had many changes in my life. At this point I needed something that will give me positivity, joy...and this was cosplay. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI bought my Lara Croft Cosplay, put it on and was totally happy. A big dream of mine came true. And at this point I knew, that this is this, what I want to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplay gives me not only joy, but also knowledge about new techniques, friends, and a place where I feel comfortable.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m so happy to\u003cstrong\u003e have family, friends\u003c/strong\u003e and\u003cstrong\u003e my community \u003c/strong\u003ethat are supporting me!\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eI appreciate every kind of support. I am so grateful to have you guys! I never thought that this hobby is not given even me joy, but also you.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy wish is to do \u003cstrong\u003einvest more time in cosplay, maybe even make it to my lifetime job\u003c/strong\u003e. The first steps were made. But it\u0027s a very long and though way to get there. Some of my community wants to support me financially and so I created my patreon. My goal here is not even to fullfill my wish but also to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003emake this community even bigger and more together!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I want to give you rewards for your support, because \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eit\u0027s not usual to get such support.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you expect being a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWIP\u0027s and FMA Videos about my Trips to awesome Conventions, Behind the Scenes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDigital Photos of my recent Cosplay\u0027s\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCosplay Video\u0027s where you can see me in Action (Or something like that :D )\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTutorials and Booklet\u0027s of my Cosplay Projects\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSigned Prints and Phone Wallpaper\u0027s\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFanservice like Fansigns, Exclusive Photo\u0027s (sometime Boudoir or Photos of my Cosplay\u0027s that are exclusively only for higher Tier\u0027s)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHandmade Items\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConnect with me via Steam, Discord and Skype\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlaying some games together like GWENT\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI know that I\u0027m not a very known Cosplayer and I\u0027m a beginner still, but everyone stared small and with you we can make this even bigger!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

There were some people asking me if I have patreon and to be honest, first I wasn\u0027t a friend of it. But I want to reward those who are supporting me with special prints, exclusive videos like tutorials or some communitytalk via Discord during a stream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery support means a lot to me! Either money or only spread my cosplay page on social media! \u0026lt;3 It\u0027s not a must to support me via patreon, but if you want to I would be very happy!",
