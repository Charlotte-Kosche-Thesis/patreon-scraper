That\u0027s a ship I drew all by myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s right. I\u0027m an artist, and in my not-so-humble opinion I\u0027m a pretty good one. I\u0027ve been hard at work, honing my talents for years, ever since I was able to pick up a pencil. Most of my talent is specialized in handling technical illustrations, but I\u0027ve been known to draw a human or two:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/DRAjWoi.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHandsome guy there, huh? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, I bet you\u0027re also wondering what the deal is with me putting \"modeling\" at the top of the page. Well, I\u0027m not about to put on a pair of tighty-whities and strut about on stage, but I can pick up an eXacto knife and a pot of glue and build something cool:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NpKW6ib.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only is that model entirely lit with LED lights with a self-contained power source, it\u0027s entirely scratch built. That\u0027s right, I picked up some sheets of plastic, cut them out, and built a model of a ship from Star Wars. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I don\u0027t just build big. I also build small:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/IJr6VEW.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo whatever your heart desires... models, drawings, paintings, sculpture... I can handle it. And if you send some money my way, you can have a small bit of my talent for yourself that you can hang up on your wall, set on a shelf, or use at the gaming table. And really, who wouldn\u0027t want some of that stuff up there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome on... click the button. You know you wanna!\u003cbr\u003e"
