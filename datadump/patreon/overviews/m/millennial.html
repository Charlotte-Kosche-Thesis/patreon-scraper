    "summary": "We are the team that brought you the original Jurassic Park. We crafted the first craft beer. We patented the concept of social commentary and invented the cat meme revolution. We are #viral and apathetic, digital, entitled and diverse. We are the iEra of human evolution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are #Millennial.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we\u2019re here to change the world. Armed only with the ubiquitous power of USB headsets and mediocre production value, we will not rest until every important news story has been unearthed, turned to click-bait, and generated at least 300 pointless internet comments. We\u2019re like Walter Cronkite with attitude, if Walter Cronkite had been an idiot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur show unpacks the previous week\u2019s news, both stories that made headlines and a lot of important ones that didn\u2019t. Each episode is a mix of serious and fun, as seen through the filter of four Millennials with very different tastes, perspectives and areas of expertise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast is free, but we count on your kind support to keep it going. In exchange, here on Patreon, we\u0027re dedicated to uploading kickass bonus content on a weekly basis-- from video blogs to additional show segments, from physical goods to our flagship benefit \"After Dark.\" We take this shit seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisit our website to subscribe to the show and learn more: \u003ca href=\"http://www.millennialshow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.millennialshow.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
