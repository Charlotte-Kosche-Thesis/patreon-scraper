    "summary": "Whimsical mail by subscription. Postcards, tiny books \u0026amp; curios all lovingly created by hand and delivered to you monthly. Who knows what\u0027s coming this month? It will be beautiful - perhaps a bit macabre - a small surprise, anyway, and over time you\u0027ll build up a collection worthy of display in your own miniature gallery while giving an artist the greatest gift of all: a predictable income!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWelcome to Many Tiny Books, an ongoing mixed media art project by mail, created by Michelle Margaret Lefevre. With my background in sewing, a special interest in embroidery and a lifelong penchant for collecting pretty bits and pieces, I\u0027m going to create a body of work that draws on other media such as photography, writing, assemblage and papercraft to express a particular vision of an alternate time and place, and deliver it directly to my patrons via postcards and other physical mail. There\u0027s something delightful about mail, about tangible objects you can hold in your hands appearing in your mailbox as if by magic. Each month you\u0027ll know something\u0027s coming, but not exactly when or what will show up. That feeling is part of what I want to give you, a few moments of anticipation and curiosity and discovery. Let me lift you out of your world for just a second, by sending you a small piece of mine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe entire process will be documented here on Patreon as I post sketches, progress photos, prototypes, and record my thoughts and plans for the project exclusively for my patrons to see. Four reward tiers are available to start, and as we progress an additional tier will become available which will introduce a self-contained storytelling element. I want to leave room for this project to change and evolve organically, so in addition to signing up to get pretty mail, you\u0027ll also be buying your ticket and climbing aboard this imaginary train bound for parts unknown, where we\u0027ll find the story together. I\u0027d so love to have you along for the ride!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
