How I\u0027ll be using your support, why I\u0027d want it in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell here goes: I am a creator. Period. Always have been. I started drawing when I was four, writing when I was six. I made my aunt clean out the broom closet under her stairs, converted it into my private \"studio\"; dragged a stool, her typewriter and paper in there and wouldn\u0027t come out for anything other than food or the bathroom for days until I\u0027d written my first \"book\". \u003cbr\u003eI was seven.\u003cbr\u003eI cannot HELP but create. I see things and immediately plot lines and backstory, details and concepts come flying out of the aether and into my skull like super-sonic jet bats with cerebral cargo. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e When it comes to sex and sensuality, I think our convoluted and suppressed relationship to our bodies, the multiple sexual traumas that SOOOOO many individuals experience before they\u0027ve even reached the age of 13, the dearth of sex-positive influences in most of our lives during our most formative years- all of these things are MASSIVE contributors to much of the violence, divisions, lack of common decency, and immensely misogynist legislation and norms of most of the societies I\u0027ve been exposed to all round the globe. \u003cbr\u003eI think that one super simple way to address these things is to create art that leaves people feeling super titillated, inspired, delighted, aroused, and \u003cem\u003eHAPPY\u003c/em\u003e_ thereby sourcing what healthy, engaging, empowering sexuality can look like without having to  expound on what it shouldn\u0027t look like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor quite some time now I\u0027ve had a vision, a dream of manifested erotica-\u003cstrong\u003e the \u003cem\u003eL.E.R [Le Erotique Randomme]\u003c/em\u003e: a long-term, multi-media, multi-dimensional project of epic proportions that is going to be boulder in the watered ripples of our collective experience.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve decided to use Patreon for it AND an abundance of my other art, spoken, written, illustrated and otherwise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour choice to become my continuing patron directly translates into the creation of incredible, unique, well done art and erotica in several forms. Your support fashions a container within which I get to live even more fully as a proud papa to my BEAUTIFUL daughter, partner to my unmarried-for-ten-years-running wife, and \u003cstrong\u003eCREATOR OF LOTS AND LOTS OF AMAZING, ENVELOPE-PUSHING, PARADIGM-SHIFTING, HOLYWHATAREYOUTHINKING AAARRRT!!!\u003c/strong\u003e"
