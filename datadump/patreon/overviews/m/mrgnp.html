    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Morgan and I\u0027m making resources to support survivors of sexual violence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I run a support group for men (trans, cis, and intersex) and non-binary people (of any/no gender expression) who have experienced sexual violence. It\u0027s a peer-led space where survivors can discuss their experiences and build solidarity and community with other survivors, and it\u0027s one of only two support groups in the whole UK which is focused on men and explicitly includes non-binary people (ours was inspired by \u003ca href=\"http://www.mesmac.co.uk/find-help/support-groups/leeds-survivors-support-group\"\u003ethe other one, which is in Leeds\u003c/a\u003e). We have fortnightly meetings in Glasgow, and a fortnightly chat group online. Here\u0027s our \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NotYourFaultgroup/\"\u003efacebook\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp; \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/notyourfault_\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a \u003ca href=\"http://morganpotts.com/essays-editorial/\"\u003ewriter\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://morganpotts.com/lectures-workshops/\"\u003espeaker\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://plantdad.bandcamp.com/\"\u003emusician\u003c/a\u003e, but that\u0027s not why I\u0027m on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a lack of services for people who are trans, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming who don\u0027t identify with womanhood, but also aren\u0027t comfortable navigating spaces directed primarily toward cis men. Trans people are significantly more likely to experience sexual violence than cis people, and the violence we face is gendered, but there are very few resources which include us. There are even less resources for trans survivors which are free, accessible to people with mobility access needs and autism, and don\u0027t require proof of address or immigration status. Our group is run by two trans and non-binary people who are survivors ourselves. We\u0027re both unpaid volunteers who saw a lack of vital services for survivors like us, so we decided to do something about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWe want to create the infrastructure to support survivors, and\u003cbr\u003eultimately create a culture of support which combats rape culture\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause we\u0027re unpaid, our capacity to do this important support work is limited. I have many freelance jobs of varying levels of precarity, and at the moment I can only dedicate about an hour a week to the support group, plus the time in the group itself. If I\u0027m going to do more, I need to be paid for my labor.

And, we burn out. I don\u0027t want to burn out. This work is too important and I want to make it sustainable for me to do it on an ongoing, indefinite basis.

I\u0027m not a professional and it feels weird to professionalize my role by asking to be paid for my work, but a big part of the work i want to do is to de-professionalize it and enable / empower other non-professionals to support survivors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are no immediate, tangible \"results\" of these projects if you\u0027re not accessing these resources yourself. But if you become a patron, you\u0027ll be directly supporting survivors (me and my co-facilitator), and supporting the support work we do to support other survivors. You\u0027ll be contributing to creating a culture of support for survivors, countering rape culture with direct action, and building solidarity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for supporting survivors supporting survivors \ud83d\udc9c\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
