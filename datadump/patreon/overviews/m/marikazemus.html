    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eMy history as a character designer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making illustrations for a long time; since was a toddler, in fact. I believe my first illustration was a crayon etching of Mario making the big jump on Royal Raceway from \u003cem\u003eMario Kart 64.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Y\u0027know, the one with the castle? Anyway, ever since then, I\u0027ve continued to improve on my craft. I got my first tablet, a Wacom Intuos 4, around sophomore year of high school, and that\u0027s when I began uploading my work to websites like DeviantArt and Furaffinity. I\u0027ve since carved out my own artistic style and techniques, blending both western and eastern design conventions into my lively and unique characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I like designing characters?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSimply put, I\u0027m a storyteller, and characters are vessels for stories. I like to give each one I create a unique backstory and personality, which can further influence their design, as well as any upgrades I might give them later on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow did I get into drawing smut?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHonestly, it initially started as a means of better understanding anatomy, but it quickly spiraled into erotic artwork. It helped me become a part of some very friendly and creative art communities around the internet, particularly the anthro community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat programs and utilities do you use?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI currently use \u003cem\u003ePaint Tool SAI\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eAdobe Photoshop CC 2015 \u003c/em\u003ein conjunction with a Wacom Intuos Pro tablet and a Windows 10 Dell Inspiron 15 7000.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my endgame?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eArt is really its own reward, but if I wanted to get anything out of this aside from the love and support of my fans, it would be to release a successful series of graphic novels, erotic or otherwise, starring my original characters. My magnum opus, \u003cem\u003eDeath\u0027s Metal,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0can only come to be if I fine-tune my illustration skills enough to make it a reality. That, as well as the financial benefits, is why I have come to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I reward you for your patronage?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMore illustrations, of course. Depending on how much you pledge, you can get a drawing from me. I hold monthly raffles, with your patronage determining how likely you are to be drawn. You also get high-quality packs of my work at the end of each month, and early viewership of my original work right here on this website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI hope you consider signing on! Have a lovely day.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e"
