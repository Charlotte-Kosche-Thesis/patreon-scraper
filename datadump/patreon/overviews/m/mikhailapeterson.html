    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHi! My name is Mikhaila Peterson. I\u2019m a 25-year-old student (and now mom!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything I put on my blog (www.mikhailapeterson.com) is free for everyone to see. My diet, suggestions, recipes, research, etc. I\u0027ve seen websites where you have to pay to get diet information and that can stop people from pursuing that information. I\u0027d like as many people to see this as possible. Patreon is so I can focus more time on the blog. I have a lot of information to share, and this diet has helped many people control serious issues (that are supposedly uncontrollable without medication). Arthritis, excessive fatigue, sweating, depression, anxiety, muscle pain, skin problems, weight problems, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor people who are here through my father (Jordan Peterson), my blog has the diet he\u0027s on now. This is the diet that is treating his depression successfully, as well as other health problems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was diagnosed with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis when I was 7 years old. My parents think it started when I was around 2. I was the first child in Canada to be put on injections of Enbrel, an immune suppressant. I was also put on injections of Methotrexate. When I was 12, I was diagnosed with severe depression. I started taking Cipralex (Celexa), an SSRI. I was on a very high dose for a child. That dose increased into my teenage years and early 20\u2019s. When I was 17 I had a hip and an ankle replacement, caused by joint deterioration from the arthritis. At 20 I was prescribed Adderall to keep myself awake. I was sleeping for approximately 17 hours a day, completely missing out on life. I was later diagnosed with Ideopathic\u00a0Hypersomnia.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the peak of my medicated times I was taking:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor Arthritis:\u003c/strong\u003e Enbrel and Methotrexate, (immune suppressants). Folic Acid because of the Methotrexate. Tylenol 3 so I could sleep at night without as much pain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor depression:\u003c/strong\u003e Cipralex and Wellbutrin\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor fatigue:\u003c/strong\u003e Adderall to keep me awake, Gravol and Lorazepam to put me to sleep from the Adderall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor my skin:\u003c/strong\u003e Minocycline (antibiotic), and later dapsone (antibiotic)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther:\u003c/strong\u003e Birth control (Seasonique)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been on way more than that too. That was just at \u003cem\u003eone point in time\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, all in all, I was very sick.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeptember\u00a02015 I went on an elimination diet to see if I could control my arthritic symptoms (with extreme skepticism and limited hope). I gave up halfway through and made almond flour banana muffins. 3 days later I couldn\u0027t walk. After a successful elimination diet for 1 month (and much less skepticism), my arthritis went away.\u00a0 Three months later my depression disappeared. Five months later my fatigue disappeared. I lost 30 pounds. The story is a lot more complicated but that\u0027s the gist of it. I put my dad on the same diet for his health issues and eventually they resolved too. Lifelong problems, gone (controllable).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy arthritis ate my hip and my ankle but I haven\u2019t experienced anything more debilitating than depression. Everything wrong with me was diet related. Arthritis, depression, anxiety, lower back pain, chronic fatigue, brain fog, itchy skin, acne, tiny blisters on my knuckles, floaters, mouth ulcers, twitching at night, night sweats, tooth sensitivity, the list goes on, but everything was diet related. Every single thing wrong with me was fixable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started a blog to write down my experiences with the diet. I\u0027m writing what it\u0027s like to have a serious mental problem, an autoimmune disease, pregnancy, and I\u0027m almost delving into the newest research about immune responses to food, the gut, etc. I have the list of foods that healed my dad and me there too. I don\u0027t want to charge anyone for any of the information I put up. I want anybody to have access to this information. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is for people who want to support me, or who think I\u0027ve helped them in some way. I\u0027m going to be a stay at home mom for the next while (lucky me - but it\u0027s hard money wise), so every dollar helps. I\u0027d really like to devote more time to the blog, writing, and YouTube videos. I think this is incredibly important and if I had had this information earlier, I would\u0027ve saved my joints.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, I\u0027m not a medical doctor. All of my information and suggestions come from reading scientific articles, slow and painful testing on myself, and talking to other people with similar problems. I have a lot of information to share and would like to help people avoid some of the more painful mistakes I made and continue to make, trying to figure things out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
