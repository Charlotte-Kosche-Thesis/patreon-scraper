I\u0027m a streamer and modder of Tekken.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI hope to one day become a top Tekken streamer and change the standards of Tekken with my unique style of play. I love to create mods and new content for my viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has such an amazing system which I never knew could be so possible! Through Patreon, I have the opportunity to do what I love and support my followers. As creating content takes HOURS, Patreon gives me much more confidence and helps me interact more with my viewers.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eF.A.Q.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a service where you can pledge to send a regular payment to creators, so they can support themselves and keep making new things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is more suited towards creators rather first or third-party sponsorships. Patreon lets me create for my viewers alone. With this system, viewers choose when content is created and sometimes what can be created.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will I end up paying and how often?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou pay each month. I will always release at least one video per month, but usually I dish out two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need the money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to travel to tournaments and meet with some of the best players in the United States. This money also goes towards\u00a0purchasing equipment for the stream (things likes higher quality microphones, hard drives, new monitors), games, and new fight sticks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Patrons pledging\u003cstrong\u003e $1\u003c/strong\u003e or more receive info on upcoming videos, tutorials, and mods in my Discord!

However, this will be granted once your first payment has been processed (occurs at the start of the month).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything else important that I should know?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTekken may change the functionality of all mods in the future. By pledging, you agree that I am not responsible for any mods that do not work in the future by the release of any Tekken updates provided by Namco. Should these mods stop working, me and my team will try our very best to get things running back up to speed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*\u003c/strong\u003eAll sessions must be planned at least one week in advance.
