It means people coming together to create a world of\nself-determined worker owned cooperatives, intentional communities,\nlocal food initiatives, mutual aid societies, barter and local\ncurrency exchange networks and a host of other materially meaningful\nsystems. To get there, we need tremendous skills building for\ncooperation and a clear analysis of our economic system, and we need to build up these alternatives as legitimate, powerful tools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u0027s where I come\nin. I\u0027m a cooperative culture pioneer, and I\u0027m working my butt off to bring that new world into being. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI have spent the\nlast 27 years as an activist: writing, teaching, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS8YeDKKBcU\"\u003espeaking\u003c/a\u003e and\ngenerally rousing rabble, all in service to creating a just,\nsustainable, cooperative world. I live in and often work for\nintentional communities. Resiliency (and especially finding\ncommunity-based solutions to climate change and economic insecurity)\nis a major theme in my work. I have a healthy spiritual streak as\nwell as being a major fan of radical politics and practical action. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePlus I write poetry.\nSome of it is even good.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe core values of\nmy work are: cooperation, authenticity, compassion, humor, passion\nand humility. I\u0027m explicitly anti-oppression (especially around race\nand class) and anti-capitalist in my approach.  (The irony of crowd\nfunding to help take down capitalism is not lost on me. We live in\nweird times.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI also do\nsignificant volunteer time, with the \u003ca href=\"http://www.ic.org\"\u003eFellowship for Intentional Community\u003c/a\u003e, co-founding a new \u003ca href=\"https://www.ic.org/directory/laramie-ecovillage-project/\"\u003eanti-oppression, sustainable living commune in Wyoming\u003c/a\u003e, and with\nthe local Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, and the \u003ca href=\"https://neweconomy.net/\"\u003eNew Economy Coalition\u003c/a\u003e. All of this work is important and none of it is paid. Also in the currently unpaid category is work with two collaborators on a new \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eCooperative Culture Handbook\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Books need to be written many moons before any money flow happens, which makes clearing out the time to get it done a bit tricky.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI produce an occasional blog, video and music list just for my patrons. I try to touch in here at least every few weeks with something. But please know that much of my work is happening outside of electronic space. I will try to keep you updated on what that looks like as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also continue my practice of keeping my workshop and\nconsulting fees low enough to be accessible, a practice which has\nstarted to feel unsustainable for me without some other means of\nsupport. \u003cstrong\u003eSo thank you on behalf of all the working class and poor people who will be able to\ncontinue to afford interacting with me! \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t become\na patron at this time, no worries. I know living in late stage\ncapitalism means that many of us with good urges can\u0027t follow through\nwith dollars, especially on a monthly basis. If you are more up for\none-time support and want more of my content, please consider getting\nmy new book, \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.ic.org/community-bookstore/product/together-resilient-building-community/\"\u003eTogether Resilient: Building Community in the Age of Climate Disruption\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"

The irony of crowd funding for my work is not lost on me--I am explicitly anti-capitalist in my approach. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKey words to describe how I do my work: compassion, community, authenticity, passion and accessibility.\u003c/strong\u003e I have a deep commitment to doing my own work and supporting others, particularly in the areas of anti-racism and anti-classism, and am a queer feminist. I write poetry. Some of it is even good. I am a co-founder of an anti-oppression commune that we are working on getting off the ground in Wyoming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything I do is ultimately motivated by wanting a world that is sustainable, resilient and just. Sustainability was my first love as a professional, and no matter what I\u0027m doing, it connects back to wanting the planet to be deeply cared for, both for our sake and Hers. I have a strong spiritual streak that shows up in my work. I also can swear like a sailor when it seems aligned with the intensity of what I am feeling and seeing. I do a fair bit of volunteer work, especially for the Fellowship for Intentional Community, but also for the New Economy Coalition and locally through the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m seeking funding because this package of things is hard to get funded. I have applied for jobs and grants, have tried to make it as a consultant and freelance trainer, and am one of the many thousands of people doing good work while struggling to pay the bills, because dismantling the system is hard to get supported within the system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy commitment to you all is that I will continue to write, speak, teach and organize-- here, on social media and in the wide world. I will continue to do my own growth work and be an encourager of others do the same.\u003c/strong\u003e Expect to see essays, poetry and short talks posted here. Also expect that as the support here grows, so too will my role in creating a new organization with partners of similar orientation and passion, called \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gMabYxt1tRCvdTWPrnG92MqGAbCVVQZPT6g0w7jLVjY/edit#slide=id.g250fecee66_0_9\"\u003eCooperative Revolution\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are unable to become a patron at this time, that\u0027s cool.
