Creating art and learning new things still keeps me motivated every day, and I want those that view my videos to feel that same happiness and contentment. \u00a0Being creative can help you out of the most difficult of times, because there is always some new idea we can try, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54,96,146);\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WCqhQOUCN20/TfygqquZdsI/AAAAAAAAAFc/RJISzjwgG94/s320/shoe+from+my+happy+flower+finished.jpg\"\u003eTaking the Alternative Route...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life has become pretty unconventional to the people who live around me, in many ways. \u00a0I create art, \u00a0which many people believe is only good for a hobby, and not really a practical, worthwhile contribution to society (well just lock me up and throw away the key), and on top of that I gave up a very safe, \u00a0salary job as a public school teacher, to ... gasp ... \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ehomeschool!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (Insert here a long pause for those who would like to stare at me in a confused manner...nothing new I see that look every time I tell someone what I do). \u00a0But those of you who understand that stubborn feeling that you don\u0027t want to do the same thing as everyone else, will understand me. \u00a0You want to be original. \u00a0To break free, do things your way, be yourself, and perhaps also let your kids have the freedom to be themselves too. \u00a0We are all different and unique...just take a look at your own beautifully designed fingerprints, which no one else in the world owns but you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54,96,146);\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sMUa-kCuM_w/TivzYN1PVdI/AAAAAAAAAGs/jDPNCzXdGc4/s400/scribbler+tree+work+in+progress+copy.jpg\" style=\"width: 227px;\"\u003eDoing What I Love...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that is the state of mind I am coming from. \u00a0I have never been good with other humans telling me what to do (believe me this has made my life pretty difficult sometimes!) and I am always much more productive when I have thought of an idea on my own. \u00a0\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eI want to show other people, starting with my own three children, that you can use your skills and talents to design your own way of earning a living, as well as being able to incorporate those skills into taking care of your family responsibilities. Working for someone else is all fine and good, and maybe it gives a feeling of safety, but you have to give up time with your family, and neglect the special abilities that you have been gifted with, just to earn money. Why not use what you are good at, and incorporate it into your daily life, as well as inspiring your family to do the same? \u00a0Don\u0027t you reckon we were given our special talents for a reason?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54,96,146);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s My Cake And Yes I\u0027m Gonna Eat It...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy friend once said to me that I was trying to \u0027have my cake and eat it too\u0027. \u00a0Sometimes the pressure from others to just go with the flow and do what everyone else is doing can be really overwhelming. \u00a0More than a few times I have thought seriously about giving up and joining the crowd. \u00a0Wouldn\u0027t things be so much easier? \u00a0But I don\u0027t think so. \u00a0I\u0027m happy teaching my kids and making my art, and teaching my family to be creative thinkers. \u00a0I don\u0027t want to give up now, I have come this far. \u00a0Things can get pretty tough, though, especially when you are relying on one income (and sometimes no income when things get really tricky). \u00a0My husband has a lot of pressure to support our family. \u00a0But NOT ONCE has he ever said I should go back to work as a teacher, or put the kids in school. \u00a0All he ever does is encourage me. \u00a0He fixes my computer, buys art materials for me and the kids, and shares my artwork with family and friends. \u00a0I would like to be able to take some of the pressure off him financially. \u00a0Even though my art videos have always been (and always will be) free for people to watch, it would be nice to be able to say \u0027Hey honey, here\u0027s some money to help with the rent, or the food, or whatever\u0027. \u00a0I don\u0027t want to have my cake and throw it out the window, if you know what I mean!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54,96,146);\"\u003eI Can\u0027t Do This On My Own...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is where Patreon comes in. \u00a0Here I can connect with like-minded people who appreciate the hard work that goes into creating art. \u00a0With your support and encouragement through Patreon, I can free up more of my time to create cool stuff for you, and perhaps not have to worry so much about the financial side of things. \u00a0I know I have the ideas, I know I can do it, I just need your help to bring these ideas to life, and use my artwork to inspire everyone who comes into contact with it. \u00a0But I want to do so much more. \u00a0Here are some of my (perhaps a little over ambitious) goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eGain the time to learn better skills, and\npurchase better equipment and materials for making my videos really awesome!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eMake more videos, and improve my videos to make\nthem clearer, more professional,  and\neasier to follow.  \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eBranch out into different media, and also into\n3D work and learn to animate my drawings and paintings and bring them to life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eEarn enough to allow my very supportive and hard\nworking husband to spend more time with our homeschooling family so that we can\nwork together more as a team/family venture, instead of all the financial\npressure being just on him.
