    "summary": "There is so much misinformation out on the interwebs about Christianity and the Bible which is strange because, in many ways, they are both very simple and boil down to one thing -- \u003cem\u003ebe the love.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing has always been about putting those three words into action (sometimes even political). I\u0027d love to do more of it -- a lot more of it. And friends are always asking when I\u0027ll write my next piece. The thing is, it\u0027s not a paying gig and, as much as I love it, my family and I like me having an income.  Who doesn\u0027t?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon campaign is sort of like an ongoing Kickstarter.\u00a0It\u0027s pretty simple. You just pledge whatever amount you think a blog post is worth and you can even set a monthly limit. For example, if you pledge 4 bucks a post and there are 8 post that month, you\u0027d chip in $36. You could, however, also set a limit of $30 a month. So, even if I write 20 posts in a month, you\u0027d still just chip in $30. (I\u0027m actually aiming for 6-8 posts a month).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, this is just an interesting way to crowdsource funding an artist you appreciate and would like to see more creations from.\u00a0I\u0027m hoping I\u0027m one of those people for you. Thanks for you consideration and contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne last thing, even if you aren\u0027t interested in funding you can be a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ebig\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e help by simply sharing this post around social media along with a note about what you think of my work. Thanks!"
