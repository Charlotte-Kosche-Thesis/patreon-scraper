I must\nfind a way to support this project, since I currently have no stable academic position. This is where you come in. By supporting my writing, you enable the production\nof a work that will discuss Peterson\u0027s ideas impartially, making his thinking available\nto varied audiences by distilling it and linking it to other intellectual\ntraditions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite the tidal wave of social media\nattention that he is receiving, Peterson is here to stay. Yet, if his ideas are going to spread, they will eventually need to be discussed in respected and established academic venues (for an explanation of why that is the case, click\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.academia.edu/36395104/Books_about_Books_about_Books\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e). The sooner this happens, the better.

Not everyone is in a position to do that, so it is a division of labor. It is also a labor of love: I really want to write a book on Peterson\u0027s philosophy\u2014and I get the sense that many people want to read such a book too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, become a patron and help me turn that exciting vision into reality.

I now have two PhDs, one in Philosophy of Mind from York University in Toronto and another in Philosophy of Signs (Semiotics) from the University of Quebec in Montreal.
