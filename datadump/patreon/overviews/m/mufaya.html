Started to use FL Studio (Fruity Loops Studio) when I was 13 and Game Developing with Unreal Engine 4 at 14.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I am using a 9 year old desktop and changing parts in time. I have 8 GB Ram and having lots of crashes in FL Studio at the moment (had some days with more than 5 crashes at 2-3 hours) and it\u0027s really ruining things. I am also trying to make my videos with using Unreal Engine 4 so I can use my skills in unreal engine 4 to make things look more cinematic and dynamic. But, I have AMD r7 360 Graphics Card and Intel Core i5-6402P CPU... means that I can\u0027t record with full FPS and cinematic graphics settings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e These are some of the reasons why I am in Patreon. As a 17 years old person, I can\u0027t really afford those things. I would be appreciated a lot if you support me by being a patron, commenting, giving structural feedback about my musics and videos, sharing my work as much as you can and listening my musics or watching my videos."

     "description": "I currently have 8 GB of ram. I went to buy 8 GB more ram last week but seems like prices went too high so I\u0027m still with my 8 GB Ram. Currently when I open some of my projects files, ram instantly goes up to %85-%90 and other applications like chrome, media player and sometimes even the task manager... crashes. Wasting so much time to make my projects use less amount of ram. I also need a new Graphics Card because of having longer than 7 hour of rendering times in adobe after effects. Can\u0027t even preview my videos smoothly in adobe after effects. Also having a new gpu will make my video environments look way more cinematic and smooth on fps. (example: I had to turn of shadow casting on my lightning in my last video and lowered the graphics from cinematic to epic, epic to high, and some on medium).",
