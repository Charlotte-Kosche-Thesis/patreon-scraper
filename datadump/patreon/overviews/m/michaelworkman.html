    "summary": "Fighting for humanism and conscience in a world of populist violence and nihilism, Michael Workman reflects, examines and at times wrestles with philosophic wonder the difficulties of conscience in this context. In recent years, he has begun work on a series \nof roughly 7 books: a novel, \"American Hell\" (about mental illness), a \ngraphic novel, \"Envy the Dead\" (about addiction), a children\u0027s book for \nadults \"The Darkness Sings Songs of Itsself\" (a collection of prose \npoems and drawings of the personification of the spirit of despair\u0027s \nprivate thoughts on life and human existence), \"Hollow Harvest,\" a \npoetry collection and attendant series of drawings on the destructive \nforces of nihilism and narcissism in American society, \"Burn it Down,\" \nan essay memoir about the art world as a bastion of neoliberalism, \n\"Rustaire,\" a novel examining poverty, queerity and violence in the \nrustbelt Middle West, and an untitled seventh volume.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorkman \nbrings a vast array of experience to this calling, including ten years pulling an Ehrenreich in the art world and recording the insular horrors of the 1%. In 2009, he \nco-founded the annual Verge Art Fair in New York (and Miami from \n2009-2012), the New Material Art Fair during Art Basel Miami Beach in \n2013, the popular one-off Art Brooklyn in 2011, and the Visual Art \nNetwork, an internet audience outreach initiative that includes the \nVANlist email announcement service and the /publicprojects program to \nconnect artists with Chambers of Commerce. Formerly, he was Director of \nBridge, NFP, a Chicago-based 501 (c) (3) arts publishing and programming\n organization. Bridge, NFP published the Pushcart-prize winning \nbimonthly Bridge Magazine, for which he served as Publisher and \nEditor-in-Chief. Bridge, NFP also organized the annual Artboat \nexhibition during Art Chicago for two consecutive years at Navy Pier, \nThe Nova Art Fair for another two, and launched the Bridge Art Show from\n 2004-2008 in Miami Beach and Chicago in 2007, in cooperation with Art \nChicago at the Merchandise Mart. He has worked in supporting roles on a \nnumber of other fairs, including SOFA Chicago and NY.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is currently columnist on the Maker Beat of DIY culture in Chicago and writes social, literary, and is now also moving toward dance critique, for alt-biweekly Newcity. He also operates a \ncuratorial umbrella project, Antidote Projects, the last exhibition for \nwhich he produced a \u0027zine, False Love, with original work by artists and\n writers including AA Bronson.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cycle of books require a \"cooling-off\" period between each phase of production, usually to the tune of a year between writing and revision. \"American Hell\" is up for revision starting in December 2015. Patreon funds will support this 7-year project with recurring monthly donations allowing work on them to proceed unfettered by the concerns of monthly income. Workman and his son are relocating to a coop living environment in service to this vital effort, and reducing the influences of economics in daily life.
