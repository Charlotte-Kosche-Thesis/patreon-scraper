This year, I have a lot of ideas and projects that I want you to be apart of! Part of my journey is experiencing new parts of the world and I want you to experience those with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy favorite thing about photography is the people and strangers I meet along the way. From an engagement shoot to going Urban Exploring and coming across a homeless person, it\u0027s the moments and memories that I make of it. I am most passionate about meeting new people through photography. It allows me to learn about their world and what THEY are passionate about. I want to be able to live freely and go through all walks of life to go about and photograph life how I see it. However, taking photos and not getting paid runs me into a problem: I don\u0027t want to be a sellout and I refuse to allow that to happen any longer. With the help of Patreon, you will be able to help me balance my normal, part-time job and fund me to create new work, prints and canvases.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon allows you to support me and my photography in exchange for rewards such as one-on-one coffee dates to a full out photo shoot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDifferent amounts correspond to the rewards listed.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen you click on the \u003cem\u003e\"Become a patron\"\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0button, you can select the tier or how much you\u0027d like to pledge per set (sets are the bundles of photos that are released from my page 1-2 times a month). You will be charged automatically but will be allowed to adjust or cancel at any time. Mind you, I update my instagram with free photos close to everyday but, I appreciate any support,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
