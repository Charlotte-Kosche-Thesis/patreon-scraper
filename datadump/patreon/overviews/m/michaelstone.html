    "summary": "On July 16, 2017, \u003cu\u003eMichael Stone\u003c/u\u003e\u2014an internationally-recognized Buddhist teacher, author, host of the Awake in the World podcast, and mental health advocate\u2014died, having succumbed to bipolar disorder. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMichael loved his students and he loved his work.\u003c/strong\u003e The practices he shared through workshops, retreats and writing were a life raft for him. His work inspired and grounded him. As a neurodiverse person living with internal instability, he channeled his challenges and the insights gleaned from his experience into tools that he could share with others. It could be argued that it was in experiencing these challenges that Michael became so effective a teacher and communicator. For someone facing his kinds of suffering, he did really, really well. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is easy to wonder, how he could\u2019ve died considering his practice and teaching. We could instead ask, how did he live so well considering the power of his neurodiverse wiring? What can we learn about our own minds and hearts from someone who visits the front lines of instability? \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing Michael\u2019s partner, I knew a full version of him. \n\u003cstrong\u003eOne thing I know for sure is that Michael would want his work to continue.\u003c/strong\u003e I feel I can be a voice for him now\u2014that I can articulate closely what would be true for him going forward. So, however, I can be available, I will be available. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut why continue?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBecause of the work Michael did that has yet to be released to the world.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 42 years Michael did a lifetime of work. There is more material waiting in the wings than ever before\u2014a trove of at least a year\u2019s worth of podcasts for the Community Library, several online courses, and four books scheduled to be released. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAlso, because our international community has insisted on continuing.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMichael\u2019s teachings have spread to many sanghas, each with its own heart. A network has formed. We call this network at large \u201can international community without walls.\u201d It was the thing that Michael was most proud of. \n\u003cstrong\u003eContinuity will come through this community\u2014including support from practice mentors, staff, advisors, and other collaborators who worked closely with him.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe don\u2019t have Michael anymore, but we still have the resources he left for us. \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe \u003cu\u003eCommunity Library\u003c/u\u003e (and the website that houses it) will continue with the same accessibility and generosity as before, as long as we continue to have supporters.\u003c/strong\u003e Below, we tell you how to support the Community Library and Michael\u2019s legacy by pledging a monthly amount through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u2019s worth noting that since Michael\u2019s death, his followers have grown by the thousands. People have been moved by his story. \n\u003cstrong\u003eWhoever you are, we welcome you. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMichael\u2019s life was interrupted, but the teachings need not be.\u003c/strong\u003e We activate our connection with Michael through practice; that is the lineage. In this way, the teachings outlast the teacher. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n~ Carina Stone\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSteward, Michael Stone Teachings\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePLEASE SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY LIBRARY \u0026amp; MICHAEL\u2019S LEGACY\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is like an ongoing Kickstarter campaign, where you can pledge a monthly amount\u2014that you specify\u2014in support of what\u2019s being created. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs Michael said, \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eFrom a Buddhist perspective, Patreon offers an opportunity for a form of digital dana\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cem\u003eDana\u003c/em\u003e is the practice of generosity and a way to support philanthropic public projects that empower and help many.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur \u003cu\u003eCommunity Library\u003c/u\u003e is that kind of project. It is and will always be at the core of Michael Stone Teachings\u2019 international online community. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nEverything in the Community Library\u00a0is available for free.\u003c/strong\u003e Anyone, anywhere can have instant access to material that will help them deepen their practice and contribute to a culture of compassion and collaboration. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell over \n\u003cem\u003ehalf a million\u003c/em\u003e people have already taken advantage of what the Community Library has to offer. And our numbers keep climbing. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u2019s as simple as this: \u003cstrong\u003eeverything we do takes a resource.\u003c/strong\u003e With Michael gone, so is much of our income. The more resources we have the more we can ensure that the teachings Michael left behind can be made available for free to anyone in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nIt takes just a few minutes to pledge by clicking that large orange button at the top right of this page.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRemember, you\u2019ll be making a monthly pledge and you can easily cancel it anytime. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nYou\u2019ll also see that we\u2019re offering gifts to show our appreciation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u2019ll find these over to the right. We hope you\u2019ll like them and that they deepen your practice. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e for helping us to continue to nourish our beautiful, international community without walls and to keep Michael Stone\u2019s legacy alive.\u003cbr\u003e"
