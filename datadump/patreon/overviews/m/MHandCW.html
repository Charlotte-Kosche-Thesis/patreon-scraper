It\u0027s got mysterious cabals, death defying action, dark secrets and rich, fully developed characters. It\u0027s a diverse and innovative way of looking at the Conan Doyle style mystery that\u0027s never been done, and we\u0027re super excited to bring it to you. As a writer, that\u0027s why I love this story! That said, each chapter of \u003cem\u003eMH\u0026amp;CW \u00a0\u003c/em\u003ecosts money\u00a0to produce, about $1500 per issue, and as a publisher, I want to make sure my collaborators get paid! Plus, hosting free content on the web (without ads, thank goodness) doesn\u0027t come in a gift basket. All proceeds from the comic go into\u003cem\u003e making more of the comic! \u003c/em\u003eThere are a ton of twists and turns coming in this story, and Carlos, Rachel and I can\u0027t wait to bring them to you, but we need your help! Please pledge what you can, and stick around for lots of exciting content and news from Cloudwrangler Comics!"
