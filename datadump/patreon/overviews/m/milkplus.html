Aside from me, we\u0027ve also got Beignet, our social media manager. If this is your first time finding out about us, you can check out our website\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://milkplusvisual.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e! Our first release was\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://milkplusvisual.com/story/soundless/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundless\u003c/a\u003e, a free kinetic horror VN, and we plan to make even more games!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe focus on making visual novels surrounding girl x girl relationships in a variety of genres and settings. Our first project, Soundless, focused on a young girl named Mercy and her struggle in a town that rejected her. Its aesthetic is heavily based off of early 2000s NVL visual novels. It currently has a 4.8/5 rating on itch.io and a 7.12/10 rating on the Visual Novel Database, and has been regarded as a terrifying, yet touching story by many.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd now, we\u0027re working on our second game titled POLYCHROMANIA, which is yet another horror game. Unlike Soundless, this game will contain erotic content, a cast of adults, choices, and a large amount of endings. You can access some WIPs and information through the public Patreon posts here, our social media, and our Discord, but there\u0027s a whole lot of Patron exclusive content, too!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you can\u0027t donate monthly, but still want to support milk+, feel free to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ko-fi.com/milkplus\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebuy us a few Ko-fis\u003c/a\u003e.
