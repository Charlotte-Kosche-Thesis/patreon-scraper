His Patreon campaign is to support his music and podcast, Time \u0026amp; The Mystery: Conversations with Mike Mangione. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI Am Releasing Two Albums\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eHello my friends\u003cstrong\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n Right now my main focus is on the release of my two records.\u00a0 The first released will be my Three Days EP in the spring, followed by the full length record due out in the fall.\u00a0 Support from my patrons will go toward duplication, Promotion and support of both releases.\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a patron today.  Any amount helps \u2026 some get rewards.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAlong with my music releases I will continue to produce and release my podcast Time \u0026amp; The Mystery.\u00a0 I have been a fan of podcasts for some time now and have used them religiously while touring the country.  I had an epiphany last year while on the road listening to one of my favorite shows...I should start a podcast!  So, six months ago I brought recording equipment to one of the festivals my band was playing and began recording conversations with artists who I knew who had colorful backdrops.  I then began reaching out to everyone I knew in the industry who I thought would make an entertaining conversation and I was off!!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share with you, my listener, a unique conversation with these individuals.  I didn\u2019t just want to talk about who they are, I want them to dig deep and share why they are who they are!  How did they become who they are? Why do they do what they do.  What is it about their work that stirs in them and fuels their passion?  How do they connect with others and what do they want to invoke within their audience?  Whether talking to an actor, a musician, an author or a priest, I want to know what their intentions are and how they want to be remembered.  Its a conversation filled with both  tangible and temporal ideas as well as spiritual and mysterious realities!  It is Time \u0026amp; The Mystery.  One of the most amazing things I have encountered in all of these conversations has been the commonalities between the individuals despite their obvious differences.  Slug, of the hip hop group Atmosphere, has similar desires with Archbishop Naumann of Kansas City and I want to share it with the world! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I will be able to continue recording these conversations.\u00a0 Your support will cover practical costs such as web hosting fees and gas etc, to as general as my time to record and edit these shows.\u00a0 Your support will also help me continue the post production of my latest record (promotion and packaging) as well as create video to accompany the songs.\u00a0 I intend of regularly releasing video surrounding the release of this record. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to partnering with you all and with your help, continue creating beautiful and engaging stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMike\u003cbr\u003e"
