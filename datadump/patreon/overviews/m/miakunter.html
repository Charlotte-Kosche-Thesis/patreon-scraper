    "summary": "Jack Shamblin, head of Mia Kunter Productions, has come a long, long way from that Bible-Belt Eastern Oklahoma town where he grew up, a two-hour drive from the headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan. Back in the eighties, when he drummed-up enough courage to tell a friend he was gay, she told him he would \u201cdie of Aids and then roast for eternity.\u201d His previously \u201cadoring\u201d mother went homophobic and threatened to take away his college fund. And, all of a sudden, no one would talk to him. Depression followed and presented him with his first unofficial acting job \u2014trying to play it straight when it wasn\u2019t really him. Jack was locked inside himself with so much to say but with no vehicle of expression. He calls it his \u201csilent-state-of-Bohemia: a place full of singers without voices, dancers without legs and writers without hands.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast-forward to 2018 and meet the new and evolved Jack Shamblin \u2014 international writer, actor, director, comedian, performance artist and activist.\u201cOnly when I owned my pain and created from it,\u201d he says, \u201cdid I begin to heal.\u201d He not only found his voice, his legs and his hands but he clarified his direction as a queer leader and role model in the arts. These days you may also encounter him as Mia Kunter, his alter-ego \u2014 he identifies as gender non-conformist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMr. Shamblin credits performance artist Theodora Skipitares with discovering him at the University of Iowa in 1994. She asked him to write a monologue based on Tim Bailey\u2019s ACT-UP funeral procession. He ran with the concept and developed it as a piece. She thought it was perfect for her New York City LaMaMa premiere. Moving to the East Village and the downtown scene, Jack landed a role in Caryl Churchill\u2019s \u201cThe Skriker\u201d at The Public Theater (where he shared a dressing room with Philip Seymour Hoffman.) His career was launched and since then Jack has been unceasingly fearless in unearthing queer history, pushing boundaries in the arts, exploring dark places and raising necessary but often uncomfortable issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMr. Shamblin\u2019s current project is \u201cThe Fop: Love \u0026amp; Lust in Victorian Queer New York\u201d (Renamed \"SLUMMING IT\") which has been described as \u201ca bawdy romp through Victorian New York.\u201d It\u2019s based on an actual male bordello and saloon called Paresis Hall which was located in Cooper Square, the heart of the nineteenth-century gay scene in Manhattan. (Currently, it\u2019s the setting for the TNT series based on Caleb Carr\u2019s novel, The Alienist.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile there are candid references to oral and anal sex and scenes of a sensual massage and a very discreetly-staged inspection of anal cavities, \u201cThe Fop\u201d is never vulgar or offensive and there is no nudity. A lot of it is tongue-in-cheek with a laugh here and a chuckle there, frequently entertaining with all the colorful characters backed-up by the engaging music. At the same time, it makes its points about the hypocrisy of authority and addresses the issue of how queer men and women find a place to express themselves in a culture that has no room for them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
