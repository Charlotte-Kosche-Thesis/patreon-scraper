PRETTY GREAT.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been struggling since I started my \u0027Women in Blues\u0027 community radio revolution in 2013 to find the right platform for ongoing support.

If you did cancel before the 1st of the month - you will still be listed as a supporter of the show, album and community.
