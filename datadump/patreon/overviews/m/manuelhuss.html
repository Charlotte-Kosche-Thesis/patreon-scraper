It was back then when my passion for space was\nborn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nToday, many years later, I invite you to take\npart in my journey to the moon and far beyond.\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho I am and what\nI do:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Manuel\nHuss and I\u2019m living with my wife and my two kids in Luxembourg\n(Europe), where in my free time I\u2019m doing Astrophotography whenever\nthe skies allow it. Right now I\u2019m mostly focused on doing Moonscapes and Deep Sky photography at shorter focal length. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen people ask me why I\u0027m doing it, there is no simple answer to it. It\u0027s not only about the beauty and sublimity of space, there\u0027s the vastness too and there\u0027s a lot of it! It reminds me of how small we are, in a spatial way but also in terms of time. When you\u0027re looking at a picture of the Soul Nebula, you\u0027re not only looking at an object that\u0027s really far far away, you\u0027re also traveling in time, since what you see, is an image of the Soul Nebula as it looked like 7.500 years ago. That\u0027s how long it took the light to get here. It\u0027s almost beyond comprehension, and yet we\u0027re only talking about our cosmic neighborhood. Star-gazing makes me thoughtful, it\u0027s going hand in hand with philosophy.\u00a0That\u0027s what makes it so attractive to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few words on my equipment: For my moon shots I\u0027m using a Sky Watcher Maksutov 180/2.700 reflector and an ASI 178MC CMOS camera mounted on a Celestron AVX. The Deep Sky imaging is done with a TS Star71 flatfield apo and an ATIK 383l+ CCD camera on an Orion Atlas Pro az/eq-g mount. There will be more detail on the equipment in the posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAstronomy is a\nfascinating hobby, but it comes at some costs: There are many\nsleepless nights, hours and hours of processing data, suffering from\nfrozen feet in the winter and mosquito bites in the summer. And\nbesides that, as you can imagine, it isn\u2019t the cheapest hobby\naround.  Especially when you choose to share your passion with\nothers. When you\u2019re moving from visual observation to\nAstrophotography, the demands not only in your know-how but also in\nyour gear and the related financial costs rise... astronomically.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd\nthat\u2019s where Patreon and hopefully you are filling in. I need to\nkeep my gear running and eventually upgrade it to see even further\nand get better results. For example, my guiding camera, which is an\nessential piece of equipment for taking long exposure Deep Sky shots,\nis suffering from a loose contact which leads to approximately 33%\nloss of my exposure time. So as a first goal, I\u2019m planning on\ngetting a new guiding camera for my setup. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a thank you for\nsupporting my work, I will offer the following rewards, which I have\nsplit in two tiers (there might be more in the future):  \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eSky Watcher\u003c/em\u003e:\nyou get access to all images in high resolution and a detailed\ndescription of the motif.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eDeep Sky\nExplorer\u003c/em\u003e: in addition to the \u003cem\u003eSky\nWatcher\u003c/em\u003e rewards, you get access to alternative versions, side products, technical data, processing details, work in progress and eventually raw data.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you click the \"become patron\" button you got to choose how much you want to contribute to my work.
