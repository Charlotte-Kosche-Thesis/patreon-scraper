In this 10 minute video podcast we\u0027ll be checking in on the latest in gaming, recapping the week\u0027s Mega Dads events and content and reading viewer/listener questions on the air. Think of it as a mini version of Mega Dads Live, but you\u0027ll get to look at our stupid faces in addition to hearing our stupid voices. Sounds great, right?",
