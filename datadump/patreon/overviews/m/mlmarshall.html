It takes place in a unique world based off Bronze-Age Celtic Britain, giving me creative freedom while providing my work with a historical and mythical base.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story follows Aderyn, the titular character, from childhood to maturity as she traverses realms and worlds, communicates with spirits and unseen forces, and embarks on a unique quest to uncover the cause of the Earth\u0027s sickness. Accompanying Aderyn is Seithennyn, a tylwyth-teg nature spirit, and Talhaearn, a young and ambitious bard-in-training. As Aderyn leaves the comfort of the Gelli Gadarn forest and steps out into a world dominated by political hierarchies, greed, and religious corruption, the witch must seek out the \"soul of the island,\" the fabled Stone of the Serpent\u0027s Tail, to learn why the Earth\u0027s energies are weakening.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis story is largely character-driven. I have striven to make this novel the sort of fantasy I would like to read--one that goes beyond the typical sphere of the genre and incorporates elements from classic literature and mythology, with a modern infusion. More than just entertainment, my work is rooted in symbolism and thematic elements, and through the backdrop of fantasy, I hope to explore the human condition, environmentalism and naturalism, mysticism and spirituality, fatalism, philosophical cynicism, political and religious corruption, and the trappings of greed, all while pulling from archetypes from the collective unconscious. My work is dark at times, and despite the fantastical elements, I aim to keep it feeling very real and very human.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout my creations:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI plan on posting chapter updates once or twice a month.\u003c/strong\u003e If you decide to become my patron, you will receive exclusive access to these chapter updates, regardless of which monetary tier you choose to pledge. \u003cstrong\u003eMy chapters will fall between 3,000-10,000 words each, and I estimate 20-30 chapters per volume, with likely 3 volumes in total\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I am creating is not necessarily a series. I am treating this story as one--rather large--complete novel. This is to keep up a consistent flow and connectivity within my story--it will not be split into different books in order to meet some criteria for series length, and each volume will be considered a continuation of the last, as the next part of the story.\u00a0To make reading easier for my audiences, I have decided to break down the novel into parts or volumes, and release them separately, with the goal of eventually publishing one book containing all volumes. This is similar to the three-volume novel form of publishing that was standard in 19th century Britain.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you find my creations to be enjoyable. An integral part of this experience is for me to hear back from my readers, so I welcome you all to comment as much as possible. It is important to remember that what I am presenting you are chapters from an unfinished novel--so your suggestions are deeply appreciated. While the completed version of the novel and its volumes may change slightly from the chapters I post here, my goal is to thoroughly write, rewrite, and edit each chapter before you see it. This ensures that I am delivering the highest-quality chapters to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003eA little about me:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing novels for as long as I can remember. I wrote my first novel at age 10--it was handwritten and about 330 pages in length. I self-published my novel\u00a0\u003cem\u003eForsaken\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0at age 18, and I have written five novels to date. In recent years, however, my writing has matured and changed significantly. I am currently in my final year of working toward a degree in English Language and Literature. Born and raised in Missouri, I now live in Cardiff, Wales with my Welsh husband.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003eThank you so much for stopping by and considering becoming a patron for my in-progress novel, \u003cem\u003eStone of the Serpent\u0027s Tail\u003c/em\u003e!\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
