    "summary": "Hi\neveryone, I\u2019m Richard David Le Tourneau, and I\u2019m an author and father to three crazy son\u0027s. I\u2019ve always enjoyed\nwriting, loved it in fact. One Christmas I asked for a typewriter, partly\nbecause I saw Misery and loved the film and wanted to do some of my own\nwriting. As I got older, I\nwrote more, but I never thought of having anything published. Now I\u2019m much\nolder (not that old) I think it\u2019s time for people to see what I can create.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce I\nwas a teenager my work got darker and more twisted, my imagination takes me to some\nstrange places, and now I can take you there, kicking and screaming preferably.\nI love\nwriting Horror but, I also work on Children\u2019s stories, there may be some\nparents out there who are put off by authors who work on Adult fiction and Children\u2019s\ntoo. For me, I wanted to create stories both generations could enjoy. Both pose\nseparate challenges, and both are\nenjoyable to work on. \nLast year I completed my first novel Lilith\u2019s\nPuppet and this year for Halloween you can become the next victim of The Sack\nMan. For the next three years I will be releasing another novel in the series\nbut, for now, the full details of those are a secret. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis year\nI have a lot to work on, apart from Sprout, which is having a much-needed name change, I\u2019m also doing a few\nchanges to Lilith\u2019s Puppet. There will be a collection of short stories available\nand numerous novellas too. I love\nwriting. It\u2019s a passion which has grown over the years and continues to do so. My mind is always creating\nsomething, On my computer, I have several\nfolders, and each contains multiple files\nwhich I\u2019m working on. I have lost count of how many projects I have. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for getting this far. Even if you can\u0027t pledge right now,\nthank you for being here, and thank you for taking the time to read this. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
