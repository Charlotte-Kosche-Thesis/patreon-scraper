Thanks for reading!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started The Whippet because it\u2019s getting harder and harder to find interesting articles without being swamped by Trump news, and it was doing my head in. I wanted a breather from the harrowing stuff, but I didn\u2019t want just pictures of cute animals, either, I wanted stuff that made my brain ping. I couldn\u0027t find a newsletter like that, so\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thewhippet.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI made one\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt takes more work than maybe it looks like from the outside - I reject a lot of articles because they\u0027re too obvious, already been shared too often, or they just don\u0027t intrigue me, and I put a lot of thought into finding the parts that will tell the gist of what\u0027s interesting about it without you having to read the whole 8,000 word article. I\u0027d say it takes me about six hours of solid work an issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of which is a long-winded way of saying, if you want to support The Whippet, I\u0027d love you to, and you\u0027ll be making it sustainable for me to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also help just by telling folks that you like it! Print it out and slip under their doors. Read it on public transport when you know people are looking over your shoulder. \"Accidentally\" forward it to your ex. Every little bit helps."
