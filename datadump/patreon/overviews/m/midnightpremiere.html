These funds will help me pay for convention expenses, material costs, and even in buying little gifts for my supporters! As someone who always enjoys what happens behind-the-scenes, I plan to share my trial and errors with you all, and be able to share tips and tricks that I have learned along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kinds of rewards can we expect?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards are loosely outlined on the tier to the right, but you can expect anything from WIP sketches of what projects I am working on during the month (some of which may never see the light of day otherwise), free requests and livestreams based around your availability, and even goodies mailed directly to your doorstep (or just digitally, if you\u0027d rather)! For example, I may do exclusive inked drawings for \"Inktober\" in October, gifts based around the holidays, or anything else I can think of. I want you as a patron to feel involved in the projects you are supporting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is your end goal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am planning to learn as much as I can, and share what I have learned with the community. I have so many big plans in not just visual art but animation, acting, music, game design and illustration, and I hope that by using Patreon, I can share my adventure with you all.
