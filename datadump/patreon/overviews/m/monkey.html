    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h3\u003eMy name is Dan, and I live a bit north of Boston, MA.  I work in a Cable Access TV Studio and I also work with the local high school students teaching TV Production.  I am married (no kids) and I drink so much tea, I should have been a Brit.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/h3\u003eI am a Minecrafter. \u00a0I have been playing since around 2009 and I\u0027m still going! \u00a0Although I started by making videos on YouTube, I have recently run out of time to record, edit, upload and tag videos, and for a while I just sort of disappeared. \u00a0Then I rediscovered beam.pro (now mixer.com ) and I\u0027ve been having a blast over there. \u00a0It\u0027s a smaller community than \"that other livestreaming service\" and it\u0027s not nearly as difficult to manage. \u00a0They also have lag-free streams...which means that I can have a conversation with my audience as fast as they can type it! \u00a0It\u0027s really incredible. \u00a0That and a few other neat things over there and I\u0027ve decided it\u0027s time I show everyone what I\u0027ve been up to these past few months!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main Minecraft server that I stream from is the Monkey Mines private SMP server that my brother and I started many years ago even before maps were infinite (like late 2009-ish).  We have about 5-10 active members, and although most of them don\u0027t record or stream, you will see them pop in and out of my videos occasionally! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Having worked with students for so long, I long ago decided that I would keep my channel very family friendly, which I have done and will continue to do for a long time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been branching out recently to other Minecraft servers as well as other games like Fortnite Battle Royale, Rocket League, and Need For Speed! But no matter what other games I play, I always come back to punch some trees!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy do I stream?\u003c/h3\u003eI spent a lot of time watching Minecraft YouTube videos (Etho, Xisuma were my first favorites) but at the time I was still playing in creative because that\u0027s how I started and it was what I was used to!  But one day I caught up to everyone I watched and I had nothing else to do and decided I would give it a shot.  I\u0027ve been hooked ever since!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy favorite part of streaming is the audience interaction.  I LOVE hearing from people who enjoyed my streams (or didn\u0027t, with suggestions on how I can improve).  I think Patreon is a really neat platform for reaching the people who really enjoy my stuff and can afford to donate something.  It gives me the chance to send email updates to you when I\u0027m going live too so you never miss a moment of Monkey Minecraft!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/h3\u003eYou already know that I have a full-time job (which often interferes with my game schedule!) so why do I need money for this?  Well right now I am the only Monkey Miner paying for the server each month and I have also increased my internet speeds which is costing me extra.  Lastly, I keep upgrading my computer to handle all the things I want to do with it, and it\u0027s been feeling like I\u0027ve been just throwing money into this project without really getting anything back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t get me wrong, I LOVE streaming, and I\u0027m not going to stop until it\u0027s not fun anymore, but making at least a little money off it would be really useful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIf you can\u0027t afford to donate\u003c/h3\u003ePlease don\u0027t feel bad!  Many people can\u0027t donate!  I do not keep anything from the general public in favor of my patrons.  Many of you are too young to donate, some of you just don\u0027t have the kind of job that leaves you with extra cash lying around.  If you can\u0027t afford it, then just keep watching, tweet the stream out, post on the Facebook, and most importantly CHAT! \u00a0I\u0027d love to hear from you!\u003cbr\u003e"

If you can afford a little extra cash, great.  If not, please enjoy my videos anyway!",
