    "summary": "Hello, \u003cbr\u003eWe are Gary and Mike Petrin and we created BrothersP productions. We love writing songs, creating music videos and entertaining. Basically we are starving artists who would love to do this full time. We\u2019ve been around for a while and we could never quite get over the hump of taking our creativity to the next level. Well any other level for that matter. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019ve created a new show called Meet the Dysfunctionals that takes place in the 70\u2019s. Parents could say what they wanted and raise their kids the way they were raised. If you have parents that grew up in the 70\u2019s this show could explain a lot as to why your parents act the way they do. Not saying everyone had parents like the Dysfunctionals, but when we were kids we had a lot in common with a lot of other kids. A LOT!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn Patreon if you like what you see you can monetarily support us. That is if you are in the financial position to do so and have a sympathetic heart for starving artists. If anything we could try for the sympathy or pity angle when you realize this show is based on true events. Thanks Mom.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhere the $ Will Go\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell we would love to do this full time and spend more Benjamins on the creative process.  Being able to use the kind of software and tools to create a higher quality product would be great!  Even being able to bring on some highly talented creators would be wonderful.  But we are realistic, we know that since we are just starting this adventure, we need to get the word out.  It takes advertising chachingos to do it the right way.  We need marketing \npesos, dollars, yen, pounds,\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ewell you get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\nFor various levels of support, from single donation to monthly pledges, we offer different rewards like exclusive access to our Patreon only feed, your name mentioned in our \"special thanks\" section on our video\u0027s, and all the way up to writing you in as a character in one of the episodes. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you decide that you would like to help us take \"Meet the Dysfunctionals\" to the next level and you simply want more, please donate.  If you are unable to financially support us, please help us out by sharing our work on your social channels and subscribing to our Meet the Dysfunctionals Youtube channel.  It would mean so much if you\u00a0like us, you really like us!\" \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.meetthedysfunctionals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MeetTheDysfunctionals-Title-4.png\" style=\"width: 370px;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/3TUoIufz2qs\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://meetthedysfunctionals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Trailer-Edited-2-1.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "We are Gary and Mike Petrin - The BrothersP\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re just a couple of brothers that like to have fun creating music and videos.  Life has been more than interesting for us.  When we tell a story from our past the first response we usually get is \u201cthere\u2019s no way that happened!\u201d  We contemplated writing a bio about our experiences but we really don\u2019t want anyone to get the wrong idea about what we went through.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe grew up in a very non-politically correct time.  The 1970\u2019s was an exciting time to be a kid. When you went out with your friends your mother made sure you had a quarter in your pocket so you could make a phone call in case of emergency.  If you came home past curfew you were expecting to get a beating. Whether you were 5 minutes or an hour late.  So we always made each beating count. We never were 5 minutes late, always more than an hour.\u003cbr\u003eAfter High School we went our separate ways for a while but ended up getting back together and starting a rock band.  We took the band on the road for a few years.  The adventures from the road are a whole different conversation of unbelievable stories.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo Gary had the bright idea to animate a few stories to see what that would look like. And\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.meetthedysfunctionals.com\"\u003eMEET THE DYSFUNCTIONALS\u003c/a\u003e was born.  Ok so obviously we never recorded all our conversations back then so we do not have actual records (we only had cassettes and 8-tracks so the quality sucked anyways).  But these stories are pretty freakin\u2019 close.\u00a0Comedy has always been a great escape during hard times.  Shining a comedic light while retelling certain experiences makes it a lot easier to share them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you enjoy them.  \u003cbr\u003eGary and Mike Petrin\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. you could really help us out by sharing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.meetthedysfunctionals.com\"\u003eMEET THE DYSFUNCTIONALS\u003c/a\u003e on your social networks.
