    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWelcome\u003c/h1\u003eOur goal at Manchester Pig Save is simple; we are here to open people\u2019s eyes to the unnecessary suffering and death that is all around us, yet all too often unnoticed. We do this by publicly showing compassion to the most vulnerable and abused members of our society, the so called \u2018food animals\u2019.\u003cbr\u003eWe hold peaceful vigils outside slaughterhouses, so that we may bear witness to the millions of animals whose lives are needlessly taken each day and to bring public awareness to their plight. Coming face to face with the victims of the animal exploiting industries has a huge impact on our choices and our attitude towards these these sentient beings who are mostly hidden from public view. Bearing witness to their suffering shows us that these animals feel in the same way that we do. They feel fear, happiness, love and sadness.\u003cbr\u003eWhen we witness and feel their suffering first hand, when we see them as the unique and individual lives that they are, our resolve to end the atrocities committed against them is strengthened. We believe that ending oppression and violence must be done with love and kindness for all beings, regardless of sex, race or species.\u003cbr\u003eWe were inspired and supported by Toronto Pig Save as the UK\u2019s first member of the global Save Movement and we are here to support others who wish to set up Save Groups in their area. For all of those who are committed to ending the suffering for these animals, we first must bring their plight into the public eye and bearing witness is a powerful way to do this.\u003cbr\u003eOur mission is clear, we want to give these animals some love and compassion in their final moments, to be their voice and spread their message to the world, who find it so easy to turn away. Please help us to help them and come along to one of our vigils.\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWhen the suffering of another creature causes you to feel pain, do not submit to the initial desire to flee from the suffering one, but on the contrary, come closer, as close as you can to him who suffers, and try to help.\u201d \u2013 Leo Tolstoy, A Calendar of Wisdom\u003cbr\u003e"

Many of the people who come to our vigils speak of feeling isolated before, as outsiders in a non-vegan world, looking on in horror at the \u2018normality\u2019 which surrounds them, which seems anything but normal to them.\u003cbr\u003eWe have people of every age, ethnicity, gender and preference attending our vigils, all stood side by side, and sharing a common purpose. We have students stood next to stockbrokers, firefighters stood next to florists and everything in between. We have children bringing their parents, parents bringing their children and a group of regular attendees are actually grandchildren bringing their grandparents (or is it the other way around?).\u003cbr\u003eIn any case, one thing to be sure of, is that you will not be alone. We all share a common goal, a common interest and a shared philosophy of non-violence and a strong aversion to ALL forms of injustice, persecution and prejudice. We stand together, proud of what we are doing to help the most persecuted victims on this planet and we will not back down until they are all free.\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re interested in coming along, please get in touch via Facebook, or email us on Manchesterpigsave@gmail.com. We\u2019re also on Instagram and Twitter, so please look, like and follow.\u003cbr\u003e",
