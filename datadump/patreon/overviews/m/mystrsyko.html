When I was a child I fell in love with robot fighting TV shows like Battlebots and Robot Wars. Ever since it\u0027s been a dream of mine to build a fighting robot and compete on television myself, but my family never had the resources to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately I\u0027ve been making \"Live Review\" videos on Youtube of these old robot fighting shows, where I tell jokes and make sarcastic comments poking fun at them. But now as an adult with the knowledge of how these shows and the robots themselves are made, I can\u0027t just sit back and watch. I have to be a part of it. Now, I finally have the opportunity to live my childhood dream of making a fighting robot, thanks to my supporters here on Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to support my Youtube channel, or help make it possible for me build and compete with these fighting robots, please feel free to select one of the reward tiers available. Each reward gets you awesome content exclusive to my Patreon supporters, and includes all the rewards below as well! And fear not, your generous choice to support me will not be in vain, as all the money I receive through Patreon will go towards creating more entertaining content for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t possibly thank everyone who has supported me the last few years on Youtube enough, let alone those who go the extra mile to become my Patron. Thank you. Thank you all so, so much. You have all literally changed my life with your kindness and support, and I am forever grateful to you all.\u003cbr\u003e"
