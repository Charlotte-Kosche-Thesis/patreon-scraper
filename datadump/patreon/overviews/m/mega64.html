    "summary": "From public access to the internet and beyond, Mega64 has been bringing you bizarre entertainment from the depths of the video game world since 2003.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have seen any of our \"public game experiment\" videos where we take video game weirdness and take it into the real world. Maybe you\u0027ve seen our written/improv sketches \u0026amp; short films, skewering the game industry or perhaps achieving \u003cem\u003ecerebral high art\u003c/em\u003e. Heck, there\u0027s a chance you\u0027ve even seen our original half hour public access TV series on DVD or any of the commissioned videos we\u0027ve made for Ubisoft, Nintendo, Microsoft, Kojima Productions, Funimation, SpikeTV, and many more. Oh, and we have a podcast too! It never seems to stop around Mega64 HQ. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve done a lot over the years- and all of it has been done by three guys: Rocco, Derrick, and Shawn. We\u0027ve also had help from our amazing friends of ours who have pitched in over  the years to make it all possible! Everyone involved has strived hard to keep Mega64 going,  but this Patreon is about taking our show to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSo really, why are you doing a Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe short version:\u003c/strong\u003e This is to keep Mega64 independent and free from having to rely on third parties or sponsored content. The more we get, the more freedom we have, the more we can make, and the better we can make it. We can devote our time solely to making stuff for YOU, the viewer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLong version:\u003c/strong\u003e Mega64 has been around for over a decade. And hey- for a group of friends hanging out and making wacky videos, it\u0027s been pretty great! But making funny business into a real business means hustling. Even though we\u0027ve stayed independent over the years, we made alliances with third parties backing us up to make exclusive content (IGN, Gametrailers, etc.). In times when they aren\u0027t around, we relied on commissioned works to fund our productions. That\u0027s been our main creative strategy this whole time, and while it\u0027s still awesome, it means we have to focus a lot on commercial work while our more wild ideas get left on the table.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMega64 has never been the biggest thing on the internet. But we\u0027ll roll the dice  and say we\u0027ve got one of the most rabid, devoted, and \u003cem\u003ecreative\u003c/em\u003e fanbases of any group on the planet. One question we\u0027re always being asked is, \"when are you going to go bigger? When will you make more ambitious stuff? When will you take Mega64 to the next level?\" \u003cstrong\u003eWell, this is it.\u003c/strong\u003e With your support, we can finally shift focus away from trying to make hit commercial stuff, and get to what our hardcore fans truly desire: Mega64 with more creative freedom. Through Patreon, you are funding our ability to create things on a level Mega64 never has before- without the worry of total annihilation or fiscal implosion!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHaven\u0027t you guys made fun of crowdfunding?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah, sure- We\u0027ve made fun of crowdfunding. People asking for too little to make their first AAA game, or too much for a 1st Class flight to Seattle. But we don\u0027t believe that\u0027s the case here. We\u0027re not funding construction of a space shuttle or anything else we don\u0027t know about- it\u0027s just about making the current Mega64 bigger and more ambitious. Any hardcore Mega64 fan knows what we can do when we work hard on a big project. This fund is to make that happen more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I don\u0027t want to do the Patreon thing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s totally cool! Mega64 will most likely continue on as it has. We\u0027re not going away. But making this stuff isn\u0027t easy. You can help support us by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://shop.mega64.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ebuying merchandise from our online store\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitch.tv/mega64podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esubscribing to us on Twitch.\u003c/a\u003e Anything you throw our way really does help a LOT. Your regular contributions through Patreon will really be the most reliable way of making sure we can consistently grow and flourish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything else?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah, the most important thing: Thank you. It\u0027s because of your support and your viewership that we\u0027ve had all of these amazing opportunities. No matter what you choose to do, we can\u0027t thank you enough for letting us do what we do after all these years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
