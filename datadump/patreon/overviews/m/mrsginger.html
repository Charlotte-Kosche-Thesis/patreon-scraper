This way\nyou can choose which videos you want to watch and aren\u2019t paying for ones you\naren\u2019t interested in, and I can put up extra videos without it affecting what\nyou pay. I know for me I prefer to have a fixed payment for everything in my\nlife! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI currently upload at least 1\nvideo per week, usually on a Monday, and that is just a chat about what I\u2019ve\nbeen up and to and what is going on in my life. This includes my health,\nmy search for a job, my dog and his antics and health, and more. Then there are\nsome additional videos that I add in occasionally such as recipes, or room\ntours in my house. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can choose to support me with\n$1 per month, or anything above that (that\u2019s about 80pence in GBP). If you\nwant to watch the Vlogs, they are offered to every Patron paying $5 or more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can cancel anytime, and\nthere is no commitment. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does your money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour support enables me to\ncontinue spending a lot of my time making videos for You Tube, and additional\nvideos for Patron. I\u2019m still not quite there yet, and may require a part time\njob at some point, but every $1 from a Patron helps. I\u2019m trying to forge a life\nworking from home because I love making You Tube content, I have health\nissues that make it less painful being at home, and I have a gorgeous labradoodle that requires\na lot of attention! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI get a lot of request to review\nparticular products, and I know how much my \u201cNew at the drugstore\u201d videos\nare enjoyed. Patron support helps me fund those items so that I can bring\nyou more reviews on what you want to see. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford Patron, or\nsimply don\u2019t want to, that is no problem at all. There are life updates in my\nmonthly favourites videos on my beauty channel, and I\u2019m also on Snapchat.\nI know what its like to struggle financially, so I totally understand and one\nof the goals of my beauty channel is to save you spending money on things that\nyou end up not liking! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Karen and I\u0027ve been\nobsessed with all things beauty and/or medical since my Saturday job in a\nchemist at aged 14. In more recent years when I had a good job working in\nmedical research, I was finally able to experience some high end makeup, and\nsplurge on the things I loved. Sadly in 2015, I had to\ntake redundancy from that role, but I took that opportunity to have a\nyear of \u201cfinding myself\u201d and dedicating more time to You Tube and also\nmanaging my Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and the associated pain. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy You Tube life began when at 40\nyrs old in 2012 I was about to get married and wanted to do my own makeup. I\ncouldn\u2019t find any videos that were women anywhere near my age and/or in the UK.\nWhy does this matter you may ask? Because the 20 something girls were telling\nme that \u201cthis concealer doesn\u2019t sink into lines\u201d yet I could see no lines,\nand they were recommending products we could not buy in the UK. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHaving gained a lot of medical\nknowledge in my 9 years working in the hospital, coupled with my love of\nbeauty, I decided that by making videos myself I could share my experience\nof the products I bought. I could perhaps help people understand the\ningredients - what was good and bad, and give an in depth review that might\nmean viewers saving a few pounds. Honesty has always been a characteristic of\nmine that has got me in trouble, but I figured on You Tube giving honest\nreviews would be appreciated! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour support really does mean the\nworld to me, and not just the financial support - the fact that anyone is\ninterested in what I have to say or whats happening with me, surprises and\ntouches me always.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks and huge hugs!\u003cbr\u003eKaren x\u003cbr\u003e"
