What\u2019s the point of talking about movies when we\u2019re speaking on different wavelengths?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStriving to bring you a fun, interactive way of movie discussion, I do all sorts of film commentary such as reviews of new releases, timeless classics, and other movies requested by fans!  In addition to reviews, I also take part in discussing movie news as well as create top ten lists and rankings of all different types of movies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that I can generate enough funds to bring MovieBabble to new people every single day while also dabbling in new and exciting projects. \u00a0Every little bit helps towards my goal and it would mean the world to me as I strive to succeed in one of my passions in life.  My ultimate goal is to one day be able to solely review films as a profession, so I would absolutely be grateful to anyone who gets me closer to my goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for your support! \u00a0Although I may never meet you, your support is something I will always cherish and be thankful for. \u00a0Thank you in advance and remember, #BabbleOn!"
