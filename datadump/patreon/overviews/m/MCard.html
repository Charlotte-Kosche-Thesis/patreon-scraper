    "summary": "+ have you ever read\none of my fics (from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/Cards_Slash\"\u003eAO3\u003c/a\u003e (Cards_Slash), or on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bewareofchris.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e (bewareofchris), or perhaps from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cards-slash.livejournal.com/\"\u003eLivejournal\u003c/a\u003e (Cards_slash)), and been one of the many that commented or thought: \u201cWow, that was pretty good.  I would buy that\nif it were a book.\u201d  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n+ do you have a few\nextra dollars lying around in your bank account, looking for a nice, new home?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n+ if you answered a\nresounding (or even lukewarm, or maybe a half-hearted) YES to the previous\nquestions, boy do I have an opportunity for you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCard, that is me, would\nlike to devote her time to writing an original novel (two of them, even).\n However, as writing is a passion and not a profession (that pays bills),\nthis has never been a viable reality. \u00a0You might say,\u00a0but, \u003cem\u003eCard\u003c/em\u003e, you have written\nmillions of words of fanfiction over the course of several years!  Why\ncan\u2019t you just write original fiction for free and wait to see if anyone wants\nto buy your crap? \u00a0Now, that is an\nexcellent point.  I have indeed written millions of words for free on the\ninternet because writing is, first and foremost, a \u003cem\u003epassion \u003c/em\u003eof mine.  Fanfiction provides me with\na community that I can interact with in a way that is easiest for me (that is\nto say, I write my feelings and thoughts and people chose to read or not read\naccording to their own feelings and thoughts).  I have been a moderately\nsuccessful fanfiction writer.  When it comes to writing, I thrive on interacting\nwith a community.  In writing an original fic, I don\u2019t want prestige or\nsudden wealth (I mean, nobody would turn down sudden wealth, right?) but a. the\nability to focus on writing without starving in the process, and b. to share it\nwith a community of folks that are interested.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo this end, I would like your support to do what I do best:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo write a large cast, long-form (fantasy) novel.  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will feature several of my\nmore memorable and repeated themes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- accepting\nyourself\u003cbr\u003e\n- overcoming bigotry/obstacles\u003cbr\u003e\n- love in many different forms: romantic, familial, friendship\u003cbr\u003e\n- dealing with/overcoming your childhood experiences to become a better person\u003cbr\u003e\n- is that really evil?  A guessing game.\u003cbr\u003e\n- yet again another long form story exploring the meaning of \u2018having a soul\u2019 \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ealong with some new ones:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- religion v.\nfaith, faith v. knowledge\u003cbr\u003e\n- the danger of group-think\u003cbr\u003e\n- the importance of feminism\u003cbr\u003e- the tendency of history to ignore contributes from minorities, the cost of\nthis erasure\u003cbr\u003e\n- the destruction of indigenous cultures by a power-mad Theocracy.\u003cbr\u003e\n- the balance and harmony of all things\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebut limited amounts of:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- unnecessary plot contrivances\u003cbr\u003e- ominous foreshadowing\u003cbr\u003e- suspiciously convenient magical relics that save the day\u003cbr\u003e- white guys\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarring some amazing\ncharacters such as:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- \u003cstrong\u003eEmma\u003c/strong\u003e, a\namateur (cross dressing) archaeologist and full-time heretic who is quietly\nexcavating and living in a giant temple that the religious leaders of the\nChurch of Aminali refuse to acknowledge exists.  \u003cbr\u003e\n- \u003cstrong\u003eSamara\u003c/strong\u003e, a possible former member of a royal family who came to save a girl\nshe loved but failed and ended up a prostitute instead.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- \u003cstrong\u003eCaramis\u003c/strong\u003e, a\nmouthy, unlikable, genius-type (17 year old) who was born part mage in a society\nthat burned his Mother alive the day he was born.

This includes becoming a terrorist and a fugitive,\nin an effort to destroy a system of religion that maims girls and enslaves its\nfollowers under the pretense of finding said Lost Goddess, (Aminali).\u003cbr\u003e\n-\u003cstrong\u003e Isabel\u003c/strong\u003e, Joseph\u2019s daughter who I cannot describe in a clever paragraph.\n You\u2019ll probably like her though.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- \u003cstrong\u003eJeyari\u003c/strong\u003e, decided not to get\nmarried and while her Father, the Chief was confused and pulled\nthat \u2018maybe you haven\u2019t met the right guy\u2019 thing yet, he ultimately\nfigured Jeyari probably wasn\u2019t going to change her mind and therefore was like:\nyou know what, you do you.
