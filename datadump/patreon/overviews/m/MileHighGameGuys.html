We started back in June of 2016 with a couple of cheap mics, a Nalgene for a mic stand, and a fierce desire to ramble inanely about all things board game related. Well, with a bit of hard work, a bunch of good fortune, and enough cursing to make a sailor blush, we have managed to grow into the best podcast produced entirely in Adrian\u0027s basement!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 And now that we\u0027ve made it an entire year and still don\u0027t hate each other, we are pressing on with more and more amazing content for all of our great listeners! Part of that includes this Patreon page, that\u0027s right, this one, right here, that you\u0027re currently on! This is a chance for us to raise some money to help with annoying things (like web and audio hosting) and with awesome things (like better equipment and more games to give away)! Not to mention that by supporting us you gain access to a bunch of awesome supporter-only stuff like live video hangouts, behind-the-scenes audio, Jeff\u0027s ridiculous hand-scrawled show notes, and much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what are you waiting for? You\u0027re already here, take the plunge and join us in making the Mile High Game Guys the best board game podcast in our neighborhood!!\u003cbr\u003e"
