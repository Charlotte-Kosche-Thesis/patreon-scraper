    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca\u003eWHAT \n          PATREON IS AND HOW IT WORKS \u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003ePatreon is a website which uses a variation on the idea \n          of crowd funding to give artists ongoing funds to continue making their \n          art. Prospective\n\u003cem\u003e patrons can agree to donate a fixed sum of money each \n          month\n\u003c/em\u003e to their favorite artists\u0027 accounts. In return the artists can reward his patrons with different prizes which vary according \n          to how much support the patron gives, just as in other crowd funding \n          sites, such as \n\u003cstrong\u003eGoFundMe\u003c/strong\u003e,\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eKickStarter\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eIndiegogo\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n        The thing \n          which sets Patreon apart from crowd funding sites is that it \n          provides \n\u003cem\u003eongoing\u003c/em\u003e support. For example, someone viewing a Patreon \n          artist\u0027s page they really like might choose to donate at the $5 per \n          month level, and for this their reward might be the ability to access \n          a restricted part of the site which has videos of work in progress, \n          or some other reward. Other levels of monthly support usually have increasingly \n          more desirable, and/or valuable rewards for increased levels of financial \n          support. The artist sets the support/reward relationships he thinks \n          will attract patrons. Alternatively, he might make the entire site open \n          to everyone, and accept whatever level of support people wish to contribute. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n        It is an elegant, fair and affordable \n          solution to the age-old problem artists have of locating and attracting \n          patronage in order to be able to concentrate on making their art. \n\u003cstrong\u003ePatrons \n          can stop support at any time, or change the level of their support, \n\u003c/strong\u003e\nso it behooves artists to make the rewards worth the patron\u0027s support \n          and to promptly fulfill all promises of rewards they make. The most \n          valuable things about this model is that it allows artists to 1) build \n          a base of patrons/fans, 2) to receive possibly significant support and \n          3) become more widely known.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n        If you enjoy what I am doing on \n          this site, I invite you to seriously consider becoming my patron. Your \n          support will allow me to make more and better art, and I think I have \n          some very enticing rewards for my patrons.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eWant to become my patron?\u00a0 Just click the big red\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Become a patron\" \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e button on the upper right corner of this page.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you \u003c/strong\u003efor taking the time to \n          look at my Patreon site!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n        -- Martin\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca\u003eWHO IS MARTIN DE MADRID?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a classically-trained realist painter who has been painting professionally for over 20 years.\u00a0 My specialty is the materials and techniques of the great masters of the Baroque (17th century: Velasquez, Rubens, Rembrandt, etc.).\u00a0 I work in most of the traditional media: pastels, oils, watercolor, chalk,\u00a0 graphite (pencil), charcoal, etc., and I have highly-developed teaching skills honed over the past forty-four years teaching everything from yoga to emergency medicine to English.\u00a0 Some of you might remember my \n\u003cem\u003eOld Masters\u0027 Painting Techniques Newsletter\u003c/em\u003e, a vlog on classical painting techniques in the early 2000s.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter developing a violent allergy to turpentine (I am investigating the use of oil of spike lavender as a non-allergenic replacement for the turps), I decided to return to\n basics, and for a classical artist, that means drawing.  Currently I am\n working on three major drawing educational projects: the Brague \nsight-size drawing course; figure drawing from imagination using the \nBurne Hogarth figure drawing series; and learning to animate.  Along the\n way I have picked up advanced skills in perspective drawing. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been working on a Master\u0027s degree in Creativity Studies, and am using what I learn to inform and transform my art processes, as well as using those processes as part of my \"laboratory\" in writing the Master\u0027s degree thesis.\u00a0 My research centers on the creative processes of animators, because they have so many levels of creativity in their work, from drawing to \"acting with a pencil\", to giving input on script changes.\u00a0 They work in a high-pressure, deadline-driven environment and so have to constantly push their creativity to keep up.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs part of my degree requirements,\n\u003cstrong\u003e I am animating at least one scene from my project to make a film about the life of Milarepa, the patron saint of Tibet.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 I lived with and studied under a renowned lama in Milarepa\u0027s lineage, and have excellent contacts for this effort.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince my goal is to support my continued creativity, I have been sure to include rewards which take you into the process behind my art: the doodles, philosophical elements, alternative ideas, and, most importantly a \"Creativity Blog\", or \"Artist\u0027s Diary\" where I will keep a stream-of-consciousness diary of what I think about while drawing (or silversmithng, or painting, or whatever).\u00a0 I have really tried to give great value in return for your generosity in believing in, and supporting my endeavor.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut this effort is more than just about me creating something interesting, it is also about helping you to master the important artistic techniques which allow YOU to create, so there are rewards which teach the technical side of art, too.\u00a0 At the high end, I will even be your mentor and critique your work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nKeep checking back, I will have a video (or two) and some work put up, hopefully soon.\u00a0 Oh, and a big THANK YOU!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-- Martin\n\u003cbr\u003e"
