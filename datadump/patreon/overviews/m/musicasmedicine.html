    "summary": "Hello and thank you for visiting my page on Patreon!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThis project is dedicated to funding\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.lydiafiddle.com\"\u003eLydia Violet\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u0026amp; The\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.musicasmedicineproject.org\"\u003eMusic As Medicine Project\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e! We are dedicated to emboldening community resilience through music, music education, and Joanna Macy\u0027s Work That\u00a0Reconnects. We are guided by a\u00a0vision that values health and well-being, music, community activism, creativity, environmental justice, and music education. \u003c/strong\u003eThese values are precious in our current political and planetary moment. If you share in this vision and wish to help create a culture of beauty while celebrating a diversity of musical traditions and a great love for the Earth, you are in the right place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy contributing your \u003cstrong\u003etax-deductible donation\u003c/strong\u003e to this campaign you will be directly supporting Lydia Violet and the Music As Medicine Project. Who is Lydia Violet? I am a Bay Area violinist and vocalist, teacher, activist, and event producer. I am\u00a0deeply inspired by folk, blues, and protest music traditions. In my solo project I combine some of my favorite instruments like the fiddle, banjo, and stand-up bass with 3-part harmonies to offer a soul-folk revival experience. I also have gotten to play \u0026amp; collaborate with some\u00a0\u003cem\u003eincredible\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0musicians!\u00a0In the past year I have had the pleasure of working with Rising Appalachia, Climbing PoeTree, Ayla Nereo, and have been featured on Democracy Now! w/ Amy Goodman.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have also\u00a0studied closely for 9+ years with deep ecology elder\nand Buddhist scholar Joanna Macy\u003c/strong\u003e, learning how we can\nmetabolize our concerns around our current planetary moment into action, resiliency, and profound communion with our human and\nmore-than-human communities. \u003cstrong\u003eMacy\u0027s work helps people transform despair and apathy, in the face of overwhelming social and ecological crises, into constructive, collaborative action. It brings a new way of seeing the world, as our larger living body, freeing us from the assumptions and attitudes that now threaten the continuity of life on Earth.\u003c/strong\u003e I have studied and co-facilitated with Joanna for many years, and three years ago pioneered, \u201cMusic\nAs Medicine In Our Time\u201d with Penny Livingston at the Regenerative Design\nInstitute in Bolinas, CA. In this workshop we brought together Macy\u0027s \u201cWork That Reconnects\u201d with exploring community and movement music that nourishes, promotes justice, and facilitates healing in our communities. I have continued to teach these workshops as they have great relevance to the situations we find ourselves in as a people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusic As Medicine is ready to expand, and we have an exciting new facet to our work!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWe are in partnership with an East Bay high school who recently lost their music classes due to budget cuts to fund a music program back in that school!! With enough funding, we will be able to start this in the 2018-19 school year this fall! I have seen the budgets, and I can tell you that this is \u003cem\u003ecompletely \u003c/em\u003epossible, and we need our community support to do it! My music classes were fundamental to my well-being as a young person, and I am committed to creating that opportunity for as many school-aged children as possible. When our children are healthier, our societies are too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo date I have been mostly self-managed and funded, pouring my resources into a vision I believe it. That or I need to charge a certain amount for workshop attendance to support myself. While this is standard in workshop culture, it inevitably cuts off access for people who don\u0027t have the resources to attend, perpetuating lack of access to these programs. The good news is that the success of these workshops, classes, concerts, and community events has led to invitations to teach and play all over the country. \u003cstrong\u003eThe difficult part is that I am also no longer able to personally finance the needs of this growing project, and that\u0027s where I need your help.\u003c/strong\u003e When you subscribe to support me on Patreon, your funds will directly help me to both teach and create more programming through my fiscally-sponsored organization, The Music As Medicine Project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am committed to staying an accessible resource for people who want to learn and experience the work of beloved elder Joanna Macy. I am applying for grants and funding to launch and continue these programs, but this money won\u0027t become available for one or two years. One of the keys to my success will be my community support. I wish to create a robust scholarship fund, but in order for this to be a reality I need further support. I\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0know that this is absolutely possible, because we live in a time where people still care deeply about what happens to each other.\u003c/strong\u003e If enough people sign up to contribute towards the Music As Medicine vision, I will be resourced enough to create our scholarship fund, music programs in more schools, put on more workshops and trainings, and create even more culturally rich community events. \u003cstrong\u003eIn a time when there are those creating cultures of fear and violence, it is more important than ever to respond with creating culture that forges resilience, kindness, creativity, education, courage, and resource-sharing.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Patreon is a way for that to remain sustainable, and for the production quality of my offerings to continue improving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Lydia Violet music project is also ready for wings. I will keep creating art no matter what my financial situation is. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0for this music project to have a decent chance at success, I need to be able to fund high quality media, live band tours, invitations to open for larger groups, etc.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Your support would immensely help me be able to do these things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrently I play artist, manager, booking agent, teacher, event producer, graphic designer, video editor, CFO, curriculum developer, and more!\u003c/strong\u003e Needless to say, I am ready to delegate some of these tasks to others, and just need to resources to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo please, take a look around.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0And if you like what you see, and want to help stoke the fire of this project into it\u0027s next incarnation, please pledge a monthly amount here through Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?
