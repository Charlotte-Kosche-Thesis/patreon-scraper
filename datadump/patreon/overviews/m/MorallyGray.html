I first learned this traveling trade when discussion creationists and religion was the norm. From here, i learned that the exact same skills can be applied to other topics. In 2012 i began applying this to feminism, which at the time, was all the rage. It took me until 2016 to start YouTube, to which i haven\u0027t looked back. You can find my channel here (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLYcOeMcoFI5LYPfqR2PW8g) and my twitter here (https://twitter.com/VeryMorallyGray). I welcome discussion on any topic. I hope to talk to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you for any potential doors you might open by pledging $1 to my world domination. \u003cbr\u003eMuch Love. \u003cbr\u003e"

Money allows me to afford many things, like food, power bills, meth, brothel nights, long walks on the beach, and a general comforting feeling that i won\u0027t die squatting in some back alleyway, turning my emaciated corpse into a chew toy for a family of feral dogs. I\u0027m also a bird lover.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless if you are a Patreon or not, my content will always be free to view. I see no point in restricting people. I will always be upfront and honest in how i am going about things.
