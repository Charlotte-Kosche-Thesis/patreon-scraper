Meandrous is like that, except the person making it isn\u0027t technically required by threat-of-bad-grade-if-you-don\u0027t to make mountains out of tinfoil or spray fake snow onto fake trees. The result is dioramas that are a lot cooler- cause they\u0027re made with like, love and stuff. Or, if not love, at least intense interest and moderate cursing and sometimes a magnifying glass. The point is they\u0027re dioramas, but they\u0027re cool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the dioramas are display items, some are wearable in jewelry, some you can play with like for dollhouse or tabletop gaming (like Warhammer et al, or D\u0026amp;D.) They\u0027re basically for anyone who loves to see tiny things, fantasies, and fandoms come to life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwJCdrg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Meander, and why another Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m Meander! I\u0027ve been making kind of weird, kind of fantastical wearable art online since 2004. Although I\u0027ve sold on eBay and Etsy and all kinds of places, these days I make my work in much smaller batches and sell pretty exclusively at local specialty boutiques and art galleries. It\u0027s not that I\u0027m snotty or something and I believe in accessible, affordable artwork for anyone who wants it-- it\u0027s just that I have a busy life and can\u0027t really keep up with the high intensity of online marketing and social media required to be successful online. Artwork is my income right now, but I\u0027m also a full time student, single parent to a tiny zombie shark child, and have a pretty intense disability. The slower pace of working and selling only in my community helps me balance all the things I need to do, but a side effect of not doing much online is that I really make a ton of items that I never end up sharing to my online followers. Unless you go into a specific gallery or a specific boutique, you\u0027ll never see them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is a way to support me for the effort involved in sharing these un-shared projects as well as tutorials, creating high-quality shots which can be made into prints or background images for phones or computers, special giveaways, and more. If you like to, and are in the position to, be a supporter of the arts and you like my work, please consider becoming my patron today!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

     "description": "\u00a0\u25cf \u00a0Patrons at this level will be invited to suggest diorama or terrain scenes they\u0027d like to see made. This is a recurring perk! I\u0027ll take ongoing suggestions for terrain or diorama scenes or themes and each month, I\u0027ll select from the pool of suggestions and make a terrain or diorama with my choice of size and intricacy as I feel fits. It could be inspired by your favorite book, or maybe be a setting from your own original comic. It\u0027s a chance to see something you\u0027re a fan of in terrain-form!\u003cbr\u003e\n \u25cf \u00a0The patron whose suggestion is selected will be the -only- recipient of the behind-the-scenes photos for this item only and will also receive the finished photos before all the other patrons. The patron who inspired the build will also get to select one of the photos and will receive a high-res copy without a watermark, logo, website, or any distinguishing mark so it\u0027s clean for printing and hanging. The picture will be personal use only, but the patron is welcome to print and gift, just no commercial sales. :\u0026gt; The set will be released to other patrons after the winning patron\u0027s sneak-peak and will be named and credited as the inspiration for the build.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u25cf \u00a0In addition, you can have a 50% off coupon toward the purchase of any piece you inspired in case you want to own more than just a photo!
