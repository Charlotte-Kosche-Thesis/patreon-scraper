     "about": "What\u0027s up fellas? My name is Carrington, otherwise better known as Megalomanic14 in the android community and on Xda. I am a developer. I have developed and continue to build and refine some of the most popular custom roms, modifications, and tools for over 50 devices. Chances are if you have used a flagship samsung, lg, htc, motorola, huawei, or sony android device over the last several years chances are you\u0027ve either used some of my work or ran software with pieces of included. My roms include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFireNote: for the jelly bean galaxy note 1/2 era roms\u003cbr\u003eFireKat: kit kat era roms\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFireMate: Ascend Mate 7 Rom\u003cbr\u003ePopRocks: Lollipop roms for galaxy, lg, and nexus aosp devices\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am building a website and community resource because in my experience on Xda I\u0027ve realized there is a major gap between those more technically advanced users and the millions of everyday smartphone owners out there that could use the information, educational videos, technical support and help...I will also be conduction live online support as well as directed message interactions for personal technical support from myself via an interactive forum or messaging center. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may be asking yourself...why support my patreon campaign? \u00a0What benefit or end result is expected? Very simply...smartphones and tablets are the way of the future. As pc and laptops die out and the mobile ecosystems continue to evolve I want to provide a resource where I curate my rom development section for as many devices as possible; to bring a much more optimized experience with more powerful performance and battery efficient software that will be available for as many devices as possible. I want to bring step by step tutorial videos detailing basics such as setting up your phone, and basic power management help, to the more advanced tutorials on root and installing the new rom software.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, I want to bring the amazing experience I\u0027ve accumulated over the past 4 or 5 years and pass it on to as many people as possible. You see, the days of a phone being a phone are gone. Today we pay 600, 700, up to $800 dollars for a device on top of a 2 year $2000 monthly subscription to accompanying service...it\u0027s time for someone to step in and bring a unified wealth of materials and knowledge to raise the capability and satisfaction of your pocket mini computer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to bringing the instructional videos, tutorials, news articles and write ups, and refined optimized software to the table, I also plan a series of in depth explanations and comparison videos to really elaborate on the questions people have when updating devices. Is this device better than my last? Will it be future proof? Ect \u00a0As the next generation of advanced technology hits I want to have detailed comparisons of what your getting for your money vs what the ad men and hype reps are selling us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve enjoyed my roms over the years...you\u0027ve enjoyed the optimized experience that gave you your money\u0027s worth from your device please sign up to support my patreon campaign. \u00a0If I just had a few hundred of the thousands of you amazing dudes that populate my threads pledge a buck each month, you\u0027ll be supporting me in trying to bring a new community together for us without the shackles and attitude of other mobile sites, and raise the enjoyment and experience of everyone\u0027s devices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will your patreon funding go to each month?...as I plan to go ahead with launching the community and full time developmental and tech support, the resources will support funding the server that houses the roms and software on a high speed/high bandwith line, continued expansion and upkeep of the website and domain, research and possible device purchases to facilitate further advancement in the developmental and programming areas, and it will allow me to put all my time, focus, and passion intl launching the community that we will be building together...with your help let\u0027s make this a reality....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks alot,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCarrington...aka..Megalomanic14",
