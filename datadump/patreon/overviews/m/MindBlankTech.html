For all fans and viewers who have enjoyed my YouTube PC Tech channel and are at the core of its growth, I want to thank you for your support, kind words and holding the content I make in such high regard!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my Patreon page, where from now on you have the possibility of influencing even more this channel\u0027s growth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth is that MindBlank Tech is, right now, run 85%+ with money from my own pocket. 10K subscribers is not nearly enough to attract the attention of all companies in the PC business to the point of having a constant stream of new hardware to review, test, investigate and turn into the content that you all like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube\u0027s revenue is a far cry from supporting me and this channel needs, so hopefully, with Patreon support from fans, I can at least accomplish 2 major things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.\u003c/strong\u003e Increase the upload frequency of my content. Right now, with GREAT efforts, I am at around 2 videos per week. Besides the actual time the videos themselves demand, I need to keep a day job to support me and my family. With this Patreon I aim to become independent in the future, therefore dedicating 100% of my energy towards MindBlank Tech.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. \u003c/strong\u003eIncreased revenue also allow me to directly buy new products for review, without being at the manufacturers appraisal if this channel deserves or not a review sample. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s not a lot I can give back to you guys at the moment, except the content that I create and my humble gratitude, but as time ticks on I plan on giving back to my fast growing community. I\u0027m still working on the details but at the top of my list is a PC centered forum where all of you can come, discuss and create an even more flourishing community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for your continued support and for believing in me!"
