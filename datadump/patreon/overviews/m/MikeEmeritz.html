Will it fill your mind with so much entertainment that you have to rent additional brain-space in the skull of an unconscious sea-otter? For your sake, I hope so. For the otter... not so much. We shall see though, won\u0027t we?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoking aside, my dream has always been to entertain, to tell stories, to create things people can enjoy, and Patreon is an opportunity for me to connect with the people who enjoy what I do the most. With a lot of hard work, a little luck and some help from you, I hope I can continue to produce the kind of work that both you and I enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I have to take whatever work I can get, and that doesn\u0027t always leave much time for my own personal art or comics, but I still do what I can anyway, thirty minutes at a time if I have to, because it\u0027s that important to me. Patreon is an opportunity where self-publishing regular content could potentially allow me more time to make more content. It won\u0027t\u00a0be easy, and it certainly won\u0027t\u00a0be an overnight thing, but I\u0027m putting in the time already. I might as well invite you along for the journey. I know exactly where I\u0027m trying to go, I\u0027m just not sure exactly when I\u0027ll get there: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be making art and comics full-time, putting out books as often as I\u0027m able to finish them, and experimenting with other creative ideas that I simply don\u0027t have time for right now.\u00a0I\u0027m already putting in the work in pursuit of this goal. With your support, I believe I can make it a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnward and upward!\u003cbr\u003eMike :)\u003c/strong\u003e"
