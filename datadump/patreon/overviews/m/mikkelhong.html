    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page.\u00a0 I am going to be writing a memoir chapter per month to publish on here.\u00a0 You will be my first readers (besides my initial editors, of course). This Patreon will allow me to justify my time spent writing and editing, my busman\u0027s holiday, after teaching full time and coming home to to my wonderful rowdy house and all the time and love that keeping that together involves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month, $5/month supporters will receive an e-book formatted chapter of my memoir.\u00a0 This allows me to release and get feedback from people that actually want to read my work, without putting all of my messy life onto the internet for any old body to find, including my students and my mom (although I hope you do subscribe, mom).\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If I get enough of a collection of stories, you will be the first to receive the complete, fully edited e-book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a sample of my chapter \"Cooking for Cons\": \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cSo you have cooked before?\u201d she asks, looking hard over horned-rimmed glasses.  Bonnie, the weekday cook at a Bellingham, Washington halfway house for excons, looked skeptical. I\u0027d seen the ad for a weekend cook position at a halfway house for excons.  I had often wondered about the house, a humongous white Victorian, surrounded by mature chestnut trees, a block away from my apartment.  Sullen men dressed in two decades ago fashions perpetually smoked on the large porch, staring idly toward the outside world.  A large picture window in the front revealed Hawaiian-shirted guard reclining in an office chair before a bank of CCTV screens.  I was now sitting in an office at the back of the house, speaking to the warden, a friendly but tough white haired woman, and the weekday cook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOh yeah.\u201d I said, confident. \u201cI\u0027ve cooked at a bunch of local restaurants, I have a passion for home-cooking, so I am always tinkering, refining, rejiggering my favorite recipes. I just really love to cook and I\u0027m good at it.\u201d I meant it, too! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWell, okay,\u201d she said, dropping what passed for my resume on the table that separated us. \u201cLet\u0027s see was you got.  You start next Saturday but Thursday I\u0027ll show you the kitchen, take you to  Cash \u0027n\u0027 Carry to meet those guys and use our account. I\u0027ll introduce you to a couple of the cons who will help you out.  They get work hours for helping with dishes and such.  Good for them, easier on you.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThat\u0027s great,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks a lot.\u201d\u003cbr\u003eBonnie eyed me again. \u201cYou do realize you won\u0027t get paid for Thursday.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOkay, no problem,\u201d I replied.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe shook her head slightly.  \u201cYou\u0027ll be cooking for 24 inmates.  All felons. Almost all men.  And four staff.  Breakfast and dinner. Saturday and Sunday.  Lot\u0027s of meat.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI swallowed hard at that last part. I didn\u0027t eat meat, never had.  I kept that to myself and managed a \u201cYup!\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2663\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRough and burly, Bonnie led me around the halfway house kitchen in a furious blur.  \u201cMost of these guys are just fucking idiots!\u201d she told me as we stacked #10 tin cans of diced tomatoes.  \u201cI\u0027m talking extremely stupid!  I mean, you basically have to commit a crime right in front of a cop to get busted.  Shit!\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWell...,\u201d I began to demur.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYou fill out your background check yet?\u201d she cut in.  \u201cIf you haven\u0027t, don\u0027t put a damn thing on there that the FBI won\u0027t find on your permanent record. If it was struck from your record, it was struck from your record.  That\u0027s the goddamn point of getting things struck from your record!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the first time, it occurred to me that Bonnie might have had something struck from her record.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cDon\u0027t ever leave a knife in the dishwater.  Don\u0027t ever leave the knife drawer unlocked. The day guard  will open it for you when you get here. Whenever you leave, he locks it.  This is an unarmed facility, if an inmate gets a knife, we have to tear the whole damn place apart looking for it. And no piss test for us, here, so if you smoke anything other than cigarettes, keep it to yourself!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cDon\u0027t let these guys fuck with you. If they see any weakness in you, they will crawl right up your ass until they get what they want. Usually more orange juice or bacon.  They may be dumb as shit, but they\u0027re expert manipulators. That\u0027s what got them locked up in the first place.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore brilliant tidbits of angry wisdom burst forth as we careered through Cash \u0027n\u0027 Carry dropping humongous quantities of food on the palate jack.  A twenty-five pound tube of frozen ground beef (\u201cTake it out of the freezer two nights before you need it.\u201d), 30 pounds of pork loin (\u201cPut it in a low oven after you finish cleaning up breakfast, that way it\u0027ll be done by dinner and you didn\u0027t have to do anything all day.\u201d), and 10 packs of frozen orange juice (\u201cI\u0027m telling you, they\u0027ll get inside your head. They\u0027ll try to scare you into giving them extra.  They try to figure out where you live. And some of these fucks are child molesters!\u201d). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Bonnie\u0027s advice ricocheting about my brain, I tried to figure out how the hell I was going to actually do the job I had been hired to do.  My mind shouted complaints and warnings as Bonnie went on and on.  Child molesters? A pound of meat per person per meal? How in the hell was I going to actually do this job? Despite my interview bravado, I was not ready to do this.  I had a diploma from a private college, I could do anything. I thought. How could a lifelong vegatarian be expected to cook 30 pounds of meat at a time for 24 very hungry, very scary customers demanding good food on time, every time, or else?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
