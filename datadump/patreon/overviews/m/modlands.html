By typing commands in the chat, members of the audience create, \ncustomize, and control their own individual characters, telling them \nwhat to do, while the streamer builds the world around them. The game \ncan be played in co-op survival mode with the streamer and audience \nsurviving against mobs, competitively (with the chat users playing as \nfactions or in a battle royale), or in pacifist creative / social mode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is also extremely moddable by design - it\u0027s relatively easy to add new things to the game, and I\u0027m working on adding in-game tools to make modding even easier!
