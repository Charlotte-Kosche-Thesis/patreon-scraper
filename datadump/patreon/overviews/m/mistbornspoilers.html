    "summary": "We\nall enjoy well written Fiction. If you\u0027ve made it to this page,\nyou probably enjoy it even more than most. The spoilers project believes that Fantasy and Science Fiction have provided us\nwith an escape from our ordinary, mundane lives.  For an hour or an\nafternoon we get to live in someone else\u2019s world, a different world\nwhere our protagonist\u0027s problems have tangible solutions.\u00a0 We get to step into someone else\u0027s shoes and see the world in a different, refreshing way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeth\nand Patrick are creating the\u00a0 Mistborn Spoilers Podcast so that we can spend more\ntime in those worlds, and be sure that we have fully explored them,\nor at least continue to, endlessly.  If you are like us, you\u0027ve probably \nfinished the last book of a beloved series and felt a little\ndepressed. Sad at the prospect that you may never again be able to\nvisit the familiar places and faces we\u0027ve come to know while\ninvesting that time reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut\nsome of us are not deterred by this problem, because there is a\nsimple solution.  We read them again.   \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSeth\nand Patrick already create the WOTspoilers podcast.  Where, as\nfriends who are both huge fans of that series read through it chapter\nby chapter, and discuss the history, lore, foreshadowings and hidden\nmeanings in the series.  Twice a week we record live, for any Patron\nto listen, join in the conversation we\u0027re having, send us real time\ncorrections, and your own theories.  We also create Patron only lore\nepisodes, and send out free swag to all donors, not to mention\ngetting your name read aloud on the podcast.  Our little online book\nclub has been a much bigger success than we ever expected.  So, we\u0027ve\ndecided to the very same thing with another series we love.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\nwould have to be a completed series if we\u0027re going to present it with\nthe same spoilerific style, and we wanted this new book club to be\ninteresting to at least some our awesome, die-hard fans, and friends of the Wheel of Time Spoilers Podcast.  We both love how Sanderson\nhandled completing the Wheel of Time series.  That\u0027s how we\ndiscovered him.  That led both of us to check out his other books,\nand eventually becoming big fans of the Cosmere as well. So, our\nanswer was pretty clear.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe\nMistborn Spoilers Podcast will be our next project.  It will run\nalongside WOTspoilers, and at the same time.  WOTspoilers releases 3,\u00a0 45 minute(ish) episodes per week.  Within three months of today\u0027s\ndate 3/16/18 We\u0027d like to be releasing two 45 minute(ish) Mistborn\npodcasts per week as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\n\n\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\nPatreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nIt\ntakes a lot of time to research each episode properly, to read 5,000+\npage series like Mistborn multiple times, and to record and produce\nthe audio at a level of quality that our listeners deserve. We hope\nto make these spoiler book clubs our full time job, and if we add up the\nhours we\u0027ve spent between the two projects they really already are\nfull time jobs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf\ncourse, there are also hard costs to running the show. We have\nmultiple domain names to pay for and podcast file hosting through\nLiberated Syndication, audio equipment and sound proofing for the\nstudio/office we\u0027ve been slowly building.  Travel costs to\nconventions and podcasting events to create live shows, Electric,\nheat, and internet for the work space, not to mention an unbelievable\namount of coffee. Patreon support will help us cover those expenses,\nand continue bringing you the shows you want at better and better\nquality each week. \u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank\nYou\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nEvery\ndonor makes a difference.  You help us keep the internet and lights\non, each donation might also go to building a better studio, and\nmaybe one day actually paying the many people who help us with these\nprojects out of the kindness of their hearts, and their love for\nthese books. For that we are eternally grateful. Our podcasts are out\nthere, totally free for anyone to listen to and enjoy. Tell your\nfriends and spread the word. And if you find that you want to help\npush The Spoilers projects into the next Age or Universe, consider\ncontributing a small amount each month toward one show, or both. With\nyour help, we can continue to bringing you insight into the books you\nlove!\u003cbr\u003ewe\u0027ve had some requests, so if it\u0027s more your bag you can donate using Bitcoin.\u003cbr\u003e1vVcaXVQS5SCjRCq4efjjXEE5w84c4XYT\u003cbr\u003eJoin our conversation, here\u00a0https://discord.gg/WSYGZpJ"
