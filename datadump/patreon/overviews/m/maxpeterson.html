    "summary": "I\u2019m Max\nPeterson, and I\u2019m a writer, musician, filmmaker, poet, podcaster: a dilettante who\nbelieves that art is a marriage of experience and experimentation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe content that will appear here most regularly is a deep-dive film appreciation podcast called\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eMEASURING FLICKS\u003c/strong\u003e, which I record with my friend, Karl Hartley. We do four episodes a month on iTunes, but Patreon is the place where we release exclusive companion episodes, covering remakes and sequels of the films we dig into on the pod, along with directors and films that didn\u0027t fit into the monthly \"Themes\" of the main show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write stories, poems, plays, comics, and films (which I sometimes produce and direct: the films I make are influenced by my love of Art House, B-Movies, Grindhouse, and Independent cinema).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve\nrecorded rockabilly, blues, drone, rock, country, punk...my approach\nto music is to blend colors and canvases, experimenting with genres and sonic\npalettes. A country\nalbum written from the perspective of serial killers. A lo-fi\nalbum reveling in the unpredictability of guitar feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat sort of\nstuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo everyone\nwho\u2019s read, watched, or listened to my work over the past decade: thank you so,\nso much. I\u2019m enormously grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe things I\ndo take a lot of time, and sometimes a lot of money (films projects especially): gas,\nfood, lodging, massive external hard drives, lenses, studio time...to say nothing of the actors, musicians,\ncamera operators, audio engineers, and other artists I work with.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNot all my\nprojects will cost the same, but the more budget I have, the bigger the\nprojects I can tackle, the better I can make them, and the more I can pay the\ncreators I work on those projects with.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd I\u2019m\ngoing to try to put most of those projects out in the world for free, on\nYoutube, Bandcamp, Soundcloud, my website: wherever I can. (Some things--big things\nlike feature films--I\u2019ll take around the festivals first, but for the most\npart, I just want people to see it all, and share it, and dig it.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo here I am.\nThe great Patreon experiment. To the people who are making the work possible,\nwhether you\u2019re backing me a Buck or a Benjamin:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so\nmuch.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n-- Max\nPeterson\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n.....................\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nP.S \u2013\nPLEDGING \u201cPER CREATION\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI decided to\ncharge \u201cPer Creation\u201d rather than \u201cPer Month\u201d because sometimes projects take\nawhile. If I\u2019m not putting anything out on a given month, Patreon won\u2019t process\nyour pledge that month (or three months, or however long some big project takes).\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf I\u2019m on\nfire, and put out more than one thing in a month, Patreon allows you to CAP\nyour pledge each month, so you\u2019ll never be charged more than what your budget\nallows. If I don\u2019t do anything in a given month, you won\u2019t be charged anything\nat all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd even if\nyou cap your pledge, if I put out THREE things in month, or FIVE things in a\nmonth, you\u2019ll still get everything. No punishment for capping!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe \u201cPer\nCreation\u201d path seems more in line with how I work as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e"
