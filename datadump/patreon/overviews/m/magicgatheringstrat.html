In that time we have created more than 8,000 videos with over 3,000,000 views, written hundreds of articles, organized dozens of events, hosted podcasts, streamed on Twitch, and raised money for charities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you know what? We have loved every bit of it, and we want to keep going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, to keep things going as they have been or, even better, to gain momentum, become better, and do more, well -- we need your support. All of this takes time and energy, and Magic isn\u0027t a cheap hobby to begin with.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you like what we do and want us to keep going; if you want more videos, more articles, and more fun events; heck, even if you just want to keep hearing the lovely lilt of Dan\u0027s accent, then please consider becoming a patron. For as little as a cup of coffee per month you can keep us moving forward and making fun Magic content well into the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat does it cost?\u003c/h2\u003e\nWe hope that you will choose to support us with a minimum amount of $5 per month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMilestone Goals\u003c/h2\u003eWe have made our Milestone Goals even bigger and spaced them out a bit further so that they embody a realistic time committment on our part based on the amount of support we are bringing in. In the meantime we will continue to provide awesome, regular content on our website and YouTube channels.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePledge Rewards\u003c/h2\u003ePledge level rewards become active after you have been a patron for at least two months.
