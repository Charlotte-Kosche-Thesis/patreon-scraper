My writing mainly focuses on characterization and relationships between characters, but I\u0027d like to say that I have some plot here and there to speak of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/euP8GGf.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Mel Sayre - typical 25-year-old human with no extraordinary powers (other than being professional cat pillow).
