    "summary": "Are you tired of the ABSURD stigma around mental illness? Do you believe there\u0027s a better way to find emotional freedom than for you or someone you know to live with mental illness in secret while trying to medicate it away? If so, you\u0027re in the right place, baby, and I am THRILLED to have you here! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to the movement! Ready to get real?* Let\u0027s dive in...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt age 20, I was released by the hospital into my parent\u0027s custody after being diagnosed as clinically insane. I was told by over a dozen mental health professionals that I\u0027d have to be medicated for life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI struggled with bipolar type 1, anxiety, ADHD, depression, bulimia and insomnia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSociety and the professional mental health world BOTH made me feel like my\u00a0ONLY option was to just live my life around strict\u00a0medication procedures and avoid talking about it with others so that I wouldn\u0027t be judged or discriminated against.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI call bullsh*t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we try to \"hide\" something, we only make it worse. It only ADDS to the stigma.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, even though OVER A DOZEN professionals insisted I must be \"medicated for life,\" I have been blissfully stable and medication free for over two years because of a practice in unconditional self-love and acceptance as well as a\u00a0daily commitment to mindfulness and miracles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s a miracle? A miracle is simply anytime you return fear to love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe process of returning my thoughts to love is how I live with Bipolar Type 1, without medication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use music, meditation and various other mindfulness practices to stay grounded and centered despite what EVERY professional I ever saw told me I must do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I\u0027m creating for you: monthly guided meditations with beautiful background tracks (that I compose) that you can download as an MP3 to enjoy over and over again, live group calls, sneak peaks into my songwriting process, and special mindfulness tools and practices that I use regularly in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore people NEED to know it\u0027s possible to live as an \"intense\" person (as I like to call myself) without having to hide it or feel out of control, or worse - totally controlled by medications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to have a pill to wake me up, a pill to numb me out, a pill to make me focus, a pill to keep me calm, and pill to put me to sleep. I felt like a robot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t get me wrong, medication saved my life at one point, and many people find it works for them. But with my high-dosage cocktail of 13 pills/day, I KNEW there had to be another way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI found it, and now I\u0027m no a mission to share HOW I found it through music, meditation and other mindfulness practices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is for you whether you just love music and meditation OR you\u0027re looking for some tips to\u00a0find emotional freedom.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, you\u0027re supporting a cause the world needs right now. Once we support and accept all the different ways humans think, feel, and process the world around them, people will naturally feel freer, thus alleviating a lot of the added anxiety many people face simply for trying to hide their mental illness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlright love, ready to make some change in this world AND positively benefit your own life? Let\u0027s do it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for joining this movement!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*More real talk: I\u0027m not a medical professional of ANY KIND. I\u0027m just a human on a healing journey who has experienced the power of living mindfully and practicing radial self-love. I\u0027m also not anti-medication - medication saved my\u00a0life - I just got to a point in my life where I was tired of being controlled by it. If medication feels good to you, you do you, but don\u0027t feel stuck or trapped by your diagnosis. There\u0027s always emotional freedom that CAN be found.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
