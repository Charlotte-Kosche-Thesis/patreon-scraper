My work is philosophical, nihilistic, introspective and lots of other big college level buzzwords that ultimately are here to make me sound smart. People trust you more when you sound smart. I read that somewhere. I write novels, short fiction, comics and make art. I really just love to tell stories and share content with people, and that\u0027s my overall goal, but I also would like to avoid ever having to leave the house and find real work. I mean, honestly, me going outside wouldn\u0027t be good for anyone involved.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you sign up for as low as a buck a month, the Patreon only content you get is comics (a day or week early), podcasts (a week early), new serialized chapters (a week early), Patreon only comics/podcasts, posts about my work and upcoming projects, plus the rewards. If you donate to this page, you will not only get updates and stuff here\n first, but you\u0027ll also literally be helping my girlfriend and I pay our\n rent and buy groceries and simply survive. Anything you give will be \nabsolutely greatly appreciated.

Some of these will change, for instance when a season of a serialized fiction like The Rabbit Collective ends a new one will take its place either on the same day or a different day. For instance, Family Game Night, when it returns January 7th, will be posted on Sundays. I will list other projects and their release dates as they arise (such as Beatrice Beagle). Other things like posts from either my blog or from Medium have no set dates, and will simply be linked here when they go up.
