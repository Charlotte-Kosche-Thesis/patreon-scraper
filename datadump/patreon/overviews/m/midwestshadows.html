    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWhat do we do?\u003c/h3\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Midwest Shadows is a different kind of paranormal channel...our investigations and adventures\u00a0 bring the audience along with us LIVE. Our audience travels with us all over the Midwest and investigate well known (and not so well known) areas of paranormal activity, report on paranormal news, monsters, and anything else that go bump in the night. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy support this channel?\u003c/h3\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe want to bring production quality and top-notch content to match, with a spooky touch. Simply put, your support goes into helping us expand our capabilities and move into new video concepts. We realize we are nothing without our audience, and with your support we will faithfully and consistently turn out quality content. We have things planned for this channel that nobody else has done before in this arena, so grab your popcorn!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Real talk: Our time is precious. We are regular guys who both work 60 hours a week. In order to find a balance with our family life (important!) - the time we devote to YouTube HAS to\n pay in order to continue and grow. If it does not, unfortunately, that time will have to be \nspent earning money in another way. That is something we desperately want\n to avoid- because honestly, our vision is to make this our full-time gig.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the help of patrons like you- our output will see rapid improvements. We are investing in unique spycraft technology to make our channel unlike anything that\u0027s come before. We want you finding yourself entertained,\n challenged and also to find good debate amongst the comments section. If it\u0027s out there, Midwest Shadows will find it and get it on film.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your make this all possible. We appreciate and respect our audience. Your pledge will allow us to spend \nconsiderably more time developing the core idea for a video- giving it the time it deserves to fully realize a project, rather than rushing it out in an hour \nand a half because that is all the time available to justify. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat is in it for me?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Full access membership. As we grow the channel you will have front-row tickets to exclusive live podcasts, as well as behind the scenes content. We have a list of equipment we still need to invest in- but once that happens, look forward to LIVE audience interaction on our paranormal investigations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Full access membership is where it\u0027s at with Midwest Shadows. When you pledge, you\u0027ll have access to Patreon-only content, including a video blog where Tom and Joel discuss future plans and goals with the audience, and you get to be involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s simple: Pledge $6 (or more) to get full access. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But wait: Pledge $8 (or more) per video and you get the right to ask us \nwhatever they like, and have your questions answered at the tail end of our upcoming videos. If you enjoy our output and have questions to ask regarding anything covered in a video, this is a very useful \nthing. It is also not a one-off, you can ask to clarify a detail or give our thoughts as often as you wish (within reason, c\u0027mon!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything above $8 is truly appreciated.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e We do offer higher tiers, and depending on your level of support we\u0027ll be sending you goodies in the mail as a thank you.
