I\u0027m Tempest. I\u0027m the author of \u003cstrong\u003eMazeWorld\u003c/strong\u003e, a different kind of tabletop RPG, which I have been working on and running as the sole GM since February 2011. I am a French-born RPG enthusiast in all of its forms, whether tabletop or computer games, and a bit of a nerd in a lot of respects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMazeWorld\u003c/strong\u003e is a different kind of tabletop RPG because it has been entirely written and designed from scratch. It does not use any existing system, and it is primarily focused as a singleplayer (as in, one GM and one player) experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am working on writing quests and stories to add to the game as part of the core experience. Future plans include additional mechanics to support multiple player parties, the creation of a definitive core rulebook, and the creation of a new website, to be used as the official and definitive resource database for the game. It would be used, for example, as a platform to host the core rulebook, but also additional content such as extra modules, new questlines, and why not fan-created content!\u003cbr\u003eAlso under consideration are physical goodies, such as physical copies of the core rulebook, or other merchandise such as T-shirts, artwork, and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main objective is to be able to call the game \u003cem\u003e\"finished\"\u003c/em\u003e; not in the sense that I want to stop working on \u003cstrong\u003eMzW\u003c/strong\u003e one day, but in the sense that the game\u0027s core (mechanics, quests, stories) reaches a finished, presentable state, for two major purposes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1)\u003c/strong\u003e The game must be finished so that it can then be used as a base for future projects, such as the aforementioned core rulebook and database. \u003cstrong\u003eMzW\u003c/strong\u003e is more than just a game - it is an entire system, and an universe of its own, on which I want to continue building.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) \u003c/strong\u003eThe game must be finished, so that I can stop being the only Game Master. \u003cstrong\u003eMzW\u003c/strong\u003e shouldn\u0027t be leashed to my presence and free time; I want it played and run by other people! It would also allow me to free up time; it is difficult to manage real life, authoring and designing, community managing AND game mastering all at once, after all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I first began working on, and running this game in 2011, initially as an experiment intended for a tiny community of friends and curious visitors on IRC, I have since grown and become more experienced in many aspects; through \u003cstrong\u003eMazeWorld\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u0027ve learned to become a better writer, game mechanics designer, roleplayer, and community manager, among countless other things. Through working on this game, I\u0027ve also found and gathered a small but wonderful, ever-supportive community of people; players, supporters and curious spectators alike, many of which I am lucky to call my friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout the support of these friends, some of which have been there since day one, I wouldn\u0027t be able to launch this Patreon page. I want to give my players the ability to support me on more than a one-time or occasional way, and in turn I want to continue thanking and rewarding these players and supporters, without which I wouldn\u0027t have been able to continue working on this game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with most creative ventures, the creative juices must be kept running by a functional mind and body, and the only way to do so, as with most things in life, is to have the financial support to keep working on what I love. With your support, not only can I receive invaluable help in continuing to work on a life\u0027s passion, but I will also be able to plan for, and fund future ventures related to the game and perhaps reach out to a wider audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your interest, and hopefully we will see you in the Mazes soon!\u003cbr\u003e"
