    "summary": "Hi, my name is Michael Volpicelli and this is my Patron page where people interested in what I do can get involved by supporting my projects and artistic pursuits. By nature and circumstance, I\u0027m actively involved in supporting charities with their fundraising goals. You will often discover me working on a new artwork that will be usually auctioned off, all funds going to the charity. I\u0027ve been blessed and I can\u0027t ignore helping others with my gifts. It\u0027s just so natural and compelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also have visions of much larger projects that peek into the psyche of the human mind, heart, and our tribe. Themes can vary but they always involve a tremendous amount of research and time. I can absorb volumes of texts on a subject, speak to hundreds of people and transcribe thousands of quotes to make a piece of art that tells a story. That stands for something bigger than any one of us. It\u0027s what I love to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease join my team at any of the pledge levels you see here. Any dollar amount helps and brings me one step closer to more freedom to pursue these worthwhile goals and projects. The more you can pledge per month, the more perks you get, too. This isn\u0027t for everyone, so even if you can\u0027t pledge, maybe you can click Share for me instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \n\nMany thanks and blessings, Michael\u003cbr\u003e"
