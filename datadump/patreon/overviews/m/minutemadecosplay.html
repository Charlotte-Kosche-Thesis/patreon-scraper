My name is Andy and I am a cosplayer from San Antonio, TX! I have been cosplaying since 2004 and travel to conventions all across Texas. When I\u0027m not cosplaying, I\u0027m sewing, acting, singing, dancing, writing, drawing, interacting with friends, family, and fans. Cosplay has been my passion for a very long time and I feel like it\u0027s time I made the jump to bigger things such as creating more costumes and content, as well as traveling to out-of-state conventions to see more of you!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-dft4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22141334_10207737474274185_2218985193518518439_n.jpg?oh=0a4379c4158d4b671dd96c2eb305d070\u0026amp;oe=5A7E0C78\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO I MAKE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCostumes and Geek-Related Fashion! I make the majority of my costumes you see on my page! My skills include seamstress, armor, and props. I\u2019m always trying to improve my skills, learn new techniques and search new materials for costumes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-dft4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22050316_10207737474194183_7303356184523690928_n.jpg?oh=cd689726387258256d8d069477154ece\u0026amp;oe=5A85F894\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile cosplaying on my own is fun and rewarding in itself, I want to branch out and not only make bigger costumes for myself but also making amazing costumes for other people. I want people to feel great when they wear my costumes, and be wowed by what I can put together and ultimately wow myself. I want to work harder and bigger and make things so breathtaking, it can be called masterpieces.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI follow people like \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Thedesignerdaddy/\"\u003eDesigner Daddy\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JoshuaHartDesign/\"\u003eJ. Hart Designs\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PtytbArtAtelier/\"\u003ePtytb Art Atelier\u003c/a\u003e. They are a huge inspiration to what I want to create. The only thing holding me back is funds. So if I were able to raise the funding, I would work even harder to make the fantastic designs I strive for, and in return I\u0027d do anything within my power to reward my patrons to make it worth their dollar. Also with my eternal gratitude to make this happen, I could also finally open up a design studio and branch into geek-based fashion alongside costumery for conventions and even theatre. I want more than anything to design and create. And this is my chance to do so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo give an idea of what you\u0027re contributions can do:\u003cbr\u003e$1: covers a sheet of craft foam\u003cbr\u003e$5: a can of spray paint, or a tube of contact cement.\u003cbr\u003e$10: a yard of basic fabric, or a sheet of insulation foam\u003cbr\u003e$20: a yard of standard leather or vinyl\u003cbr\u003e$40: heat-resistant wig\u003cbr\u003e$50: a bolt of nerdy fabric or a cleaning for a sewing machine to keep in good working order\u003cbr\u003e$60: decent handheld steamer\u003cbr\u003e$75: airbrush with compressor\u003cbr\u003e$100: a roll of worbla\u003cbr\u003e$200-300: a new dress form or a new sewing machine\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-dft4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22090096_10207737474234184_3286130183901312060_n.jpg?oh=2fba940f3ccb4616a976b00b8da4cc55\u0026amp;oe=5A46F6FB\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eGOALS ON PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal here on Patreon is to be able to reward those of you who feel like you want to be able to support this crazy dream of mine, perhaps you enjoy chatting with me or you would like to see more of the behind the scenes of what it takes to create a costumes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a way to connect art lovers (patrons) with artists wishing to show their potential, through a sponsorship in exchange of certain rewards. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nDonations will go towards my future costume projects/plans and help me create a business to sell commissions and geek-related fashions.
