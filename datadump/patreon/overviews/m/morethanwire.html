So I\u2019m sharing my art with you, but I\u0027m also sharing my process, my inspirations,\u00a0the\u00a0new metalsmithy techniques I\u0027m learning!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

After withdrawing from school I packed up my paints and my dog; we didn\u0027t stop driving until the sun met the sea.\u00a0 Selling small drawings and jewelry kept the gas tank full and our bellies fed.\u00a0 I spent two months with a geologist learning to hunt Jade in Big Sur, California. And Quartzsite, Arizona, is where I learned to cold forge silver for making jewelry.  My experience traveling was cut short when my mom had a heart attack, and I raced home.  After that I became a board certified massage therapist and spent years helping other people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter so many years of hiding my art, I decided I couldn\u0027t tell my daughter to believe in her dreams if I never believed in mine.  So I\u0027m finally pursing a BFA.  And I\u0027ve learned so much! My art is evolving rapidly--it\u0027s such an exciting time!  I\u0027ve always had a knack for art, but I\u0027m nowhere near as good as I\u0027m going to be. And, through patreon, you can to be part of the journey with me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
