This is my Patreon. I hope you like it here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e Well... I\u0027m not a \u003cem\u003ecreator\u003c/em\u003e of video games, nor am I a great artist of any kind, I can tell you that. I don\u0027t build worlds with real or imagined materials, nor do I manage things with any sort of a mind for business. I\u0027m not a professional anything. I\u0027m a girl who grew up playing video games in the 90s and has a very specific system of beliefs regarding the generally alienating nature of a lot of the gaming communities of today. My decision to start live streaming, to crawl out from under my rock and interact with the world via YouTube, was brought on - and is now continually fueled - by those beliefs. I also love to talk about the things I love with anyone who\u0027ll talk back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess you could say, if I\u0027m anything, I\u0027m a personality. An often rambling, sometimes vulgar personality, but a personality nonetheless.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e I play games. I talk about games. I try to encourage other people to talk about games and, when I\u0027m able to do this, I listen to them. I do my best to open and maintain dialogues. I work hard never to sever the link between the ever changing 21st century gaming world and my 1990s inner cheerleader, who loves to love things, who thought the Nintendo 64 truly was the pinnacle of perfection, who rarely cared what she was playing as long as she was having fun and playing with her friends. I do everything I can to stay positive in the face of flame wars. I support my fellow wide-eyed, oh-my-god-this-is-awesome players. I cling tightly to the concept of \u003cem\u003efun\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I do this?\u003c/strong\u003e I stream my gameplay, host live discussions and post Let\u0027s Plays. My preferred genre is horror, so you\u0027ll see a lot of that on my YouTube channel, but I grew up on RPGs and have recently been sneaking away to play some shooters (I absolutely suck at shooters, but that\u0027s neither here nor there). My live discussions are often focused on a particular genre or aspect of one or more games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdmittedly, I do feel strange asking for funding for something essentially everyone in the world can do these days. As I said, I don\u0027t make games. I\u0027m not especially beautiful, nor am I one of the top ranked players of any of the games I regularly play. I\u0027m not a professional streamer, either. But I\u0027d love the opportunity to try to be. And, most importantly, I\u0027d like to be able to afford the time and the freedom to build an ever growing community of current and past gen players who talk about games rather than scream about them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to help the gaming world enjoy games again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to pledge to my Patreon, that\u0027s what you\u0027ll be supporting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell... that and my Dead by Daylight addiction. #Survivor4Life\u003cbr\u003e"
