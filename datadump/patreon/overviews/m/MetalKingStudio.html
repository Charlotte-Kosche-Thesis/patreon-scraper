    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGreetings Friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Sean Sutter. I am the creator of Relicblade: Adventure Battle Game. I do all of the game design, illustration, sculpture, terrain-building, and so much more for this enterprise! It\u0027s an audacious undertaking that I take great pride in. I have always been a huge fan of tabletop miniature games, and it is my absolute pleasure to create one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started working on Relicblade full time in June of 2015. Since then I have run two successful Kickstarter campaigns to fund the core game and a few expansions. The greatest challenge of making Relicblade by myself is also what makes it an interesting candidate for patronage. Until now I have poured enormous solitary effort into Kickstarter. With Patreon I hope to bring you into Metal King Studio to share in the joy of creating a miniature world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon I will be able to share my process as I design new characters, create dynamic illustrations, and sculpt new miniatures. I harbor dreams of creating a community that is as enthusiastic about creating Relicblade as I am. Together we can create a sustainable, vibrant, and profoundly unique tabletop fantasy skirmish game!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour friend,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSean Sutter\u003cbr\u003eLord Commander\u003cbr\u003eMetal King Studio"
