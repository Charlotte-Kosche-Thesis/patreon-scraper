    "summary": "Hey guys thanks for visiting my Patreon account! I\u0027m going to briefly give a bio about myself but i\u0027m not going to give too much away! My name is Mason Ledbetter (known as Masonvpt online) I\u0027m a 25 year old YouTube/Instagram Drummer. I\u0027ve been posting drum videos for around 8 years on youtube and social media.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/masonvpt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/masonvpt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/masonvpt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI started playing when I was a little kid, although I don\u0027t remember learning how to play, my parents say I was around 3 or 4 years old.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve wanted to create success being a drummer somehow and just the fact that you\u0027re here reading this means that my goals can be reached and I\u0027m still on my way!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve done all kinds of things musically, I don\u0027t want to give too much away but I\u0027ve been in various original and cover bands since I was in Jr. High School, and I still am!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been recorded on a studio album along with a few amateur albums and songs. I\u0027ve collaborated with many musicians and recorded drum tracks for many as well! I\u0027ve met a lot of awesome people along the way and you are the next I plan to meet if I haven\u0027t already!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn top of all that I also work a full time rotating shift job of 50-60 plus hours!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut It all comes down to this...\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy life has always revolved around music and drums, thanks to the Internet and social media I\u0027ve been blessed with all kinds of ways to make my dreams happen, and this Patreon page is a HUGE way to make that happen and I\u0027m thankful that this opportunity even exists!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/maZsmBxnKsQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSO WHY EXACTLY DID I DECIDE TO MAKE THIS PATREON ACCOUNT??\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately being a drum cover creator on YouTube has a big down side. YouTube sets big stipulations on copyrighted music, so we cannot monetize our covers to make money on YouTube or any other outlet for that matter. I get asked this question a lot and the answer is no, I do not make money from YouTube or any other outlet at all. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so thankful that Patreon exists!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlso as I mentioned earlier, I work a 7 day rotating shift full time job at a glass factory in my hometown of Decatur, Illinois. My schedule goes like this...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n7 days straight 8 hour shifts.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n7 days of first shift 8am to 4pm then 48 hours off\n\u003cbr\u003e\nthen 7 days straight of second shift 4pm to 12am then 48 hours off\n\u003cbr\u003e\nthen 7 days straight of third shift 12am to 8am then 4 days off and repeat!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been on this schedule for 5 years so far!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBasically I\u0027m sure you\u0027re aware how hard it is for a musician these days, but i\u0027ve been trying to make ends meet with this job but unfortunately I barely have time to create content for my followers and fans considering I have to sleep and take care of my house and other life issues..\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll I\u0027m really doing here is trying to create other income so that I don\u0027t have to live paycheck to paycheck barely even making ends meet and hopefully get out of this crazy swing shift job to free up my time so that I can really give my followers what they deserve and just have some success doing what I really love to do in life. But in the meantime I\u0027ve been using every ounce of time I can muster up to create any kind of content for you! Anyway enough about all that, let\u0027s find out how this works!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTHIS IS HOW MY PATREON WORKS!!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m so excited about this! This is such an amazing opportunity! I\u0027ve been thinking of better ways for my followers to get the best content and at the same time they can be a Sponsor themselves!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThink of this like my own private Inner Circle of my favorite fans and followers. And just with One Dollar per video I put out a month (which could be anywhere from 2-4 videos, you can also adjust a max limit when you subscribe) You can get access to my private Patreon feed and even my private Facebook account for Patrons! You will see exclusive content like..\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDaily Vlogs, Live Streams, Pictures that are not posted anywhere else, drums only videos, tutorials, my thoughts throughout the day and so much more, you will even have access to merch that no one else has access to!\u00a0 You can find out exactly what kind of Sponsor packages you can choose from in the Rewards section on the right hand side, you can also see the pricing options, starting out with only 1 Dollar. Anything helps and everything is much appreciated. I\u0027m truly grateful for all of you! You are all going to learn so much about me!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWELCOME TO MY INNER CIRCLE!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cz1LcgI0Cpc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for stopping by and I hope you choose to see what I have to offer here!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI decided to put a Frequently Asked Questions section below, just in case you had any questions that I didn\u0027t cover above! Thanks again for supporting me on any outlet, even if you choose not to be a part of this, I\u0027m still truly grateful for you! If you\u0027d rather make a one time donation instead then you can easily do so using PayPal!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.paypal.me/masonvpt\"\u003ePayPal Link\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003eFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1. Can I decide to unsubscribe or stop support?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYess! Very easily! If you do ever decide that, that\u0027s totally fine and I appreciate the support that you have given!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. How many videos will we be paying for a month?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0can\u0027t guarantee a number because of my crazy schedule but I know it will be somewhere around 2-4 videos. But you can set a max limit for your budget when you sign up!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n3. Does Patreon accept PayPal?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes\u00a0this is the easiest and safest way!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. Does it have to be U.S Dollars?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo! Patreon will convert any currency! This is a U.S based site so everything on here is written in USD but that does not matter, you can pay in any currency!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks again so much for any and all contributions made!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e~Mason Ledbetter\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
