My name is Mike and I make \u003cstrong\u003eOld School On The Go\u003c/strong\u003e, a web video series focusing on portable games of yesteryear! I cover Game Boy classics, obscure Game Gear games and everything in between to shed some light on the portable world of gaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u0027S THE STORY HERE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eI wanted to create the kind of show I thought was missing for a long time; something that\u00a0focused on the portable games I loved from my childhood with a critical focus on design. Soon this little experiment became a labor of love and OSOTG is now a fixture in my life! The fact that people actually watch my videos now is incredible to me. My channel might be small but I have awesome viewers who encourage and inspire me to no end.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO WHAT\u0027S THIS PATREON FOR?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m gonna level with you here: I \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e making OSOTG. But for me and many others who spend their time making free content on the Internet, it\u0027s no picnic. Like most folks, I have to work a normal job to keep myself fed and keep my rent paid. This means less time for me and less episodes of OSOTG for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the more help I have, the easier it will be for me to put out more episodes every month.\u00a0Your pledge will help me keep OSOTG on a steady schedule and ensure that you see the best content I have to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t think that you \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e to pledge, though.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m thankful enough to have anyone watching my show at all. Pledging is just an extra way for you to show your support and get some fun bonuses while you\u0027re at it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT COUNTS AS A FULL EPISODE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFull episodes of OSOTG are usually long-form reviews or top 5/top 10 videos. I will only collect pledges for full episodes since they take the most time and effort to produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes I make shorter episodes called \u003cstrong\u003eOSOTG Quickies \u003c/strong\u003ethat are usually just 2-4 minutes long; I also post songs and video game music covers from time to time. I consider this stuff bonus content so you won\u0027t be charged for it if you pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD KNOW BEFORE I PLEDGE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe higher-tier rewards ($15 and up) are only fulfilled \u003cem\u003eafter\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ve collected the payment for your pledge. So if you pledge in the middle of a month, you\u0027re going to get the rewards for that tier at the around the beginning of the following month since that\u0027s when Patreon processes your payment.\u003cbr\u003e"
