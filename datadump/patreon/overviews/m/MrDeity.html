    "summary": "For the last eight years, I\u0027ve been creating episodes of \"The Mr. Deity Show,\" which is a satirical look at God and Religion. The show is my attempt at using humor to concretize the abstract concepts and ideas which people of faith say they believe in, but may not have given much thought.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0People thank God when their sports team wins the big game \u2014 as though God specifically took time out of his day to assure that victory. Meanwhile, thousands are starving all over the world, and God clearly can\u0027t be bothered. They\u0027ll say that they look forward to Heaven, but don\u0027t realize that such a place cannot exist without everyone there losing the free will they\u0027ve come to treasure in this life. Or, they\u0027ll say that \"everything happens for a reason,\" without noticing that such a declaration makes\u00a0the horrific, genocidal murder of millions (among other atrocities) all part of God\u0027s plan.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0For those of us who believe that the scientific worldview and the values of liberal, secular, pluralistic democracy have lead to an unprecedented period of societal, educational, economic, and moral progress, people who still embrace the thinking of the bronze, Roman, and early Dark ages present a serious problem. And while there are many ways to combat the intransigence of religious devotion and magical thinking, my contribution to that struggle has been a humorous one.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0I believe deeply in the power of humor, and it\u0027s ability to make people think \u2014 particularly about things like faith and religion, where people are so heavily invested. Having been deeply religious myself, and having left a religion that was, at the time, my entire world, I understand how hard it is to get people to reconsider something in which they\u0027ve invested their entire lives and sense of meaning. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0To me, nothing provides a better port of entry to new ideas than humor. When you can make someone laugh and think at the same time, you open a door that might otherwise have forever remained closed. Humor can make people think about things when a more direct confrontation would cause them to shut down entirely \u2014 it\u0027s difficult to marshall your defenses when your laughing your ass off.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0So, I would like to find patrons who can help me continue making episodes of The Mr. Deity Show, as well as my other series, The Way of the Mister, which does the same thing, but a little more directly and without the fictionalized characters and heavenly setting. I would also like to finally produce the series I\u0027ve been writing (and speaking about) for years called, \"The God Distraction: I don\u0027t care if God exists, and neither should you.\" This is a new approach to Atheism that doesn\u0027t get bogged down by the fruitless, distracting, and ultimately unanswerable question of God\u0027s existence. Rather, this new approach (which I call \"Practical Atheism\") asks, \"if God does exists, what can we reliably know about such a Being \u2014 His will and character, in particular?\"\u00a0This forces believers to focus on what we can actually, practically, and reliably know about God, which, by the way, is absolutely nothing.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0If you can become a patron and help me continue to produce these videos, I can guarantee you a better world, filled with laughter, contemplation, and the occasional pun. And if you\u0027ve read all the way to here, I can say only, thank you, thank you,\u00a0thank you,\u00a0thank you,\u00a0thank you,\u00a0thank you, thank you!!!"
