We aren\u0027t trying to go on tour anytime soon; we just want to make recordings and make them available. We meet on our own time, and find ways to sustain our incomes outside of Gestalt. With or without money, we will never stop making music. Your contribution helps us create more, and cover the very expensive costs of recording, producing, and creating contemporary yet accessible art for all.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon is a place to support artists. Patrons choose their monthly contribution (which can be cancelled/changed at any time with no fees), and in doing so form a community of supporters. It also gives artists a way to have a conversation with their patrons, and listen to what supporters are saying; not to mention the exclusive rewards for patrons :).\u00a0 And, it really makes a huge difference; 95% of every dollar goes to the artist!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat is Music by Gestalt about?\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe believe that amazing contemporary art can be enjoyed by everyone, but so many people just don\u0027t know where to begin. Our music is aiming to create a way to hear contemporary elements: minimalism, asymmetric rhythmic cyclicality, math rock and graphic scores and improvising... all of which is accessible for musicians and non-musicians alike (we sound like a rock band!). Especially in working with film, dance, and collaborative projects, we want to become a niche-identity known for\u00a0working with artists of other fields to create powerful and accessible art for all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWait! What do I get?\u003c/h3\u003eOur patrons become the first audience for all of our work. They get their name on our albums, and can receive early/exclusive access to streamed/recorded concerts, videos going over what we are working on, PDF\u0027s of our sheet music, and whatever else we can think up! It\u0027s really about getting our art to the people who want to hear it."
