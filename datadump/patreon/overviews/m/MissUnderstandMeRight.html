I\u0027m still gonna have my blog, don\u0027t worry, but with this I could be able to do even better recordings for you.\u003cbr\u003eIf I get enough patrons I\u0027ll be able to actually get a proper recording set-up, and not just have to use my phone. I\u0027ll also be able to maybe get a little bit better editing program so I can do all the things I want with the recordings. Plus this would enable me to be able to record without having to worry about anything else, since I will have school and other such things that might create small obstacles, but I still want to be able to give you something to look forward to so any amount I get through here will help keep me on that track. And I have plans for how I want this to expand and be a bit more than just some random recordings and go more into longer story arcs, things that will evolve over time, so this would help a lot with that!\u003cbr\u003eSo here you would also get some special, Patreon only recordings and texts, some with the longer story arcs, and some nice perks for the different rewards if you\u0027d chose to pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut like I said, don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll still upload to my blog, and I\u0027ll continue to be active there, so if you can\u0027t pledge, that is completely fine!\u003cbr\u003e"
