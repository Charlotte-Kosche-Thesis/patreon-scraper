    "summary": "-MY PROGRAMMER SIDE-\u003cbr\u003eI love making stuff. I love hosting game servers and basically watching people have fun on stuff I put together or host because I feel like i\u0027ve done something people enjoy -- that I\u0027ve made at least one person happy. and I LOVE feeling useful. Even if its litterally just opening a new chat for a topic that isn\u0027t already covered. I host right now a discord server as well as Minecraft, Starbound, etc game servers and even a few websites, including my own at mothgirlmusic.com. I take hosting stuff like this seriously as it takes up a lot of my time that i\u0027m not doing music or coursework for audio engineering classes, something that takes full time already, so maybe i can make enough people happy to where people might want to help support the community and help me be able to also make it worth the time and effort, because you guys are awesome and are totally completely worth it. and i want to keep doing it and keep up making stuff and making servers, keeping hosting a fun and interesting community to chat and game together! If you have any ideas on what else i could host or do to make it even better, please message me on telegram at @mothgirlmusic or just join our discord server at\u00a0https://discord.gg/CEWCaDB and hit me up there!\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e-MY MUSIC SIDE-\u003cbr\u003eI define myself as a musician foremost, but I also dabble in coding, linguistics, and cryptography with some success due to their applications in programmed music. My favorite genres of music are widely varied, but the one I love the most is Complextro. I love the speed, the intricacy, and, well,the complexity of it. Its music designed explicitly to please and inspire others to dance to it. I\u2019ve been working towards becoming a Complextro artist for a long time, and I think I\u2019m making progress. From a very young age, I had piano lessons, and like many children who had piano lessons, I didn\u2019t like them very much.\u003cbr\u003eI just sort of went with it, but after a time I fell in love with the act of creating music. I own my own Digital Audio Workspace now, complete with all the instruments I could need. I had quite a bit of difficulty learning music because I wasn\u2019t taught very well, but recently I\u2019ve picked up most of what the industry professionals are required to know. I favor a mixture of live instruments, and logic sequenced notes for my own music.\u003cbr\u003eI picked the name \u201cmothgirl\u201d because\u2026I like butterflies, and moths are just fluffy butterflies. Its cute, I\u2019m a girl, do the math. My music has always been more important to me than my name, however.\u003cbr\u003eThe feeling of having a group of people dancing to my music, being taken by the beat of it and moving with the sound of it, the speed of it, there\u2019s really nothing that gives me a greater adrenaline rush, or sense of success. I am and hope to work towards fitting my genre better, but I don\u2019t quite know how yet. The inspiration is everywhere, provided by all the great artists around me.\u003cbr\u003e"
