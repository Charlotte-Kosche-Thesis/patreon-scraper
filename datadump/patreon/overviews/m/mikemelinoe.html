    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHello Melinoe World, I\u0027m currently listening to birds sing and sirens ring in my Austin apartment, wondering how I can sell or expand my vision. As many may know, or none, I\u0027m an artist. Now that may seem quite narrow so let me elaborate a bit. I\u0027m from Detroit, MI but recently moved to Austin, Tx. Music is my passion, it\u0027s something that I\u0027ve always wanted to pursue and day to day it\u0027s coming to light. But since I\u0027ve been in Austin, I\u0027ve gained so many new skills, artistically, from painting, modeling and even acting. But truthfully, I\u0027m in love with painting! Painting is beyond therapeutic for me. I picked up the paint brush late December of 2016 then found my style in May of 2017. I felt if my music was unique why not translate that over into art. It took some time but I was quite determined, and now we\u0027re here.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI call my style \"Shades of Hospitality\". Why? Well many people hide behind the idea of being used or abused over the years because it may or may not physically harm us. Truthfully that\u2019s the worst pain. When you simply don\u2019t see it, feel it or hear it. Being oblivious, with the full intent to serve and conquer, can weighs us down because we won\u2019t escape the reality. The reality is that, over the years we\u2019ve endured pain via another human. Maybe we wanted to listen to comfort their needs or just give someone that extra dollar when we never possessed that value in the first place. This baggage and excess worth we carry is determined by the shades of hospitality, we create. Images or products I artistically create are caught by perception, energy and color. In time, the ideas we\u2019ve held for others hospitality leaves nothing but more weight to live with. Rather good or bad, because it\u2019s not all bad, we must move accordingly. When you decide not to shave for 30 days, you\u2019ll find more hair in those areas where hairs grow. That\u2019s exactly how my art is perceived and developed. These \u201cShades of Hospitality\u201d can make or break us, but I can only see perfection in destruction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout art I\u0027m not sure where I\u0027ll be truthfully Melinoe World. Maybe slumped under a bridge or lost in a McDonalds burning your fries and nasty burgers. Saying this to say, I appreciate your time and energy. The hard work that I put in is returning daily with loads of love and unexpected treasures, but it starts here. Right in my small apartment with long nights, early mornings, tea and meditation. My dreamy eyes will always be alive, so enjoy and WELCOME TO MY WORLD!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
