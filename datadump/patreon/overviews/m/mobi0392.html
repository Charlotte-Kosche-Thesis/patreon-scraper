    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGreetings! \u003c/strong\u003eNoah here. Some of you might know me as mobi0392, the animator and artist across some social media platforms. Welcome! I\u0027m so excited to finally share my latest project with you all. It\u0027s a comic I\u0027ve spent many years writing, and it\u0027s called Port Prism.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Port Prism is a magical adventure story about a high school student named Terrence, who after some hard emotional trauma, moves with his dad to a small coastal town called Port Prism. Now on the surface, Port Prism appears to be a plain, simple, and unexciting place until a meteorite hits and uncovers the long lost cursed tunnel system beneath it \u2014 unearthing the town\u2019s dark and menacing past. Terrence accidentally gets wrapped up in one of the town\u2019s biggest mysteries\u2026 one many people have disappeared trying to solve.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It all starts with you, the viewers, the supporters, the fans. This is a tremendous project and will take time and support. Between my animations and other creative works, I cannot do it without you guys. This Patreon is designed to help me build a following so I can release all the latest story information/concept art here with you guys while getting your support in return. The end goal is to turn Port Prism into a fully published comic book, and have it available across ebook and physical copies to purchase online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Much more to come from me, so stay tuned!\u003cbr\u003e"
