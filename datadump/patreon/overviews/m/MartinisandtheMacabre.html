And some of you actually do! And you like it enough that several of you have \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003easked us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e to create a Patreon, which is so completely amazing and flattering! We never really considered it starting out, but after a year\u0027s worth of hosting fees, website fees, and new equipment (not to mention the shear amount of hours that go into researching and editing for just a single episode), we\u0027ve decided that the time is right. Just to make it clear-we don\u0027t \u003cem\u003eexpect \u003c/em\u003eto get paid. It has been and probably always will be a labor of love. But if some of you feel compelled to throw a couple bucks our way to recoup some of the money we\u0027ve put into the show, then we will humbly accept. We thank you all in advance for any and all contributions made, but most of all-thank you for listening and sharing.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Erica \u0026amp; Billy-"
