    "summary": "Hello all you lovely beings. Thank you for visiting my page, and thank you again for sponsoring me, my artform, and allowing me to share my insights, expression, passion and activism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Macaila Eve, Pixie from (ex-band) The Goth and the Pixie. To me, music is all about connection and creating a community. I write for processing and expression, I write to release, I write for the joy of it and, sometimes, I write to educate. My inspiration ranges from love, heartbreak, connection, sexual assault, racism, minority oppression, statements on our current culture, coping mechanisms, and also some more happy simple stuff too! Gotta have some happy songs in the world too. Often they begin life as poetry and become restructured into songs. More recently I have gotten more interested in combining spoken word with my music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t been on Patreon before here\u0027s a bit about it; It\u0027s kind of like a crowdfunding website but with ongoing donations; sponsor an artist. Become a patron of the arts. These donations may be monthly or per project completed, it depends what the artist has chosen. I\u0027ve chosen monthly donations because it provides me with more stability and allows me to budget for the projects I am currently invested in. This donation will go out on the first of the month. For your contribution you will receive a reward. The rewards are detailed ---\u0026gt; to the right, if you have any cool ideas for rewards please send them my way, whether or not you sponsor me. I have decided to follow the model which \u0027Living Big in a Tiny House\u0027 follows: which is, to give the same reward no matter which contribution is given. This is because I believe that people will support with what they are able to and I want to give back for the support they are able to give - without discriminating based on what someone is able to give. I am very open to letting this community decide what works best for it- so let me know your thoughts and ideas - and I\u0027d love to be giving back to you all something fulfilling. You may stop your donation at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe contributions I receive will go towards enabling me to invest in writing, promotion, recording, making videos, and putting on awesome shows. Musician income is by nature unstable- and we all need a little stability. Surviving on piece meal work can be very stressful; as a patron, a sponsor, you are able to give me some peace of mind. A little less to worry about so I can focus on making music and poetry and continue making a fuss about the issues that are important to me- and more opportunity for me to share with you the behind-the-scenes, the just written songs, the drafts and hilarious stories and heartwarming moments. I\u0027m very grateful for platforms such as this one allowing us to connect more closely with our fans and supporters; a platform for me to share early and exclusive content, silly doodles and heart to hearts, for supporters to be involved in, to connect with me and each other, and to enjoy rewards too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is a blessing to have people who believe in me and I am incredibly grateful for the gifts my friends, and this community, give me. It makes it so much easier to believe in myself and to continue to follow this journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.eveofthepixie.com\"\u003ewww.eveofthepixie.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA bit about me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m originally from Hamilton, New Zealand, where I have been lucky to be surrounded by beautiful and talented musicians. Here I was on the committee of \u0027the Volume Collective\u0027, a group promoting local music by providing practice spaces, free recordings/videos and hosting shows- check them out on Patreon :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy New Zealand band \u0027the Goth and the Pixie\u0027 released an album and completed a mini tour around the NZ North Island in late 2017. Our sound together has been described as \u0027casting a spell to another reality\u0027 or Dark Circus. We draw on a wide range of influences like Queens of the Stone Age, Cranberries, David Bowie, Mr Bungle and enjoy the theatrical and chaotic as well as beautiful and melodic. Check out it out on Spotify, Bandcamp, Itunes, my website, probably some others (thanks Distrokid). Also, this band has just ceased to be. It is an ex-band.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver 2017 I have been travelling around Australia a lot (mostly Melbourne but also Adelaide, Brisbane, Blue Mountains, Byron Bay, Sydney and Tasmania) writing and performing solo or jamming with other artists/bands with my violin and harmonies. This has been great for growing my skills and slowly developing a network of musicians to collaborate with but it\u0027s been incredibly financially precarious! I joined Melbourne punk-folk Whisky Dram in Tasmania for Hobofopo and Benalla Wall to Wall festival and also have accompanied Pepper Jane and James Hickey on various stops of their tours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe past six years I have had some very difficult experiences. Through these stressful events, music and writing were my salvation. Supportive friends and expression were my lifeline- and still are in a big way. Life can hit hard, often unexpectedly, and I realised that during these times I need to be able to have writing and music (and gardening) in my life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently work at a kindergarten. This year I plan to record an EP and am saving to go to Canada and America in 2019 for a mini tour (and to visit my friend Ariana, the talented Aorangi, look her up!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also \u0027follow\u0027 on Patreon without having to donate- it\u0027s on the left hand side \u0026lt;--- under the part that says how much I am donated per month - and you\u0027ll see what I post publicly. Alternatively, you can donate a $1 a month and EVERYTHING I post :) Your call. Thanks for having read to here! (or skipped it and scrolled down, that\u0027s always a good tactic), catchya !\u003cbr\u003e"
