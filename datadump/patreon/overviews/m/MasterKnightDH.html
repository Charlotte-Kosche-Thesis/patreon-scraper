    "summary": "Battalion Wars is an all-time favorite for me, molding 2 genres together in a manner that provides healthy gameplay by the very design of the combination of genres. This is not getting into how Battalion Wars has good design on its own merits that belies its apparent status as a way to cash in on Advance Wars, such as creative strengths and weaknesses for units providing depth to the rock-paper-scissors system, defensive power being useful, and dodge moves involving actual opportunity costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yet I feel more could be done with this sort of thing. More that couldn\u0027t be done because Kuju Entertainment suffered from being a backwater gaming company in the UK. Of course, my interest is in making not a Battalion Wars clone, but a game that does have Battalion Wars as a clear and key inspiration. Here\u0027s what I would want to plan out on the outset that would be different from Battalion Wars:\u003cbr\u003e-Gameplay takes place from first person view of the player\u0027s directly controlled unit\u003cbr\u003e-No switching to another unit, though under given conditions, the player may choose an ally unit to start as and directly control instead of the main PC for the level\u003cbr\u003e-Medieval fantasy warfare, obviously with my own touches (don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m not going to rip off of Tolkein, not least because that\u0027s been done too often)\u003cbr\u003e-Multiple control modes for the player that they can switch between: Fighter for hand-to-hand or weapon usage; Mage for spellcasting; and Tactician for command issuing. I will of course be wanting the middling difficulty level will be playable enough without having to switch often between control modes, but the hardest will demand a good handle of all of them\u003cbr\u003e-Yes, difficulty level settings, which I have my own ideas about as well\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd those are off the top of my head. There are other things that I have come up with, such as a story, but there\u0027s the concern of both streamlining and spoiler territory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a disclaimer, this Patreon is a faith system. Do NOT feel obligated or anything to provide money. Although funds would be very nice, the reason I have the money setting to per-month instead of per-creation is because I would inevitably need proper support anyway, something that can\u0027t be given a monetary value, cheesy as that may sound. I sadly don\u0027t have an idea on any perks that wouldn\u0027t be ripe for abuse, and I\u0027d rather people personally communicate with me to begin with so that I can get some better supporting ideas in addition to the moderation I\u0027d want to be doing. Without proper support, this whole thing is unfortunately not going anywhere fast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNevertheless, given the chance, this would result in a solid and deep game. One that would be surprisingly fitting of the intended title--I won\u0027t publicly say what it would be before securing it legally, naturally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and the intro video is to showcase my talent with Battalion Wars, though it\u0027s a slow take of the level as a result of the challenge\u0027s restrictions being set in an experiment for this game.\u003cbr\u003e"
