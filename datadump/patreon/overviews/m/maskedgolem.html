My name is Aeon Devlin and I am a 20 year old Australian student currently studying my Bachelor of 3D Animation; I often work under the alias of Masked Golem. I primarily create digital illustrations but I do some animation and traditional artwork as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat equipment and programs do I use?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor digital art I use my Wacom Intuos Pro M graphics tablet and I paint in Adobe Photoshop CC. For 2D animation, I use either Animate CC or the Animator\u0027s Toolbar extension in Photoshop and make the final edits in Premiere Pro CC and After Effects CC. For 3D modelling and animation I use Autodesk Maya and Mudbox, using primarily the Renderman and Redshift renderers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I have a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI pour a lot of time into my artwork; my digital paintings can take upwards of 20 hours and span over the course of days or weeks! Animation takes even longer; for polished work with complex movement it can take months to plan everything and get the movement looking appealing. Unfortunately it is getting harder to produce polished paintings and even harder to work on animation with little income coming from my art; I often have to put aside my art and scrap ambitious projects so I can take care of basic living costs.\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I can spend more time focusing on creating more content as well as improving the overall quality and polish of the work. I\u0027ll be able to invest in better equipment and dedicate more of my time to work on larger projects between university and other commitments; after all it is my dream to make a living creating the things I love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get as a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you decide to support my $2 all-access tier, you will have access to any bonus content for any of the pieces I create! That includes works in progress, early access to timelapse videos and animations, variants of paintings, working files (\u003cem\u003ewhere applicable, I often combine my paintings into one layer for the character and one for the background\u003c/em\u003e), early and scrapped concepts as well as a 15% discount on any commission if you choose to commission me when I have them on offer! I plan to extend this list with more perks as I receive more support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*Patrons are charged at the beginning of each month*\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zaWJnyH.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for visiting and I hope you decide to support my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeed to contact me?
