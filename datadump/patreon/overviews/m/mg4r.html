Ever since I was a young kid I had always wanted to become an entertainer and entertain people (I also enjoyed playing video games...a lot) and with my discovery of Youtube and Twitch I was one step closer to achieving my dream of being an entertainer. The reason I decided to use patreon was to allow you guys a chance to help me while truly getting a something in return whether it\u0027s just one of the rewards [which will get better over time I promise] or help me get to a goal that you want to see. All in all I thank you all for helping me and supporting me either through patreon or just being there for me as a viewer. Thank you.\u00a0"
