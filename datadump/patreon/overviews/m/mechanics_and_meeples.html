    "summary": "I\u0027ve been writing articles about board games since 2005 at a variety of web sites, including Gone Gaming, BoardGameNews, and BoardGameInfo. At the start of 2012, I collected together many of my articles on a single site of my own:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mechanics-and-meeples.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emechanics-and-meeples.com\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m still working on gathering some of my older articles, but to date I\u0027ve got over 150 articles compiled, tagged, and indexed at my personal board gaming blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat are your Board Game Articles about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eI mostly cover the field of eurogames that originated with popular offerings like \u003cem\u003eTicket to Ride\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Settlers of Catan\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eCarcassonne\u003c/em\u003e. In recent years I\u0027ve focused a lot on deckbuilding games and cooperative games, but I examine much of the field \u2014 and sometimes go farther afield into popular American hobbyist games like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mechanics-and-meeples.com/tag/empire-builder/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eEmpire Builder\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eMost of my articles discuss game design in one way or another, giving an insightful look (I hope!) at what makes games tick. I also frequently talk about new releases. However, I\u0027ve also examined the portfolios of designers, talked with them in interviews, ranted about what I don\u0027t like in games, and even published a few strategy articles. I generally write about whatever strikes me in the field of board (and card) games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to keep my articles in the range of 750-2,000 words, but sometimes they get away from me and end up being larger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my most popular articles ever including:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mechanics-and-meeples.com/2006/02/02/six-degrees-of-collaboration/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Six Degrees of Bruno Faidutti\"\u003c/a\u003e, which is about collaboration in game design;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mechanics-and-meeples.com/2013/04/29/co-op-interviews-matt-leacock-pandemic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Co-Op Interviews: Matt Leacock\"\u003c/a\u003e, which is about \u003cem\u003ePandemic \u003c/em\u003eand the \u003cem\u003eForbidden Co-Op\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0games; and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mechanics-and-meeples.com/2012/09/10/dissecting-dominion-part-one-the-original-game/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Dissecting Dominion\"\u003c/a\u003e, which is one of my deck building articles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eHow Often Do You Publish?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eGenerally, I try to publish every other week. If I get enough support, I\u0027ll increase that to once a week \u2014 which I plan as my current limit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI encourage you to make use of the monthly cap feature, so that you can choose to limit your total patronage as I go from biweekly to weekly (or even higher?).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo You Write Other Board Game Stuff?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI may at some point decide to publish short news or other info through Mechanics \u0026amp; Meeples. I do also publish occasional board game reviews at RPGnet. I\u0027ll let you know about all of these articles through the activity feed, but none of them will count as official content for Patreon (which will consist of only my board game \u003cem\u003earticles\u003c/em\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhy Should I Support You?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eI hope that you\u0027ll support me if you enjoy the board game articles that I write. More patrons will give me more encouragement (and resources) for writing. I\u0027ll increase the number of articles that I\u0027m writing, and I\u0027ll also be more willing to write more difficult articles that take more time. Finally, I\u0027ll be able to make purchases that will help me write articles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I\u0027m really successful, I hope to eventually convert my articles to books. Though the PDFs won\u0027t be a part of the normal Mechanics \u0026amp; Meeples content, if you\u0027re an Omnivore or Sponsor, I\u0027ll send you a copy \u003cem\u003egratis\u003c/em\u003e. Even if you\u0027re contributing at a lower level, you\u0027ll know that you\u0027re helping to increase the amount of scholarly board game discussion there is in the world."
