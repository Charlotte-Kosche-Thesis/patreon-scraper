I have a similar bass that I use as a backup but it doesn\u0027t play as well and sound as good as the white one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t play the white fretless at all now because the circuit board has gone bad. It\u0027s such a specialized bass that I can\u0027t just replace it with anything. It requires a specific Kubicki board which will run me $200, and at least $50 to have it installed and have the entire bass set-up and recalibrated . I\u0027ve been trying to push forward without my beloved fretless, but it\u0027s been difficult because that\u0027s the instrument I do the majority of my songwriting on. Can you help? What\u0027s it worth to you? How can I return the favor? Album credits? Guest list? I welcome your ideas.",
