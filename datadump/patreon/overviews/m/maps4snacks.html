    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi there, fellow gamers!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Welcome to my Patreon page. I am a passionate DM who loves drawing battle maps to take the tabletop RPG\nexperience to the next level for my players. They can be useful for any of you who want\nto quickly grab a map to use in your game, or simply get inspiration and ideas for running your own adventures. Just have a look at what\u0027s on offer and see if there\u0027s anything to your liking!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s this all about?\u003c/strong\u003e All my maps\nare drawn digitally and are made specifically\nfor my own homebrew campaign. Offering them for free on Patreon is simply a way for me to share with the community and allow others to enjoy the maps as well. Any pledges are of course welcome, and these will go toward cover snacks, drinks, new books, miniatures or anything else that will\nenhance the game I run with my group. In addition, it will allow me\nto support others here on Patreon who are doing some great work on building\nquality RPG related content, and back Kickstarter campaigns that add to an ever-growing community of tabletop RPG players around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor free you say?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Yes, I\u0027ve decided to post all my maps for free, available to download for patrons as well as the public, and my reward tier \u0027Pay What You Want\u0027 is intended for those who wish to support my work by pledging $1 or more for every map that I release.\u00a0My goal is to release about 1 to 2 maps per month, depending on how my campaign is evolving. Please know that you\nwill never pay anything if I do not post a new map, and you can set a monthly\nmax for what you are willing to spare each month for the maps that I post, or of course enjoy them for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/strong\u003e Each map that I post will come in a high-resolution JPG format and will feature a version with and without a grid. I will leave the labeling up to you, as each DM will probably have their own ideas on how to use them. All maps are 3840x2160 pixels or larger, perfectly suitable for online play or displaying on a monitor. I will also make a slightly cropped version with black borders that fits exactly on a A1 sized sheet of paper. In addition,\u00a0I will include the original PSD files with all the various layers that make up the map, for improved customization.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e for considering supporting me and I hope you\u0027ll become a patron! If not, that\u0027s totally fine too, and as long as my maps find their way onto many gamers\u0027 tables to enjoy a nice session of whichever RPG you play, that\u0027s good enough for me.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
