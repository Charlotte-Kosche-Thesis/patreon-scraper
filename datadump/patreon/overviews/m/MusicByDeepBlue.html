Over the years, I\u0027ve learned to play several instruments in my quest to better speak that musical language: trumpet, piano, guitar, bass guitar, piano and a drum here or there. \u00a0After twenty-five years of playing and studying, I\u0027m still learning to speak that language.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Need \u00a0Your Support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s face it: Being a musician -- if you want to be good at it -- isn\u0027t often a lucrative career choice. \u00a0The moniker \"starving musician\" is pretty accurate for a lot of us, and would be for more, if it weren\u0027t for supportive friends and family. \u00a0Your support will enable me to continue to make music and purchase new software and equipment in the process. \u00a0It will also help me do other cool stuff, like take my wife to dinner and buy her something nice to say \u0027thank you\u0027 for her tireless love and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t feel like becoming a patron of my music, then that\u0027s fine; you\u0027re under no obligation to do so. \u00a0Feel free to enjoy my music as much as you like. \u00a0I ask only that you share my music and patreon.com information with your friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, and God Bless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003edB"
