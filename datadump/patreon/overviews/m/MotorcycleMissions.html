I\u0027m a surgical nurse and a motorcycle customizer with my own powder coating business. I found my true calling in life when I combined my vocations, realizing that my nursing instincts could help veterans who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder discover community and purpose in riding and building motorcycles.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI founded Motorcycle Missions in 2015 to bring the therapeutic benefits of participation in the motorcycling community to the people who put their lives on the line for the rest of us--first responders and military veterans. Research on PTSD indicates that camaraderie, shared mission and the intense release of adrenaline all help to mitigate symptoms. We teach trauma-scarred veterans how to build show quality motorcycles, welding technology, and motocross riding --all at no cost to them. We build a brotherhood, a purpose, and a mission around building and riding motorcycles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin our mission! Your monthly patronage--even just a couple dollars a month--will help us bring these life-saving projects to more veterans and first responders! And if you donate $10/month, you earn chances to win one of our amazing veteran-built bikes."
