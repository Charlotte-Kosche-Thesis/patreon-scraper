    "summary": "Hello friends - My name is Mike Peralta, and I\u0027m an independent musician in Southern California. I\u0027ve been in love with making music since I was a kid; it\u0027s all I ever think about sometimes. When I was a young boy,\u00a0while hanging out with my grandfather\u00a0one day, he handed me a guitar and taught me to sing and play an old country song called \"The Barefoot Boy With Shoes On\" (which was hilarious because my grandfather is Italian). We spent a great deal of time bonding with music over the years and making great memories together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYears later, one of my high school crushes passed away over the summer. She was a beautiful girl who was kind and warm to everyone she knew - even nerds like me. Everyone I knew attended her funeral. I was emotionally and physically numb all day, and when I finally made it back home, I was so desperate for a release of the pain I was feeling, I instinctively picked up my mother\u0027s dusty old 3/4th sized guitar with a broken truss rod and a cracked head-stock. I randomly played chords and hummed melodies to myself for awhile. Eventually, somehow, it turned into my very first song: \"Brandy\u0027s Song\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePouring my heart into music didn\u0027t fully take away the sadness, but made it somehow more bearable. Throughout the years, I continued to use music as my therapy: as a way to reflect and forgive; as a way to tribute lost love and friends gone, then let them go. Now I share my music with everyone I can, because I know music heals. Music can touch your soul. Music is universal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight about now, you\u0027re probably wondering what this has to do with Patreon (the website we\u0027re on right now). Well, in short - I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I had it my way, I\u0027d produce music full-time. I\u0027d have a brand new video out for you every few days. I\u0027d have a new original track out at least once a month. I\u0027d post more photos, more blogs, and more vlogs (video blogs). I\u0027d spend more time interacting with my fans, my friends, touch more lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut life gets in the way! Editing videos takes up a ton of time. Maintaining a \"day job\" takes up even more. Recording in a real studio isn\u0027t often in my budget, nor are a million other things that go into producing and marketing music. If my finances were better, it would be easier to put out more content for others to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s get down to it: What do I need you to do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know most people reading this are here because you enjoy the art I\u0027m sharing with you. For that, I\u0027m eternally grateful. But unfortunately, the real world won\u0027t let me pay for things in warm sentiment (lol). If you can find it in your heart, please become an official supporter of my music and my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis website (Patreon) is a very safe, secure, and easy way to lend financial support to artists and content creators like me. Up at the top of this page, you\u0027ll see a big button that reads something like \"Become a Patron\". Click it, and you can help support my art with as much or as little as you can afford.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeriously, you can support me with as little as $1 a frikkin month, and I\u0027m not kidding when I say it\u0027ll make a difference, and I\u0027ll be eternally grateful. You can change your monthly pledge at any time. You can even quit at any time with no obligation. You retain total control over how much you give, and for how long.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that signing up for a new website to send money to an artist might seem a little \"heavy\" or even unusual. But think about it... We all already waste so much money every day, buying things like Double Lattes at Starbucks, 12-packs of beer or sodas, going out at night, or even just buying fast food. One night out on the town might cost $50 if you\u0027re frugal, but I would seriously love you forever for pledging even half that in an entire month. Think about it a bit ... we know indie artists struggle and need our help. If you love the art I make for you, think it over. At least sign up for $1 a month and be able to say you\u0027re a rare supporter of the indie music scene. Besides the amazing feeling of giving and support, it\u0027s something kinda cool you can brag about, too! (\"Hey bros and broas, I totally support indie music!!\")\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really appreciate any and all help. Each one of you who helps makes a difference. It really does add up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this far, and I appreciate your help. I really couldn\u0027t do this without you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Mike"
