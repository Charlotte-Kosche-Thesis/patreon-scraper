    "summary": "Hi there! My name is Maggs, and I work with fire and molten glass until the wee hours of the night, and in my spare time I mess around with paints, stencils, and art journaling. I\u0027ve been making art full-time for eleven years and I love every moment of it. For me, being in the studio is like meditation. When I sit down behind the torch, everything else just fades away, until the only thing that matters is the flame, the glass, and myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, as soon as I turn off the torch, the rest of life resumes. For the past year and a half, life has been happening with a vengeance. It started with elbow surgery, followed by a torn rotator cuff and more surgery, and after I finished that and finally got back into the studio after months of physical therapy, just as I was starting to hit my stride, I managed to sever the extensor tendon on my right thumb. Another surgery, and now I get to wear a fun immobilizing cast for a month, followed by more therapy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://maggscreations.com/patreon/stitches.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is me in the ER, right after receiving temporary stitches to \u0027hold everything together\u0027 until the surgeon can schedule an appointment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://maggscreations.com/patreon/splint.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the fun thumb-immobilizing gauntlet that I get to wear for the next month or so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://maggscreations.com/patreon/oh_noes.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is Pillbug the kitten, because he\u0027s adorable, and is pretty much the only one who is happy with the fact that I spent a lot of time in the recliner for the days after the accident and the surgery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003eBut all is not lost! Although for now, I can\u0027t work with molten glass with only one hand, I CAN still draw and write. And so, I\u0027m setting up this patreon page, in the hopes that a few of my friends and supporters will reach out to (excuse me, I have to say it) give a helping hand. And in return, I will write you real letters, draw for you, or send you handmade stencils, and just as soon as I\u0027m healed from my latest mishap, I\u0027ll be back in the studio and making shinies!!"

     "description": "I primarily work in borosilicate glass, which is the same type of glass that is used for scientific glassware. Clear borosilicate has been around since the late 1800\u0027s, but colored borosilicate is a fairly recent thing. And the colors.... they\u0027re so very very lovely! But, as with all things pretty and shiny, there is a cost. Colored borosilicate starts at about $40 a pound, and some of the really premium colors can be $100 or more per pound. I\u0027d love to be able to add more colors to my palette, and with your help, I hope to be able to do just that!\u003cbr\u003e",
