    "summary": "Hey! Here we go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Mac, I\u0027m an independent musician who likes playing the piano terribly, playing guitar just about well enough and playing ukulele as if it\u0027s saving my life. I\u0027m told I have the voice of a fallen angel coming out of a face only a mother could love; I guess that\u0027s kind of a compliment haha! I think, in a nut shell - I\u0027m the nut. XD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn and raised on the west coast of sunny Scotland, along the river Clyde - I\u0027ve spent my whole life trying to find the right path for me, and it only took a complete nervous breakdown and a shattered heart in my 30th year on this flying rock to get me to where I am right now. I\u0027m finally on the road to something I am proud of. Making music has been a life long passion of mine and I\u0027ve never had the confidence to put myself out there into the public domain like this before - which is why I\u0027m thrilled to be alive during this amazing and exciting time! Things like Patreon make it possible for me to live my dreams on my own terms and I live for this community; it\u0027s incredible! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI put a little bit of myself, my life, my story into everything I create; all my content is 100% my own, from my own heart and soul. My sound is somewhere between Sia and 3 Doors Down. Think, if 30 seconds to Mars and Adele had a love child; that\u0027s me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have found myself on Patreon due to some really positive feedback I\u0027ve had in the last few weeks and I figured I might as well see how it goes! Through finding myself I\u0027ve found my sound and now that I feel more confident in my music I really just want to share it with the world - earning a bit of cash from you guys helps me to continue being able to sustain myself while creating more amazing content for you to enjoy. You\u0027re paying for my actual food and I\u0027m giving you soul food in return; that\u0027s the way I look at it! XD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love meeting new people so having this connection with my fan base is just amazing to me. Everything I write comes straight from my soul and the idea of sharing my 4 minute long love affairs with the world fills me with the best kind of joy; I hope you find some joy in them too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to take a moment here to thank all my family and friends for standing by all my ups and downs over the years and giving me the support I needed to help me find my happy place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecial shout out to;\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- My wee sister, Sarah and my number one fan, Shay for cheering like absolute lunatics every time I play them a new tune;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- My mum and dad for creating me and, in turn, all the creative angst that comes with me; \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- The other mother of my children for being my most supportive friend on the planet; \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- My mini me\u0027s for just being pure, walking, talking, embodiment\u0027s of awesome;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- a wee Trashkan for being the best bestie - and for driving me around for hours, and putting up with me crying loads... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand last, but by no means least;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- Meech - a special wee grain of sand in my hourglass. You\u0027ve been my muse, really. So, thank you. I love you. You\u0027re still my Pirate. I hope one day we\u0027ll laugh about all of this.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e And as for YOU, awesome patron who is reading this - Welcome along for the ride! It\u0027s gonna be a good one! Thank you for dropping by and I hope you stick around. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMac."
