    "summary": "First and foremost, thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first started this channel I had two main reasons for doing so; I wanted to raise awareness about topics that were important to me, and I wanted a creative outlet to hone my skills as an artist and animator. \u00a0Initially this channel was exclusively about atheism and my earliest videos were meant to be informative and were categorized as \u0027nonprofits and activism\u0027 however I\u0027m pivoting a little to make this channel more about entertainment. \u00a0If you\u0027ve always enjoyed the more intellectual videos and topics, don\u0027t worry they aren\u0027t going anywhere, but I do have a lot of big ideas for new types of videos I\u0027d like to start making which would include an animated series that would make fun of everything from right wing rednecks, to \u0027ghost hunter\u0027 TV shows, TV psychics, and a lot more. \u00a0I\u0027d also like to have a short story series that would feature stories and essays such as \u0027The Stolen Smell\u0027, or Carl Sagan\u0027s \u0027Dragon in my Garage\u0027. \u00a0I\u0027d also like to start making holiday specials and a lot more. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is I\u0027m a one man operation, one animated video could easily take hundreds of hours, and I live in the real world with adult responsibilities such as work and school. \u00a0That means the amount of time I am able to spend on this hobby is limited, however if this hobby were to become a viable source of income I could scale back my hours at work and spend more time making videos. \u00a0In addition, the extra money can also help me pay for newer and better equipment to make higher quality videos. \u00a0One thing that really needs some wok is my audio quality, and that will be the first item on the list of things to improve with any money I make from Patreon. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you enjoy what I do, and you\u0027d like to see me do more of it and do it better, consider making a contribution. \u00a0Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this!\u003cbr\u003e"
