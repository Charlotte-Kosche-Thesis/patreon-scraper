    "summary": "My name is Nonnie.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m new and I don\u0027t have much to say as of yet. But I can tell you a bit about myself at least.\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up it has always been difficult for me to complete things or form connections with people. I\u0027ve moved so many times nowhere feels like home (nearly once every two years). Lived with different people who couldn\u0027t stand me. I know I was difficult. I know I didn\u0027t try to make anything of myself. And to be honest even since I was a small child I didn\u0027t expect to live as long as I have. But I\u0027m still here and I know I can\u0027t just live off of the belief I\u0027ll just be gone one day and nothing I do matters. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always loved stories. They\u0027re an incredible tool that enables a person to witness worlds they could never even hope to visit. My head was always filled with ideas and whole new lands and walks of life. And for years and years I\u0027ve wanted to make my own story for others to enjoy. I\u0027ve tried. Believe me I\u0027ve tried. I\u0027ve written countless incomplete tales, started dozens of unloved comics. I desperately wanted to make something that people would love the way I\u0027ve loved other people\u0027s stories. But I kept giving up because no one seemed to care. I realize now that no one will care if I don\u0027t care either.\u003cbr\u003eRecently I\u0027ve started a comic called Ghost Eyes about a cursed and troubled teen experiencing the public world for the first time and meeting strange people like him. (It\u0027s actually an AU of another story I\u0027m working on with a friend) It\u0027s a weird story with creepy aspects but I\u0027m so proud of myself so far. I have over 100 pages done! Maybe that\u0027s not a lot compared to all the other comics artists and such but this is the biggest achievement of my entire life. I have never worked so hard on something and the more I work on it the more confident I feel in myself and my ability to produce. I\u0027m determined to keep working now that my train of thought has found its tracks and is picking up speed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI would strongly appreciate a little encouragement. I live in a 5 room house with 5 other family members and low income since my mother is single and works for a potato chip company. I have no money and can\u0027t get a job. But I know I have the ability to get myself out there at least through my art. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do with my future but I\u0027d at least like to give my mother money she needs to get out of this job. I\u0027m not asking for a lot. But small donations would go a long way. And in turn I\u0027ll pour my heart into every page and do my best to entertain everyone with my stupid stories!\u003cbr\u003e"
