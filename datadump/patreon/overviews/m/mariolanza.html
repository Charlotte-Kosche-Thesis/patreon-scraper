So if you enjoy my work, and you would like to see it continue, I sure wouldn\u0027t turn down any financial backers who would like to help out.\u00a0 Especially because with two kids about to start college, and college payments looming on the horizon, at the moment I can use all the help I can get. The bills around our house are about to get rather steep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for supporting my work.\u00a0 F Brad Culpepper!\u003cbr\u003e"
