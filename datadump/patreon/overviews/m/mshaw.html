    "summary": "Hi folks! My name is Mark Shaw from the good ol\u0027 Eastern Shore of Maryland. I\u0027ve been a musician and computer nerd for nearly my whole life. Since I first began, my favorite part has been entertaining people and sharing my knowledge and excitement for technology. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had the fortune to work in the technology industry for over 20 years in a variety of positions. Everything from research and development in parallel computing back in the 90s to modern day small business IT management. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the music side of things, I was a huge marching and concert band geek throughout all of my school years. Since 1996 I\u0027ve played in a variety of other bands from ska to hardcore. Now I work 3 days a week in my home studio on developing music for businesses, reviewing equipment, and sharing my experiences with technology. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fun begins when I get home to work on my personal projects. I truly feel that technology and music go hand in hand. They\u0027ve developed side-by-side over the years and we\u0027re discovering new ways of creating music everyday!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo my goal with creating content is to teach people that there\u0027s always a way you can make music or have fun with technology without needing a rockstar budget. Sometimes technology can be complicated and if there\u0027s one thing I\u0027ve learned over the years of working in IT, is that documentation means *everything*. And what better way to teach people than by using the power of video learning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will allow me to invest in hardware, software, new video equipment, tech gear, and of course musical instruments and equipment as well. Most importantly, I\u0027m here as a technical resource for all my Patreon supporters! I\u0027m happy to provide insight on solving your technical challenges. I receive a lot of cool questions from people needing help with Linux, Raspberry Pi projects, MIDI, and more. I\u0027d love to hear from you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
