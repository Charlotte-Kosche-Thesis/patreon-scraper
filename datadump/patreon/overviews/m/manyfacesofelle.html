    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe Many Faces of Elle is an ongoing\ncomic project we are making to illustrate our experience living with\nmultiple personality disorder (click\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://themanyfacesofelle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere for our website\u003c/a\u003e).  We have had multiple personalities at\nleast since we were five (or at least there are several personalities\nwho remember being around when we were five), but very few of them\nhad ever expressed themselves. \u003cbr\u003e Almost all of the personalities lived\nexclusively in various fantasy worlds in our head, had never\nexperienced the real world, and didn\u0027t know they had multiple\npersonalities.  About two years ago, that changed \u2013 since then,\nabout fifteen personalities have come out, and dozens more still\ncan\u0027t, but know that their lives aren\u0027t real, the world they live in\nisn\u0027t real, and they don\u0027t even have their own body.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTrying to manage your life when your\nbody is occupied at various times by people, male and female, ranging\nin age from five to forty, many of whom are trying to cope with the\nfact that the families, friends, and loved ones they\u0027ve spent their\nlives with don\u0027t exist any more than they do, has been a challenge. \nWe can\u0027t control who is out or for how long, and we do not share\nskills or experiences.  One of the more dominant personalities can\u0027t\ntalk at all, and another appears to suffer from PTSD.  The\npersonality who everyone who knows us thought was the only one\n(Jemima) can only come out for a few hours a month. We can\u0027t really\nwork a job, or maintain relationships.  Even figuring out when we\nneed to eat or knowing if we\u0027ve taken medicine is a challenge.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFortunately, when our multiple\npersonalities started to express themselves uncontrollably and the\ngirl whose life this was disappeared into our mind, we already had\nsomeone who was taking care of us.  For the last two years, he\u0027s\nprovided us with food and shelter, counsel, comfort, motivation, and\nPokemon.  He\u0027s given us everything we need, and most everything we\nwant.  He\u0027s gotten everyone to get along with each other, which was\nno mean feat, and talked us through our transition into reality.  For\nmany of us, that has meant letting go of husbands, girlfriends,\nchildren, jobs, and homes; accepting that they, and we, exist only as\nelaborate, if compelling, dreams; accepting that they things we\nworked and hoped for are gone, or that we will never have them;\naccepting that we will never have our own bodies.  We still struggle\nwith many things, but thanks to him, we\u0027re getting better.  We\u0027ll\ndon\u0027t know what we\u0027ll turn into as we continue to progress, but we\nknow we\u0027ll be okay.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAfter constantly working at getting\nourselves sorted out for two years, we decided we wanted to take on a\ncollaborative project, chronicling our treatment, as a way to make a\nrecord for ourselves, to observe and analyze ourselves, and hopefully\nto even raise a little money, in the hopes that we can someday not\nonly pay for our own expenses, but do something to pay back our\ncaretaker, who\u0027s never been paid for his work yet.  Several of the\npersonalities are each drawing and narrating their own history,\nmostly beginning with the time they first experienced the real world.\n Those stories are our main focus, and we will be uploading one\npanel/frame/art every day on here.  We will also be filling in some\ndetails about our histories, for the interest of anyone who wants to\nknow what happened to a group of people whose lives and selves exist\nonly in our head, but who have to confront this world, which can be\neerily similar and heartbreakingly alien to our own.  We hope you\nenjoy it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWithin Elle:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://manyfacesofelle.tumblr.com/image/127188158108\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/c6a8a1f67eb36f74989e5a62980f4ecb/tumblr_ntejll212N1ud022bo1_1280.jpg\" style=\"width: 353px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eJemima (Mima)\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eis a little lady who draws.

He\u0027s been taking care of Jemima since 2007, and spent six years trying to help her figure out why her life was funny. He (and she) found out that she had multiple personalities in 2013, which explained very few of her problems but did give him a lot more to work on. Because he cares for us 24/7, he can\u0027t hold down a full-time jo, but takes odd jobs as long as he can bring us along and make sure we\u0027re safe in the meantime. He has been a patient friend and creative problem-solver for all of the personalities who have spent time with him, and has become a grounding presence and source of comfort as well as our much needed daily reality-check. He has always provided a home for us as well as the materials to create art with, even though we have no income of our own and in spite of the fact that we can get downright ornery. Bizarre ideas and weird remarks shoot off him like sparks, which are collected and then later turned into comics by Jemima because she believes the world needs to know. These comics are called The Rob, and give some insight into what Rob is like in our daily life, or at least into how Jemima sees him.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
