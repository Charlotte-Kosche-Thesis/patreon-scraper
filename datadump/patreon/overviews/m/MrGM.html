As of February 2018 this has now become my main source of income. and its all Thanks to you guys :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately I am not able to be as active as I liked on Patreon itself. Which is why I have made the decision to make all of the rewards from Pledging into \"Discord Only\". On my Discord we have a special channel setup where we have a small community of Patreons and YouTube sponsors. I am constantly active in there and over the last couple months the supporters have helped me out on a ton of videos! From script writing, thumbnails and even the choice of music. You really do become a key part of the production of content on the YouTube channel. Plus other great perks which are listed on the $1 tier reward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to pledge $5 or more, consider becoming a \"YouTube Sponsor\" which includes all of the rewards for the $1 tier plus some extra things like a custom badge next to your name in my live streams and access to my custom emotes! \u003cbr\u003eRemember to link your YouTube to your Discord if you\u0027d like to gain access to the special channel.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://gaming.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT\"\u003ehttps://gaming.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT\u003c/a\u003e - Click Sponsor button\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank for you reading!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMrGM (Dan)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eIf you can dream it, you can do it.\" - Walt Disney\u003c/em\u003e"
