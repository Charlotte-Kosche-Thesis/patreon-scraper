Even before then,\nat an unknown early age, he started drawing illustrated children\u2019s books\nstarring his brother and he as stick figures on wacky adventures. Once\nintroduced to the daily funny pages in the newspaper, especially Jim Davis\u2019\nGarfield, his passion was turned to comic strips and books. He, with his\nlifelong friends often inspiring him or even co-creating with him, would\ncartoon for his and their own enjoyment and amusement, starting in elementary\nand lasting even into his college years. Although his comics never appeared in\nany school newspapers, his comic strips eventually became well known among the\nstudent bodies throughout elementary, junior high, high school, and college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 1994, at the age of 9, Will\nBoyer created MILO THE CAT and MILO COMICS. Eventually, in 1999, he brought the\nstory to a climax by turning Milo into SUPERMILO. That same year he started his\nfirst webcomic, a fan comic titled \u201cPokemon Elite.\u201d Both a Sonic the Hedgehog\nfan webcomic, \u201cSonic Crackers,\u201d and a Ghostbusters fan webcomic in 2007,\n\u201cCNCGB,\u201d would follow. In 2008, after a couple of failed attempts already, he\nwould start preparing to bring back and reboot his old Milo Comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://supermilo.webcomic.ws/files/patreon/will_boyer_at_ftcc_2008.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://supermilo.webcomic.ws/files/patreon/sm_1_my_soaps_thumbnail.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, in\nlate July and early August of 2009, during his years in the Digital Effects and\nAnimation Technology major at Forsyth Technical Community College, Will Boyer\nstarted publishing \u201cSuperMilo the Strip,\u201d a reboot of his original child hood\nMilo Comics, originally online at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://theduckwebcomics.com/the_misadventures_of_superMilo/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.DrunkDuck.com\u003c/a\u003e\n(now known as \u003ca href=\"http://www.theduckwebcomics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.TheDuckWebcomics.com\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010 Will Boyer also started\npublishing online \u201cGospelman,\u201d a Christian comic strip he created in 2004\nduring his years preparing for possible ministry at Piedmont Baptist College.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, that same year he would\nmeet the love of his life and become too busy finding full-time, non-artistic\nwork to devote much time to art, and so his comics suffer their first major\nhiatus.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat same year in 2010, he also\nstarted work illustrating a series of children\u2019s books, titled \u201cAndy the Pug,\u201d\nby Kelly Morrison. He would unfortunately be fired after a few pages into the\nsecond book as he needed a more stable full-time line of work in order to marry\nhis sweetheart and, being busy job hunting and later working a full-time job\nalongside the illustration work, couldn\u2019t produce art as quickly as Kelly\nMorrison nor he would have liked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://supermilo.webcomic.ws/files/patreon/sm_30_btb_thumbnail.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://supermilo.webcomic.ws/files/patreon/sm_42_adhddog_thumbnail.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, in 2013, after finally\nmarrying his sweetheart, Will Boyer returns to webcomics.

     "about": "Ever since Will Boyer was 9 years\nold, he\u2019s dreamed of becoming a comic strip and book artist. Even before then,\nat an unknown early age, he started drawing illustrated children\u2019s books starring his brother and he as stick figures on wacky adventures. Once\nintroduced to the daily funny pages in the newspaper, especially Jim Davis\u2019\nGarfield, his passion was turned to comic strips and books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe, with his\nlifelong friends often inspiring him or even co-creating with him, would\ncartoon for his and their own enjoyment and amusement, starting in elementary\nand lasting even into his college years. Although his comics never appeared in\nany school newspapers, his comic strips eventually became well known among the\nstudent bodies throughout elementary, junior high, high school, and college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nIn 1994, at the age of 9, Will\nBoyer created MILO THE CAT and MILO COMICS. Eventually, in 1999, he brought the\nstory to a climax by turning Milo into SUPERMILO. That same year he started his\nfirst webcomic, a fan comic titled \u201cPokemon Elite.\u201d Both a Sonic the Hedgehog\nfan webcomic, \u201cSonic Crackers,\u201d and a Ghostbusters fan webcomic in 2007,\n\u201cCNCGB,\u201d would follow. In 2008, after a couple of failed attempts already, he\nwould start preparing to bring back and reboot his old Milo Comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, in\nlate July and early August of 2009, during his years in the Digital Effects and\nAnimation Technology major at Forsyth Technical Community College, Will Boyer\nstarted publishing \u201cSuperMilo the Strip,\u201d a reboot of his original child hood\nMilo Comics, online at \u003ca href=\"http://www.drunkduck.com/\"\u003ewww.DrunkDuck.com\u003c/a\u003e\n(now known as \u003ca href=\"http://www.theduckwebcomics.com/\"\u003ewww.TheDuckWebcomics.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010 Will Boyer also started\npublishing online \u201cGospelman,\u201d a Christian comic strip he created in 2004\nduring his years preparing for possible ministry at Piedmont Baptist College.\n\nHowever, that same year he would\nmeet the love of his life and become too busy finding full-time, non-artistic\nwork to devote much time to art, and so his comics suffer their first major\nhiatus.\n\nThat same year in 2010, he also\nstarted work illustrating a series of children\u2019s books, titled \u201cAndy the Pug,\u201d\nby Kelly Morrison. He would unfortunately be fired after a few pages into the\nsecond book as he needed a more stable full-time line of work in order to marry\nhis sweetheart and, being busy job hunting and later working a full-time job\nalongside the illustration work, couldn\u2019t produce art as quickly as Kelly\nMorrison nor he would have liked.\n\nFinally, in 2013, after finally\nmarrying his sweetheart, Will Boyer returns to webcomics. This time around\nSuperMilo would run consistently EVERY Saturday from April 2013 to November\n2014, at \u003ca href=\"http://www.milocomics.com/\"\u003eWWW.MILOCOMICS.COM\u003c/a\u003e. That\nSeptember Will Boyer began work on Hip Hop for Charlton Neo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter the first Hip Hop story was\npenciled, Will Boyer, out of new SuperMilo strips in his update buffer and\nexhausted to the point of severe anxieties, placed SuperMilo on hiatus and went\non a well-needed Sabbatical at the urging of Tom Gray, \u003ca href=\"http://www.milocomics.com/\"\u003eWWW.MILOCOMICS.COM\u003c/a\u003e webmaster and lifelong\nfriend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nToo stubborn to listen to reason,\nthe burnt out Will Boyer continued working on SuperMilo and various Christian\ncomic projects offline during his Sabbatical. He is currently preparing the\nfirst colored SuperMilo trade paperback for print, \u201cWobbling on the Edge,\u201d\nwhich features a new 14 page prologue, which is already being made available\nhere to donors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHe has also recently finished and\nmade available for purchase the first black and white SuperMilo trade paperback\nversion of the second colored trade, \u201cEnter the Space Worm,\u201d a 48-page book for\nsale now at cons and online at \u003ca href=\"http://www.indyplanet.com/\"\u003ewww.IndyPlanet.com\u003c/a\u003e\nunder the MiloTeam Comics name, and which includes extra never-before-seen\ncomic strips featuring the Space Worm and new character named K.A.T.-V. These\nextra strips are however being made available here on Patreon to our donors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSometime after that, Will Boyer is\nhoping to color \u201cEnter the Space Worm\u201d for print as the second colored\nSuperMilo trade paperback, which will include a back-up story titled, \u201cSewer\nWorm,\u201d featuring the continuing adventures of our little Space Worm friend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile waiting for Charlton Neo to\ncall on him to pencil the next Hip Hop story, the publishing company has him on\na convention circuit the summer of 2015. Having already attended Jay and\nEddie\u2019s Comic Book Show and Lexing-Con, his next convention appearances as of\nthis posting will be on April 25th at Winston-Salem Comic Convention\nin W-S, NC and on June 19th \u2013 21st at Heroes Con in\nCharlotte, NC.\u003cbr\u003e",
