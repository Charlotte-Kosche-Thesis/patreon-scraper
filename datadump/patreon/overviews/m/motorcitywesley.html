Typically each cohort experience consists of weekly discussions about Detroit: its weaknesses, strengths, history, and how Christian communities in Detroit have responded to all those. Topics include homelessness, poverty, healthy food access, urban gardening, medical access, and race. Guests from Detroit non-profits and churches join in to share their experience of the city. Students discern together and donate time to many of these non-profits and ministries to get a full picture of what they\u0027re all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSERVICE-BASED\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the \"lab\" part fo the MCW experience, students put what they\u0027ve learned into action.
