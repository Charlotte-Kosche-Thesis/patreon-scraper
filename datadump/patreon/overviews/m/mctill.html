    "summary": "Greetings friend!!! \u00a0Thank you soooo much for checking out Everybody\u0027s Hip-hop Label. \u00a0We are so glad you are here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you remember the first time music took you to another place?  It captured you in such a way you forgot about this world?  It wrapped you up and connected with your soul?  Do you remember the first time this happened to you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe sure do.  My name is Adam Hayden (MC Till) and for me it was \u201c3 Ft High and Rising\u201d by De La Soul. \u00a0For my buddy Joe Thomas (Joe November) it was \"The Low End Theory\" by A Tribe Called Quest. \u00a0And for our friend Michael Stover (Sto the Last) it was \"Shades of Grey\" by Braille.  These albums were just the first to capture us beyond parallel, but they wouldn\u2019t be the last.  The three of us have gone on to soak up as much Hip-hop as possible.  There is something about Hip-hop music that inspires and enthralls us like no other music or art form.  Hip-hop is special to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, we want to be special to it.  The three of us have been creating Hip-hop and studying it and writing about it and discussing it for over a few decades.  Now, we want to offer our enthusiasm, skills, and Hip-hop devotion to Everybody\u2019s Hip-hop Label and we want you to join us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverybody\u2019s Hip-hop is a community-funded record label dedicated to the creation and distribution of thoughtful Hip-hop music.  This isn\u2019t about egos or getting rich.  This is about striving to create music that inspires and entertains.  It is about creating experiences for people to enjoy. \u00a0And you can help make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe invite you to join Everybody\u2019s Hip-hop Label as an executive producer.   Generally speaking executive producers make sure artists have all they need to create their art.  Typically this includes thousands and thousands of dollars.  But, Everybody\u2019s Hip-hop Label relies on the community not one or two wealthy individuals.  You can join the movement for just a dollar a month.  You can help decide which artists we work with and you can submit samples for beats.  You can become an essential part of this movement.  We need you.  And if you jump on board you get all the music we create (past, present, \u0026amp; future) at no additional cost and you get it way before the general public. \u00a0Currently we are working up to releasing a tribute song every month and four extended projects every year. \u00a0You will get all of that, but more importantly you will help make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you say?  Want to join the team and help create lasting memories for others?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace,\u003cbr\u003eAdam, Michael, \u0026amp; Joe\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdam Hayden\u003cbr\u003eAlias: MC (Till)\u003cbr\u003eStatus: Manager, Co-Producer, Okay Guy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMichael Stover \u003cbr\u003eAlias:\u00a0Sto the Last\u003cbr\u003eStatus:\u00a0Publicist, Writer, Great Guy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoe Thomas\u003cbr\u003eAlias: Joe November\u003cbr\u003eStatus: Co-Producer, Funk Flexer, Another Great Guy\u003cbr\u003e"
