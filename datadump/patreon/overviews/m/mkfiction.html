I\u0027m MK, I\u0027m a gay chronically ill extremely short deep Southerner-turned-Canadian, and for the majority of my life I\u0027ve been building a universe that is more or less centered around the time I overdosed on sacred texts and decided that many religions could use some new and exciting...unimprovements. So far I\u0027ve got 700 short stories, a couple handfuls of novels, and no desire to stop any time soon. It would be very exciting if you would join me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBURNING THE SOUND\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBurning the Sound is a stand-alone novel about a French Catholic with anxiety who follows his demonic roommate into Hell to fight a war against a demigod. Mallory Laurent is a would-be special education teacher who is emphatically not cut out for the real world, and has spent the last seven years of his life working a dead-end job he\u0027s overqualified for, periodically going off his psychiatric meds and regretting it, not going to Mass,\u00a0and sharing his home with his demonic BFF, with whom he is absolutely not in love, because that would be both \u003cem\u003eill-fated \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003emorally corrupt\u003c/em\u003e...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, fine. There is a reason he doesn\u0027t go to Mass anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePyre is a demonically-possessed demon. He was born in an underworld known as the Wretched World, and he is a victim of fetal possession by the murdered right-hand man of the worst dictator the Wretched World has ever known. He has spent the last hundred years of his miserable half-life fighting off the creature, an elemental known mostly as the Fire, that semi-owns his soul. He escaped into the Human World in a Hail Mary effort to smother the Fire\u0027s hold over him, and wandered around contemplating suicide until some guy in Connecticut put out an ad for a roommate seven years ago. Pyre understands a little bit about the Human World now, and a little bit about his future, which is this: when he dies either his body will be used for genocide one last time or he will take the Fire with him, but he is definitely going to die, sooner rather than later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that would be fine, but he is going to miss Mallory, when he dies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen the Fire manages to up the ante and gain more control over Pyre than he\u0027s ever had, Pyre comes to terms with the fact that he has to leave the Human World and sacrifice himself in the Wretched World to try and douse or at least contain the Fire, and Mallory finally understands that monsters are really real and there are exactly zero gods available to help him, and determines that if it\u0027s a choice between Pyre and the world, he\u0027ll take Pyre and set the rest on fire if he has to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecause I believe in Mallory and Pyre, but I don\u0027t believe their story is the best fit for trad publishing. It is however, given my propensity for extras and the fact that I more or less live and breathe this universe, a pretty good fit for serial self-publishing. I\u0027m going to write anyway, I can\u0027t really stop, but stories need readers. Mostly I want to share it, because I like it, and because I write so that I can face the world: and I wrote Mallory, a disabled man with chicken legs and Peter Pan Syndrome who all at once leads an army against a god of death and wins, so that I could face myself and still believe I might come out on top somehow. And even if you don\u0027t get that out of it, you might enjoy it anyway. It\u0027s kind of funny.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy endgame is to make a living off these stories, but I\u0027m not stupid enough to believe that will ever happen. But I would like to share them with other people in exchange for money. So if you want to get in on these gay-ass demons I\u0027ve sold my soul to, then click that big honkin BECOME A PATRON button and LET\u0027S DO THIS SHIT.\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m chronically ill, gay, married, and really short. Like, really short, I\u0027m talking under five feet tall. I divide my time between the deep South and the frozen North, and I\u0027ve been writing stories and mostly living within them for about seventeen years now. I write horror and fantasy with a side of romance and an ongoing attempt at comedy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI bind books by hand and care for very small children and infants for money; I study language and religion for fun, and when in doubt I make up language and religion and write about it. One time I had a raccoon named George Cooney; right now I have a really fat cat named Thanatos. My favorite word is astriferous. It means \u0027bearing stars.\u0027 My SECOND favorite word is mythopoesis. It means \u0027myth-making.\u0027 Those are also my hobbies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe very first draft of Burning the Sound made a reader throw up one time and I am really, really proud of that.",
