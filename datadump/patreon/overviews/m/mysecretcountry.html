    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for supporting us!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nEverything we\u2019re creating here is part of a larger project called \n\u003cem\u003eMy Secret Country. \u003c/em\u003eThe title springs from the quote by C.S. Lewis, \"Everyone, I suppose, has a secret country.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\nMy Secret Country\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e is a cross-media project. That means, the story happens across platforms \u2014 on Patreon, at our website, through a Minecraft game and then finally a documentary film.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/202561547\"\u003eMy Secret Country - Teaser\u003c/a\u003e from \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/user42796549\"\u003eMy Secret Country\u003c/a\u003e on \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com\"\u003eVimeo\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDid you say documentary film? Yes, actually\n\u003cem\u003e My Secret Country\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eis a one-hour documentary that uses animation to bring to life the imaginary friends and worlds of three children and a few adults. The three children in the story have teamed up with each other (and Marlo), to write the fiction part of the story. It\u0027s an incredible tale where their imaginary friends all meet and go on an adventure to save all dessert from extinction. (That\u0027s right all desserts, pies, cakes, donuts, sweeties, etc...! Because it\u0027s going extinct.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat you can expect as a patron of this project includes a special first look at\u00a0short films that are part of the larger documentary, stories from people who have imaginary friends and worlds, a unique series of stories and images by artist Youwarkee, all about the pretend world, Needreba. These things will all end up at our website for free, but you\u0027ll get to see them first. You also get to see things that are just for you. Our patron only wall will include\u00a0behind-the-scenes sketches, drafts, rough-cuts, you\u2019ll learn about things that go well, things that blow up, etc\u2026 things that we don\u0027t want to publish for anyone else. \u00a0You\u2019ll be right there in the trenches as we work on this project, you\u2019ll have a say, you can take part and share your story, and most importantly, it won\u2019t get made without you. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is an experiment. We\u0027ll be taking it step by step together. If the patron levels aren\u2019t working for you, just say the word and we can shift things around. If there are things you\u2019d really like that aren\u2019t available, we can talk about making that happen. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEveryone who supports us and this project is incredibly important. This project is for you. We\u0027re so glad you found us here, with love from the entire \n\u003cem\u003eMy Secret Country\u003c/em\u003e team. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t:::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nFAQ (Frequently Asked Questions):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: \u201cWhat if i want to just donate money to you once and even write it off on my taxes?\u201d\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA: That\u0027s fine. You can make a one-time tax-deductible donation\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.mysecretcountry.org/support\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eat our website.\u003c/a\u003e Thanks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQ. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just do a Kickstarter or IndieGoGo campaign?\u201d\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA: First, our project is designed to be web-native. That means it\u2019s designed with the Internet in mind. We\u2019ll build it piece by piece. You won\u2019t get the whole picture, until all of the pieces are assembled in short form first. So it\u2019s ideal for patreon, where patrons like you tip per month or per project. And we\u2019re able to connect to our supporters in unique ways by sharing the process behind the scenes, sharing our stories and insights, offering special rewards and giving you access to all of our content first. Second, this is a long term project. We\u2019d like to grow it into an ongoing collection of stories about imaginary friends and worlds. That\u2019s a mighty ambitious thing to create, so we really need your support. Third, we aren\u2019t totally ruling out a Kickstarter or IndieGoGo campaign either. As we said this is an experiment. We\u2019ll see how it goes. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: \u201cMy 7-year old daughter has an imaginary friend. I don\u2019t really have the money to support this project right now. But, my daughter would really like to share her imaginary friend as part of your collection and you also said that her friend could be an extra in the feature film if we send you a drawing?  Can we do that without becoming a Patreon supporter?\u201d\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA: First, yes. You can just head over to our website and\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.mysecretcountry.org/shareyourstory\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esubmit your daughter\u2019s story here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe only want you to support us if you are financially able to do so. If you feel like sharing our\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/mysecretcountry\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePatreon url though,\u003c/a\u003e we\u2019d be extremely grateful.\u00a0Second, yes! If your daughter submits an image, and gives us permission, her imaginary friend will end up as an extra in the documentary film. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: I\u2019m a 42 year-old man who works in business (banking). I had an imaginary friend as a child and I\u2019d kind of like to share it for your collection, but truth be told, I don\u2019t necessarily want people to know it\u2019s me. I would never hear the end of it! Can I send you a story anonymously? \n\u003cbr\u003e\nA: We\u0027d like to know your real name and interact with a real person, but as far as the story that you share as part of the collection, that can totally be anonymous. Yes! So far we have several people who are sharing their stories with pseudonyms or just their first name.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: \u201cHow do you know that the imaginary friend stories people send you are real?\u201d\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA: So far we\u2019ve only had very genuine people contact us. In most cases they have drawings and anecdotes that stretch back years. There is often a friend or family member who verifies the story for us. We can\u2019t know for sure that someone didn\u2019t make it all up, but since the point of this project is to foster creativity, if you just made up an imaginary friend to take part in our online collection, that means we just inspired you to make up an imaginary friend. It\u2019s a win win situation. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: \"What is an imaginary world?\"\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA: Imaginary Worlds are make-believe places where make-believe beings go about the business of daily life in playful ways.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: \"Why are you so interested in imaginary friends and imaginary worlds?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA: Over the past decades there has been a decline in children\u2019s freedom to play. At the same time we\u2019re learning that play is a biological function hardwired into us that\u2019s as important as eating or sleeping. The bottom line is, we need to play to be healthy and happy human beings. All sorts of play are important and that includes imaginative play and worldplay. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWorldplay, or imaginary world invention is important because children make their own play, rather than consume the play made for them by others. They grow a sense of self as an independent thinker, an inventor of ideas and things. They learn to posit alternate realities and to construct speculative knowledge of value to the real world. That kind of learning is imagination exercise for adulthood.\u003c/strong\u003e And some people may go on to putting their early imaginative workouts to creative and innovative use across arts (movie directors, screenwriters, novelists, painters etc\u2026) and sciences (programmers, engineers, conservationists, physicists etc\u2026) Inventing imaginary worlds in childhood helps lay the groundwork for an innovative society.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: \"How many people to have imaginary friends or imaginary worlds?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA: It may be a well-kept secret, but the fact is that some 65% of children have imaginary friends (including Calvin, of  \u201cCalvin and Hobbes\u201d). In the UK, 46% have imaginary friends and in Japan 10%.\u00a0About 12% or more of children take their play even further and create entire imaginary worlds with their own unique cultures, languages, artwork, and inventions. Some notable worldplayers include writers such as the Bront\u00eb siblings, J.R.R. Tolkien, and C.S. Lewis, artist-sculptor Claes Oldenburg, and zoologist-artist Desmond Morris.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
