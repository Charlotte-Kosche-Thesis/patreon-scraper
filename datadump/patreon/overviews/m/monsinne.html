Lots of futa, lots of force, lots of enslavement, and lots of gaudy sluttiness. \u00a0Basically, if you want to read about Katarina getting railed by a dominant futa Ahri that breaks her into a toy; Elves getting kidnapped and fucked silly; maybe you just really hate a champion or hero, and want to read about her holes getting destroyed, and mind warped by your favourite? \u00a0Then read some of my stuff! \u00a0You can find a lot of my stuff I\u0027ve done over here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/stories/user/Monsinne\"\u003ehttp://www.hentai-foundry.com/stories/user/Monsinn...\u003c/a\u003e  (You\u0027ll need a profile with stuff ticked to be able to see half of it!)\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA quick list of kinks you\u0027ll see - among others:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e* Futa\u003cbr\u003e* Reluctance/non-con\u003cbr\u003e* Enslavement\u003cbr\u003e* Stockholm Syndrome\u003cbr\u003e* Breeding/Impregnation\u003cbr\u003e* Addiction\u003cbr\u003e* Abuse/degradation/dirty talk\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to write more. \u00a0The most rewarding aspect for me with writing is feedback and interaction with my readers. \u00a0I believe Patreon will help me with both. \u00a0All of my stuff will always be put up online for free and full access, but if you\u0027d like to support me, it\u0027ll only go back into spending more time writing, more interaction and less time at my shitty day-job. \u00a0Cool rewards like voting and being able to read my WIPs, and so on. \u00a0Just check it out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what will I be offering here? \u00a0What do you get out of it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuality, filthy smut. \u00a0I only release works that I\u0027m happy with, that I think meet or succeed the standard of quality I\u0027ve set in my past works. \u00a0I think that erotic fiction is much more tantalising when the character\u0027s emotions are tangible, when you can empathise with them. \u00a0When there\u0027s setup, plot, plausible reason for action. \u00a0It makes the pay-off of the filth so much more enjoyable! \u00a0A girl being treated like a toy isn\u0027t as fun to read about if there isn\u0027t a contrast of her as a functioning person. \u00a0Writing with those considerations in mind takes time, and I hope with the support of people who enjoy my stuff, I can dedicate more time to it, to produce \u003cem\u003emore \u003c/em\u003eengaging filthy smut!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be aiming to produce a full chapter of work 2-4 times a month initially, a chapter will never be less than 2500 words. \u00a0Each one of these will be based off a prompt that all patrons get to vote for. \u00a0So basically, what I write will be up to you guys!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
