Lucas, and I go on the internet by my initials. In a few months I\u0027m going to be the proud owner of a Journalism BA, but in my free time I\u0027ve been making media analysis videos on the internet. I\u0027ve been making YouTube videos since I entered the 9th grade, but in recent years I\u0027ve been focusing on more in-depth analytical content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel is sort of a mixed bag, but all of my videos aim to bring a new perspective or make an argument about a particular piece or genre of media. Some of my favorite videos include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qse2tdKb3j8\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHow Monopoly was deliberately designed by its creator to be unfair to players\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTbsgyUoulg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHow media reviews fundamentally break journalistic ethical code\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRQOlHgteaY\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHow Queens of the Stone Age\u0027s 2002 album Songs for the Deaf uses radio as a thematic framing device\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf34InksoAM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHow 2017 indie platformer The End is Nigh handles completion\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY GIVE ME MONEY?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, there really is no reason for you to give me money. In fact, the only reason this page exists is to provide an avenue for people who want to donate to do just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, know that money earned through Patreon will go towards financing future videos. This is more than just simple equipment upgrades, by the way. In fact, the last time I made a video on a zero budget was in May 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to pledge, the main thing you\u0027ll get access to is behind-the-scenes material. All the scripts for all of my videos will be made available for your reading pleasure, and I also post some snippets of future projects, whether it be pieces of a script, some raw footage, or some segments of the final edited video. It\u0027s not much, but I hope that this encourages you to keep your pledges fairly low.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT ARE MY GOALS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making videos. I consider my media analysis projects to be a true passion of mine, and I only want to make them bigger and better. Journalists don\u0027t generally make a lot of money, so my ability to fund that passion is limited. Hopefully this, along with YouTube\u0027s ad revenue, will begin to open up a secondary revenue stream which I can pull from to eventually make my craziest ideas become a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn tandem with that goal, I also take pride in my degree path and career as a journalist. This creates an issue when asking for funding like this, as the element of bias comes into play. I want my work on YouTube to affect my work as a journalist as little as possible.\u00a0As such, I won\u0027t be looking at the list of people who pledge, nor how much they give. I also won\u0027t be paying attention to or responding to comments on Patreon in the same way I do on YouTube. I appreciate your pledges greatly, but I can\u0027t know who gives me what if I don\u0027t want to sacrifice my journalistic integrity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU SO MUCH.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still cannot believe that anyone would ever want to give me money to continue producing content. That\u0027s incredible.\u003cbr\u003e"
