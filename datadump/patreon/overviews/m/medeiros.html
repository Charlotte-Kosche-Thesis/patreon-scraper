    "summary": "I\u0027m Andrew Medeiros; I\ndesign tabletop roleplaying and live-action games (rpgs and larps) and\nwant to bring them to you so that you and your friends can enjoy them as much\nas I do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe roleplaying games I\u0027ll be producing will almost exclusively be based on the  \u003ca href=\"http://apocalypse-world.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eApocalypse World\u003c/a\u003e engine by \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/lumpley?ty=h\"\u003eVincent D Baker\u003c/a\u003e and require a base knowledge of those rules to\nplay. Other successful roleplaying games built on the same rules framework\ninclude: MASKS, Dungeon World, Urban Shadows (which I\nco-designed), Monsterhearts, Sagas of the Icelanders, and many many more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThough my focus is more on on tabletop\nroleplaying games,  I also love writing live-action roleplaying scenarios (aka larps);\noften inspired by Nordic larp traditions, and will strive to create one larp\nfor every three rpgs written.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs mentioned, I co-designed and co-wrote the\nroleplaying game \u003ca href=\"http://www.magpiegames.com/our-games/urban-shadows/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eUrban\nShadows\u003c/a\u003e by \u003ca href=\"http://www.magpiegames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMagpie Games\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027ve designed a few games that I have given\naway for free online. So why a Patreon? I want to continue writing and\ndesigning games and this way I can dedicate more of my free time to producing\nthese games, something I\u0027ve very excited about. With enough support, I can\nunlock new funding goals and give the games further polish; that means\nhiring a graphic designer, editor, and hopefully one day an illustrator.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI plan on releasing 3-6 games per year, this\nwill ensure each game is thoroughly play tested and ready to play when you get\nit. I\u0027ll also include sneak peeks and play test materials for supporters who\nwant to try the game sooner and provide valuable feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*New Patrons*\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons who begin funding at the $5 or higher mark from now onward will gain access to one of my past games, not all. When you sign up as a Patron, I will send you a private message with the list of options for you to choose from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBased on the large trend of male-dominated game\ncreators on Patreon vs non-male, this Patreon includes my promise of \u0027paying it\nforward\u0027. That means at least 15% of all profit collected through this Patreon\nwill go back into Patreons with female and non-binary creators.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
