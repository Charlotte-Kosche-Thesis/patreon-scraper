    "summary": "Howdy?  I\u0027m the your Mad\nPhilosopher in residence.  What makes me mad?  Well... a great many\nthings... but the short answer is that the way mankind has been\nliving since long before my lifetime is deeply, unsettlingly,\nincomplete.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThere is a tension in our\nlives.  We all feel it, but none of us really grasp it, understand\nit.  In the first world, in the 21\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;st\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; century, the poorest\namong us have access to technologies, foods, levels of education, and\nforms of entertainment that, by and large, surpass even the wildest\ndreams of the kings and emperors that lived even a few centuries ago.\n At the same time, we have been divorced from all that gave meaning\nto our actions.  It\u0027s the existential nightmare Nietzsche, Camus and\nKafka were gesturing towards: a world in which one can literally\naccomplish anything, but the demands and absurdities of one\u0027s lessers\nalmost force one into choosing to accomplish nothing.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIf you\u0027re like me, the\nmotivational talk on people\u0027s email signatures, cubicle walls, and\nfacebook posts seem more like excuses to celebrate mediocrity and\nattempts to be at peace with an unfulfilling life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI may just be an angsty\nmillennial, but having read philosophy non-stop for twenty years, I\u0027m\npretty confident that I\u0027m not alone today, and I\u0027m certainly not\nalone in history.  I want to have a public conversation centered on\nthis reality.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIn the past, there were\ncertain prerequisites for doing philosophy.  The biggest example is\nthat of patronage.  If one was a wealthy slave-owner, one would have\nthe leisure time to think about how awesome life is and write about\nhow everyone (except slaves) should be able to just hang out and do\nphilosophy all the time.  If one wasn\u0027t a wealthy slave owner, one\nwould have to turn to the kings and bishops for patronage... and\nthose philosophers would inevitably write about how awesome the kings\nand bishops are and how everyone was lucky to be ruled over by such\nbeneficent stewards.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIn today\u0027s society, those\nthat are able to produce value to others have access to disposable\nincome.  While I would love to do philosophy all the time, I\u0027m too\nbusy providing value to others in order to feed my family.  If you\nfind this conversation valuable, I can provide it for you; I do ask\nfor your patronage, though, as today\u0027s rulers are less than happy to\nhear what I have to say about them.  Every little bit helps.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tCarpe Veritas, and have a\ngreat time.\u003cbr\u003e"
