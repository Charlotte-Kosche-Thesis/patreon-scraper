    "summary": "After the shit storm of a year that 2016 was, many activists sat down to reflect on how to use their platforms more effectively moving forward into 2017 \u2013 myself included. \u003cem\u003eWhat causes the biggest stir in my spirit? What are my areas of expertise and experience? What do people come to me for, and how can I honor that relationship by pushing more radical thinking? \u003c/em\u003eI asked myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, after months of pre-contemplation, in January, I launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.melissafabello.com/beautyschool\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBeauty School\u003c/a\u003e: a monthly feminist newsletter unpacking issues related to body politics and beauty culture. My goal was to offer my readership deep dives into critical analysis often missing from the mainstream body image conversation in bite-size essays \u2013 straight into their inboxes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I was floored by the response. Body acceptance big shots like Jes Baker (The Militant Baker) and Gina Susanna (@nourishandeat) joined the list, and I reached 1000 subscribers months before I hoped I would. Clearly, this was something that was needed. Even \u003cem\u003eHealth at Every Size\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0author Dr. Linda Bacon had something to say about it:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55a0499ce4b0919ea0ccf840/t/593477db9f7456640477fb4e/1496610788931/lbtweet?format=750w\" style=\"width: 451px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich got me thinking: We know that conversations about body politics and beauty culture are usually buried in social justice circles, and that the mainstream body positivity discourse is often fluffy and oppressive. What would it be like to have tangible resources to help push that conversation forward? If my own unique talent is synthesizing ideas and disseminating information, especially at my intersections of privilege in body positive spaces, what if I could use the platform afforded to me to do the most good? What if people who are new to feminism and body acceptance could\u2014well\u2014be taken to school?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I could expand Beauty School from a newsletter to a full-on multimedia platform? Hell, what if we could do it together?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what I\u0027m picturing:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA weekly blog, allowing me to respond more quickly and fully to current events and direct questions that you have.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYouTube videos, covering more complex topics in easy explainers \u2013 something you all consistently tell me you miss.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMonthly hangouts, connecting with you to talk through career stuff, content stuff, or even just \u003cem\u003eJurassic Park\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0stuff.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRegular webinars, featuring the most radical activists in the field, blowing your minds with their brilliance.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA series of courses, guiding you through practical steps to take to improve your activism and wellbeing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBooks (gah! the dream!), detailing issues about body image in a feminist way for mainstream audiences\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere it is in visual form, just to get you even more pumped:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55a0499ce4b0919ea0ccf840/t/593481f1ebbd1ac8c0875001/1496613367251/?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWouldn\u0027t that be \u003cem\u003eamazing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eYes\u003c/em\u003e, you\u0027re thinking. \u003cem\u003eOf course! But how?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWell, friend, that\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel called to do this. I feel so compelled to do this work that I want to take a risk for it. But I\u0027m also a Capricorn, which means that any risk I take needs to be calculated. So while I would love to dive head first into this, no-holds-barred, I think it makes more sense to ask for some help getting it off the ground first \u2013 and then eventually moving into dedicating myself to content creation full-time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m asking for Patreon patrons to help shape what Beauty School looks like \u2013 through opportunities to connect with me personally, provide feedback on my thought process, access a backstage pass to my journey, and get first dibs on content and programming \u2013 for as little as $2 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd to start, my goal is only to reach a collective $1000 per month \u2013 just enough to pay my rent. This will allow me the ability to focus my time, energy, and talents to put the resources that you want and need out into the world, while giving back to the gracious community that has always supported me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0are who I do this work for. But when I\u0027m being pulled in multiple directions, content creation always falls to the wayside. But it\u0027s the one thing that you need; it\u0027s what you ask me for. And I have so many ideas to share with you \u2013 and the world at large. And I think that with a little support, at least at first, I could create something life-changing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what I\u0027m asking is simply for you to consider if you have the space in your budget to send me five or ten dollars per month in exchange for some really awesome perks for you (check \u0027em out to the right). It would make all the difference in the world for me, and I truly believe I could use it to make a difference in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClass dismissed.\u003cbr\u003e"
