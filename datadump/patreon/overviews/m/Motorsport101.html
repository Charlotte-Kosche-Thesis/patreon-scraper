    "summary": "Hey folks, I\u2019m Andre Harrison. Currently, I\u2019m a 24 year old, aspiring journalist and bookmaker (to pay those bills). You may also have know me as \u201cHarrison101\u201d, from my days on YouTube as a gaming \u201cLet\u2019s Player\u201d specialising in the F1 and MotoGP gaming series, as well as journalistic style show \u201cDre TV\u201d, and Downforce Radio from hit biking show \"Bike Live\", from August 2014-November 2016. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January of 2016, I decided to move on from the gaming aspect of what I do, and decided to commit to the \u201cMotorsport101 Podcast\u201d, 100%. This was due to the congested nature of the F1 space on YouTube, and I felt like it wasn\u2019t the best fit for what my real strengths are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u2019m incredibly fortunate to be doing this with a team of really passionate and intelligent friends and fellow fans. We believe that Motorsport is a \"Fresh take on the world of Motorsport\", something we feel has become a bit of an old man\u0027s game Us, a bunch of 20-something\u0027s from two continents are trying to make it just a little bit more fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, as of February 2017, we\u0027ve added \"Bike Live\" to our network of content, with Louis Suddaby and Rebecca James also making the switch!

As well as the full show being on iTunes (And Stitcher, coming soon), we will also be producing video highlights of the show, to try and grow it via the medium of YouTube. Bike Live will be running alongside in roughly the same sort of timezone, meaning the 2017 version of the network will be running with two shows a week from March to December, with sporadic shows in the \"off-season\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show is a mix of news, reviews, and banter, aiming for around 2 hours or so, also featuring guests, and interaction from the fans as well, for Q+A segments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, something I need to stress. This page is only for supporting us. We\u2019re not withholding any content, regardless. This page could grow dust and have no patrons, and we\u2019d still be doing this. But if you REALLY love us and want to support the show, then this is the best possible way you can support us, you get an even better podcast, and we give back with some extra perks and incentives!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, having this show isn\u2019t free, there\u2019s hosting fees and website fees to cover, but if we can get them covered, it can put our minds at rest, and then anything else, we can potentially split it down the road. We also need to use analytics to get true statistics on the show, so we can use that to attract potential sponsors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you want to go the extra mile to support #Motorsport101 and what we do, this would be wonderful, and of course, thanks so much for taking the time to read, and support what we do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAndre Harrison, Louis Suddaby, Adam Johnson and Ryan King, the #Motorsport101 Network\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
