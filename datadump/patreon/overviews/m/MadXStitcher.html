    "summary": "Hello out there, and welcome to my Patreon page.\u00a0 My name is Milesy.\u00a0 I used to have an embroidery shop, but that closed down in 2017, when I realised I could no longer keep up with the demands and requirements of keeping it running.\u00a0 Now, I\u0027m solely a content creator, focused on all aspects of embroidery.\u00a0 Between my YouTube channel and my deviantART page, I make all manner of art, resources, and vlogs/blogs on embroidery - in particular cross stitch.\u00a0 I\u0027m a very small creator, but I\u0027m trying to grow my brand into something bigger.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is this page?\u003c/h3\u003e\nI occasionally get asked what the deal is with the whole donation thing, but I don\u0027t see Patreon as a donation service.\u00a0 I don\u0027t ask for donations on my videos or streams, and don\u0027t expect people to hand over their money and get nothing in return.\u00a0 What Patreon is more similar to is a separate subscription service.\u00a0 I don\u0027t charge per-creation, but per-month.\u00a0 That way you know what you\u0027ll be paying every month, regardless of how much content I manage to release.\u00a0 For your pledge of support, you can get early access to videos, downloadable patterns, exclusive livestreams with voice chat, and more.\u00a0 Each month, there\u0027s a new-supporter bonus, and at the end of the year, I like to do something special for my supporters as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow will I use the money?\u003c/h3\u003e\nThe money made from this page helps support the channel.\u00a0 That means everything from keeping my Adobe subscription up to date, to purchasing new equipment, materials, and licensing rights to some of the artwork that I use.\u00a0 Embroidery on its own is often an expensive hobby, but since I\u0027m doing it commercially, often have to purchase a separate license to use the images that become patterns.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis year, I\u0027m hoping to upgrade some of my equipment.\u00a0 The webcams I use are decent, but I\u0027d like to try to replace them both with something that gets crisper, clearer macro shots.\u00a0 My facecam in particular is a disaster, and isn\u0027t any good for anything other than a small little bit of video up in the corner.\u00a0 I\u0027d also like to get a better stand, whether that means finding something on the market, or having something bespoke made.\u00a0 Already this year, you guys have allowed me to put acoustic tiles in my stitching area, which (once installed), will bring so much more vibrancy and colour to my videos, as well as improve the sound quality and minimise my fears that I\u0027m annoying my neighbours.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecoming a patron is completely optional, and won\u0027t affect your ability to watch my videos, attend my livestreams, or see any of my finished pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNew Patron Bonus:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNew patrons from any tier level will get a needleminder set (four needleminders in total).\u00a0 Make sure your address is correct when you sign up.\u00a0 Needleminders (and all physical rewards) are sent out at the beginning of every month, for the previous month(s).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note: Most rewards stack.\u00a0 A person pledging $15 will also receive rewards for all previous tiers.\u00a0 The exception to this is digital pattern rewards.\u00a0 You will get the number of patterns listed in the reward every month.\u00a0 You will not get that number plus the previous number.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePattern Listings:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://pinboard.in/u:MadXStitcher\"\u003ehttp://madxstitcherstore.net/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFloss List: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://madxstitcherstore.net/floss-list.html\"\u003ehttp://madxstitcherstore.net/floss-list.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeedleminders: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://madxstitcherstore.net/needleminders.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://madxstitcherstore.net/needleminders.html\u003c/a\u003e"
