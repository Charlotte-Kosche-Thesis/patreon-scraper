    "summary": "I love live action role playing games.  I\u0027ve been writing larps since 2000, and now I am looking to build a community of players, game masters, and community organizers who want to play my games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Aj4cnhC.jpg?1\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eIf you back this project you will be supporting me in creating ready to run, one shot, character driven larps. \u00a0I write games that are full of political and social tension which unwinds in an evening. My games do not have winners or losers - I want everyone who plays to get an opportunity to have a dramatic denouement. \u00a0The games I write have mechanics that tie into the core of the story. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemedia Amoris is one of my most recent games.  The game was set\u00a0was set in the Nobilis role playing universe, at the Court of Love. \u00a0Players portrayed characters seeking to decide the nature of love - is it about passion between two people, about how society organizes itself, or simply a corrupting influence that must be stamped out? More importantly they sought to fall in love themselves. \u00a0One part of the game that I thought was particularly interesting was a mechanism for players to write their own plots and intra-character relationships before the game. Remedia Amoris is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5144977/Remedia%20Amoris.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eavailable\u003c/a\u003e for you to read and run, to get an idea of the sort of larps I write.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile Nobilis is a setting that I particularly enjoy, I write games in a variety of original and established universes.\u00a0In the last few years I have written in the Shadowrun, Castle Falkenstein, and In Nomine universes. \u00a0I have also written semi-historical games set in Charlemagne\u0027s Aachen and Ancient Rome. \u00a0My next project has a original future hard science fiction setting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to use this Patreon project to expand my larp writing in three ways:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, I write more when I have an audience. Recently I have been writing a summer larp and a New Years larp, but having more people I am writing for will help me expand my writing to meet my own goal of producing four larps a year. \u00a0Writing a larp generally takes me between one and four months, depending on how large and complex it is. \u00a0I want to produce games in the spring and the fall, and having a community on Patreon who I am producing for will help me meet that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/P5h1zye.jpg?1\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eSecond, I want to package my larps for other groups to play.  I always conduct the first run of the games I write, but I have been able to\u00a0hand some of my games off to other people who run them for different audiences.  I want to take the time to fully flesh out my larps so that they can be easily run by a third party, and to revise them to incorporate the lessons I have learned in the first play through. \u00a0Patreon makes that easier for me because the audience for each larp is clear - its you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThird, I want to make it easier for other people to find my games. I don\u0027t have as much time to go to conventions as I might like - I really only have the chance to run a few larps a year. \u00a0But I think that my games are well suited for others to run, and I absolutely love to see photos and read reports from people who have played one of my games. It\u0027s great motivation! \u00a0My hope is that this Patreon project will help me develop an audience for my larps, and encourage people to run them around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy live action games have been run at conventions and private parties in multiple countries. I have written for the Godlike roleplaying game, for Pyramid Magazine, and for the Deleria roleplaying game (which was nominated for an ENnie).  I have written more than a dozen short form larps - and with your help I\u0027m hoping to write more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecial thanks to\u00a0Johanna Bobrow (\u003ca href=\"http://silverandindigo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esilverandindigo.com\u003c/a\u003e) for the pictures of Remedia Amoris. \u00a0Nobilis was created by\u00a0Jenna K.
