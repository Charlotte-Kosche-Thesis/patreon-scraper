I\u0027ll still love you anyway for just\u00a0checking out my content. I just want to share and\u00a0entertain you, and if you feel like dropping some money into my \"virtual tip jar,\" well...that\u0027s super-rad. And if at any time you don\u0027t feel like pledging anymore, no problem.

Every little bit helps; my goals of new art supplies and computer software will only increase my ability to produce varied and interesting content. Thanks so much for even reading this far. Honestly, this concept isn\u0027t much different from you cats buying my art via commission, but this way is much better because we\u0027ll be able to interact way more. And you\u0027ll get to see me bring reality to my ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
