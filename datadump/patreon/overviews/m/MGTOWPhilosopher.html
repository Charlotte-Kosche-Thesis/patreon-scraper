    "summary": "This channel is devoted to people who are interested in social, political, philosophical, and MGTOW content. My target audience is mainly men, though I have no problem with women watching. It just so happens that those who are most interested in what I have to talk about are men.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy talking about subjects such as culture, society, culture, economics, philosophy of a practical nature that a regular guy or gal can understand, and MGTOW. As a life long MGTOW \u003cbr\u003eI want to help young men who are just coming up, and didn\u0027t have a man teach them the realities of life, and perhaps some older men who may have never heard of MGTOW before, and want to learn more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also firmly anti left, and anti socialism, and anti collectivism, and subjectivism. This means that I heavily dislike\u00a0 emotion based decision making, using feelings as facts, and not employing logic and reason to find ones answers. I also oppose arguments from authority, any and all forms of circular reasoning, and most forms of extremism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can kick me a few bucks a month that would be great. I\u0027d like to spend more time making content, and expand my channel, maybe enter onto new platforms, but that is hard when you work full time. Any support you can provide would help me do that, and maybe even reach the point where I can provide content for you guys full time. Imagine that.Anyhow thanks for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am a practical person who is based very firmly in reality. I understand the world, and how it works all too well. This makes me an enemy of all people who embrace irrationality, circular reasoning, flawed logic, and who try to push such on others so as to spread their nonsense. Believe what you want, this does not make you my enemy. However, try to spread it via public institutions, or through the corrupt government, or media, and you have now become my enemy. Hence why I am creating, and will continue to do so if I can. To educate people about the truth, and about the reality of life, so that maybe they will learn something useful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to being a practical person I embrace realism entirely, and take my lessons from reality. In that sense I am a philosopher, at least of sorts, but not the useless type who sits around all day pontificating to students, and to their colleagues about various complex aspects of arguments, ideas, social and political structure. I can do such no problem, as I am well schooled in most philosophical schools, both western, and eastern, but most average, everyday people are not, and philosophy that people cannot understand is useless. Hence, I prefer a more practical, realistic approach in terms of how I present my arguments. I like to use logic, and reasoning that speaks to everyone, and that everyone understands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of my videos are about social, and political subjects, but some are about MGTOW. Some are linked to MGTOW,\u00a0 and marked as such, but might not be obviously MGTOW. But if it is marked as such there is a connection. Be it to feminism, or leftism, or something else that effects men, there will be some link or it won\u0027t be marked MGTOW.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main goal in creating this Channel is to educate others. I don\u0027t expect to get through to many, if any leftist. They are long gone, and have been indoctrinated. Getting them to change their views is as hard as trying to get a fundamentalist Christian not to believe in God. Don\u0027t waste your breath. However, there are some folks on the fence, and some who just didn\u0027t take to the indoctrination, and those are the people I hope to reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions please feel free to support my channel, and drop me a donation. Every little bit helps me to continue to create new, and interesting content. \u003cbr\u003e",
