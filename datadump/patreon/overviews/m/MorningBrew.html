    "summary": "We are Alex Lieberman and Austin Rief, and we are the founders of Morning Brew (also known as the Brew Crew).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe were sick of spending hour after hour flipping through the \u003cem\u003eWall Street Journal\u003c/em\u003e on a treasure hunt to find that one story that actually caught our attention. Learning about and feeling connected to the business world should not have to go down that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo as two college students who met at the University of Michigan, we created Morning Brew in March of 2015 to \u003cem\u003econnect our generation with the business world in a way that is engaging, memorable and personal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eSince then, we have sent out over 650 hand-crafted daily emails, keeping our generation up-to-date on the business world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will not stop until we create the most interesting, thought-provoking and connective business content that you could possibly ask for. We will do whatever it takes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho Are We:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been getting a TON of emails from subscribers explaining that\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"we love the Brew, but who is the Brew?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0They want to know who we are and our story. It\u0027s a privilege to finally introduce ourselves: \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/2j0bmhc.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0026#8217;m Alex Lieberman. Head Barista (CEO) of Morning Brew. I\u0026#8217;m 23 years\nold, hail from Livingston, New Jersey and graduated from the University of Michigan in 2015 with my BBA (and concentrations in Real Estate and Markets). Before joining Morning Brew full-time, I worked as a Fixed Income Trader for Morgan Stanley in New York. Fun fact: I eat my food faster than any other\nhuman being on the planet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/eg7f5e.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u0027m Austin Rief.\u00a0Head Shop\nStrategist (COO) of Morning Brew. I\u0026#8217;m 21 years old, hail from Owings Mills,\nMaryland and am a senior at the University of Michigan studying accounting and finance. I interned at a boutique investment bank in New York this past summer, but will be joining Morning Brew full-time upon graduation. My fun fact? The movie 21 was about me (\u0026#8230;okay, that\u0026#8217;s just not true at all, but I did count cards in a former life).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo great to finally meet you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re just two newfound entrepreneurs, who have been hard at work trying to make our dream a reality. Our ask is for you to get behind the Brew and get behind us. \u003cstrong\u003eTrust that our ability to create great content and our eye for building things that truly connect with young business people will lead to success.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does Patreon come into play?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing the Brew is a huge challenge, no doubt about it, but we are so excited for the opportunity. BUT this does also involve a sizable amount of money. Money that we don\u0026#8217;t have and need to find (cue broke college grad jokes). We have a few ways to do that:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdvertise in the Brew\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRaise money\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLet the community drive this company and launch a Patreon\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003eWe plan on doing a little bit of each, but not too much of any one. Why? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u0026#8217;s simple\u0026#8211;we don\u0026#8217;t want to overwhelm you all with an abundance of intrusive ads that take your attention away from the Brew\u0026#8217;s quality content. And we don\u0026#8217;t want to give away so much of the company that our early hires can\u0026#8217;t have the same drive that Austin and I have to work towards this shared vision. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat said, anything that you can do to help back the Brew will go a long, long way. Plus, we truly want to involve you, our loyal readers, in the fate and direction of this growing spaceship and create a community that everyone will look back on and be proud of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are our costs?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is \u003cstrong\u003e$1,500/month\u003c/strong\u003e. That roughly amounts to 0.5% of our reader base donating a Tall Cinnamon Dolce Latte (do they even taste good?) to the Brew each month. That will cover: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNewsletter Redesign\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are so proud of Morning Brew and we hope you are too. That said, it is crystal clear that we aren\u0026#8217;t perfect (a Brew can dream). BUT, we do owe an experience and level of perfection to you all. A comprehensive visual redesign will allow us to bring our grand vision for the daily Brew to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHiring a Head of Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0026#8217;re speaking to everyone from seasoned writers at the Journal to newbie journalists at Northwestern University with an understanding of the voice that speaks to our readers. (We\u0026#8217;ll be sure to keep all of our Patreon backers updated on our progress.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrew Team Workspace\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as Austin and I enjoy pouncing on that first open table at Starbucks on 28th Street or muting the phone mic during an important partnership call while the craziness on 3rd Ave races by, we really do need a \u0026#8220;home base.\u0026#8221; (We\u0026#8217;ll reveal the space + photos of the team with our backers once the goal is hit!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNext, our stretch goal:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$4,000/month\u003c/strong\u003e. We\u0026#8217;ll give you all of the details should we end up lucky enough to reach this monumental level, but just know that this will be the #1 catalyst for the Brew to pull in all star quality talent (especially in the creative and community-building spaces) and get the technical resources necessary to be a big league player in video, social media and other key platforms.\u003cbr\u003e"
