It gets ME the funding I need to create more music and music videos and it gets YOU access to exclusive content (blogs, early releases, exclusive downloads, private performances, first previews) that you can\u0027t get anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew to Patreon? New to Maggie Kubley? Check it out ---------------\u0026gt; My name is Maggie Kubley and I live and work in Chicago where I create music, performance, and music videos. I\u0027ve got a band named Celine Neon. We put on elaborate pop concerts all over the city. I also create music under my own name that I perform via my special standup-meets-cabaret style of concert. I also produce music videos for both Celine Neon and my solo work. All these things take funding. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in. Every time I create a song/video, I can earn a bit of money! How? You sign up to pledge $1, $3, $5, however many $ you want for each song/video I create. I create the song/video, upload it for you to have and love for forever and ever, and then the $ that you pledged is deducted from your credit card/debit card/pile of money you keep under your mattress/etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage means the world to me and I take it very seriously. I\u0027m brand new to Patreon and I\u0027m excited to use it as a vehicle to connect and form bonds with my most genuine and supportive fans. Give me your feedback! \u00a0Let\u0027s do this together. I\u0027m excited to take this journey with you!!!\u003cbr\u003e"
