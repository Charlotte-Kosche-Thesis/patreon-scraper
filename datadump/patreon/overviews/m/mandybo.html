    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u0027re a fan of mine and want to support me in the creation of new songs, music videos, vlogs, writing, performances and other incredible artistic \"creations\", this is the place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy story:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a very hard working independent artist. I\u0027ve been struggling to find the right platform for ongoing support, through which I can release constant material (and make a living). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs a creator, singer, songwriter and recording artist, I thrive on direct communication with my audience without having to go through labels, distributors and the mass media. I love creating and instantly sharing. I also know my community, y\u0027all are smart, kind, supportive, future-platform embracing individuals. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI believe subscription sites like Patreon are a new revolution in releasing music and art patreonage. They\u2019ve created a quite underground network for artists to connect directly with their fans, bypassing the entire commercial system, and it\u2019s awesome! This helps save artists like myself in an art-economy that is presently drowning by allowing you to directly support the continued creation of the music you love.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTo continue to make music that fills your hearts and speakers, I need support, true patronage; those willing to be the driving engine to pay for the recording studios, filmmakers, website fees, gas, food, lodging. This is my life and my work, I need a salary and a budget.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is an ongoing commitment to me and my music.  Now, I know commitment can be scary, but if you change your mind you can pull out before you\u2019re charged at the end of any month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile I have been successful in running both Kickstarter and PledgeMusic campaigns, which are awesome for huge one-time projects, I don\u2019t want to get repetitive and exhaust my community with \u201cHey, I\u2019m making another record, pre-order here\u2026again!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI just want to be able to go into the studio, make music with friends, call a film director, make a video, take a little time off, write, record and press PUBLISH when I am done (instant art).  I love putting creations out NOW. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout money:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSOME CREATIONS COST A LOT OF MONEY while some creations cost almost nothing, the idea here is that you trust me to use the ongoing budgets as I see fit. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eNot every project will cost the same...but the more budget I have, the more incredible creations I can create and the more I can spend on my artistic collaborators. It gives me great pleasure to be able to pay other artists to Do Their Creations with my budgets.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you guys know me, you know I LISTEN. I know we can make it together and we will. Even if you\u0027re a one dollar backer, I want to know what you\u0027re digging and what\u0027s bugging you via comments here, on twitter and/or facebook, as well as on the live webcasts.\u00a0I truly appreciate the feedback I receive from everyone, it\u0027s GREAT and it works! I read comments and absolutely love discussing my projects and career with each and every one of you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEvery patron who\u0027s supporting me is important to this community, YOU\u0027RE who I\u2019m creating for and I\u2019m glad you found me here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhether you\u0027re backing me for a dollar or ten dollars...THANK YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLots of love,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMandy Bo\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eP.S. If you\u0027re not familiar with MY music, please visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.mandybo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.mandybo.com\u003c/a\u003e where you can find my bio, music, videos, photos and more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e............\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTHE FAQ (frequently asked questions)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you have questions, please submit them on twitter, facebook, or here on the patreon stream once you sign up.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eQ: \"Why are you charging Per Creation versus charging Per Month, like some other patreon artists?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eA: Per Creation seemed safer than monthly. What if i\u0027m traveling or touring and don\u0027t have output to share? I\u2019d feel guilty. \u00a0Patreon has a MONTHLY CAP, so if you want the security of only EVER paying $10 a month, because that\u0027s what your budget allows, you can CAP at $10. That way it\u0027s like paying $10 per month WITH the added advantage that if I decide to post No Creations in a given month, you\u0027ll be charged NOTHING. So it\u0027s technically better for you, and I won\u0027t feel guilty, ever.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eQ: \u201cBut if I cap my backing at $10 a month, does that mean I won\u0027t get ALL THE CREATIONS?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eA: I\u2019m treating everybody equally. The CONTENT goes out to the public, you guys are the backstage. You don\u0027t lose access to ANYTHING when you hit your cap. You\u0027ll still get EVERYTHING emailed to you if you\u0027re backing at the email level, and access to all streams even if your cap is $1 a month. You don\u0027t get punished for capping. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eQ: \" I want to join your Patreon, but I don\u0027t have any idea how much to donate. I want to do it for about $25-35/month. You say it\u0027s donating \"per creation\" - how often do you do those \"creations\" - so I can get an idea how much to donate per thing. For example, if you do a \"creation\" every 3 months, I will donate $100 per thing. guidelines on \"thing\" timetables... at least roughly?\" \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eA: Well...that\u0027s really generous. You have two options: you could just back me at $10/thing, which is the closest denomination (in general I\u2019ll put out about one creation a month) and I\u2019d cap your donation at $30 or $60....so you never pay more than you\u0027re happy with. OR if you\u0027re feeling more generous, you can actually \"write in\" a higher amount per creation (i.e. you can write in $20/$30/$50 at the $10 level) until you hit your monthly cap. There\u0027s an easy way to set a monthly maximum for yourself when you\u0027re entering your payment info.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eQ: \"When are you going to put out a physical record I can touch?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eA: SOON! I\u2019m working on it. Meanwhile, you can purchase physical goodies at \u003ca href=\"http://www.mandybo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.mandybo.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eQ: \"What if I want to just donate money to you once?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eA: That\u0027s more than fine.  Please email me at bo@mandybo.com for details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
