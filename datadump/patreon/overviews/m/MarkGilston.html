In today\u0027s mercurial society, it\u0027s much more difficult for\nthe small time artist or musician who doesn\u0027t follow the mainstream cultural\nnorms.  So it\u0027s more important than ever to help those who want to keep\nthe old traditions alive and thriving.  Let\u0027s not let the old music get\nwashed away in the flood of the new pop trends.

     "about": "Mark was born and raised in New York City. Both of his\n parents were steeped in the folk music revival scene of the 1950\u0027s. He \ngrew up  \nlistening to 78\u0027s and LP\u0027s of American, Russian, Spanish, Caribbean and \nIsraeli folk music. His sister was a professional harpist. Learning \nguitar and taking piano lessons \nstarting at age 5, he was constantly immersed in music.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn \nhis youth, Mark gained a love of traditional American ballads and Old-Time songs \nand instrumentals from recordings and from his father, who often sang the old \nballads which he had learned in his youth in \n\nAppalachia.  From his early years in college, Mark was often playing these tunes \nand accompanying himself on the mountain dulcimer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\u003cimg height=\"230\" src=\"http://www.markgilston.com/images/mgcon.jpg\" width=\"150\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHis interest in Balkan music developed in his early \nteens when he began folk dancing at John Wagner\u0027s studio. A good friend \nsent him back a \n\u003cem\u003egaida\u003c/em\u003e from Bulgaria and he began to teach himself how to play the\n instrument in 1969. In 1970 he moved to Montreal to go to college and \nbecame a regular at the Yellow Door Coffeehouse where he bought his \nfirst own mountain dulcimer. He started playing concertina two years \nlater.  \u003cbr\u003e\nAfter earning a Bachelor\u0027s degree in Folklore, Mark \nwent to graduate school at SUNY Binghamton and ended up settling there \nuntil 1994. Sometime in the early \u002790\u0027s he discovered Swedish \n\u003cem\u003espelmansmusik\u003c/em\u003e and fell in love with the traditional fiddle music \nof Sweden. Rather than trying to learn yet another instrument, he began \nplaying this music on concertina which he found was capable of playing \nthe intricate harmonies of multiple fiddle parts.  \nLater he began to adapt the Swedish style to dulcimer as well.  In May \nof 2002, Mark moved to Austin, Texas where he now lives and plays.",
