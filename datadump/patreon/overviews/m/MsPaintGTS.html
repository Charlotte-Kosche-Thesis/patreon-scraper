I made the switch over to PaintToolSai around mid-2012 the name just kinda stuck with me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about myself... I\u0027m 23 years old biologically male- currently attempting to make the social transition to female and respect your right to call me whatever you please - though June, MsPaintGTS- and female pronouns are preferred. Whatever the heck that means.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started a Patreon because in recent times I have only been able to draw for commissions due to the need to supplement my relatively low income to help pay for rent, food, and the like. This has caused a lot of my content to become a reflection of my many commissioners desires rather than my own- it has also caused some of my practices with experimenting on techniques to die down quite a bit. It is my hope that through the support of those who enjoy my art I will be able to afford some time for myself to go out and create of my own accord once again- I will lay out my general desires for creation bellow just so you know what sort of content you\u0027ll be supporting, if you choose to support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll content will be size-related... This generally means very small humans coming into the posession/contact of normal sized females/feminine humans - OR - normal size humans coming into the posession/contact of gigantic sized females/feminine humans. The scenarios will mostly be sexual in nature, sometimes featuring nudity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe things I prefer to draw...

Some images supported through Patreon may imply death through suffocation- or feature generic blood splotches from very small peoples- the \"victim(s)\" of this will always be willing in these cases generally and painful details will not be depicted. Certain images may feature male content or Futa - this will be more of a rarity than the standard content but it may pop up from time to time, this Patreon is designed specifically for freedom of creation on my part- I hope you understand that I will draw what I desire and from time to time this will mean some couple play, or futa will be involved which will feature male genitalia. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo images will be entirely exclusive to Patreons- The only things that will be \u0027exclusive\u0027- are certain explicit streams and the high quality versions of explicit art - 50% size versions being available on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://giantessbooru.com/post/list/mspaintgts/1\"\u003eGiantessBooru\u003c/a\u003e page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Patreons who donate any amount will have their names credited underneath the relevant uploads when they make their way to DeviantArt - these may be sorted by alphabetical order or by donation amount.
