The story follows Steve, Roy, and Jugsy through their first year out of high school and through just about all the normal crap that happens when people start assuming you\u0027re an adult (jobs, relationships, apartments, roommates, college, the usual), and you\u0027re not quite sure what that means. Magnetic North is a full color, full page comic that updates once weekly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for me, I\u0027m Kat. I\u0027m previously a baker, currently a full time mom, and I will never have enough time for this comic, even if I got to work on it every minute of my day. Even the sleeping ones. I come from the small town I\u0027ve based the comic in, and while I don\u0027t live there anymore, I do remember what being 19 and carless was like there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of paying someone to watch my kid so I can work on the comic, supporting me means I can upgrade my equipment (my tablet is 10 years old, and I work 100% in photoshop, also my computer chair randomly does death drops), I can upkeep the site (you know, any information besides the comic itself), and pay bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
