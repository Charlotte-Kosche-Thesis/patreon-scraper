What began as a small project became a massive endeavor, involving metal fans from all over the world, as we secure interviews of some of the most important names in heavy metal. Bands like \u003cstrong\u003eFive Finger Death Punch, Judas Priest, Gorgoroth, Watain, Children of Bodom \u003c/strong\u003ehave all sat down with us already. Of course, there are many still to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTired of what we saw as a lazy media that simply republishes press releases, and which wastes our times with interviews that amount to little more than silly questions, we aimed to make a difference. We stayed clear of clickbaiting content, thoroughly prepared all of our interviews and, little by little, expanded our content. Articles on psychology and heavy metal, freedom of speech and, of course, photography, have become the norm in our magazine. And yet, we want to do more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TKe1Ld3niBo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are currently developing the Youtube series \"\u003cem\u003ein the Pit,\"\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0where we show you the ins and outs of concert photography, using specific gigs as case studies. Additionally, we plan to create a series of \"Concert Photography 101\" videos, so that those with an interesting in the field, even those outside of the heavy metal community, can learn about this amazing (and often frustrating!) job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s22.postimg.org/5fgiumdxd/Why_Patreon.png\" style=\"color: rgb(35, 45, 50);\"\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatreon allows people who value our work to support it by making a small monthly financial pledge.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou pledge as little or as much as you like.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou are charged when you pledge and then at the beginning of each month. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou can cancel your pledge or change your pledge amount at any time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all know that ads are terrible. Not only are they annoying, they are also a security risk, as more and more ads are used as vectors to transmit malware. What is more, they often threaten the independence of a media publication like ours, as there is an enormous conflict of interest when you are receiving ad money from the same label whose music you are reviewing. Because of this, and even though it meant forgoing on a steady stream of income, we decided to maintain \u003cstrong\u003eMetal Blast!\u003c/strong\u003e free of any ads. The same applies to our Youtube channel, which we have deliberately maintained ads-free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHere is where you, our readers and viewers, come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging a monthly amount, you give us the opportunity to maintain our independence while, at the same time, allow us to expand our operation. First and foremost, to make Metal Blast a fully independent, self-sustaining site and, second, to be able to increase our reach by covering some of the costs that come associated with our work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s22.postimg.org/6ggrjquwx/What_you_get.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the great things about Patreon is that it also gives us a direct and tangible way to reward those in our audience who feel more closely connected to us.\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting us, you can have the chance to access our archive of raw, unedited interviews, early access to our videos, direct input into our interviews (is there anything \u003cstrong\u003eyou \u003c/strong\u003ewould like to us a specific artist?) as well as into some of our editorial content. Also, if you\u0027re a fan of photography, you can have direct access to our photographers, who will be happy to help you get to the next level in your work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSounds good?
