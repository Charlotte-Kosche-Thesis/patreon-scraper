    "summary": "Thank you for visiting this page \u0026amp; reading about the Dream Delivery Service!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0started the Dream Delivery Service to devise, as a writer, a new relationship \u0026amp; intimacy with readers. And, on a personal level, to do things that come most naturally to me: writing all day, biking around cities in the dead of night, \u0026amp; being weird without consequence.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you subscribe to the Dream Delivery Service I write \u0026amp; deliver dreams to you every day for a month. To subscribers in the city where I\u0027m located I deliver the dreams to their doors before dawn, biking around the empty streets at night. To subscribers outside the city I deliver the dreams every day by mail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe dreams are brief narratives of dream-life \u0026amp; dream-logic, which I write from my imagination.\u00a0I attempt to write a unique dream for every subscriber every day, though I more often fall short of that goal. Here is an example, a dream I wrote for NPR\u0027s Morning Edition when they interviewed me:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"\u003eMorning Edition Listeners\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMarch 14, 2017.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou are in a dark tunnel. You have a small flashlight, which\nilluminates tiny specks.  The\ntunnel stretches out in front of you \u0026amp; behind you. Water drips \u0026amp; plops\nfrom unseen sources into unseen puddles. You walk into the dark for a long time\nuntil you trip over something \u0026amp; fall: a stack of newspapers bundled up with\ntwine. You turn your flashlight on the bundle: It is all of the newspapers from\nevery city from the day you were born. The bundle is too heavy to carry so you\nleave it \u0026amp; keep walking until you trip \u0026amp; fall over another bundle. It\nis all the newspapers from your first birthday. You keep an eye out as you walk\nnow \u0026amp; come across another bundle: all the papers from your second birthday.\nThen your third. Fourth. So on. You grow accustomed to the bundles \u0026amp; pass\nby them without looking until you find a bigger bundle \u0026amp; a steel bucket.\nThe bucket is full of keys. The bundle consists of every newspaper from your\nlast birthday until today. Some are normal newspapers, some are blank except\nfor ads, some are filled with unreadable stories of nonsense \u0026amp; gibberish.\nEach has a keyhole on the front. You take keys from the bucket \u0026amp; try to fit\nthem to the newspapers\u2019 keyholes. When you fit a key to a blank paper \u0026amp;\nturn the key, the paper fills with stories. When you fit a key to a nonsense\npaper, the paper falls apart into dust. When you fit a key into a normal\nnewspaper a bit of light fills the tunnel. And as you unlock more newspapers\n\u0026amp; the tunnel fills with more light, you realize it\u2019s not a tunnel at all,\nbut a home you recognize on a street you recognize in the neighborhood in which\nyou live. \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSince September of 2016, I\u0027ve been on the road delivering dreams in various cities, often biking between cities as I travel. So far I\u0027ve delivered in Denver, Richmond, Tucson, Marfa, \u0026amp; Austin. Along the way, the Dream Delivery Service has been profiled on \u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-39494657/the-man-who-writes-dreams-and-delivers-them-to-your-door\"\u003eBBC World News\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/this-bike-poet-delivers-dreams-to-your-doorstep\"\u003eVice\u003c/a\u003e, \u0026amp; \u003ca href=\"http://www.npr.org/2017/04/14/523413140/door-to-door-poet-touches-lives-by-writing-poems-and-delivering-them\"\u003eNPR\u0027s Morning Edition\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am going to continue traveling to more cities \u0026amp; delivering dreams in them. I\u0027d like to deliver in big cities like Chicago, Portland, \u0026amp; New York, but I\u0027d also like to deliver in small towns \u0026amp; cities that are often less of a draw for arts projects like this. But I need some help, which is why I\u0027ve set up this page. I hope you\u0027ll consider subscribing to or supporting the Dream Delivery Service.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can become a patron here or subscribe directly at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dreamdeliveryservice.com\"\u003ewww.dreamdeliveryservice.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
