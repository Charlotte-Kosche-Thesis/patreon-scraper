    "summary": "Hello everyone and thank you so very much for being here! My name is James Mack! Truth: I am a very poor man. It is very difficult to keep myself afloat or financially stable. I\u0027ve had multiple jobs throughout my life that never seemed to stick or help me improve my quality of life. And so...I\u0027m trying something different. Something more...risky. I love to draw, I love film, and I above all else love video games! Why am I telling you this, well it\u0027s all related! See I\u0027m creating a series called Monthly Gamer where I discuss video games and animate over my discussion of them. https://youtu.be/Jbxh_nuW2s8\u00a0Seems clich\u00e9 I know, but it is something I am legitimately passionate about! My aim is to inform and entertain any enthusiasts of video games and hopefully grab some newcomers along the way! It\u0027s also a way for me to be transparent and engaging with my audience...YOU! I have a wide knowledge of video games and I like to discuss them with other people! If you decide to take this journey with me it will surely be worth your while! Currently I\u0027m only using what I can make due with, but with your help...I can be SO MUCH MORE for you! The more you invest in me the \u00a0more I\u0027ll grow better as a content creator for you! Once again thank you SO MUCH! You have my gratitude!\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/user/TheJmack90"
