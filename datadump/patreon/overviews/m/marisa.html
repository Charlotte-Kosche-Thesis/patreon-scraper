I first published a book at 17 and now I am trying to get more writing done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI work freelance which means the money doesn\u0027t often come in. I occasionally get contract jobs and right now I am covering my rent and bills but if there are costs to submit work to competitions, to pay an editor to go over my work, to attend literary events, to subscribe to literary journals or to even buy my fellow writers\u0027 books or support their work then usually I do not have the funds to do so. The recent funding cuts by the Australian government has made things more dire. I also spend a lot of time volunteering with organisations like the union MEAA and Diverse Writers of Australia and Australian Women Writers. If I could get some money for stories and some feedback too, it would help a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I spend the money on?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e1. Paying an editor a fair rate to edit my work before submission/publication.\u003cbr\u003e2. Costs of attending literary events such as festivals, conferences and book launches.\u003cbr\u003e3. Subscriptions to literary journals to help support them as they try to continue giving writers a platform to publish on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e4. Costs of submissions for competitions \u0026amp; buying \u0026amp; supporting other writers, some via Patreon itself.\u003cbr\u003e5. I would also like to donate some of the money to the Indigenous Literacy Foundation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I writing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSeveral things:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e1. A novel titled Sedition that is now in the rewriting/editing stage.\u003cbr\u003e2. A novel titled HIM that is currently in the first draft stage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3. Short stories - I want to write more of them and I would like to give you one short story a month to read.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e4.
