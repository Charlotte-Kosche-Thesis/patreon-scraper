    "summary": "Okay, okay, I\u0027m doing this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m Mike Schmidt, of the Internet Schmidts. You may know me from my extensive work on \"FUCKING HIRE ME ALREADY\", a project I\u0027ve been working on for the last 34 years - 26 of those years spent in the field of comedy, live and otherwise. As you can see, I\u0027ve also established a beachhead in the run-on sentence community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill reading? Cool.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a standup since 1991, and a podcaster since 2006, eventually starting my own show, \"The 40 Year Old Boy\" in 2008. The show is a free-wheeling monologue I like to call \"talking at the speed of my head\"; a\u00a0weekly trip through the mosh pit that is the inside of my skull. No filter, no set list \u2013 just a gut-punch funny stream of consciousness ramble that can and does touch on anything I\u2019ve ever done in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a highly personal show, and listeners are more like friends than fans ... and who better to ask for money than friends, right? Right? Hey, where you goin\u0027? Aw, c\u0027mon...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill reading? I\u0027m shocked, but glad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn June, Year Ten of \"The 40 Year Old Boy\" starts production, and I\u0027d like to mark the occasion by not only putting out the most brutally funny and heartfelt year of shows yet, but by also getting out and doing live shows all over the world. I want to meet all of you - everyone who\u0027s ever sent me a dollar of support, or an email of thanks or encouragement. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to see the faces of everyone who laughs with and supports me every week. I want to thank you in person and tell you all how much you mean to me ... and then I want to make you laugh until you fucking cry and cry until you fucking laugh and after the show we\u0027ll go out and close whatever town was foolish enough to have us. I want shows and experiences we\u0027ll never forget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support\u00a0here will allow me to concentrate on creating a life worth talking about, both on the show and onstage. Your support here will allow me to develop past stories I\u0027ve told on the podcast for the live stage, or maybe even into pitches for television. There is no greater privilege in this world than being paid to be yourself; your support here will grant me that privilege.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to do the best work of my life for you: live, on the podcast, and on any other podcast or shows that will have me. I want to spend all of my time constantly growing and improving as a performer ... and when the world finally takes notice you can say, \"That\u0027s my friend Mike. I always knew this would happen\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s fucking time, man. It\u0027s time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou in?"
