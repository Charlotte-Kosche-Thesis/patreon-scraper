With your support, I will be able to provide services including servers for games to play on with you on streams, and expand my retro collection, enabling us to relive our childhoods together on stream.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eA LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME...\u003c/h4\u003e\nI\u0027ve been a gamer at heart for well over ten years, having gotten my first console (Sony Playstation 1 at the age of 4 in 2000). Since then I\u0027ve played many games across multiple platforms spanning those sixteen years.\nI\u0027ve been producing content since late 2011, but today I\u0027m mostly known for my now defunct Minecraft Let\u0027s Play series on YouTube \"MrMFretwell Plays Minecraft\". I also produced content known as Hidden Secrets, a Minecraft server/gaming group that I ran, however this has since closed down.\nStreamADay was a challenge I began based upon Inspiration from Coestar, a friend and inspiration who has streamed daily for over two years. StreamADay is actively helping me overcome my personal battle with depression. On occasion I will talk about my problems openly in the hope that I can show that depression is a battle that can be won, that no one is alone when experiencing it, and that talking about it for me helps, so others shouldn\u0027t be afraid to talk about it. Thanks to the amazing support and dedication from all those who view, day by day I feel like I am getting better.\nThanks for reading this and learning a little more about me!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePATREON REWARDS/BENEFITS...\u003c/h4\u003e\nBy becoming a Patreon and supporting me, no matter the amount there are always some benefits involved, the more backers we get, the more rewards I\u0027ll be able to offer. I want to offer my wonderful backers with the best experience I can deliver from servers to play on together to personalized gifts from myself to make this campaign truly special and worthwhile."
