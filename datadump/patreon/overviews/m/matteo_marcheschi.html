I fell in love with the sport when I was only 11 years old, and, even though I was young, I knew I\u0027d found my passion. That has stayed with me for all these years. I\u0027ve been to plenty of races since then, including eight races at Chicagoland Speedway, two at Daytona, and two at Kentucky. My passion for the sport is unending, and I\u0027m committed to covering every aspect of NASCAR.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWhat I Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been writing about the sport for over a year for Racegear.com and Frontstretch.com. Now I\u0027ve gone independent, writing for my own NASCAR website, UncontrolledTire.com. I co-host the Uncontrolled Tire Podcast and create unique content, including driver interviews and weekly driver approval rating polls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Problem\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWriting about NASCAR is all well and good. Unfortunately, it\u0027s financially taxing. Between podcast equipment, website hosting, and travel expenses, it gets too be quite a bit. That\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it For You?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOf course, there\u0027s some serious perks for you as well. From access to previews of articles and other content before it goes out to the world to the ability to impact my content, there\u0027s no shortage of benefits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne Last Thing...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you all so much, whether you contributed or are just taking a look. I cannot express how much your interest means to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
