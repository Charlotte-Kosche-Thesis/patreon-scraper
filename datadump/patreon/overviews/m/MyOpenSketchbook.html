I am a full time freelance artist and illustrator creating art that focuses on portraiture and the human body. As a lifelong people-watcher (not as creepy as it sounds) I have a passion for capturing the human face. I\u0027m also an unapologetic fangirl, and creating fanart is like my comfort food. Expect to see some fanart on occasion sprinkled throughout my posts! Though traditional art is my bread and butter, I\u0027ve been continuing to play with digital art as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersonal Work Examples\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.myopensketchbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/personal-work-examples.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommissioned Work\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eExamples\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.myopensketchbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/commissioned-work-example.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon allows me not only to keep creating more art, but to create a \nfantastic community with you where we can interact on a far more \npersonal level than just sharing on social media. By becoming a Patron, \nyou\u0027ll have early access to my art + first chance at claiming a \ncommission slot when commissions are open. Other pledge tiers gain you \naccess to exclusive behind the scenes \u0026amp; process art shared only to my Patrons, and a \ndiscount code to my shop! With your support, I can continue to create new works to share in addition to taking on commissions. It also lets me take the time to create and fund new products for my shop such as new prints, stickers, pins, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo my current and future patrons, thank you, thank you, thank you.
