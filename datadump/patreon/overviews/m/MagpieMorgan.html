    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eCharity Streaming + Patreon, why?\u003c/h3\u003e\nI\u0027ve been streaming for charity on/off for about 3 years. I recently got twitch affiliated which is awesome, but since buying a few things to help improve my stream I realised I can bring more to my community and create entertaining/educational videos as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI felt like it was important for me making this, to consider myself still a charity streamer, to be whole heartedly open in what I spend my money on and how much comes in to my personally. So I thought that having this page would be the most beneficial instead of accepting something like paypal where I could be pretending to have no income, but in reality well off you know?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m making this Patreon hopefully to just cover costs. Would I like to be someone who\u0027s entire income is from Patreon? Who wouldn\u0027t! But realistically all my goal is, is being able to afford replacing broken stuff, affording what makes my stream run (Xsplit \u0026amp; Adobe) and being able to buy the occasional iced coffee for late night video editing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
