You guys get to pick a cosplay for me to do under $500or if you want it to be a bit more extravagant you can tip more to pay for the whole thing because cosplay is expensive. Like if you pay me $500 then ask me to build a mecha and I\u0027m like...wait.. but I... lol you feel? Basically you message me and lemme know which cosplay you would like or if you want a certain kind of shoot, within reason and tasteful might I add, I throw it in queue and pump them out when I can! After 6 months you are able to request a 2nd cosplay and so on and so forth!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
