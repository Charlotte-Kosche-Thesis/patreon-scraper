    "summary": "Friends,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an undergrad, I took a creative writing course whose instructor, despite the fact that I was always feeling behind and unable to perform to her high standards, told me \"You need to keep writing, you\u0027re good,\" as she handed back my final project grades. Fast-forward to about a decade ago, and\u00a0I first heard of a miniatures game called Malifaux that had been introduced at the previous Gencon and incorporated the genres of the Wild West, Victorian England, Gothic Horror, and Steampunk. I happened to be reading the Dark Tower series at the time and purchased the gunslinger, Perdita, and her crew straight away. I\u0027ve been lost in the steam-clouded streets and barren wildernesses of Malifaux ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2008 I began the blog that would eventually become Malifaux Musings as a way of sharing my love for all things Wyrd with the world. Since then, it has grown, shrunk, been shut down temporarily, and has now begun to emerge into a Malifaux news source that (I like to think) people from around the world use to receive an outsider\u0027s view of what\u0027s coming for Malifaux, Through the Breach, and other Wyrd products, as well as receiving tactical and strategic advice from people who (occasionally) have some helpful experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBottom line: I love working on Malifaux Musings and watching it grow. I love spending time writing. That growth and writing time, however, has limits. I have a family. I have a full time job. I have to rationalize taking time away from said job to write for personal topics or to stay abreast of Malifaux news and notes. Additionally, Malifaux Musing\u0027s new writer, Jon, travels to major US tournaments up and down the American eastern seaboard and beyond to provide on-site reports, and these trips cost money as well. Plus, it\u0027s not like the miniatures and books are free. As such, I\u0027m looking at adding Patreon support to make sure the blog and website\u0027s growth continues unabated and to give myself the opportunity to write outside of the world of Malifaux as well. I\u0027m not looking to replace my income with this site. I\u0027m a scientist first, writer second, and I have no interest in changing this. However, I wouldn\u0027t mind adding some supplemental income to cover the costs and keep it growing. And I love every one of you that contributes your hard-earned funds to make that a reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again,\u003cbr\u003eAdam Rogers"
