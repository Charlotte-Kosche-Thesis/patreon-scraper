The concerts aim to help new and already established metal musicians. Funds raised from Patreon will help our operating budget as well as providing resources for performers at the venue, production assets, and a capital for the promotion.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlus, whether it\u0027s the veteran metal band that we all know or your cousin\u0027s band that just got their first gig, we want to support their music and the creators behind them. we know you do, too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.metalheadsociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PATREON-PAGE-COMMON-QUESTIONS.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\u003c/strong\u003e NO - Pay in any currency!
