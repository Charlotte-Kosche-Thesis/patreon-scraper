    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eMagical Creatures of Hamakua - Animal Rescue and Sanctuary \u003c/strong\u003eis a public charity registered under section 501(c)(3) and all donations made to the sanctuary are tax deductible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Helena Lundblad, and I\u0027m the President and founder of Magical Creatures of Hamakua - Animal Rescue and Sanctuary. Ever since I was a small child I was drawn to animals. Dogs, cats, horses, birds, mice, walking sticks, frogs, bunnies etc.. You name it, I probably tried to have them move in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy and my (very supportive and patient) husband moved to a beautiful 13 acre property in Laupahoehoe, Hawaii in July, 2016. After years of not being able to have animals in my live I was like a sponge dipped in water. Two weeks after we moved in we adopted two cats and a dog. A month later we heard about an orphan baby goat who needed a home. We named her Janice. Janice was injured before she moved in with us, all her hooves were damaged and she lost two of them completely. While she was healing she lived in our bedroom, she ended up staying inside the house for 6 month. When Janice was older and could get around ok in her home made prosthetics, we found two more orphan baby goats on craigslist. After that it was those horses that needed fostering.. And then the two other senior horses that my dear friend Karen (Vice President of the organization) found starving and rescued. And a numerous litters of kittens that needed fostering. And some puppies. Most recently two orphan baby piglets moved in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January 2018 I incorporated Magical Creatures of Hamakua - Animal Resuce and Sanctuary and we are a public charity under section 501(c)(3), meaning all donations are tax deductable. There are more animals out there who needs sanctuary. We are not out of space, but out of funds and manpower.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we\u0027re building a base of committed volunteers we also need cash donations to grow. We need new/improved fencing and shelters. Animal feed and veterinary care. I\u0027m committed to give all I have for the animals, but I can\u0027t do it alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll donations, small or big, are extremely appreciated! The residents of the sanctuary today cost us about $600 per month, and that\u0027s not including any unforeseen expenses like medical emergencies. Up until now this is money from our own pockets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering donating to our cause to make this world a better place for all our Magical Creatures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelena Lundblad\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
