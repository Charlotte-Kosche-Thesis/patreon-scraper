    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"https://mcstacker.net/MCStacker.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi I\u0027m PyroStunts(Matt Godfrey). Welcome to my Patreon page. This past year I\u0027ve just about finished the creation of the new version of MCStacker. Work began on this before all of the Minecraft 1.13 command changes were announced. It meant that many of the command output code had to be rewritten. I have a 1.13 version of MCStacker at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mcstacker.net/mcstacker1.13.php\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emcstacker.net/mcstacker1.13.php\u003c/a\u003e . And the 1.12 version is at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mcstacker.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emcstacker.net\u003c/a\u003e . The original MCStacker is still useful and it\u2019s still a very popular tool for the Minecraft adventure map and mini game making community. But the time had come for a reboot. The original site is no longer supported but will remain at it\u0027s current URL.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started with Patreon, I promised to do the following things. I\u0027ve achieved all of these things and a whole lot more and I\u0027m really happy how it\u0027s turned out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA more robust and responsive MCStacker.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Passengers stacking system will be more hierarchical.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEvery field that lets you enter ticks has a toggle button that converts it to seconds by multiplying it by 20. Such a simple idea that makes it even easier to use.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere\u2019s also a lot more color on the page. It really helps you to see how things are organised which creates less confusion.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eItems that have specific NBT will be supported. (just the important ones like written books)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore commands are going to be supported, starting with the entitydata command.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA command parser. If MCStacker can produce a command then it should be guaranteed to be able to use it to load all of the settings into the form.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that the hard work has been done, I get to focus on feature requests and bug fixes. I\u0027ve now also ventured into YouTubing and have an MCStacker channel. The goal of this channel is to showcase all of the functionality of MCStacker and to show people how to use it. Some of the videos will cover basic use while other videos will cover advanced game mechanics.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me on Patreon helps me tremendously with running costs and more importantly with motivation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will be given an ad-free link to use which will make all the adds disappear for a month. Thanks for you support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
