Rather than telling the stories of Greek and Roman myth, we focus on analyzing the literary material where those stories come from. Sometimes we choose a particular figure or theme from mythology and examine texts relating to it. Other times, we choose a passage from a play or poem and analyze it for its themes and ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur podcast is unscripted, so anything can happen! We keep it real\u2013we want you to feel like you\u2019re sitting down and having a conversation with us. We also welcome your input\u2013questions, thoughts, suggestions, ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, of course, we appreciate your support! We\u0027ve been on the air since April 10, 2016, sharing our passion for ancient myth. \u00a0As our little podcast grows, we\u0027re encountering increased hosting expenses. We want to upgrade our hosting plan so we can keep all our episodes available for everyone to listen to at any time.
