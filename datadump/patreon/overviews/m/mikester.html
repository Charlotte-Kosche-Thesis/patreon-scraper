    "summary": "My name is Mike Sterling, and I sell comic books for a living. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been doing so for nearly 30 years now, and for most of that time, in one form or another, I\u0027ve been writing online about the comics business. I used to post on local BBSes, then on AOL forums, then on LiveJournal, and now, for the last 13 years, I\u0027ve been gabbing about funnybooks on my own website, the slightly self-deprecatingly titled \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.progressiveruin.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMike Sterling\u0027s Progressive Ruin\u003c/a\u003e.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver those 13 years, I have written nearly 4,500 posts for that website, formerly on a daily basis but currently on a somewhat more sane schedule of 3 to 4 posts a week. I try to educate my readership about just how \u003ca href=\"http://www.progressiveruin.com/category/retailing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe comics retail sausage is made\u003c/a\u003e, with descriptions of my day-to-day job experiences, thoughts that go into ordering and maintaining comic stock and merchandise, and proselytizing for \u003ca href=\"http://www.progressiveruin.com/category/free-comic-book-day/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFree Comic Book Day\u003c/a\u003e. I also review comic book releases, \u003ca href=\"http://www.progressiveruin.com/category/this-weeks-comics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enew\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.progressiveruin.com/category/from-the-vast-mikester-comic-archives/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eold\u003c/a\u003e, as well as providing \u003ca href=\"http://www.progressiveruin.com/category/end-of-civilization/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esomewhat satirical commentary\u003c/a\u003e on items offered to the comics market via the monthly catalog. In addition, I have a long history of interacting with my readers, regularly \u003ca href=\"http://www.progressiveruin.com/category/question-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eencouraging their questions\u003c/a\u003e and, at the beginning and end of each year, asking for \u003ca href=\"http://www.progressiveruin.com/category/predictions/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etheir comics predictions\u003c/a\u003e for the coming months and looking back at how their previous predictions panned out. And of course, sometimes, I\u0027m just \u003ca href=\"http://www.progressiveruin.com/2009/03/15/the-long-awaited-watchmena-team-crossover/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esilly\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn late 2014, I opened up \u003ca href=\"http://www.sterlingsilvercomics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy own comic shop\u003c/a\u003e, after decades of managing shops for others. As one might imagine, this has decreased my free time significantly, though I still devote what time I can to providing content for Progressive Ruin. It is too much of a necessary release for me, to discuss and comment and sometimes just straight-up vent about this industry to which I\u0027ve devoted my life. By opening a Patreon account, I hope to perhaps subsidize my time spent working on Progressive Ruin, providing the content I always have, and maybe, just maybe, a little more besides. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, I am planning to begin my longterm project of going back to the very early days of the site, fixing (or at least addressing) broken links in old posts, correcting errors, adding category links, actually putting \u003cem\u003etitles\u003c/em\u003e on posts (no titles, what was I thinking), and generally just cleaning up the mess. That\u0027s gonna take a while, and Patreon support would certainly help pay for the time devoted to this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can help, even just a buck a month, I would greatly appreciate it. I know there\u0027s a lot of folks out there in the comics world that deserve your support, and if you can spare a bit for me, that would be great. And if you can\u0027t...believe me, I still appreciate your readership, and thank you for following (and hopefully still following!) Progressive Ruin after all these years!\u003cbr\u003e"
