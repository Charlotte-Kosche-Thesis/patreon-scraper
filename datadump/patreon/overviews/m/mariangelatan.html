    "summary": "I am an amalgamation of worlds; a mishmosh of art and science, east and west. My name is Mariangela Tan. I\u2019ve been a full-time artist since 2014 but have been seriously creating since 2004. I make most of my meager living through the sale of my artwork from gallery shows. I have plans to make more work for my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.etsy.com/plushplay\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eetsy\u003c/a\u003e shop. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work primarily in organic fibers such as wool and paper but also draw, paint and sculpt.   I\u2019m best known for my soft sculptures of needlefelted flora and fauna in the guise of animal-plant hybrids, mythical carousels and other fantastical creatures. My work has been featured in art shows across the country and has also been published in a compilation book of plush artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.mariangelatan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_6868.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI was born in Manila to first and second generation Chinese immigrants. My parents would then emigrate themselves to Brooklyn NY when I was 8 years old. Growing up in two very different places and being a part of such different cultures has shaped the artist I am today. This duality is a reoccurring theme in my life and my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost of my formative years, I focused on the sciences and this is where my love for the natural world began.  I was and am a science geek, a comic book nerd, a video game enthusiast and an anime otaku. I grew up never considering art as a career for my parents referred to artists as starving.  I didn\u2019t pursue art until I was an adult when the realization came to me that I was never more fulfilled and satisfied as when I created with my hands.  The majority of the techniques and mediums I use today are self taught and I strive to expand that knowledge. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBeing an independent artist means having to wear many different hats; web designer / web manager / marketing /customer service / shipping / photographer / editor / copywriter. An artist doesn\u2019t just make art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.mariangelatan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/patreon01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that your support here on Patreon will help me experiment and further develop my skills, concepts and ideas. In return, I hope to give you a glimpse into materials, techniques, processes and new projects. With enough support I can also bring my work to art fairs which will allow me to reach more people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that some of this resonates with you and that you might consider supporting me via Patreon. May my Patreon provide you with knowledge and inspiration. \u00a0I\u0027m so very grateful to the ongoing support that I get from my Patrons. I thank you from the bottom of my heart and I cannot express enough how helpful this is to the continuation of me as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Her themes often include explorations of sentimentality through tangible objects, and frequently crossover into the world of toys and consumables. Her current work showcases wool fiber and crepe paper that has been transformed into delicate floral arrangements. So often inspired by the wonders and oddities of nature, she uses them as symbols of transformation that we can all relate to. Mariangela\u0027s work has been showcased in galleries and boutiques across the US and has attracted the attention of collectors globally. \u003cbr\u003e",
