We are a small band of young film junkies who were inspired by the likes of the Nostalgia Critic and The Cinema Snob to make our own movie reviews.  What started out as a group of friends having fun though, has quickly turned into a growing web series with over 4 different shows and vlog series and we need your help to keep growing.  We\u0027ve been pushing the boundaries of what we can do, but we want to do more with better equipment, and that\u0027s where you come in.  If you\u0027ve looked at our youtube page and like what we do, than you should know that we want to do more, but most of our, or my, equipment is very out of date and increasingly insufficient for our needs.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, we can change that by replacing our outdated equipment, buying new and better software, increase our film budget for each episode of Michael the Comic Nerd, pay our graphic designer for official logos and possibly merchandise, make our own website, and even eventually make our own theme song!  These are just some of the things we want to be able to do, but can\u0027t because we have no funds to do it.  With your help and support, I believe we can do all of this and so much more!  So if anything I\u0027ve just said rings true with you, or you just want to help out an up and comer, then donate to our cause and help us become what I know deep in my heart we can be!"
