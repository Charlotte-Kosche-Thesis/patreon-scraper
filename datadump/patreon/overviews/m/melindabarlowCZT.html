Because YouTube is free lots more people have been watching my channel and enjoying the same type of lessons I teach at the library. \u00a0I post three lessons a week if you attend a live class you get them all the same day, but on YouTube they come on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturdays. \u00a0It takes a good deal of time to make and edit each lesson, you support would be greatly appreciated. \u00a0You can count on 12 videos a month.\u00a0"

It was created by Rick Roberts and Maria Thomas. \"Zentangle\" is a registered\ntrademark of Zentangle, Inc. Learn more at zentangle.com.\nWhen do you tangle?\nI tangle all the time. At least once a day, I got my CZT Certified Zentangle Training October 2008 and I\nhave been tangling every day since.\nDo you have any artistic training?\nYes I am a proud member of Class #4 CZT 2010. My mother is an artist and as a child I took classes from her. She thought I used to much purple when I\ndrew the mountains on a landscape one time. Just a side note!
