    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello beautiful people!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Morgan Dortch\u003cstrong\u003e. \u003c/strong\u003eFormally, it was Morgan Miller, but then I had to go and get married. So now its Morgan Dortch. I still go by Morgan Miller for music purposes. Also between you and me, it sounds better. Anyways, thank you for taking the time out of your busy life to read this and check out this site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\"What the heck is Patreon?\"\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003eBasically, it allows people to upload videos and content so lovely people like you can help support what we do. I upload a video, and you to pledge to donate whatever amount of money you would like per video. You can set \u003cem\u003elimits\u003c/em\u003e! So if I upload 5 videos and you pledged to donate $1 per video but $3/month. You would still just be giving $3/month. Pretty spiffy right? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Why would I wanna do that?\"\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFirst, let me tell you a little bit about myself. Narcissistic right? I am a 22 year old singer songwriter. I moved to Nashville, TN January of 2016. A lot of people think I moved here to become famous or to \"get a music career\". Truth be told, I moved to the music city because I felt like that is where God wanted me to be. I have no interest in fame. I have an interest in making music for a living and not being controlled by money or by a clock. I am a barista for an insanely cool coffee company that does catering events, and has a membership coffee club. I like to think coffee is a metaphor and connects people. Some of the best conversations I have had have happened over coffee. I love being outside, camping, hiking, kayaking.\u00a0 I\u0027m always down for a road trip. Michael (that guy that changed my last name) and I are planning on doing quite a bit of traveling in 2018.\u00a0 So Why do you want to support me? Why Do I need your support? Every little bit goes into making more content. It will help me provide better quality material, and ultimately more music for us to jam to or relate to whether I\u0027m in Nashville or abroad. So if you like what I do, and you want to be apart of the inside scoop of what\u0027s going on, go right on ahead and join me in this Patreon journey :) \u003cbr\u003e~All my love, Morgan."
