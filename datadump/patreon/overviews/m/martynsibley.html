    "summary": "I for Inclusion has one clear aim - to make sure our society is fully\u003cstrong\u003e inclusive of all disabled people\u003c/strong\u003e, no matter who they are, where they\u0027re from or what their circumstances are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you remember being a teenager? It\u0027s hard to forget those days right? Or maybe you just blocked it all out? The low self esteem. The peer pressure. The trying to fit in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all craved acceptance and inclusion...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy teenage years\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was growing up, I had the additional factor of being disabled to deal with. Don\u0027t worry, I don\u0027t do sob stories! Unfortunately though, when I was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy at 18 months, the medical profession did. My parents were told bleak things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I grew older, medical treatments did improve. With antibiotics, cough machines, spinal fusion surgery and so forth (I didn\u2019t say they were pleasant!) us SMA-ers did far better health wise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI went on to mainstream school. Though the local secondary school wasn\u0027t accessible, so I had to travel further away each day. My family and friends were very supportive. I had great health, education, and social care professionals around me. I used lots of assistive technology (my electric wheelchair is still my everything). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy parents did all the fighting for this. I had to learn that skill later on in life. Still, I remember the teenage angst alongside needing so much personal care support (not easy for mum and dad either I imagine). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was hard not always being able to conform to the peer pressure. I remember one time slamming shut my bedroom door, to have to then call out for help to open it again (kinda funny). When out socialising it took a lot of transport planning, and a reliance on someone to help me wee. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere was was definitely a feeling of not fitting in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Bigger and Ongoing Issues\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnwards to this day. It is said 13 million people have a disability or long term health condition in the UK alone. The advances in medical treatments are giving people longer and better lives. They are not eradicating disability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhilst this is great news, there\u0027s still a few problems to overcome! For example:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Disabled people (and indeed many other marginalised groups) are currently facing huge government cuts, a declining quality in vital public services, and a general feeling from the media that we\u0027re a burden.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Despite the accessibility improvements over recent decades to housing, transport, education, employment (leading to financial independence), leisure pursuits, and social inclusion - statistics still show how far behind disabled people are when compared to their non disabled peers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Solution\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027I for Inclusion\u0027 believes in one simple premise. Every person has a passion and purpose in life. It is the responsibility of a modern society to include everybody. We should all participate and contribute in our communities. With no exceptions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor businesses the widely known concept of the \u0027purple pound\u0027 has helped promote this solution. Apparently the spending power of disabled households is \u00a3249bn! Therefore accessible products and services, coupled with disabled employees, is very attractive for corporations to benefit from.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to ignore the political power of 13m disabled voters. Giving strong economic and political reasons for inclusion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLets not forget either how disability could touch anyone at any time. So it makes sense to back inclusion, if only for selfish reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Progress\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was that scared teenager, I wished for positive role models. To have seen someone like me, older and achieving, would have helped so much. To learn about accessing government funding, managing carers, using assistive technology, researching accessible places, and other relevant knowledge...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would have meant the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Blog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo in 2009 I started my blog, \u003ca href=\"http://www.martynsibley.com\"\u003ewww.martynsibley.com\u003c/a\u003e, and social media outreach. Using words, pictures and videos; I told my personal story. The stories of going to university, living in London, travelling the world, running my own business, learning to drive, managing carers, and generally staying healthy. Also the stories of ill health, independent living stresses, career hurdles, inaccessible holidays, and all of the other low moments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result I\u0027ve had 100,000 web visitors, attracted thousands of social media followers, daily engagement on email, and lots of great fun. I\u0027ve been invited on BBC breakfast, written for national newspapers (regularly contributing to the \u003ca href=\"http://m.huffpost.com/uk/author/martyn-sibley\"\u003eHuffington Post\u003c/a\u003e), and presented tv shows. I\u0027m now a published author with my travel memoir \u0027\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Everything-Possible-Martyn-Sibley/dp/1326569678\"\u003eEverything is Possible\u003c/a\u003e\u0027. Plus I\u0027m \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/episode-3-tony-heaton-arty-activist/id1215083044?i=1000382577617\u0026amp;mt=2\"\u003epodcasting with interviews of awesome influential disabled people\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGovernments, businesses and charities have asked me for inclusion advice. I\u0027m an associate of Open Inclusion and We Are Purple (who work with big brands). I sit on steering groups for health, housing, transport, tourism and beyond. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result I was voted Britains third most influential disabled person in the \u0027\u003ca href=\"https://www.shaw-trust.org.uk/en-GB/Media-policy/News/December-2016/The-launch-of-the-Power-100-LIST-2017\"\u003edisability Power 100\u003c/a\u003e\u0027 list.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisability Horizons \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a holiday from my London day job (pre self-employment), my SMA buddy Srin and I roadtripped around California and Las Vegas. During that fateful trip we sat on the beach in Los Angeles and dreamt up a disability lifestyle magazine. It\u0027d be like my blog, but from other disabled people, with different impairments, and different experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn April 2011 we launched \u003ca href=\"http://www.disabilityhorizons.com\"\u003eDisability Horizons\u003c/a\u003e. We wrote some articles in the beginning. We begged friends to write. We begged people to read it. We begged and we borrowed and we blagged. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDisability Horizons has had over 500,000 web visitors worldwide. We have 20,000 followers on twitter alone. The magazine shares positive stories. Showcasing how life looks when independence and inclusion are in place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been featured in the Guardian and on the BBC. Through our specialism of independence and inclusion, we\u0027ve connected our community with governments, businesses, and charities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re also supporting other disabled people to run Disability Horizons in other languages and countries. It\u0027s currently in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Arabic. Raya, editor of \u003ca href=\"http://disabilityhorizons.ae\"\u003ehttp://disabilityhorizons.ae\u003c/a\u003e, is seeing amazing growth and media attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt present I\u0027m the CEO of Disability Horizons. Srin is the CEO of another project we Co Founded together called \u003ca href=\"http://www.accomable.com\"\u003eAccomable\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s been a great journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisability United \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince launching Disability Horizons, the world hasn\u0027t been quite so rosy for disabled people. The United Nations are investigating the UK government for breaching the \u0027UN convention for the rights of people with disabilities\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn June 2016 I decided we had to act. So we launched a campaigning website called \u003ca href=\"http://www.disabilityunited.co.uk\"\u003eDisability United\u003c/a\u003e. Our articles and social media presence raise awareness of injustice and promote fairness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first research project uncovered that many CCG\u0027s (Clinical Commissioning Groups) would consider putting disabled people into care homes. Talk about going back 60 years. Our article hit the national media and was referenced in the shadow report to the UN. A few CCGs have subsequently changed their policies already :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur editor is now on the Independent Living Strategy Group, chaired by Baroness Jane Campbell. So we\u0027re right in the thick of the political battle. Plus we collaborate heavily with our fellow disability organisations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSynergy trumps rivalry, every time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Need Your Support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe above projects receive no core funding. Each have technological, labour, and other costs. I cover the financial overheads from my consulting revenues. We\u0027re very fortunate to have dedicated volunteers too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom starting with nothing, growing our impact hugely, and arriving in a position of massive influence - it\u0027s time to go to the next level!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a lot at stake for disabled people at the moment. Through our hubs of knowledge, our social media influence, our support networks, and our strategic partnerships; we now need you, our Inclusion Patrons, to support our plans.\u003cbr\u003e"
