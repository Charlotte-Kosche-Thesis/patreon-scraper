    "summary": "hi! i\u0027m horizon rose, and i\u0027m a writer and singer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei\u0027ve been writing since i was really little, and singing since i was even younger! my family\u0027s always been very musical, and i was in theatre for years and years, which built up my skills. now i am, if i don\u0027t say so myself, extremely good at it. not to brag or anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eas a singer, i\u0027m very much into slower songs that can easily be played on the guitar or piano, because they\u0027re really nice to listen to in my opinion and i like sharing them with people. some of my favorite artists to play include fall out boy, regina spektor, bastille, and the mountain goats. i also write my own music! check out my album, \u003ca href=\"https://misshorizonrose.bandcamp.com\"\u003etunes from the psych ward\u003c/a\u003e, over at my bandcamp.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eas a writer, i love all kinds of genres. i tend to be mostly into sci-fi/fantasy, written mostly for young adult audiences -- not YA novels, but actual young adults, about 18-24-year-olds, accessible to people as young as about 16. i also strive to bring diversity into my writing by writing characters like me, whether that means nonwhite characters, mixed characters, characters with bipolar and adhd and psychosis, lesbian characters, nonbinary characters, or a cacophonous mix of them all. there\u0027s not a lot of media where characters like that can exist and not be either demonized or fetishized, and it\u0027s my goal to provide characters that marginalized people can identify with and feel happy about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewith this patreon, i\u0027m hoping to be able to bring people a little bit of each of these things. every month, i publish an \"acoustic dump\" and a document dump (see $2 tier for more info), and then i also release full covers, or covers with an actual backing instrumental track, whenever they\u0027re completed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eplease check the tiers over on the side to see what cool extra perks you can get with them. pledges start as low as $2/mo, which on mcdonald\u0027s revamped dollar menu gets you....... two buttermilk chicken tenders. which, while delicious, is not as cool as Cool Music And Writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003enot to brag or anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei appreciate the many people who have gotten me to this point. i wouldn\u0027t be here without you. thanks for reading this and considering pledging to my patreon! i love you all."
