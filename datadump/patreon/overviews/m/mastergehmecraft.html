    "summary": "I am a 40 something Canadian that is married to an amazing woman that has worked with me to create 4 little mutant versions of us: boy, girl, boy, boy. My oldest has Autism, my second youngest has ADHD \u0026amp; our daughter has her own lovely unique quirkiness. In November 2016, I was also diagnosed as being High Functioning Autistic, so who knows what our 2 year old will be like, but I\u2019d be surprised if he ended up being \u201cneurotypical\u201d. All in all, we are one helluva quirky family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo many people, I wouldn\u0027t fit their image of an autistic person. However, most people\u0027s knowledge about autism comes from the news \u0026amp; the movie \u201cRain Man\u201d. The truth is, it is a very wide spectrum that encompasses Rain Man, Einstein, \u0026amp; the non-verbal child that flaps their hands in the air. A lot of the reason I wouldn\u2019t \u201cappear autistic\u201d though, is that I have developed many coping mechanisms over my life to mitigate my autistic traits (even though I didn\u2019t know I was doing this).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u2019t think I had autism either, that was until 2016 came by. In January 2016 I ended up being one of many casualties of the oil \u0026amp; gas industry turndown in Alberta; in other words, I lost my job. I was never really happy in my job, even though I was pretty good at it, I just had Golden Handcuffs on. They paid me ridiculous amounts of money for a guy without secondary education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese Golden Handcuffs being broken for me ended up being the first of many personally hardships of 2016 (I don\u0027t mean celebrity deaths, although I am happy Betty White managed to survive 2016). No, I mean things like my mom dying on Mothers Day, having to sell my house \u0026amp; move my family of 6 into an RV, having my first major car accident, \u0026amp; finally moving my dad into a long term care facility due to poor health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this stress meant that all those wonderful coping mechanisms I had spent a lifetime building, began crumbling like a grasshut in a hurricane. I started \u201closing my words\u201d when talking to people. I could write fine, I just started finding myself unable to express myself verbally when in acute moments of stress. I started getting overwhelmed easier \u0026amp; withdrawing more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to my amazing wife, I was given an opportunity to have more free time than I\u2019d had since I started Kindergarten. So I started writing up a new D\u0026amp;D campaign setting \u0026amp; playing D\u0026amp;D for the first time in years. This let me hyper focus on my special interest in a way I had never been able to. Even in High School, I still had to do enough school work to pass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was\u2026happy. When focused on creating and writing, my worries disappear \u0026amp; I\u2019m not thinking about six things at once. It\u0027s basically a form of meditation. To focus on D\u0026amp;D, on something I\u0027m truly passionate about, was a completely alien experience to me. The idea of possibly supporting my family with this passion and happiness is one of those wild dreams that the people you love warn you could leave you destitute. However, between sales of my products and the support from my amazing Patrons, I have hope it may someday become a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to design professional level fantasy maps, campaign worlds, adventurers and other supplements for roleplaying games. Dungeons and Dragon\u0027s is my main forte, but I hope to expand into other genre\u0027s as well. I\u0027ll be posting samples of my work here on Patreon as well as on my Webpage. You can purchase my products and find other amazing Third Party products at \u003ca href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fdmsguild.com%2F\u0026amp;h=ATMRl_BOzbtLFDjfxFXNaCG7ZznqADYZ2fNUqx8aV-MXyxcY2dy6AGZIp8DoZP90ZwH0o4FQaiAA_9gwuXk8BSygGqXc5Cg2fNzQS5pGy__-ybnIz2XWM8vCInUgHC7J-FO1qoDxbKFFuk_zNl4\u0026amp;enc=AZPepleNoG4cblZYFntS_dwb5STf3cuzLLcsSL269Hz2oaaO2CcSMPshrX1ENprVjF8boU9jfW0rlVGsetTrpcvCfWC5e_CjkvHYZflM7UjYD21smTwuT6FLxWojmHygGguV791yQNqBQBHQaodtoVb1tuAQBcDMVX2kNyzYmNNntBVujcUk77dCZttx11WMGGg\u0026amp;s=1\"\u003edmsguild.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond the selfish goal of finding happiness \u0026amp; freedom, it will also mean seeing my family more and being able to support my wife at home instead of abandoning her for 12-13 hours a day to head off to a job I hate, leaving her to deal with 4 kids, 2 or more with special needs.\u003cbr\u003eJust by taking the time to read this far you have done me a great service. If you are not in a position to donate at this time, you could help by spreading the word to your friends \u0026amp; family, especially if you know someone that in interested in Roleplaying games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny support I receive is appreciated beyond words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you from the bottom of my heart.\u003cbr\u003e"

I am also hoping to sell products as well, with the hope that someday, I won\u0027t need to rely on the good will of others and even pay their support forward be becoming a patreon to others.\u003cbr\u003e",
