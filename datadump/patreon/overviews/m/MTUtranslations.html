    "summary": "Hello, I am known as mayaktheunholy on a few forums.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI have been getting into translating Japanese hentai games into English in recent months and have found it to be enjoyable and rewarding. I already have several partials done and am nearly finished with my first full translation. All of these you can find at my blog \u003ca href=\"https://mayaktheunholy.blogspot.com/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. And I fully intend to keep doing this, already have a second full project lined up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy translations could be more accurately described as localizations. These are not copy-pasted machine translations, no broken \"Engrish\" here. My goal is to translate into coherent English for Western audiences. Keep in mind that sometimes one has to sacrifice some accuracy to achieve this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also try to fix any bugs the original creator may have missed. I know my way around the various different versions of RPGmaker well enough to achieve this. RPGmaker games are what I am working with at this time, but I would not be opposed to working with other engines if the tools are available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will not be set up as any kind of paywall with rewards and goals. This is simply a tip jar for those who like my work and want to contribute something. I\u0027ve set it up monthly for now as that is more predictable for those who want to donate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also find me on the ulmf translator\u0027s Discord most days.\u003cbr\u003e"
