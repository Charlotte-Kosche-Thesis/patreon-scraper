    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHello, and welcome to my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Charlie. Like a lot of writers, I\u0027ve been writing stories for as long as I can remember. Growing up as a shy, awkward child in a small town, I gravitated towards writing as a hobby. I found that writing allowed me to escape into worlds that I could shape to my own liking and fill with characters who were braver and stronger and safer than I was.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past few years, however, my writing has taken on a bit of a mission. Almost four years ago, I came out as non-binary after struggling with my gender identity for years. Almost three years ago, I came out as aromantic and asexual after struggling with my sexual orientation for years as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eErasure, dismissal, and negative stereotypes are still a big problem for the lesser-known parts of the LGBTQIAP+ community. I believe that representation matters, and I write stories so that I can see myself in fiction, and maybe help others like me find themselves as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to write stories that go beyond the typical coming-out or contemporary tales. I plan to write dystopian thrillers and superhero stories and sci-fi epics. I want to write so that queer people can see themselves in as many different stories as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother thing I want to do with my writing is to make it safe for sex and romance-repulsed people to read. As a person who is both sex and romance-repulsed to varying degrees, it can be incredibly difficult to find media to enjoy. I want my writing to be a safe bet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to turn 2018 into the year of working hard and accomplishing my goals, and I hope you will consider supporting me on this journey. Thank you so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to support me without committing to a monthly pledge, you can toss me a couple bucks at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ko-fi.com/charliekryszak\"\u003eKo-Fi\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCharlie (they/them)\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
