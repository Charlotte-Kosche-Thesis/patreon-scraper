    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Mike Liguori. I am a former Marine turned author/writer...blah blah blah.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod, that didn\u0027t feel right. That totally didn\u0027t feel like me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eOk, let me try this again.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon simply to tell stories, write more books and share my writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is one of the most therapeutic things I have ever done in my life. I need it to survive as a human being. In 2007, I needed it more than anything because one Fall day, I had a mental breakdown in the middle of my college campus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn front of my friends. In front of my colleagues. \u003cbr\u003eEvery single person saw me crying, freaking out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey had no idea why. I had no idea why. I didn\u0027t even know what the hell a mental breakdown was until my hands were shaking uncontrollably, my brain felt like it was on fire, my heart was beating so fast I sure as hell thought that I was going to die of some massive heart attack.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I drove home, back to my mom\u0027s house where I was living after four years in the Marines and two tours in Iraq, sat in the dark with no idea of what was I to do next. I stopped going to class. I refused to return calls or texts. I didn\u0027t tell my parents what happened. I kept it to myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, thirty days later, I decided that I need to talk to someone at the local VA. Maybe they knew what was happening. After 3 hours filled with paperwork and doctors asking me more questions than I knew the answers to, I was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, otherwise known as PTSD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat day was when life began for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always been a writer. It\u0027s in my blood. My third cousin who I never met wrote the book Cool Hand Luke which was later turned into a movie featuring Paul Newman. He passed away earlier this year, and I wished I would have asked him all the things he knew about writing. When the VA told me I had to wait 90 days to talk to someone, I remembered what my mom said to me about writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Maybe you should start writing about the war.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first day I started out with a paragraph about the war. I shut off my computer and went to watch an episode of Price is Right since it was the middle of the day and I had no job nonetheless a class schedule to adhere to. The moment I sat down, I felt a pull toward sitting back in front of my computer. It was stronger than a tractor beam from Star Wars, stronger than anything in my life. I turned off the TV and went back over to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rest is history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2011, I wrote a book called The Sandbox Stories of Human Spirit and War\u003cbr\u003e(\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s the link:http://amzn.to/2nW9NKc\u003c/strong\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s one of my greatest accomplishments, sharing my story of war and coming home from it. I shared it on national stages. I shared it on national media. I shared with people I knew and people I didn\u0027t know. The book led me to be a Huffington Post Contributor. It led me to jobs, to helping others and writing all over the internet including on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@mikeliguori\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMedium\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eand recently, Thought Catalog. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, I\u0027m working on a second book, a novel about a man named Woods who finds himself in a war zone looking to make sense of the Marines and the people in it. Woods tells the reader through short stories the other side of war; what happens when you don\u0027t get shot at and coming home to a world that is now foreign. I\u0027m finishing it this summer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m on Patreon with the goal of creating more stories and poems, write more books and share with you all my work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e WHAT I WILL USE THE MONEY FOR\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may be asking why only $2 a month?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause asking you for anything more than that would be greedy on my part.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI give a lot of my content and stories away in hopes of helping people. I write on a couple of different sites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still want to do that. I am going to do it. However, I want to do it all the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work a full-time job. I love the job, I love the company, but it is not where my heart is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy heart, my drive, my being is in writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to travel the world and collect more stories to share with you. I want to write from everywhere, telling you where I am and what I have learned. I want to use a portion of the money to give back to writing programs in schools where budget cuts impact arts programs. I want to use a portion to help people use writing as a tool to deal with their challenges and struggles in life so they can make sense of it all and overcome it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$2 a month will help me get to my goal.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLAST BUT NOT LEAST, THANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you for reading my story and purpose. It means a lot to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decided to become a Patron, thank you for your contribution, and I cannot wait to send my first story to you and have you be a part of what I am doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you did not decide to become a Patron, thank you for taking time out of your day to read about me. It means a lot, and I hope you will continue to make art, write that book you always wanted, and continue to be the best version of yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSincerely Grateful, \u003cbr\u003eMike\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
