It is your support that makes my work possible and you have been and continue to be an integral part of my own personal development. I am so grateful for the trust placed in me with such a crucial part of your human experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Nona, an intuitive/clairvoyant Woman of Color. All of my life, I have operated with the knowledge of my gifts, but within the last 4 years I have fully immersed myself in study of my gifts for personal mastery. Along this path, I have been called to extend that work beyond personal development to others who are also seeking to develop themselves and to use that development to heal from the various traumas incurred on this physical plane. Furthermore, I am committed to collectivizing efforts as more of us seek to get to the truth of who we are for the expansion of the human consciousness. Anyone who has worked with me or shared space with me can attest to the powerful, personal transformation and safety that is always readily available to anyone in my energetic space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am constantly creating content and communicating messaging that is healing, beneficial and impactful for so many people. However, time spent creating on a micro-level is preventing me from fully actualizing my vision. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is that vision?\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy vision is to create safe spaces and healing services at minimal out-of-pocket cost to those seeking healing services and to provide them with the resources needed to restore themselves and others and to provide support on an ongoing basis to patrons/clients.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is my patronage supporting?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage keeps you in constant contact with me and with any content I create.

     "about": "Miss Nona is a clairvoyant intuitive coach who has always identified with the magic within her. A descendent from a line of women who have lived fully between both worlds (spiritual \u0026amp; physical), she has come to find purpose \u0026amp; passion in using her intuitive \u0026amp; clairvoyant gifts coupled with her personal spirituality \u0026amp; life experiences to positively impact the lives of others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuite non-traditional in her views \u0026amp; approaches to spirituality \u0026amp; esoteric knowledge, she is extremely quick-witted \u0026amp; not apt to be dissuaded by appearances, yet guides \u0026amp; instructs with the utmost love \u0026amp; compassion. As her knowledge and awareness of Spirit expands, her gifts continue to grow as she shares every aspect of the truth of who she is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe focus of her work is spiritual \u0026amp; emotional liberation \u0026amp; the discovery of who you are \u0026amp; what your life\u0027s work is. Through the occasional use of divination tools, but primarily from the seat of her clairvoyant \u0026amp; intuitive abilities, she is able to provide the clarity \u0026amp; guidance many seek. She seeks to use her work to help marginalized populations, specifically Women of Color \u0026amp; the LGBTQIA community achieve the healing necessary to operate \u0026amp; navigate oppressive systems that wish to keep them restrained socially \u0026amp; spiritually by discovering the truth of who they are via the forging of a direct, personal relationship with God/Spirit/Source/Universe as the gateway to achieving mastery of \u0026amp; knowledge of their true Self. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince beginning living in her purpose, Nona has gone on to expand her work to include more intensive spiritual life coaching \u0026amp; consulting with the specified objective of helping her clients develop their own intuitive abilities beyond their expectations. Additionally, she has coordinated \u0026amp; created safe, successful retreat healing spaces for Black women that have been met with much appreciation \u0026amp; rave reviews. \u003cbr\u003e",
