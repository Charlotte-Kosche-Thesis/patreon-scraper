I\u0027d like to do a\nquick introduction about what Patreon means for both of us, and for\nmy channel. Patreon is a place for awesome followers to help support\nme as I continue to bring new ideas to the table and create a great\nffxiv community. If you\u0027re on board with that, then please keep\nreading for more information, and also make sure to read up on all\nthe cool rewards! \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GMCeGvq.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you familiar\nwith my channel on \u003cstrong\u003eYouTube\u003c/strong\u003e? Do you attend my \u003cstrong\u003eevents\u003c/strong\u003e? How about using\nmy guides to \u003cstrong\u003emake more gil\u003c/strong\u003e or reserve tickets to the \u003cstrong\u003eEorzea cafe\u003c/strong\u003e?\nThese things make me so, \u003cstrong\u003eso\u003c/strong\u003e happy to do, but they are very\ntime consuming! It is rewarding that you guys are such an active\ncommunity and I am constantly thankful for the sweet comments and\nsupport you show me. For those who are willing to go the extra mile\nto help out, Patreon is like the next step. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LY9PgLV.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s really\ncool about Patreon is that it\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003einteractive\u003c/strong\u003e! I can talk with you\nguys in a way that\u0027s so much more personal than over Twitter or\nYoutube. Patrons get access to my private discord, which is \u003cstrong\u003eonly\u003c/strong\u003e\nfor them and my video co-hosts. Through that discord and my Patreon\nnews feed, you guys can check out behind the scenes pictures and\nupdates about my daily life. Supporters also get \u003cstrong\u003ecool rewards, like\nraffle tickets, private streams, and even handwritten mail\u003c/strong\u003e! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bWUuRtT.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I\nwant to stress that my current videos and content will continue to be\n\u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e and available across multiple platforms for the entire\ncommunity to enjoy. I\u0027ve made so many lasting friendships through\nplaying ffxiv that I really just want to help all of you do the\nsame. Please enjoy reading through my Patreon page, and I hope to see\nyour name in my discord soon! :)\u003cbr\u003e"
