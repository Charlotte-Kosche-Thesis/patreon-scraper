    "summary": "Our mission is to support moms interested in learning how to code. And while there are a lot of great technical resources out there, there\u2019s not a lot on the history of women in tech, the history of computers, or how algorithms work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you already work in tech or tech is something that interests you, we think you\u2019ll find tons of useful information in our Moms Can: Code courses. Courses include stories about pioneers in tech (Dame Stephanie Shirley), videos on how things work (How does a router work?), quizzes, and suggested projects for sharing your newfound knowledge about the world of  tech. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Erica Peterson, Founder \u0026amp; CEO of Moms Can: Code. I\u2019m a mom, entrepreneur, and I\u2019m learning how to code. I love learning, science, technology, and I\u2019m very passionate about introducing children and women to STEM.  I can\u2019t wait to share what I learn with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to know who Grace Hopper is? Want to know when the first personal computer was invented? How about the best way to introduce your children to coding? We\u2019ll answer these and more. We\u2019ll help you become more knowledgeable about coding and the tech world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf these sound like a course you\u2019d be interested in taking, please support us via this Patreon page! Whether it\u0027s $10 or $100, we\u0027re grateful for your contribution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur sincere thanks,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eErica Peterson\u003cbr\u003eFounder \u0026amp; CEO\u003cbr\u003eMoms Can: Code\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.momscancode.com\"\u003ewww.momscancode.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
