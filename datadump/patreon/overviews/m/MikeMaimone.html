I\u0027ve put out 5 albums and 6 EPs since 2008, so I guess I technically run a tiny record label, too.

The debt continues to grow, and many songs and videos aren\u0027t getting made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, with the abundance of music out there now, why conform to an archaic model, spending thousands of dollars all at once producing and promoting one batch of songs - with no guarantee it\u0027ll actually reach anyone?

I\u0027ll post special stuff every month for my Patrons, starting with a full concert recording from Mutts\u0027 House of Blues show this Summer! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*UPDATE* I just started my covers series - 100% legit getting all the licenses I need to post a cover track every month, in addition to the other original content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eWHAT WILL I GET FROM PATREON?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eYour monthly pledge will help me keep food on the table and a roof over my head while writing and recording music and producing videos.

     "about": "Mutts frontman Mike Maimone \u201cgoes from zero to a hundred quicker than most,\u201d according to Daytrotter. Choose Chicago says, \u201cHe plays the piano with his feet. He swills whiskey between songs. He shouts and howls. He is an unstoppable music force.\u201d Vern Hester of the Windy City Times adds, \u201cThe man has the keyboard style of Fats Waller and Jerry Lee Lewis combined, and a vocal style that clearly recalls Tom Waits and Warren Zevon.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaimone is endorsed by Nord keyboards and will play at their NAMM exhibition in 2018. He has averaged over 100 tour dates each year since 2007, primarily with his band Mutts and as a solo artist, as well as on keyboards for Company of Thieves and Los Colognes. He has opened for Imagine Dragons, Weezer, OK Go, Blues Traveler, and The Hold Steady among others, played Lollapalooza, Sasquatch, Riot Fest, Last Call with Carson Daly, and at notable venues across the country, from The Fillmore in San Francisco, to Emo\u2019s in Austin, to the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaimone released his solo debut LP Open Mic Nights, Empty Bottle Mornings in 2008. Going on to form Mutts with bassist Bob Buckstaff in 2009, Maimone has subsequently written and self-released 4 more albums and 4 EPs. In 2017 Mutts were named to WXRT\u2019s Local Anesthetic Best-of list for the second time. The most recent LP from Mutts, Fuel Yer Delusion vol. 4, is their fourth consecutive album to chart on the CMJ Top 200. More Mutts music is on the way in 2018, as well as a follow-up Mike Maimone solo release featuring his new brass band.\u003cbr\u003e",
