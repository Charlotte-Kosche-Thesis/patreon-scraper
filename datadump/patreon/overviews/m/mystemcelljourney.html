    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWhy Am I On Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\nHello my name is Earl Stringer and about 6 months ago I took place in a clinical trial study in South Florida to hopefully help treat my vision. you see I was born with a condition called optic atrophy. It is when the blood flow from your eye is not all getting to the brain. This in most cases causes sever vision loss. I am now legally blind and have been on a mission to improve my vision.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter years and years of researching different treatments nothing really seemed like it could help my condition until 2013. This is the year I discovered SCOTS (Stem Cell Ophthalmology Treatment Study). I got stem cells that were taken from my own bone marrow injected into both of my eyes in hopes of improving my sight. Shortly having this procedure done I decided to document my experience with this procedure. I thought it would be interesting and informative to share what it was like for me to have this done figuring that it might give someone else an idea of what they might expect if they or someone they know decide to have this procedure done. So I started my YouTube Channel \"My Stem Cell Journey\".\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhere Does The Money Go?\u003c/h3\u003e\nIt\u0027s very simple. Getting this procedure done cost a lot of money. It cost $21,600 which is a lot to me. I had to take out a personal loan to be able to get this done which leaves me with a pretty nice sized monthly bill that I can\u0027t wait to pay off!! Your support will greatly help me pay this debt off a lot quicker which will help in so many different ways. It will also enable me to be able to create a lot more video content for those who are curious about what\u0027s going on with stem cell treatments and other treatments for helping many different eye conditions, not just mine!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards When You Contribute?\u003c/h3\u003e\nAs of way of saying thanks I would like to offer you some rewards! When you pledge $1 a month you will receive early access to all of my videos. You will be one of the very first ones to see my videos even before they hit YouTube. You will also be able to participate in polls exclusively on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you pledge $5 a month you will get the same benefits as the $1 pledge plus a nice little bonus. You will be invited to take place in a live Google Hangout that will be held once a month. In this hangout I will talk about what\u0027s going on with my vision and share anything else that I\u0027ve found out about current or upcoming treatment for a variety of eye disorders.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e"
