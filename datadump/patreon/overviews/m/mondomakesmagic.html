    "summary": "Hi gang,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life is all about creating adventures that only exist temporarily. A handful of performances...a few weekends of gaming....a cosplay event...you name it! I have been creating and running conventions and events since 1999. Additionally, I have produced theatrical events (musicals, revues, and murder mystery shows) since 1996.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat funding from Patreon patrons will allow me to do is to continue creating and running these kinds of events (throughout California) for years to come. The money would go to help support the efforts involved in the planning, recruiting, scouting locations, negotiating contracts, finding vendors, marketing, creating content, finding and training staff, scheduling, and so much more, that goes into each and every event I create.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a way of saying thanks to anyone moved to contribute, I have thought up some things from both my theatrical and convention worlds that you can choose from. I also run a fun session of Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, and have included that in the thank you gifts as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me thank you in advance for the absolute pleasure it is to get to be the one who creates these kinds of events for you all. I love all the aspects that go into each and every one of these events, but the best part of all, is getting to watch all of you, the gamers and audience members, laugh and smile, and create memories that last a lifetime. Thank you so very much for your consideration.\u00a0"
