    "summary": "Since 2008, my life is all about \u003cstrong\u003emicrotonal guitar\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ve created 170 youtube videos, 4 CD\u0027s, 2 books, gave concerts and seminars in 32 countries, and have had 34 composers write pieces for the microtonal guitar. I hope to continue like this for the rest of my life. \u003cstrong\u003eThis is my goal\u003c/strong\u003e, this is what makes me happy, I can\u0027t stop myself working on it every day for hours - at 39 years old, I know myself well, and I am sure about this. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why do I need your SUPPORT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0With your support, I can realize my big projects and dreams more quickly and I can be even more productive. I have a list of things to accomplish in the next 30 years (if destiny allows :) - with your support I can do all of the below in the next ten years. Meaning that after the first ten years, I can dream up even more goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApart from this,\u00a0I spend a lot of money to produce my own video clips. If you want a good video, you have to pay for a professional clip. But this is not enough. You publish your video and few people watch it. Facebook doesn\u0027t show it even to your friends unless you promote it. Therefore, I spend money to promote my videos because I want people to watch my videos that I worked hard to make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my music and my videos, you can support me with one dollar or more per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are my big goals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003cstrong\u003eCommissioning pieces\u003c/strong\u003e from the greatest composers for microtonal guitar. I\u0027ve learned this from Andres Segovia, so I have to do it! Imagine Arvo Part or Krzysztof Penderecki writing for this new instrument (I guess I am exaggerating much :). There are already great guitarist-composers such as Dusan Bogdanovic, Andrew York, Roland Dyens, Sergio Assad, Carlo Domeniconi and many others who know me (and my guitar), and may be willing to work on a commission. Your\u003cstrong\u003e support\u003c/strong\u003e is crucial for this goal. With each $3000, I can approach one composer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003cstrong\u003eDVD+Method: \u003c/strong\u003eAt the moment, I am writing a method entitled \"Introduction to Microtonal Guitar.\" Besides, It\u0027s always a dream to have a DVD, summarizing everything I\u0027ve done from 2009 to 2015. If I have your \u003cstrong\u003esupport\u003c/strong\u003e, I can publish the DVD and the method professionally and without having difficulty financially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) \u003cstrong\u003eDecreasing the cost of Microtonal Guitar and make it available for everyone\u003c/strong\u003e: I hate business but I\u0027ve been receiving mails since 2009 requesting microtonal guitars - almost 300 guitarists have asked for one, but I haven\u0027t been able to sell a single one.  Why? Because of the high price. I need to hire a team who can research production methods, create an economic model, and sell it to the guitar world. With your \u003cstrong\u003eSUPPORT\u003c/strong\u003e, I can form a company to achieve this aim.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4) \u003cstrong\u003eAutomatic Microtonal Guitar: \u003c/strong\u003eImagine a guitar with frets moving automatically along the fretboard. You press a button and here we go: you can play a Turkish microtonal folk music. Then press again and the frets move to new locations, this time playing a Bach piece in Werckmeister tuning. What about an Indian Raga piece up next! Your \u003cstrong\u003eSUPPORT \u003c/strong\u003eis very important for this goal to help me buy the equipment I\u0027ll need to create this new instrument.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5) \u003cstrong\u003eFoundation of a \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMicrotonal Guitar Research Center: \u003c/strong\u003eThis one will have to wait for the other ones to be finished. But my ultimate dream is founding a research center at a University at the Masters or PhD level. It will have sub-divisions such as \"Just Intonation Guitar Music\", \"Microtonal Folk Music of Turkey/India/Bali/Egypt/other countries\", \"Renaissance and Baroque Tunings\" etc. We will be a factory of microtonal guitar music. :) Composers and arrangers will write for us, and my students and I will play and record. I don\u0027t think we can achieve this quite yet, but I wanted you to see just how far things could possibly go.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I was born in Ankara-Turkey in 1978. I\u0027ve been playing classical guitar for 23 years. In 2008, my life has changed drastically due to an invention. I designed the \u0027Adjustable Microtonal Guitar\u0027 during my PhD. All the frets on this guitar\u0027s fretboards are movable and you can insert and remove any frets you want into/from the fretboard. First of all, this design enables me to play the traditional music of Turkey which is microtonal and it is not possible to play these microtones (tones less than a half tone) on the regular guitar. After a while I recognized that I can also play other microtonal folk music in the World such as Indian, Balinese, Viatnemese, Breton music. In addition to this, I can play Renaissance and Baroque tunings, just intonation, Pythagorean tuning, quartertone music and any contemporary music that includes microtones. Since 2008, more than 30 composers have written pieces for me. I\u0027ve visited 28 countries with my guitar and I received the 1st prize among 85 new instruments at the prestigious Margaret Guthman Musical Instrument Competition at Georgia Tech in 2014. At the moment, I am working as an Associate Professor at Istanbul Technical University, Turkish Music State Conservatory and Center for Advanced Studies in Music.",
