    "summary": "Hello, I\u2019m Mollycoddles, a long-time writer of BBW weight gain stories.\nI\u2019m probably best known for a long-running story that I affectionately \nrefer to\nas The Alice Saga. It\u0027s been over a decade since I first started writing\n weight\ngain fiction and posting my stories on the web. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I started writing, I\u0027d been reading WG fiction for\nyears, but too often I found it disappointing. It seemed like there weren\u0027t\nmany people who were writing the very specific kind of WG stories that I found\nmost appealing. While there are plenty of other talented writers in this genre,\nI try my best to make my WG fiction stand out. To me, WG fiction is boring and\nflat if it doesn\u2019t include interesting, well-developed characters and vivid\ndescriptions.When I write, I don\u2019t\nwaste time \u2013 I want every sentence to either develop the characters or advance\nthe plot. But, even moreso, I want EVERY line to ooze excitement. I take my\nwriting very seriously in this regard, and with every story that I write I hope\nto top the one that came before.WG\nfiction tends to repeat the same set pieces over and over \u2013 lots of repetitive\neating contests and clothes fitting room scenes. I like those classic scenarios\n\u2013 and I\u2019ve written my share \u2013 but I also try to put in new details that haven\u2019t\nbeen done in a lot of WG writing, exciting new ways to show off a character\u2019s\nadvancing size that haven\u2019t been done before. In short, I try my best to make\nWG fiction into a real art! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve always\nhad a blast writing these stories, but it\u0027s also been a lot of hard work. It\nfeels funny to describe this hobby as \"hard work,\" but each story\ntakes lot of time and effort to plan and write.If it weren\u0027t for the love and support of readers, I would have given up\nlong ago. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve been unable to write much lately because I\u2019ve had\nto focus my attention on more lucrative ventures.If I could monetize my writing \u2013 even just a\nlittle \u2013 it would help justify putting renewed efforts into continuing writing.\nJust a few dollars would help me out immensely and help ensure that I can\ncontinue writing the sorts of fiction that you\u2019ve enjoyed in the past!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the way, if you\u0027re worried about spending too much money, remember that you can set limits to your sponsorship, so that you\u0027ll never spend more than you\u0027re willing. If you want to make sure that you never spend more than $1/month, you can set your sponsorship settings to make sure that doesn\u0027t happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot sure if my writing is for you?
