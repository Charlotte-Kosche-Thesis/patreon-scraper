I\u0027ve been a YouTuber and\u00a0online\u00a0critic for a number of years now. \u00a0 I\u0027m a pretty big geek and I really enjoy connecting with others by discussing the things I love.\u00a0 My channel focuses primarily\u00a0on in-depth analysis of anime characters and their respective series/films.\u00a0 I also dabble in the occasional discussion of things like superheroes, Star Wars or Trek.\u00a0 I review both\u00a0 new and old films and hold weekly podcasts discussing all of kinds of topics from the rather interesting to the surprisingly silly.\u00a0 I\u0027d love for this to be a part-time or even a full-time jobs someday. For that to happen, I need to produce the best videos I can. Each tier will be answered with a unque reward. New funds will go to equipment for the channel.\u00a0 Anything extra will go to props and stuff for little movies I\u0027ve made. My next project is a documentary of sorts and I\u0027m working on a script for a new horror film."

I\u0027m also known as Joe in the mortal realm. \u00a0I\u0027ve always found creativity to be a positive way to spread new ideas. \u00a0It\u0027s my goal to use my vast knowledge of various forms of fiction to entertain and enlighten. These videos will me primarily featured on my website (www.merlinthemighty.com) and supported by my YouTube channel. \u00a0At the moment I am currently working two jobs and doing to best to support myself and my family. However, I would love to be able to turn these programs into a part-time (and possibly full-time) job. \u00a0This is where you guys come in. \u00a0All financial support you provide will directly going to improvements of the site, higher budgets for production, and longer (and more in-depth) videos. \u00a0The more support you guys give, the more time I\u0027ll be able to have to devote to making the best possible videos I can. I want to keep doing this as long as possible. The truth is that I\u0027m going to need your help. \u00a0Let\u0027s turn Merlin The Mighty into something fantastic.
