    "summary": "Teach your Creativity to FLY!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nArt is a Practice~Practice is an Art\u003cbr\u003eHello! Thank you for checking out my page and\nmy art! My name is Michelle Crisanti and my work is primarily mixed-media\ncollage. My background is in Ceramics, and it is from working with colored\nslips on clay that I came up with this multi-dimensional way of working with\npaper. \u003cbr\u003eMy creative path has two forks: Following my Heart and Following the\nGrateful Dead. Both of these paths flowed beautifully together and merged into\nwhat I consider my-for lack of a better word-Religion. I am fascinated by\nSigns, Symbols, Mysticism, Spirituality, Energy Healing, Indigenous and\nShamanic Journeys, Divination, Astrology, and all that it entails. My Art is a\nreflection of my fascination with Body, Mind, and Spirit. My images are\ninspired by Tradition and Ceremony. My Energy Work is dedicated to helping\npeople tap into their own Creativity and bring forth their GENIUS!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHow does a sensitive, creative,\nsemi-introverted, dreamer with occasional delusions of grandeur, cope with the\nfact that in order to share my work with the World, I have to learn to reach\nout and communicate? It seems like it should be easy, and the internet is a\nhuge resource that I feel we sometimes get lost in. Patreon feels like a good\nplace to be found! I am Grateful that you stopped by here and I hope that you\nwill consider becoming a supporter at whatever level you can. I have a Patrons\nOnly feed that you will be privy to once you join in. I will be sharing New\nWork, Videos, Information, Musings, and Inspiration there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor me, art is like a barometer of how I am managing my energy. When my life is in balance, I have the time, energy, and inspiration to create. I know I am in trouble when I find myself running around without getting anything actually accomplished. That used to happen more often than not-until I stopped making excuses and started making ART! Now I need to Share IT!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n VISION: My Art and Spirituality are completely intertwined. Much of my Inspiration comes from my Spiritual Healing Practice and the rich imagery of Mythology, Tarot, Signs and Symbols, Dream Interpretation, Astrology, Energy Bodies, and the Human Mind, Body, and Spirit. I would like my work to Inspire and Connect with the Dreamer in Everyone. #weavedreamers\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n MISSION: \"Wake-UP, Kick-ASS, Repeat!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can book private sessions with me at my Rock Reiki Facebook page:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rockreiki/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/rockreiki/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also LIVE broadcasting my studio sessions and INSPIRING anyone and EVERYONE to LIVE their DREAMS!!\u003cbr\u003eWhen you support me on Patreon you are supporting the cost of my studio and supplies so that I can continue to inspire and coach people who also want to make the world more creative. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
