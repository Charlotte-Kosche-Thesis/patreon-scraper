    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eFEBRUARY 2017\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have two big projects beginning this year. These have been brewing for sometime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePROJECT #1.\u003cbr\u003eI am working on a multimedia memoir of my life\u2014growing up, what I am constantly learning, my huge wonderful family, Spina Bifida\u0027s everlasting impact, stories about my ongoing adventures on the road, and being so dastardly and poetically witty. The project will begin with me telling stories on raw video. Like a \"Mike\u0027s Life Storytime Vlog.\" Then I will write chapters and folks can read first drafts and tell me what they like and don\u0027t like. Patrons will help me whittle them down to a sweet book. Of which Patrons will get a copy either free or at cost, depending on your patronage. Supporters will get first look at everything including every draft of all my poems from here on. In April, I will be doing a poem a day for National Poetry Writing Month (NaPoWriMo) and those will only be available here on my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePROJECT #2. \u003cbr\u003eI am starting a small, San Jos\u00e9-based publishing house. The working name so far is \u003cem\u003eMonotwin Press\u003c/em\u003e and publications will be available via an online store or by subscription. The first year will focus on two zines and two themed poetry collections in chapbook format. The second year we\u0027ll add a twice-monthly poetry broadside to the subscription options. In the third year we\u0027ll look at publishing full, perfect bound poetry collections from an up-and-coming poet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and all support goes toward making my life and my work just that much easier to produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAUGUST 2016\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLife is awesome! I have been in the process of progress over the last few years. Quitting smoking and drinking, and now thriving in San Jos\u00e9 where I can be near my family. I used to tour a lot, but as I\u0027ve settled back into life in San Jos\u00e9, I see how much it needs poetry, humor and live art. My mission is to be to poetry and comedy in San Jos\u00e9 and Silicon Valley what cheese is to nachos. What air is to butterflies. What hay is to horses. Hey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePutting on shows in San Jos\u00e9 is one of my favorite things to do. I want to show my city how incredibly talented it is. It makes me happy to see people laugh, think and cry, and if I can have a hand in that, sign me up. In Silicon Valley, I now organize:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/615338711968298/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLive Lit Every Sunday\u003c/a\u003e\u2014a weekly open mic for all literature.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1558402271154060/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGO!

Some months pay off monetarily, the rest pay off socially. I am hoping to get enough patrons to supplement a poet\u0027s wage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI toured incessantly from 2003 to 2013. I slowed down a lot as I realized it was having a negative effect on my health. My writing slowed down and I lived out of a suitcase and a backpack for most of it. In that time, I lived back and forth between San Jos\u00e9 and Vancouver, Worcester, Portland or Bellingham\u2014never in any city for longer than eighteen months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve now lived in the same house in San Jose for over two years\u2014the longest I\u0027ve lived in any house since 2003.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I am offering to those who support me is the earliest possible look at my upcoming memoir/autobiography. I haven\u0027t begun the process because I want to start it with you. My goal is to share my childhood, my early poetry years in San Jos\u00e9, and my life on the road through stories I work out on private videos, podcasts, and written chapters\u2014me telling you my story through a total multi-media experience. The finished product will likely be a published book and companion audiobook. And you will get to have a say in how comes together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt may take a while. And I look forward all of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and your patronage."
