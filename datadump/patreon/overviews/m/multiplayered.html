Well, we\u2019re a group of five guys based out of Los Angeles, creating a podcast/YouTube show to share our love of games. From the 8-bit classics to the latest and greatest games, we cover everything \u2013 from the comfort of the couch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough we come from different places, and have different opinions on just about everything, we all agree that games are better together. So we\u2019d love to share our thoughts, opinions, reviews, and deepest secrets with you. We\u2019re creating content with up to date news, insightful looks at the best old games, plus everything that makes us laugh from the weird world of video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, none of what we\u2019re creating would be possible without the support of a community that we make content for! So if you\u2019re interested in hearing why we think Sonic is a terrible franchise, our biggest predictions for E3, or interviews with awesome people within the gaming industry, please consider supporting us! With your help, we can keep regularly creating new podcasts and videos every week. All donations go towards our maintenance costs, growing the show, and making sure we have enough quarters to press continue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u2019re interested in supporting a passionate new look at video games, please check out our videos. And if it seems like something you can support, consider becoming a patron \u2013 games are better together. And remember, it\u2019s dangerous to go alone."
