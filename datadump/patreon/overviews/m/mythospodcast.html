With an MA in literature and a love for folklore and storytelling, her one goal is to give people an \u003cstrong\u003eimmersive story experience that connects them with the collective imaginations of peoples from around the world - a sort of Atlas Obscura of folklore and oral storytelling.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNicole\u2019s intent is to bring to life that same immediacy, the same earnest involvement in the story she had all those years ago when her grandfather whipped up fantastic tales. She also wants to connect you with the stories of generations past, with the stories produced by those lost to history - and as Angela Carter so eloquently put it - with the vivid, raw narratives of the anonymous poor \u2018whose labour formed our world.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for being a part of this vision to diffuse creative narrative, forged by centuries of people otherwise lost and forgotten in time.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e"
