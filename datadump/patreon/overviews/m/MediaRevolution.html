    "summary": "Media Revolution is a foundation of creative talents and hobbyists alike who possess strong interests in pop culture and digital entertainment. Whether it be video games, animation, literature, filming, or music, their purposes are all akin to one another. They helped develop our livelihood and childhood on the arts of innovation and inspiration. And we would like to celebrate it by forming what could perhaps be the most passionate of the media communities by expressing ideas, sharing thoughts towards ongoing trends and recent news, finding solutions, and turning dreams into reality. We want to create new pieces for all ages, talk existing products of old and new, and debate industrial decisions from major names. No bias. No yellow journalism. No controversy. Just us being us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to further the dream, we decided it would be best to earn from what we deliver in content rather than keeping up with views of ad revenue. We can\u0027t keep this site up with our own pockets, which is why we are looking for help from you. Funding us will help us advance further in the kind of content we can create for viewers like you including podcasts, reviews, talks, music videos, and much more. And when we do evolve, we will promise to give you a brand new satisfying experience in community forming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eJoin the Media Revolution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eIf you want to donate to us personally, you can do that too by clicking\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/mediarevolution\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
