    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m a writer, an artist, a witch, an anarchist, and an aspiring herbalist and midwife. I\u0027m a multidisciplinary artist who explores themes of ecology, medicine, myth, folklore, birth, resistance, liberation, and intimacy. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently creating , a series of gouache paintings titled \"Folk Art from the Future\", a tarot deck, woodcut posters for mutual-aid based resistance, poetry, and short science fiction stories and novels. While I post completed pieces on instagram and youtube, this page will house all the behind-the-scenes bits. Here you might find sketchbook pages, real-time process videos, and insight into my visual art struggles and epiphanies. I\u0027ll also post short story excerpts, character profiles, brainstorms and finished poetry and prose that I don\u0027t plan to publish. Around each full moon, I\u0027ll publish a newsletter-a roundup of that month\u0027s art, music, book and movie inspiration along with a reflection on my creative journey. I may also include plant medicine tricks I\u0027ve picked up, and perform a short tarot reading for our patron community. Around each new moon, I\u0027ll send out a physical, personalized letter to $10 patrons that include art, tarot readings, stickers and other goodies. \u003cbr\u003eThis past year I\u0027ve struggled with an arm injury that nearly halted my creating abilities completely. I\u0027ve emerged from this challenge not quite physically healed (yet!), but a more focused, consistent, confident and passionate artist. I\u0027m bursting with ideas and a desire to grow.\u00a0 Your support would help me create more art and stories in the spirit of resistance and hope. \u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for being here! It means the world to me. \u003cbr\u003e"
