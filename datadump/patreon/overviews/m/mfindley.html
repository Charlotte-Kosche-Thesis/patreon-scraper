That\u0027s why she ran away, staking her life on her ability to survive in the wilderness. If everything went according to plan? Well, she\u0027d never set foot on Army property again.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nStaff Sergeant Casey Brennerman Huxley never wanted to be anything other than a soldier, bound to do his duty for his state and his country. He never expected to throw it all away.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFinding each other changed everything.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, Lottie and Casey have to navigate the minefield of new love, life-altering loss, and what exactly it means to be a family after the Five-Star Law.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Five-Star Law, Part 1 \u2013 Conscription Compromise is a full-length, post-apocalyptic dystopian novel.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHi, my name\u2019s Mana Findley, and I love to tell\nstories. Dark daring tales. Tall ones dedicated to swashbuckling heroes and damsels in distress. \n\u003cstrong\u003e[record scratch]\u003c/strong\u003e Actually, none of my heroes (currently) are\ndaredevils in the traditional sense of the word, and none of my heroines need a\nman to be saved (well, for the most part). And I suspect, once you get to know\nthem, you will find they\u2019re actually quite plucky!\nAlways dashing off to their next big adventure. But, I digress. I love to tell\nstories, which is why I started this Patreon channel. My goal is to provide\nengaging content for my current works in progress, and in exchange for a\nPatreon pledge, my fans get to read my stories as they are drafted. They\u2019ll be\nraw. Unedited. They\u2019ll require changes. They\u2019ll probably even have problematic\ncontent once in a while. But, I hope that with each chapter posted, I will\nserve my fan base with an honest contribution to the Sci-Fi community. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
