Let me tell you a little about myself. Currently, I\u2019m in the sixth grade. My family includes my mom,  Sarah, my dad, Adam, and my sister,  Abby. The four-legged part of the family includes two big dogs (Lily and Humphrey) a rabbit (Peter) and a guinea pig (Swirly). In my private time, I love baseball, football, helping vets, and being with family and friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe, I apprenticed for six months at Bear Meadow Folk Instruments to learn my craft, and I\u0027ve been building for two years. I\u0027ve been teaching since graduate school in 2000, and I will continue to teach for as long as I have students--I love it! My goal is to set up a working studio (nearly there), as well as build quality instruments that are both works of art and quality musical instruments. I\u0027ve made some beauties, and will continue to work hard to get better at my craft! And I want bring in students--kids and adults--who can use the skills I\u0027m offering to better themselves in any way (I want to pay the world back for all that it has given me!). I will build a curriculum that indigent kids can use to develop a sound practice of building and business skills to sell their wares. This will also be used for veterans who seek to learn a means to build and create instead of destroy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Oaks rustled and bees buzzed, babies cried gently, and old ladies fanned, the dulcimer droned and remembered.\" Jean Ritchie \u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I have always been an artist. As a young child I illustrated and bound into books stories that my brother invented, and we sold them around our neighborhood. I ran wild through the woods creating friends with whom I could play and bringing to life out of the refuse of others places that existed only in my mind. Some of my best art moments occurred on stormy, Florida nights when the power in our trailer went out, and we gathered at the kitchen table to draw by lamplight. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy formal art training began in grade school, where my handwriting was so bad that one of my teachers took a special interest in me (Thank you Mrs. Coleman!). She used art to help me with my writing; my penmanship is still pretty bad, but the art certainly took! I went to a vocational high school, and for three hours a day I studied graphic art. I learned to set type, run presses, and work with substrates like paper and board. I was introduced to the importance of design, color theory, and many of the art practices I use today. My college art career started at Hillsborough Community College in Tampa, Florida, wound its way up to the Maryland Institute, College of Art, in Baltimore, Maryland, and culminated when I earned my Masters of Fine Arts degree from the University of South Florida.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I have always been mechanically inclined. I got my first truck and rebuilt it with my father before I could legally drive it. I was trained in automotive engineering in the army, where I served as a track vehicle mechanic with the 5th Combat Engineers in Iraq. I worked as an auto technician after the army until I became interested in injection mold processing; and then I took a job where I got to make molds and operate machines that are as big as a bus!\u003cbr\u003eIt was in graduate school where my two loves were married, and I started to create kinetic art. Making gears and levers out of wood and found objects became a challenge I readily accepted\u2014I found I loved to work with wood, and I\u2019ve always loved to work with junk, my found treasures. It was here, too, that I came to love teaching. In my first semester I was given two drawing classes because I excelled as a draftsman. It turns out I was an effective teacher, also, and after I left grad school I continued to teach at Eckerd College, a small four-year school on Florida\u2019s gulf coast. I left there to teach at Shorecrest School, Florida\u2019s oldest independent day school, where I fell in love with teaching to high school students a variety of classes in traditional and digital media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring my travels I received a wide-ranging variety of commendations including the SW Asia Campaign Medal with two Bronze Service Stars, multiple grants to travel and to study Chinese art and culture\u2014including a National Endowment for the Humanities Award\u2014and many awards for my artwork in local, state, and national art competitions. And I have had some amazing and wonderful experiences, like hiking alone in the Negev Dessert while living in Israel, commingling with the multitudes of people in Beijing, China, and getting punched in the chest by Robert Bly! Most recently I became the heir to the Sunhearth Appalachian Dulcimer building tradition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI married a wonderful woman, Val, who is a teacher, musician, and artist. We live with two cats, Andr\u00e9 Flyrod and Allowicious. We are a single car family.\u003cbr\u003e",
