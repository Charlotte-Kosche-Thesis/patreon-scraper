Patreon gives fans the direct access to a creator\u0027s work on a subscription tier program where fans have the choice on how much they want to see\u00a0from their creators and at what price they\u0027re willing to subscribe for it. The higher the tier, the more rewards for the fans that us, creators wouldn\u0027t be anywhere without and are super appreciative of!.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did I choose Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell when it comes down to it, I\u0027ve been doing this singing thing since as young as I can remember. Being a professional singer has always been my dream and Patreon is that one step I needed to make it come true. Where I can connect with my fans, share my love for music and hopefully inspire others to do the same. Music is my second language and a message I hope to convey to fellow musice lovers. Patreon just brings up all a step closer to one another, without all the static noise that can happen in between.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all that being said, I want to follow up with a HUGE thank you. If it wasn\u0027t for you, I wouldn\u0027t be doing what I love to do: making music for the fans. So thank you for checking my patreon page out. I hope you stay along for the ride and all the feels as I write and record original songs, with you in mind :).\u003cbr\u003e"
