As such I also have been unable to find work, and with little else to do, YouTube has become my stress relief, entertainment for others I know, as well as my only job, so long as I keep getting ignored for the jobs I apply for. There is still a long ways to go before I can ever stand on my own via my content, not helped by the over $100K Student loans that hang over myself and my family. I hope that in time you the viewers will come to know me, enjoy my content, and eventually help me work out of Debit one Patron at a time. And thank you in advance for helping me get even this far. -Matt"
