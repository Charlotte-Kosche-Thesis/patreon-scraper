As you are probably aware, I\u0027m a science fiction writer who likes making exciting sci-fi stories. Because, let\u0027s face it, life rarely has enough laser battles, starships screaming through starry skies, or huge robots battling giant monsters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt least, my life doesn\u0027t have nearly enough. If yours does: jealous! And slightly terrified.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027ve decided to devote my life to writing the kinds of stories that I love reading. Adventure! Romance! Huge fleets of spaceships jumping through the vast nothingness of space to do heroic (or terrible) things! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you can help! This writing gig is awesome when it comes to hours (whenever I wake up until whenever I fall asleep!), flexibility, and job-satisfaction... but less so when it comes to little things like \"paying for food\" or \"having a roof over my head\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thanks for checking out how you can help support me make awesome stories! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Little Bit About Me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI left behind a career in physics for science fiction because \nthere weren\u2019t enough laser battles or wormholes at my research and \ndevelopment firm. You\u2019ll most likely find me curled up with my \nfavourite Pratchett, rererewatching Firefly, playing boardgames with my\n nearest and dearest, or making \"pew-pew\" sounds at WarMachine \ntournaments across the country. I live in Kitchener, Ontario, with my\n partner Andrea.\u003cbr\u003e"
