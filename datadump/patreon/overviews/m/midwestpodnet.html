You might agree that we make great content, but with little to no money flowing into the network, it\u0027s been difficult to expand our reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d love to make it to our moonshot -- the ability to pay at least a few of us full time to keep making content for you to enjoy! But we have to start with baby steps. A dollar a month may not seem like a whole lot, but it\u0027s a dollar more than we currently have! Imagine if everyone who downloaded one of our shows donated a dollar a month -- we\u0027d have more than enough to break even on all of the shows we produce!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for now, know this - every dollar that comes into this Patreon will be used to increase the quality of our podcast network and grow its reach! We love making these shows for our wonderful audience, and we want to start including you in the network, helping us make decisions about what content we make, and fostering a more direct connection with the people who really care about our network. This Patreon not only gives us a way to do that, but also helps us keep the lights on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo once again, thank you for considering a contribution to our Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e"
