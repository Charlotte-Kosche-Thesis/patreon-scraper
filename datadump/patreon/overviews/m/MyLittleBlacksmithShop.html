Depending on situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe agreed salary for the new hire may vary but should fall within reasonable limits. If not, I will adjust the Goal Earnings to match job market expectations. The work will go into making the game better at a faster rate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe programmer will transition the core mechanics into C++ language, where necessary, to help make the game run faster and efficient. After, we will continue developing in C++ and implement code for multiplayer as we move along.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe artist will redo most, if not all of the 3d models with beautiful textures to enhance the experience. New models will be created by the artist and some models will be created by volunteers.",
