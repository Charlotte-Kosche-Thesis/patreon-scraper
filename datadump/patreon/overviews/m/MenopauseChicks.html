    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi! I\u0027m Shirley and I am a Menopause Chick.\u003c/strong\u003e I founded MenopauseChicks.com with the intention that we can all learn how to navigate perimenopause, menopause \u0026amp; midlife with \u003cstrong\u003econfidence\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eease.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Menopause Chicks?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe like to think of a Menopause Chick as someone who is smart, savvy and who likes to be proactive with her own health. She also likes to consume her info online. The mission of Menopause Chicks is to empower women to be their own best health advocates. We do this by connecting women to the best information, to top women\u0027s health professionals--and to each other via our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/MenopauseChicks\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eprivate online community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do we need your help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe women\u0027s health information ought be awesome AND free. You would never charge your daughter for information about puberty, now would you? But here\u0027s the thing. No one ever taught us what to expect in perimenopause, our medical system is not designed to educate or help us easily access reputable information, and it\u0027s challenging to know how to advocate for your own health--especially when you\u0027re not feeling on top of your game. The key for Menopause Chicks so far, has been community--connection to others and validation that you are not alone. This resonates with women and the need is great. Our community has grown exponentially over the last year, and we have a keen desire to take it to the next level. That\u0027s why we created this page--to invite you to play a role in our future. The support within the community will always be free. Not everyone will be able to contribute. But some can. Perhaps you can? Perhaps as a result of your generosity, another woman will benefit and she may pay it forward. We\u0027ve seen this over and over: empowered women empower women.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will we use the money for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003econtinue to provide awesome content\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003erespond to women\u0027s questions in the community\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ecreate a new web-series covering all the topics that are currently keeping midlife women awake at night: hormonal health, physical health, sexual health, mental health, digital health and lifestyle goals\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ecreate an \"online concierge\" to efficiently reply to women\u0027s health questions\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur goal:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e...to inform one million women by 2020; ultimately, so every 35 year old woman knows how to make her own health a priority, what to expect and what her options are before she enters perimenopause.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
