I fell in love with the runt of the litter who I later named Mylah. I adopted her at 8 weeks-old. At 10 months old, Mylah was diagnosed with diabetes. Mylah\u0027s medical needs have been costly and at times extremely stressful and scary but I could not imagine a world without her amazing personality in it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI felt the need to give back in Mylah\u0027s name and started the Mylah Medical Foundation in 2012 after seeing the struggle animal shelters and rescues went through to save medical needs dogs from animal control. These dogs are always overlooked and ultimately euthanized\u00a0for medical reasons that certainly are not their fault. Rescues and animal shelters cannot sustain the costs that many dogs with medical problems have - and that isn\u0027t their fault either. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRescues and shelters are overwhelmed with the overpopulation of seemingly healthy dogs who have no issues and they of course deserve to be rescued too. But speaking from experience,\u00a0I cannot imagine my life without Mylah and to think that if she ended up at animal control today, she would likely be euthanized because taking on a diabetic dog with autoimmune issues is just too costly for most rescues to handle. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is where Mylah Medical Foundation comes in. My goal is to help get these medical needs dogs out of animal control and to reputable rescues. Mylah Medical Foundation sponsors and pays the medical care of the dogs so the rescues aren\u0027t burdened by taking in a dog with medical needs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003eWho are the dogs we will save together?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eWhen you become a monthly patron and join the Mylah Medical Foundation team, you are going to save dogs mainly from Chicago-area animal control facilities, but recently we have pledged to help dogs from Hurricane Harvey. We want to help the dogs in areas that have the most needs. Dogs with medical problems that end up at animal control are typically there because they have been neglected by their owners or are strays. We\u0027ve saved and funded dogs like Lilah, who was hit by a car and her owner couldn\u0027t afford the leg amputation and gave her up (she was adopted and lives an amazing life now!). We\u0027ve saved puppies with awful sarcoptic mange who were born from backyard breeders who neglected them. Those puppies wound up at animal control with little to no options (also saved and adopted!). The first dog we saved, Lily, was found in a park being beaten by a baseball bat when a good samaritan interjected. Lily suffered immense head injuries but we got her through and now she lives a happy and healthy life. These dogs are the underdogs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003eHow do we do this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(23, 54, 93);\"\u003eRight now, we are operating on a small scale and saving dogs when funds become available. We save dogs because I\u00a0donate funds from my personal\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://diydogmom.com/\"\u003ebusinesses\u003c/a\u003e to help fund the organization. I also run online campaigns to raise funds for dogs, one need at the time. The goal of setting up a monthly donor program is to have monthly funding we can count on to save dogs each and every month. When you become a Mylah Medical Foundation patron, you are directly helping save a dog each month and you\u0027ll be able to see all the exclusive updates and even help in the rescue process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a monthly patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eJoin a team of rescuers who want to see the the ones last to be considered, the underdogs, succeed.
