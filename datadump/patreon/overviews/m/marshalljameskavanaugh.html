You ever rode with Neal Cassidy or Hunter S. Thompson? Well, this trip will be full of all that Zen Lunacy and Gonzo Madness you\u0027ve always dreamed of experiencing. We\u0027ll camp in the desert and climb mountains and the whole time we\u0027ll be filling our notebooks with poetry and random realizations from the road. It\u0027ll be like Ken Kesey\u0027s magic bus ride, only we\u0027ll be stuffed in my tiny clown car instead. It\u0027ll be like Uber, only so much more of a well-rounded experience from point A to point B. Really, it\u0027ll be the story of our generation, lived firsthand in our time. And you\u0027ll have so much to write home about! Maybe it\u0027ll be the inspiration you need to write your next novel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e(You choose where we\u0027re going. Limit to 2 weeks on the road together. We\u0027ll split the cost of filling the gas tank, camping/hotel fees, and any other travel expenses.)",

With an income of $1500 a month I will be able to cover the small travel expenses I do have, which includes paying for gas, camping fees, food, and upkeep of my vehicle. This will also be enough that I won\u0027t have to worry about looking for other sources of income, that\u0027ll take me away from writing when I\u0027m off the road.",
