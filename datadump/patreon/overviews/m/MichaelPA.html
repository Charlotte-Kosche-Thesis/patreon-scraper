I am flexible in my filmmaking seeing as though I will be posting anything from sci-fi shorts to music and dance videos. I\u0027ve loved making movies since I took my first tracking shot in my drive way. I must have been about 10 years old then. I rolled down my drive way on my skateboard as I filmed my brother doing a 50-50 grind on a rusty skateboard rail. Reviewing that footage basically gave me the chills, I thought to myself, \"Dang, I could be good at this...\" And I hope you think the same! ;)",
