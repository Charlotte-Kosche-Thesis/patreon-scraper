I won\u0027t judge. Promise.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently standing at almost 65,000 words, it spans well over 100 pages of text (in the all important backup document) with code included, and fills about 200 reachable passages in Twine (more if you, again, include coding). It tracks about 50 different qualities of your character and the world at present, from the strength of your character\u0027s willpower, to how strong his current urges are, to, well, perhaps more mundane things like \"What are you wearing?\" since, obviously, people will respond to you different if you approach them in full armor, or slight leathers, or shredded rags.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe game already includes one of three possible companions for your journey (though she does not currently have a lot of content past her introduction), and is currently up to a teaser for the 1st area after the prologue, with 7-8 additional large areas already planned to encompass the full narrative. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAdditionally, an encounter system has been implemented to keep each playthrough from being exactly the same, letting you meet minor NPCs, deal with the obnoxious inconveniences of traveling through the underused roads and forgotten backwoods of the kingdom you serve, or just finally having a quiet night without any chaos going on to let you just relax away from the constant paranoia and temptation. Some of these encounters may be as simple as a passage or two, but others encompass 20+ passages involving difficulties and opportunities of their own (most of them probably involving sex in one way or another. It\u0027s kind of a theme in this game).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWell, okay, that\u0027s what you\u0027re working on, but...\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat\u0027s that you say? \u00a0Melphy, that sounds great, but why should I actually put my money down for something you\u0027re releasing for free? \u00a0(At least I\u0027m really hoping you think that sounds great)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, I\u0027m (sorta) glad you asked (I mean, just about everyone appreciates people just throwing money at them \n\u003cem\u003ewithout\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0asking why they should.). \u00a0Currently I do this writing basically exclusively as my \u0027job,\u0027 though it\u0027s currently part time, averaging about 20 hours a week, though I, obviously, can only attempt that so long before I get into some financial difficulties... \u00a0I attempt to be very attentive to comments made on any of the sites I\u0027ve used for communication, and, if need be, I am more than willing to manage 3-4 releases a day to ensure that any bugs anyone spots are immediately dealt with. \u00a0I feel the devotion I put into my work may be compelling. \u00a0If not, maybe you just really like my content and would like to see it keep coming out at a steady pace. \u00a0If neither? \u00a0Well, er, then I don\u0027t have a good reason for you to pledge, unless some of the perks look good. \u00a0In which case, totally, do it for the perks. \u00a0You know you need those perks. \u00a0I mean, come on, you\u0027ll be \u003cem\u003eutterly\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0bereaved without them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso I have this charmingly quirky sense of humor. \u00a0That\u0027s \n\u003cem\u003etotally\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0worth something, right?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003ePatreon!?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eAh, yes, the eternal question. \u00a0Why Patreon as opposed to some other method of asking for support? \u00a0The simple fact is that I feel it\u0027s a more fair support method to \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e, er, yes you. \u00a0Reading this. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Well, let\u0027s say I was using a standard donation system, and you were feeling generous, you toss me some moderate sum of money because you enjoy my current project, but then... \u00a0Uh oh, that project goes on hiatus, and maybe you don\u0027t like the replacement as much. \u00a0With a straight donation system, you\u0027re just out of luck, I already got your money, but with a more slow and steady approach of a single smaller payment a month, you\u0027re free to reduce your payment, or cancel it entirely if I start working on something not to your interest. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt also has the added benefit of being a bit more consistent than just holding out the cup of PayPal or other single use donation systems, since I can have a reasonable idea of my income from month to month, I can budget appropriately, and if I\u0027m not having to worry about if I\u0027ll have anything at all coming in a month, I can have a more relaxed, less tense life. \u00a0And you know what less stress means? \u00a0Better content output!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWelll, maaybe I\u0027ll consider it, but what else are you going to do going forwards?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e(Warning: this part is a bit more technical and a lot more boring.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently I work entirely in TWINE, meaning my work functions largely as a very complex sort of choose your own adventure game. \u00a0It also means they\u0027re generally relatively small downloads, and should work for just about everybody since they run in browser (though I\u0027ve occasionally had some issues with this, switching to the SugarCube version of TWINE has ironed \n\u003cem\u003emost\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of them out).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI mostly focus on heavily narrative based games with some RPG elements, usually tracked statistics and similar qualities that permit the character\u0027s overall choices to influence the overall story. \u00a0That way, even if something doesn\u0027t have any large, immediate repercussions, it still helps define the character \n\u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0have chosen to play. \u00a0Of course, usually the characters also are someone particular in the story, but you get to put your own spin, your own flavor on them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also consider verisimilitude one of the \n\u003cem\u003emost\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0important aspects in game design. \u00a0Whenever possible, I want to make sure that, if you feel an option would be reasonable to take, you can take it. \u00a0Obviously there are some limits on this, putting three or more options in a passage tends to cause the branching, and therefore the amount of writing necessary to get through a single scene\u0027s interactions, to spiral wildly out of control before it can be forced to join back together again. \u00a0Still, I generally want you to feel like the characters you interact with, and the character you are, are relatively consistent, believable people (or at least believable within the context of their setting), and, unless there\u0027s some in game reason for why your character would be obliged to make a particular... \u00a0Non-ideal choice, I\u0027d prefer no one ever want to yell at the screen, \"But I\u0027d never \u003cem\u003eDO\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0that!\" \u00a0Granted, some stories feature themes of loss of control, of irresistible lust, and the like, so sometimes your options \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0be limited, but only as part of the experience.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, I mean, if you hadn\u0027t picked up on it so far, \u00a0that word \"porn\" is up there near the top like... \u00a0Twice. \u00a0You may then intuit that there\u0027s a lot of sex in these games.  Annnd you\u0027d be entirely correct.  Also, at present, my major project(s) include an emphasis on genderswapping transformations, mind control, and general corruption themes. \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAside from my current project my perspective projects are Ghost Princess, my previous work currently on hiatus because I created a ratty programming snarl out of it very early on, as well as two other ideas I\u0027ve been half contemplating in my spare time. \u00a0One of them a shorter piece about a woman trying to get through a sales meeting without ending up to terribly molested (it\u0027s harder than you\u0027d think), and the other about a pseudo post apocalyptic setting where you\u0027re part of a group of humans who survive the break down of society (after mass demon attacks), who has to go out and scavenge for technology and signs of other human life. \u00a0The demons, too, have been greatly depleted as they rapidly fell to infighting, but, well, you may (not) be surprised to find that they \n\u003cem\u003ealso\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0congregate around places that are still in decent repair. \u00a0Toss in a brief opening I did for a game tentatively titled \"One Blessing Too Many,\" and, well, the trick is more choosing what to work on as opposed to having something TO work on.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo a degree, when it comes to what project I\u0027m going to work on next, it\u0027s either going to be what I feel really inspired or psyched about, as that means work will get done faster with that improved level of, well, inspiration, or based on Patron vote. \u00a0I have a lot of potential ideas, and I\u0027m quite happy to deliver whatever my supporters want the most out of what I can do. \u00a0Gennnnerrallly.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou think this sounds good? \u00a0You think my writing style is enjoyable? \u00a0Maybe you think \"Eh, this is \n\u003cem\u003epretty\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0close to what I\u0027m looking for, but I really wish (x, y, and/or z) theme was more prominent in the work?\" \u00a0Well good news, good news, and, er, well at least sorta good news. \u00a0Those first to categories can support me however they like, and if that last one is so inclined, they can do the same, get involved, and start voting for or suggesting those things they\u0027d like to see, if not included in the current project, than in the next. \u00a0It might not work for \u003cem\u003eeveryone\u003c/em\u003e, but I hope it works for \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOh, and actually, where am I going to FIND any of this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhat a fair question! \u00a0Right now I publish everything to my weblog \u003ca href=\"http://melphiessvice.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e though I\u0027m not sure how you made it here without knowing\u00a0that already. \u00a0Still, if you DID, there you go.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
