I\u0027m Robert and I make creatures, items, and encounters for the 5th edition of the world\u0027s greatest role-playing game. But fear not friends who play in another system, a lot of the items are system agnostic so you can use them anywhere. I\u0027m also developing a campaign setting that ties all of these releases together with an overarching narrative. You\u0027ll see that information trickle out over time. Until then rest assured that you can easily drop these creatures, items, and encounters into any world you choose. I also like to add a bit of humor where I can. Hopefully, that stands out to you in the image below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://moonseagames.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mourning-son.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen does your content come out?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of now, you can expect my content to come out every other week, so effectively twice a month. However, you can set a cap on how much you are willing to spend a month and still receive everything. That way if I\u0027m more prolific one month and release three different creations you\u0027ll still get all the content. Also if I happen to go on vacation for a week (I wish) you won\u0027t have to pay for something you don\u0027t receive. Think of it as the ultimate consumer protection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Who are you and why should we care?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a professional writer for the past six years. During that time I\u0027ve worked in games and games media. My roles have run the gambit from consulting with indie and AAA studios making the RPG and MMORPGs you love to hosting weekly live streams interviewing game developers for media outlets. You can also find me acting as the DM in my dining room for my local gaming group. \u003cem\u003eVineyards D\u0026amp;D You Rock!\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess that\u0027s the $1 to however many dollar question isn\u0027t it? I love to write (my sixteen year-old self would slap the crap out of me had he known I\u0027d one day say that) and I love to create. The part that I\u0027m missing is you! With your direct support I\u0027ll be able to create content at a professional level for you to enjoy.
