Eventually I moved on to self-hosting to grow my blog even bigger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mission is to spread awareness on mental illness in general, but my focus is Borderline Personality Disorder. I go through it myself, so I want to share insight on it regularly via blogging and give people another perspective on what I go through. The purpose of this is to let people know that mental illness is real, it\u0027s serious, and needs to be treated just like a physical condition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support through donations, I can keep my blog up to keep raising awareness, help others know they are not alone, and help end the stigma on mental illness as well. Even $1 or $2 a month can make all the difference to me, because it can all add up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may visit my blog at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mybpdlifejourney.com/.\"\u003ehttp://mybpdlifejourney.com/.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance for your love and support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Leah\u003cbr\u003e",
