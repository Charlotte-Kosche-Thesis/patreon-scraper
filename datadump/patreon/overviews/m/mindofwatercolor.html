I have been a professional designer and illustrator for 30+ years but now I\u0027m returning to my fine art roots. My channel is primarily for watercolor enthusiasts where I share painting demos, tips and techniques in a quick, easy to digest fashion. I\u0027ll also do product reviews, offer challenges and perhaps even have a few giveaways. Your support will help back the tremendous amount of time and work that goes into making regular art video content and enable me to share more of what I love about this fantastic painting medium."
