At that time, we decided to make a change for our family and for our health. For us this change did not include starting a crazy-intensive work-out plan, or buying a gym membership - as it just wasn\u0027t us. Instead, we decided to take one simple step, and switched one element of our lifestyle, our diet. As of November 1st, 2017 my husband and I have collectively lost over 100 lbs!!!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RFTjMAkf2llP18-e0apS0EjR98TphoZcUtJot5HZDIqIWMXXH-Jl7-2ws6Ufo8DZJasjmTNH-nQEnRTG3Ou8rkH7R0P2FrRHjhmv1ThLzh05jf1VaZG8d6zFowf44lwYs2z1Gr__uzXxnuj3oRlJZjIOtjBzZZld81c1AIanDK-VwppNkq-fa7I48kRuijXzAgR8WKUcQishQnXXbasyST9vW_bo0P2leceNMCxWpeBLtmtlWXtHajnCM80QJpSo21LocW7heKNYOD8P77SDwgh48culWrSp9LZ3SYk8M6nWC1Sv6AN1i2WRb26kbwuKp6UaTUMhDpM9LXBzu8wb7khIj_JoeEhKJ8j9s9VCZdbIs40XeeUOkNn8qR-4pxCfxUra8Sysre7qnPjvSZL1bIzyjLAj8Suq7PTWpGDK-en-RdZ4h_eVhtJaMDqYpxlKoGmASL7F1_epNisLhrLWCgrlv5XfPvbMJ4PVWGbXXp64hXekdTXKUB7Ad3FRoP8-vkpM646iryZRcQBNnebkMla7cBgVGK33ou4WOjlo5h5GyVj04-P7_drJ8-JUhDmD=w1499-h898\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started \u2018Meals with Margo\u2019 with the hopes of empowering others to be able to do the same. I recognize that often times, the hardest part about starting something new is that \u0027you don\u0027t know what you don\u0027t know\u0027. Starting this lifestyle required a TON of research on my part. I tried a lot of new things. I failed at a lot of new things. I succeeded at a lot of new things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy starting this meal plan I hope to help take out the element of fear and hope to empower you to feel confident in your journey! It\u0027s as simple as stocking your pantry with the ingredient list provided and following weekly recipes to create tasty foods for your family. For additional support and for your own peace of mind - I have also included my recipes in the MyFitnessPal database - so that it is extremely easy for calculation and accountability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what does the meal plan look like? Each week, for my Patrons I will provide:\u003cbr\u003e- A Meal Plan\u003cbr\u003e- Printable Weekly Menu\u003cbr\u003e- Recipes for 5 Dinners\u003cbr\u003e- Comprehensive Shopping List with the necessary items for ease of use. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach meal will be input into the MyFitnessPal database so that you can keep track of your macronutrients (Carbs, Fats, Calories, etc), respectively. I will also include a weekly brunch plan and shopping list (for Special Patreon Tier Supporters). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether this is your first time on this journey or if you are a returning traveler - my family and I welcome you! I invite you to enjoy our weekly meal plan and wish you the best of success in your journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Margo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also started \u0027Meals with Margo\u0027 as a way to help support my family.
