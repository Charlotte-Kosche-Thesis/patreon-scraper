It also helps that the characters are likable and relatable, with each (including Lydia, the werewolf protagonist and partner in crime with Sam and Simon) having their own ambitions and motives that you rarely see in most characters in most webcomics !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more info on this unique project, please visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://moonlitbrew.webcomic.ws/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOur website\u003c/a\u003e, as well as my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://midnightclubx.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/user/midnightclubx/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFurAffinity\u003c/a\u003e pages!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSimply put, it is a ongoing, mini-Kickstarter, with donation goals being small enough for \u003cem\u003eanyone \u003c/em\u003eto contribute!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I donate to this Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour contributions, no matter how big or small, will be very valuable for us, and it will eventually benefit everyone in the long run.

On top of more frequent updates to the comic (up to \u003cem\u003etwo pages a week \u003c/em\u003eif we reach the goal for it!), you will see new illustrations and the potential of making short spin-off comics later down the line!
