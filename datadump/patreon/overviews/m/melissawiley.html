We were in the middle of planning a move from San Diego to Portland, Oregon when I was surprised with a breast cancer diagnosis. The good news is, we caught it very early. We sped up our moving schedule, gave up Comic-Con, and got to Portland within a few weeks of diagnosis so that I could have surgery right away and do the rest of my treatment in one place. And here we are, settling into our new life. I\u0027m working on a historical fiction novel for Knopf; I\u0027m teaching Brave Writer courses and writing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://store.bravewriter.com/products/the-arrow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Arrow\u003c/a\u003e, a monthly literature guide; I\u0027m beginning my new work as an advocate for supports for people with disabilities (like my 13-year-old son); I\u0027m prepping for a new year of homeschooling adventures; and...I\u0027m starting radiation treatments.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?

Patreon provides an opportunity for me to put \u003cstrong\u003emore time into my creative work\u003c/strong\u003e and less into time-draining side-gigs like the pile of grantwriting work I took on these past few years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have filled many a page in my notebook with ideas for \u003cstrong\u003efun perks I can offer monthly subscribers \u003c/strong\u003e(like live-chat Q\u0026amp;A, personalized book recommendations, planner peeks, and writing process posts), but it took the tumultuous events of this summer to spur me to move those ideas off the page and into reality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo many of you have been kind enough to ask how you can help support my work.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m excited about the possibilities this Patreon opens up\u2014a chance for me to share something special with people who value my work.
