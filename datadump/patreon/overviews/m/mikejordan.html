    "summary": "Hello, fellow fans of the written word, my name is Mike Jordan, and in addition to being a husband, Dad, Step-Dad, and Mailman, I\u0027m a writer. I\u0027ve started this page at the urging of the denizens of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/\"\u003e/r nosleep\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0who have enjoyed my series\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6p7pth/my_wife_thinks_i_sleep_walk_part_one/\"\u003e \u0027My Wife Thinks I Sleepwalk\u0027\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I don\u0027t believe in taking money on faith, I\u0027m going to leave the rough draft of the first act up on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6p7pth/my_wife_thinks_i_sleep_walk_part_one/\"\u003ereddit\u003c/a\u003e. So anyone may read it, free of charge, and hopefully decide to contribute or pick up the finished product. After a bit of polishing and self-editing, that first act will become my first public post here. I look forward to that part of the process so I can tell this story beyond\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/\"\u003e/r nosleep\u003c/a\u003e\u0027s rules. and I want to thank everyone that\u0027s read it so far, and specifically those members of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/damnedtimetravelers/\"\u003e/r damnedtimetravelers\u003c/a\u003e, whose interest, enjoyment and encouragement has kept me up late and working on this story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support in this effort. I appreciate every donation, as I work for a living, just like you. I don\u0027t expect anyone to just throw money at me. I don\u0027t give my word lightly, as I have been down to the point where my word was about all I had. So when I tell you, three to six months for a finished product, I will do my damnedest to get it done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you for reading, and \u00a0aiding me in this effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the story:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is the story of one David Dempsey, an exceptional young man, who has to work very hard to seem ordinary. He has a perfect memory, which he has to hide. He has training no man his age should have, which he has to hide. He is afraid of nearly everything, up to and including his own reflection, because he has to lie to those closest to him, due to his condition. Most specifically, he is afraid of falling asleep, because when he does, he occasionally wakes up in the past. You see, David is a time-traveler, and he has no idea how to control it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat scares him more than anything, is the fact that he is learning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
