    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid you know that there is a Western tradition of meditation practice?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the modern, western world we are living in a kind of dark ages as to our own wisdom. Because of events in the past, we find ourselves very unaware of our own spiritual heritage. Indeed the modern westerner is more likely to know the teachings of Buddha than those of Socrates or Plato.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt wasn\u2019t always this way. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the temples of Ancient Egypt, the priests taught the art of meditation. They didn\u2019t use the term meditation at the time, but rather viewed this practice as a form of special sleep which they termed \u0027incubation\u0027. The practice of incubation took place in a special darkened room where visitors to the house of life were taught how to sit or lie in a state of inner tranquillity, so as to bring about healing and insight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e This method was passed down to the ancient Greeks and into Italy, where temples of healing and divine insight called asclepions were created with the same goals. These new temples also contained sacred rooms for meditation called abatons, where just like in Ancient Egypt incubation would take place. These meditation methods were used to gain insight and understanding into hidden things and whole books were written from the learning received by them. These techniques have not been lost, indeed Pre-Socratic texts and Hermetic writings are examples of training manuals in this ancient art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis western approach to meditation is very different in feel and approach to the eastern methods of Yoga or Buddhism and needs some translation for a modern audience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my intention to study, practice and make available to the world these authentic methods of western meditation. It\u0027s time to take the study of our mystical heritage out of the hands of the academics and start using these methods again. To show the truth by being the truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel a great calling pulling me to bring this gift back to humanity. Over the last few decades much work has been done to make the ancient teachings from the Orient and from India approachable and understandable to the popular world. I believe it is time for the western tradition to step out of the shadows and shine as it once did before. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut there\u2019s more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese ancient teachings handed down from generation to generation are part of a complete system of self-transformation covering all aspects of life. It is my goal to uncover this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the temples of old we know the initiates were taught many different disciplines and doctrines that modernly we would only associate with the far eastern religions. Gymnastics were taught to perfect harmony in the body in a similar way that Yoga asana or postures are used today. Breathing methods to calm the mind and control energy were taught to restore health. Specific methods of training were taught to help develop correct and healthy thought, increased awareness and accurate intuition. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that if I manage to regenerate the western meditation tradition of the ancient times the rest of the teaching will start to come back into focus in a way the modern man may find accessible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is this important?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me, technology is moving so fast that to bring the world into harmony we need to focus more on inner development. Science has given us great power and ability and we are using it to tear up the world, to make more objects to compete for power. We are in search of something to satisfy us but keep looking in all the wrong places. Perhaps if we went back to the traditions that our logic and science evolved from and rediscovered the spirituality that used to keep these arts in balance we can finally find what we are looking for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If we could rediscover this special form of healing sleep, just think of the applications these skills could have for healing and scientific development and what they could to cultivate understanding as to what it means to be human. With effort and your support I believe I can be the bridge between east and west bringing mind sciences of the west back home. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I need your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have dedicated my entire adult life to the study of Meditation and its associated arts. I have travelled the world to find the great teachers and techniques. With the insight this has given me, I have started to find clues in the original texts of what exactly was taking place. Matching this with modern teachings from the same tradition, visiting the original sites and pressure testing by really doing the practice is only half the job. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe real dedication is then in presenting this information to the world in a professional and easy to understand way. To do this I am asking for your support so an increasing amount of my time can be dedicated to this quest. \u003cbr\u003e"

Imhotep was a  high priest of the sun god Ra at Heliopolis.\nHe was said to be a son of Ptah, his mother being a mortal named Khredu-ankh.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dominicus.malleotus.free.fr/rhodes/img/site_asclepieion_016_(reconstitution).jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs time went and Greek influence on these healing\nsanctuaries came to be called Asclepions after the Greek god of medicine (said\nto be a corruption of Imhotep\u2019s name). These were established throughout\nGreece, usually in settings of moving natural beauty and peace. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn these sacred places physician-priests practiced a kind of\nhealing centred around meditation and dream therapy.  Patients  were pilgrims who came in search of healing\nfrom afar.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe first treatment upon admission into the Asclepions was\nKatharsis, or purification. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe process involved a series of cleansing baths and purgations,\naccompanied by a cleansing, regenerating  diet, which lasted several days followed by a\nperiod fasting.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDuring this fast sacred gymnastics and other healing forms\nof exercise  would be taught specific to\nthe health problems of the individual. Breathing techniques designed to bring\naround a rejuvenation were taught in detail and memorised for future practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePoems and play designed to help the patent come to terms with his inner hardships would be presented for his betterment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n Then,when ready the supplicant was admitted into the main sanctuary\nto participate in the  healing rites. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSacred 0fferings in the form of gold, silver, or marble\nsculptures of the body part to be healed. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nOften for minor aliments small objects or coins were tossed\ninto a sacred spring or well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe whole process was set up to create a great sense of\nhealing and indeed a sense of belief in the patient who would be subject to\nmany prayers and approbations as he was let to the abaton of meditation\nchamber.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n He would then spend a number of nights in the\nchamber under the guidance of the priest with the great goal of a visit from Asclepius\nDivine Physician himself! The God would who would either heal the patient directly\nin the dream state, or give him a vision as to have to cure his illness or\naffliction.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen funding reaches this point a retreat for those who wish\nto learn Hermetic arts and recover from the hardships of the world will be\nfounded to bring back these practices. All patrons will have a chance to stay\nin this sacred space.\u003c/p\u003e",

     "description": "Did you know that there is a western tradition of lucid\ndreaming?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/NatSci102/images/cryssph.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have all heard the story of Jacobs ladder which is\ndescribed in the bible.  It goes into\ngreat detail explaining very clearly that Jacob slept upon a rock and in his\nsleep he saw a vision of the Angels ascending and descending a ladder to\nheaven. This of course is not the old reference in the bible to a figure\nvisiting the other world. Enoch himself is said to have walked with the Angels\nand we hear legend in Corinthians of a good Christian man who visited the 7th\nlevel of heaven. So it seems there are many levels of paradise to be explored,\nas Jesus said my house has many mansions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf this is possible they how can this be done? The\nPythagoras believed that there were 7 levels of consciousness that could be\nexplored via a form of sacred sleep. A practice handed down to them by the Ancient\nEgyptians who believed a journey thought the planets or signs of the zodiac was\nthe ultimate goal of the initiate. We find this teaching reflected in the\nHermetic texts too with one the most precious fragments being entitled \"The\nOgdoad Observes The Ennead \"  this\namazing text once read is clearly an instruction manual for a practitioner who\nhas gained a high degree of mastery in this journey into our realms and wishes\nto go higher than the 8th sphere.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf we compare various texts from various traditions we\nfind some consistency in both the experiences and the methods used. In Egypt a\ntradition of special stone beds were used by the priests for their visions\nquests a tradition that was passed on to Ancient Greece in the form of the\npractice of incubation or healing sleep. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis practice seems to cross all boarders with special\nsleep stones used in Japan and China for dreams designed to help with important\ndecision making.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Oresme_Spheres_crop.jpg/220px-Oresme_Spheres_crop.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo then if Jacobs lying on a stone was not unique but\nrather part of a skill or method then how is this done and what is really\npossible?  In my possession I have an\nancient manual written by a practitioner of this art in Egypt in the 1\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;st\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;\nCentury AD. This manual outlines the exact methodology for exploring the dream world\n/ other realms. When funding reaches this level I will produce a series of\nvideo explaining the method and adapting it for modern use so that others can\npractice the ancient and valuable art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
