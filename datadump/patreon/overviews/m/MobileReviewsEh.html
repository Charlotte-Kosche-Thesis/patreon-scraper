    "summary": "I guess it starts with me (Aaron_The_Ho) and it\u0027s pretty simple. I like tech, I like making videos and I\u0027d rather be doing awesome things on the Internet rather than working in a stuffy office for a suit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life and career has brought to this point where I\u0027ve found something that I\u0027m passionate about. Something that is fun that I feel can be something I do for the rest of my life. My background is in engineering (P.Eng) and business (MBA) but whatever I\u0027ve learned growing this channel has trumped the lessons that I\u0027ve learned I\u0027ve learned in post-secondary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to know more about me and the channel?\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2bQVZB3luM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck out this video!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow is your pledge going to help me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge will help me grow Mobile Reviews Eh. I\u0027ve got bigger plans with what I want to do with the brand but I have to start small. Since starting the channel, I\u0027ve easily spent $20k+ on products and devices which is significant given that the channel doesn\u0027t pay much. Everything I make gets put back into the channel and based on my taxes for the past three years, I\u0027ve lived under the poverty line since starting the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many things I want to do with the channel and your pledge will help me get there. Ultimately, I see Mobile Reviews Eh! as a brand where people come from their tech news, reviews and tips \u0026amp; tricks. I\u0027ve recently branched into doing Android case reviews and would love to start doing iPad/Tablet reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVR is also on my horizons as I\u0027ve gotten a Samsung Gear VR the potential that I see is pretty awesome. Smart home tech is something I\u0027d love to get into as well. There are so many different ways to make \"dumb\" things in our houses better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have a finite goal in mind. This may seem silly but I\u0027ve been doing this long enough to know that the moment I plan for something one year down the road, something will happen. Not because of a lack of effort, but rather a change in circumstances that either changes my goal or steers me into something new.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
