    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/5cffd0ffbbc98131fe9c241ef7f34de4/tumblr_onswfnSyJD1qio81bo1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Mark Reep. I\u2019m an artist and writer based\nin Northern Pennsylvania and New York\u2019s Finger Lakes region. For over twenty\nyears, I\u2019ve shown and sold my graphite, charcoal, and ink drawings in\ngalleries, juried exhibitions, and museums.  My work has appeared in \u003cem\u003eAmerican Art Collector, Endicott Journal, Bluecanvas \u003c/em\u003eand many other\npublications.  I also work with stone,\nand take photographs. If you\u2019d like to see more, visit my website: \u003ca href=\"http://markreep.net/\"\u003ehttp://markreep.net\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2014, my mother\u2019s illness necessitated a hiatus from\ndrawing and gallery commitments while I cared for her.  On September 17, 2016, she passed away.  When I was ready to make art again, my longtime\npartner, the artist\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://parnilla.com/\"\u003eParnilla Carpenter\u003c/a\u003e suggested I list some unframed drawings\non eBay.  Response has been encouraging.\nSome drawings have sold for significantly less than they might have brought in\ngallery shows, but commissions and costs are correspondingly lower as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m happy about this for several reasons. Most\nimportantly, my drawings pay bills.  They\nkeep the light on over the drawing table, they pay for my utilities, my\ninternet connection.  One day soon I hope\nthey\u2019ll pay for some upgrades, a more reliable connection to upload video\nfiles, etc. And of course, the big bills too. My goal remains a simple one many of us\nshare: I want to make a living making art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnother reason I\u2019m excited about making work\navailable directly is that more friends can afford it. Over the years, many\nhave purchased prints, cards, notebooks, other products featuring my images\nfrom print-on-demand sites like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/markreep\"\u003eRedbubble\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://fineartamerica.com/profiles/mark-reep.html\"\u003eFine Art America\u003c/a\u003e. Now, without the\nnecessity of maintaining pricing understandably driven by galleries\u2019 much\nhigher overheads, folks who couldn\u2019t have afforded to buy my work at gallery\nprices can afford an original drawing. \nThat\u2019s important to me.  Feels\ngood. \u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis month, a step-by-step article on the making of\nmy recent drawing\u003cem\u003e Pirate Radio Edit \u003c/em\u003e will be featured in Strathmore Artist Papers\u2019\nquarterly newsletter. Today, I\u2019m launching this Patreon account. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs I mentioned above, my goal is simple: Make a\nliving making art. For several years I\u2019ve worked whenever I could cutting and\nselling firewood; it\u2019s been a significant portion of my income. Unfortunately,\nwith the arrival of the Emerald Ash Borer and widespread logging of infected\nash trees, the local firewood market has been glutted. Prices have fallen, and\nwon\u2019t likely rebound soon. Also, I\u2019m 56, and I can\u2019t cut what I used to. I want\nto cut less firewood, make more art. If you like my work, and you\u2019re able, you\ncan help with as little as a dollar a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for you?  A fair question, especially in challenging\ntimes, when many of us are struggling. \nIf, like me, you value insights into other artists\u2019 ways of working, I\nhope you\u2019ll enjoy my work-in-progress scans and comments.  I\u2019ll post video clips.  I plan to launch a podcast.  Your support will help by enabling upgrades\nlike better editing software, and better microphones. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour support will also help with\nthe costs of artmaking tools and materials. My primary medium, drawing, is a\nrelatively affordable one. But poor quality tools and materials\u2013 soft charcoal\npencils that break continually when sharpened, inks that dry too slowly and\nsmear, paper intolerant of my admitted abuses\u2013 can cost more in time and effort\nthan more expensive alternatives of better quality.  With your help, I hope to be able to afford\nhigher-quality tools, and utilize topshelf illustration and mixed media boards.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy eyesight isn\u2019t what it used to\nbe.  I recently bit the bullet and got\nnew glasses, and I use an inexpensive magnifier, but my eyes would benefit from\none of better quality. I\u2019d like a more eye-friendly lamp as well. When I began\nthis journey, I could work all day at the drawing table. Now, my eyes demand shorter\nsessions, more breaks, and I\u0027ve learned to not draw and drive! Your support will help me continue to create the level of detail\nI love, and my eyes will thank you for it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting plays an important part in\nmy work. I write fiction, poetry, reviews, and instructional articles on\nartmaking. I blog. I also create drawing-and-text pieces.  Some accompanying texts are simple, brief: A\nfew lines of poetry, perhaps excerpted from some larger work. Others are more\nextensive, like this history of a Scottish lighthouse, \u003ca href=\"http://markreep.net/LochTraignarryLight.html\"\u003eLoch\nTraignarry Light\u003c/a\u003e. If you\u2019re interested\nin my writing, I hope you\u2019ll enjoy my feed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy home was a working farm many\nyears ago. Most evidence of that time is gone, but a number of dry-laid stone\nwalls remain between overgrown fields. I\u2019ve repaired some, added seating in a\ncouple places, and I maintain firewood roads and paths as I can. The house\nneeds a lotta work, and I\u2019ve torn down most of the outbuildings, with the\nexception of a little granary that\u2019s become my workshop and stoneworking studio.\nBut I\u2019m blessed to live in a quiet place, with woods and other wonderful\nresources. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI mention this because my home\nfuels my work, has become a part of it. When friends tell me they\u2019ve enjoyed\nvisiting, walking, spending time here, I\u2019m happy. I\u2019ll include photos of the\npaths, stone and related work, as well as my studio, with the hope you\u2019ll enjoy as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve set up several reward\ntiers I hope supporters of my work will enjoy. If you\u2019re considering pledging,\nplease take a look with your budget and interest in mind. Questions and\nsuggestions are always welcome. If there\u2019s something you\u2019d like to see made available,\nlet me know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, thanks for looking, and thanks so much for your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
