    "summary": "My name is Craig Wieczorkiewicz. I\u0027ve been writing about the Midwest League at \u003ca href=\"http://mwltraveler.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMWLtraveler.com\u003c/a\u003e and tweeting about it \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/MWLtraveler\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@MWLtraveler\u003c/a\u003e since the 2011 season, when I traveled to all 16 MWL ballparks and chronicled my journey on that website. My initial intent was to write a book about the ballparks and the history of their teams, but as I delved further into the history and current happenings of the league, I decided to also expand the scope of my blog and tweets and become an unofficial MWL chronicler of sorts, which is both enjoyable and time-consuming. I continue to travel at my own expense so I can shoot photos and write about games I attend; write about notable games, league news, and MWL alumni; and tweet nightly scoreboard updates via Twitter. I am inspired by reader feedback to keep going, as there isn\u0027t another active Midwest League-wide site quite like mine out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s never been easy for me to ask for money or freebies, but after discovering Patreon, I thought this seemed like a good way for readers to support my work if they wish to do so. Donations will help defray the cost of my travels, website, and any needed equipment upgrades. Your small monthly pledge of $1 or more can help me in this regard and, frankly, will provide me with a degree of validation that the time I pour into this labor of love matters to people. And I\u0027m sure it will help give me that extra motivation I need to dust off the rough draft of my book and finish it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless, my website will continue to be free for all to read, but I do intend to offer perks for those who donate. They will include early access to bigger posts (i.e., team previews) and exclusive content including occasional patron-only posts and bonus photos from games. If you\u0027re familiar with my work, you know that I write hundreds of posts every year, and have always been dedicated to keeping up the quality of my work no matter what\u0027s happening in my life at the time. That, of course, will continue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time, and please know that I appreciate your readership regardless of whether you choose to donate. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at \u003ca\u003eMWLtraveler@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e."
