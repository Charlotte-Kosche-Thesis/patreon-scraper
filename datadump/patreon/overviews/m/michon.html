Why? Because cuil theory is fantastic and absurd and yet still ties together just like life.\u003cbr\u003eJust as intersectional feminism acknowledges and branches out from the reality that systems of oppression, privilege, and power dynamics are integrated, so does cuil fiction acknowledge this facet about life, the universe, and everything within literature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCuil Levels:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA cuil level is assigned to each work. These range from level one to level seven. Each level is progressively further removed from reality as we know it. Cuil Levels are from 1-6 and in ascending order for the amount of craziness/presence of surreality/ratio of queer/disabled/POC to straight/cis/able-bodied people. And Level 0 is downright bizarre and uncomfortable for everyone, including me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen there is level zero, which is so far removed it actually circles around and reflects reality and cuil reality. In general, the higher the cuil level the more absurd, impossible, and insane the events. Basically, it\u2019s like the books are ranked from realistic fiction to anime-level creativity and insanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the hell does that mean?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, cuil fiction is intersectional fiction. That means stories about intersex, POC, pansexual, women, gender variant, ace, aromantic, autistic, disabled, kinky people and all others normally marginalized, ignored, or misrepresented in media are centered without explanation or angst.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntroducing Cuil Press:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re interested in learning how to write Cuil, you can book me \u003ca href=\"http://postmodernwoman.com/product/presentationworkshop/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.
