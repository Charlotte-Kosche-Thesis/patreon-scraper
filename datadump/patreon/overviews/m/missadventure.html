    "summary": "Hello. Thanks for taking a few minutes to peruse this page.\u003cbr\u003eAs I write this I can hear a Northerly wind outside the boat. We\u0027ve had heavy gusts rocking the boat for three days now. Thankfully I am in a marina and not hanging from an anchor, rolling from toe rail to toe rail, feeling sick when I look at the screen. I am telling you this because\u00a0I live on a sailboat and I write stories about sailing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write between 1000 and 4000 words every day. As long as I am not actually on watch or on the helm, or bailing us out, I stick to my routine. Writing starts as close to 7am as possible. (This is easiest in the summer.) I write until about 12 or 1pm by which time I am a bit fried and all those boat jobs I have been putting off are clamouring for my attention. That makes my weekly output somewhere in the 10k to 20k words mark.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow you don\u0027t want to be reading all that. Do you? Besides - that\u0027s first draft stuff. Some of that doesn\u0027t even make sense. I plan to put \u0027work in progress\u0027 out to my Patrons at about the rate of 5 to 10,000 words a week. Assuming I can get an Internet connection! That means you will get 20 to 40,000 words a month for a dollar. This roughly translates to a full 100K novel\u0027s worth about every 2-3 months. Plus all the back catalogue, naturally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be keeping you posted on my approximate whereabouts and brief details of the general \u0027goings-on\u0027 here onboard SV Kasandra. If, for example, we get lost in thick fog, I\u0027ll send you out an email with \"Help\" in the subject line. \u00a0I will be dividing blog entries in half, half being public and half being patrons only.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course it\u0027s not just about the dollar. It\u0027s about having your feedback and support. I taught English and Drama for a long, long time. Right or wrong, I feel as if I learnt nothing about writing and even less about life during those years. I am doing my best to put the last part right by selling up and moving on a boat. The first part is where you come in. I need a friendly critical audience. I am hoping that will be you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have a look at the rewards you can see that there are lots of other ways to be involved, creatively and otherwise, with the books. \u00a0But perhaps you would like to know a bit more about what projects are under way and what is coming next?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\u00a0current project is called \"The Good Seed.\" It is set in a violent, dirty dystopian future. The novel is part hard-boiled crime fiction and part science fiction but the action is never far away from the sea.\u00a0Two brothers sail \"Miss Adventure\" a 42\u0027 Ketch. \u00a0Both are disturbed by events in the past. One suffers from manic depression. He is driven to find something in the world worth saving. The other is a sociopath who is exclusively focussed on survival. \u00a0They are antiheroes who do what they have to do, in order to stay afloat and stay alive. At a time when the world\u0027s food supplies are managed as a profitable enterprise by unscrupulous corporations, they stumble upon a very special kind of seed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be a series of short \u0027satellite\u0027 stories. Set in the same universe and told from the perspective of other characters around the two brothers, I am hoping they will tell me more about the characters and their world. It will also afford me an opportunity to play around with different authorial voices. I have no idea where I might publish them. \u00a0Perhaps they will just be things I share exclusively with Patrons. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuture projects in this series will include the brothers\u0027 back story. In \"Death by Miss Adventure,\" I will be revealing how they got their nick names and how they lived prior to becoming gun-running, strong-arming semi-villains. It begins in an alternate 2017. As food production struggles to meet its needs, the world begins to go to hell in a handcart, taking the two brothers with it for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is hard for me to mention the second project without getting over excited and beginning immediately. \u00a0It is a thriller in the style of H Rider Haggard\u0027s \u003cem\u003eAllan Quatermain\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \u003cem\u003eShe\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0novels. Filled with exotic landscapes, evil overlords and objects of mysterious power, the heroes are a young aristocratic couple. Their story is told by the Edwardian mesmerist and magician, Howard Thurlston. He accompanies them, aboard their vessel, \u003cem\u003eLady Anne\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0through marvellous and entirely fictitious adventures.\u00a0\u00a0Their vessel, the \u003cem\u003eLady Anne\u003c/em\u003e, is the original design from which\u00a0\u003cem\u003eMiss Adventure\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0sprang.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my hope that each of these projects will contain at least two full novels and that they will be complete and published before the year is out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third project is non-fiction. It is the story of yet another couple on a boat having yet another adventure. Only this one is real. Effectively will be a distillation of our blog from aboard SV Kasandra. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet another GRP Ketch, SV Kasandra was designed by Laurent Giles in 1971. Our hull was one of the very first ever produced in 1972. In December 2015, we purchased her for the price of two and half cocker spaniel puppies (long story) and it took until October 2016 before she was back in the water afloat. We sailed her for the first time, Sunday May 14, 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have just begun our travels. We would be thrilled to have you join us along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
