Now on his own and having moved the company to Georgia, Nick continues the charge to develop Japanese-inspired games served up with unique twists and quirks that give the games a Western flair. Previous work experience and personal tastes drive this west-meets-east style and approach. Nick has gone from games journalism to publishing and now game development, making Mr. Tired Media not a newcomer, but an industry veteran!\u003cbr\u003e\"You\u0027re doing a great job, Mr. Tired!\"\u003cbr\u003e",
