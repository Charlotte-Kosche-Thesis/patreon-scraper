If my Patreon page is successful, though, I can focus more on the quality of my work, and create a much better user experience for everyone! Even a $1 pledge brings me closer to my goals!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI release a new mandolin lesson every week\u003c/strong\u003e, so a $1 monthly pledge is similar to giving me 25\u00a2 for every new lesson I make. A $5 pledge is a little over $1 per lesson, etc. Compare that to the $40/hour+ that a private instructor might charge, and it comes out to be fairly reasonable. Again, the lessons will always be free, so if you can\u0027t pledge right now, don\u0027t do it!"
