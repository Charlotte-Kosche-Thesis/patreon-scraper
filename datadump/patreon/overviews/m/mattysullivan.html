I recommend my website (mattysullivan.com), which has several pieces, as well as a link to a free download of my book, \u003cem\u003eShallow Dance. \u003c/em\u003eThere are also some pieces available on this Patreon page, through the Creations tab.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe warned: some of them are in bad taste. In fact, most of them are in bad taste. Not obscene, mind you. And not vulgar. Or maybe only a little bit vulgar. I couldn\u0027t tell you for sure. I\u0027m not very good at determining these sorts of things. But I\u0027ve been told...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway. If you already know me, you already know it\u0027s true. So let\u0027s move on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my writing (or me), this page allows you to lend\u00a0a little support. It\u0027s pretty simple. You just sign up as a Patron of my work and pledge at whatever level\u00a0you feel comfortable with. This is the amount you agree to \"pay\" for each piece I post. I will be posting a maximum of two pieces per week, so that will give you an idea of your total at the end of each month. Twenty-five cents per piece will equal two dollars a month (give or take, depending on how the days fall), and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut take note: my writing is still free through my website (and on this page\u0027s Creations tab). By signing up as a Patron, you are not purchasing anything. You are simply agreeing to support the work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have\u00a0any questions, please send me a note or take a look at the FAQ. I am grateful for any support. Hell, I\u0027m grateful for the simple consideration of support, and I\u0027d be glad to walk you through it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for visiting, and please keep reading.\u003cbr\u003e"
