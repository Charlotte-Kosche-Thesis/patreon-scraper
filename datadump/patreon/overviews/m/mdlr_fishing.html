    "summary": "Hello I\u0027m Mark, a retired U.S. Marine turned full time fisherman. I frequent the waters of the Texas Gulf Coast in search of what I like to call happiness. Fishing for reds, speckled trout, flounder, and many more species have brought a calmness back into my life. For the first time ever I\u0027m living in the now. My passion for fishing is something I want to share with y\u0027all. There\u0027s no way to describe a school of tailing reds that\u0027s feeding on shrimp. The sounds are heart racing and unforgettable. So what better way to share my experiences than through video. The majority of my outings are from an eco friendly vessel that leaves no human footprint behind. My kayak allows me the freedom to go where the fish love to feed and do it in a way as to not destroying their habitat. If you share the same passion and enjoy watching my videos. Please consider becoming a supporter of my channel as a Patron! With your help I can travel to new and exciting places to share with you and the world. And most importantly I\u0027ll be able to offset the demanding costs of equipment that\u0027s used on a daily to provide high quality content that you\u0027ve come to expect from me. THANK YOU for stopping by!!!"
