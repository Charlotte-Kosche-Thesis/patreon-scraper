    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eWHAT IS MAKING MADNESS?\u003c/h1\u003eMaking Madness is something I\u0027m starting with the intention of giving my life to the crafts of creativity and creation. Creativity in how I approach life\u0027s challenges and opportunities. Creation in discovering entertaining ways to express myself and my worldview.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never believed myself to be the best at anything but on that same note, I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve ever come close to my best. My goal here is through hard work and a little luck to discover my potential for myself and for all of you lovely people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWHAT DO WE CREATE?\u003c/h1\u003eMaking Madness primarily specializes in film analysis and short fiction, releasing \u003cem\u003eThe Craft\u003c/em\u003e video essays every other Wednesday and weekly entries in the series \u003cem\u003eTwenty-Something \u003c/em\u003eon Fridays. Episodes of \u003cem\u003eTwenty-Something\u003c/em\u003e are developed over a two to three week period going through four or more drafts. Video essays are a more time consuming affair, involving a minimum of two weeks to research and an additional week to edit. For artists with more extensive bodies of work (John Ford or David Lean, for example) the research period can take over month. All in all, this averages 20 hours of work each week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, this is just the tip of the iceberg. As the process is refined and our budget increases, we will be afforded opportunities to add new content in a variety of creative forms. This would include audio downloads of \u003cem\u003eTwenty-Something\u003c/em\u003e, weekly video releases, additional written material, short films, contributing artists and much more. If it tells a story, we\u0027re likely to try it. As far we\u0027re concerned, limits are a myth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eUnlike Kickstarter or IndieGoGo which tend to rely on larger donations to support a single project, Patreon allows for on going support through small donations. For Making Madness, this is particularly important to keeping the output and quality consistent. All of the money from your donations directly supports the development of Making Madness and goes towards better equipment,  software and increasing time that can be spent writing, re-writing, researching, recording, editing, paying our contributor and much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be clear, content will always be free. Patreon has been a resource that has afforded many artists the opportunity to create products they care about and that people enjoy consuming. If you\u0027re able to donate a dollar or two this journey, we have a chance to start something. With any luck, we can make it something special. To anyone who doesn\u0027t have it in their budget to donate or who doesn\u0027t want to, all I ask is that you enjoy the site and share it with anyone else who may enjoy it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck us out at makingmadness.squarespace.com\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"
