    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I? And why on EARTH am I starting a Patreon account?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n**Edited to Add**\u003cbr\u003e\nFunny story. I was all set to make this page live two weeks ago, when the night before, I started having chest pains. A week in the hospital and a 31K hospital visit later, I\u0027m back home and ready to get started again. Fortunately, my insurance paid 27K of that hospital bill, but now I\u0027ve got a $4500 dollar out of pocket bill to pay to doctors, etc. So, it turns out, I\u0027ll need this extra income more than ever. I\u0027ll still use your contributions to self publish, but I\u0027ll also be dipping into this to pay some of those bills. ***END ADDITION**\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18299991_675452125973782_788377436575236096_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey there! I\u0027m Manda Collins, and since 2010 I\u0027ve written twelve books for St. Martin\u0027s Press set in Regency England, and a couple of self-published novellas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the fall of 2015, I quit my day job, where I was working as an academic librarian, to write full time. I did this for a couple of reasons: 1) I was literally killing myself (thanks to some health problems) working by day and writing on nights and weekend.. 2) I (thought) I\u0027d reached the point in my writing career where I could afford to take the plunge.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn the first front, I was right. My body, and health issues, improved greatly once I was able to work at my own pace, and I even improved my productivity as a writer.\u00a0On the second front, not so much. I could blather on about the market, and downturns, and discoverability, but the short answer is that my writing income went down last year. (Because of course it did.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m not here asking you to bankroll me out of the kindness of your heart. I\u0027ve got something to offer. I\u0027ve got a novel I\u0027d like to self publish. And I want you to help. Twice a month, I\u0027ll publish a chapter of PORTRAIT OF A NIGHTINGALE here, and in the weeks between, I\u0027ll post blogs and think pieces and bits of historical research that I used to write it. You\u0027ve heard writers talk about \"the book of my heart\"? Well, POAN is the book of my heart. It draws on the research I did while I was earning my MA in English from the University of Alabama, where I focused pretty heavily on Victorian women\u0027s writing. The heroine, Miss Penelope Monckton, is just back from serving with Florence Nightingale in the Crimea, and soon finds herself embroiled in a murder mystery involving famous poet, and widower of Penny\u0027s childhood best friend, the dangerous Earl of Rickarby.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut Manda, you\u0027ll say, \"You\u0027re already a published author! Why don\u0027t you just get your publisher to just crank this one out?\" Funny story, but this is actually the book that got me my agent, the glorious Holly Root. And she tried like heck to sell it. And then the market tanked. There are newspaper stories about Black Friday 2009. Look it up. So, we tearfully put POAN away and I wrote HOW TO DANCE WITH A DUKE, which \u003cem\u003edid\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0sell. But I\u0027ve never forgotten Penny and Rickarby. And darn it, I want you to read it! It\u0027s pretty good. And I think you\u0027d like it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSelf-publishing, however, is not as easy (or as cheap) as it looks. Because unlike with St. Martin\u0027s, I\u0027ll have to pay for 1) editing 2) copy editing 3) proofreading 4) formatting 5) a cover 6) snacks (okay, technically snacks are not a publishing expense, but I do need fuel to work, so...yeah, it is a publishing expense! There I said it.) Anyway, it can cost upwards of 2500 bucks to publish one novel. And I want this thing to look good. You, the reader, deserve a good looking, well-edited book. And I want to give it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd if this thing goes well, I\u0027ve got a couple of other projects waiting patiently for me to have the time and cash to give them the same treatment. Including, a contemporary romantic suspense \u003cbr\u003e\nproject. If we hit enough subscribers, I\u0027ll show it to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut what\u0027s in it for you? 1) You\u0027ll get lots of great prizes and giveaways as part of my super exclusive Patreon group. 2) You\u0027ll get early access to the Book-of-my-Heart 3) You\u0027ll make sure that my brand of \u003cstrong\u003emystery-tinged romance, with super sexy Beta Heroes\u003c/strong\u003e keeps on keeping on in the current Alpha heavy market. 4) You\u0027ll get access to content you won\u0027t be able to find anywhere else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy healthcare bill has changed the ETA on getting the self-pub of PORTRAIT OF A NIGHTINGALE off the ground, but hopefully we\u0027ll get there before too long. And in the meantime, we can have some fun and you can take a look inside my process. And I can get some feedback directly from you, my readers! It\u0027s a Win-Win!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u0027s do this, y\u0027all!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
