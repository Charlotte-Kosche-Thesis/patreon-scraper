    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThere are only a few things in life I\u2019d rather do than make a fun video for you...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of them is make a BUNCH of fun videos for you. This Patreon page will help make that happen and add just a little more joy, wonder, weirdness, and laughs to the world :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(If you haven\u2019t seen my videos please check them out on \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SirMichaelMccurdy\"\u003emy YouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started filmmaking early on in high school. While my peers were doing teenager things, such as having fun, I was spending countless hours shut in my bedroom reading editing manuals the size of my head and experimenting with the finer points in filmmaking--mostly animating modeling clay monsters eating lego dudes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day I was walking down the school hall when a student I didn\u2019t really know stopped me and said something like \u201cHey! Your lego video was awesome!\u201d I had left a short film of mine on one of the school computers and apparently half the school had seen it\u2026 and loved it! It was cool enough to have turned inanimate objects into \u201cliving\u201d characters on screen but then WAIT, HOLD ON. PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKED WATCHING SOMETHING I MADE?!!! That mind-blowing revelation was enough to almost fry my adolescent brain and was a pretty big milestone for me as a filmmaker. And it\u2019s what continues to give me inspiration: bringing worlds and ideas to life and sharing them with other people who really love them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFlash forward 15 years, past film school and lots of video gigs and I\u2019ve realized I haven\u2019t actually been doing what I love: making my own art. I\u2019ve been so focused on trying to find work as a filmmaker/videographer here in my small but awesome home town of Port Townsend, Washington that I haven\u2019t been doing \u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e projects, the ones I do not because anyone asks me to, \u003cem\u003ebut because I\u2019m inspired to\u003c/em\u003e. I want to keep making those films! And I know people like you want to see them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is why I\u2019m here on Patreon asking for your help. Yes, I\u2019m asking for your money but I\u2019m not going to just take it and run off to the Bahamas (although if I did you can be sure I\u2019d make a cool video while I was there), \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m going to share back\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. Besides putting sumo-sized amounts of my time into these videos and releasing them to the world for free I want to give you, my supporter, access to a more personal look at my creation process and filmmaking life. And I\u2019d like to involve you more directly in my journey and the decisions I make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been able to squeeze in a few of my films in between my video work gigs these past few years but if there\u2019s one thing I want you to know it\u2019s this: \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eyou\u2019ve only seen a very small percentage of the ideas in my head\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. How about a stop motion film made with bananas? Or a hand drawn cartoon? A bro-dance video? A fictional documentary about phosphorescent migrating snails? I\u2019m super excited that after years of feeling like these ideas were just daydreams, now, with your help, they might finally become real videos for the world to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will not only help bring these ideas to life but will also help me grow as an artist. How awesome would it be to not only keep making these videos but to \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etake them to the next level\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e? I appreciate any support you can give!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMichael\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
