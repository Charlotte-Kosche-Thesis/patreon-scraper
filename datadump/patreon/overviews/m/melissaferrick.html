    "summary": "Aug. 2018 will mark twenty five years since my debut album was released. WOW! I have been making records and touring since then. I started teaching five years ago and have found although I am still into writting songs and making music,\u00a0 I am also interested in other forms of art: podcasts, photography, and creative writing. I started graduate school in Aug. 2017--this will take two years to finish, during this time period it will be extremely difficult for me to play live shows which has historically financed my art making. So, I\u0027ve decided to give this a try. I don\u0027t have much to offer in the way of \"rewards\" so I am keeping this really simple; give what you can and see what I\u0027m up to here. I will post a video soon--I am just getting this up off the ground."
