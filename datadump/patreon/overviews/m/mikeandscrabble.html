     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello! my name is Mike, I am a loser and I live in Brighton, well, actually I live in Hove but nobody knows where that is, so we\u2019ll call it Brighton. I share a flat with a dog called Scrabble, on the roof of an old factory on a street that winds down to the sea front.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was a kid I always wanted to be an artist. I started as I meant to go on by failing my Art O\u2019Level twice, so I became a salesman instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVariously, I sold televisions and cameras, photocopiers and fax machines, cornflakes, slacks and hand-dryers. Luckily, I was very good at getting jobs, because I was also an expert at losing them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI married my school sweetheart, and we made two children \u2013 one of each \u2013 a smart one and a clever one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccidentally, I learnt to make television programmes, and whilst I did that I tripped over the internet when it was as young and stupid as I.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got divorced from my school sweetheart, which was awful, and I moved to a flat in London Zoo, well, actually it was in Camden but nobody knows where that is, so we\u2019ll call it a Zoo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter expertly losing some more jobs, I learnt to teach instead of doing, and I travelled the world talking rubbish to people and getting paid to do so. Then I met a Perfect Human and I proposed to her in Africa, and then married her in a garden tent. We exchanged gifts \u2013 I gave her problems, she gave me grace, hope and a new family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI stopped getting jobs because I had become too good at losing them, so instead, I got cancer \u2013 which is much more difficult to misplace. When my Perfect Human\u2019s daughter also became ill, we got a dog called Rolo to help us both get well; then I lost Rolo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I am good at losing things, I lost my cancer last year, well, technically I\u2019ve misplaced it for a few years, but I also managed to misplace my Perfect Human, for a while, and I moved to Brighton (well, Hove) to find my health and myself. When I got here I found Scrabble, well, she found me, really. I started to draw pictures of Scrabble and Brighton and I shared them on Twitter and Facebook, and I found some nice people who asked if they could buy them, in frames, on their walls, and I became an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen a nice lady called Jude found Scrabble and me in a corner of the internet. Jude asked if she could make a book of our pictures, which you\u2019ve just found. Try not to lose it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mike-Scrabble-guide-training-human/dp/1787110001/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e(Taken from Mike\u0026amp;Scrabble: A guide to training your new human, available on Amazon and in all good bookshops)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
