    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re here. \u003cstrong\u003eSharing music with, and meeting so many of you over the past few years has been the most profound gift of my life.\u003c/strong\u003e It\u2019s all of you who make it possible for me to put so much of myself into making and sharing music; I\u2019m awed by, and grateful for your existence. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI write and share music to bring us each closer to our own hearts. \u003c/strong\u003eWhen I can feel my heart, I can feel yours more, and my compassion for you expands. I think that\u0027s true for all of us; I believe creating and sharing vulnerable, honest music that invites listeners into their own feelings is an integral part of creating the evermore compassionate, connected world I want to live in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m at a new and exciting stage in my career.\u003c/strong\u003e This project wants to grow, and I want to make sure it has everything it needs in order to do so. Money is one of those things. In the past 16 months, I\u2019ve played over 120 house concerts, met and shared music with thousands of you, gone on 4 tours (one was a 3 month, 50 show, 13,000 mile tour!), and have connected personally with hundreds of you via the internet in response to my \u201cMary Oliver\u201d music video (currently viewed 240k+ times). Your support has kept me going when fear\u2019s tried to silence me - you\u0027ve bought my merchandise, signed up for my email list, expressed a heartfelt desire to see me continue growing, and have taught me in your own unique ways that \u003cstrong\u003ethis isn\u2019t about me, but what I can offer.\u003c/strong\u003e In those moments, I feel your love and support deeply. After the glow of the show fades, too often our shining moments of deep connection and accountability do, as well. I want to keep those moments alive after we part ways, and I move into the creation process.\u003cstrong\u003e I want you with me in an ongoing way. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThose of you who have been to my shows or have bought my music know that I operate on a pay-what-you-feel basis for both concert admission and CD sales.\u003c/strong\u003e I have no intentions of changing that; I want my music to be accessible to whoever\u2019s being pulled toward it. Patreon is a way for that to remain sustainable, and for the production quality of my offerings to continue improving. Beyond the practical reasons for getting a Patreon account, taking this scary step forward is me acting on something I believe in:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArtists are a vital part of any thriving community. I trust in art to bring us back home to ourselves and one another when the chaos of modern life fragments us. I want to live in a world where art is supported and valued; among other currencies, we support what we\u2019d like to see more of with our dollars. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have some big, exciting plans for this year \u003c/strong\u003e-- including another nationwide tour, a new music video series (#songswithfriends. Keep your eye out for it - I\u0027m wildly excited), and the creation of my first studio album(!!) -- and now, more than ever, really need to feel my community\u0027s support. I\u2019m currently my own booker, manager, social media manager, business consultant, web designer, etc., -- but I\u0027m no sound engineer, videographer, video editor, or graphic designer.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat is where you and Patreon come in.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eThis site is all about cultivating our connection, and building a community that will support the creation of more, and better quality art. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon? How does it work? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in the day, Kings, Popes, and the ultra-wealthy provided large sums of money to artists creating works they deemed valuable. Things have changed. Now, \u003cstrong\u003eelevating an artist requires the coming together of a community.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way for you to support my music career in a lasting, sustaining way. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works: \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou pledge an amount of your choice per month. Depending on the amount of your monthly pledge, you get perks that include, but aren\u0027t limited to: access to my Patron-Only Stream (expect intimate blog posts, poetry, favorite song of the moment, blurbs from my diary, etc.), early access to videos, a monthly google hangout Q \u0026amp; A (+ songs!), free MP3 downloads, your name in the credits of my videos, a Google Hangout DANCE PARTY, and more (for all of the perks, look to your right!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is a way for us to come closer together as a community - for you to have a window into the inner workings of what it takes to be a thriving independent musician, and to be part of what makes it possible. Your support will allow me to take this project as far as it wants to go, instead of constantly running up against practical hurdles. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith your support, I\u2019m confident that: \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019ll start and release a new video series called #songswithfriends -- arranging harmonies for my talented musician friend\u2019s original songs and filming us playing together, sharing their magic with you\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019ll take this summer\u2019s nationwide summer house concert tour (w/ Deep Pools!) to new exciting places\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy production quality will go way up (both audio and video)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019ll release a lot more music\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u2019ll become more connected to ourselves and one another through more regular communications\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI never thought this would be my life. \u003c/strong\u003eI didn\u2019t sing a note until I excavated my voice in the Hawaiian jungle nearly 6 years ago (a story you\u2019ll hear in more detail if you become a patron!). But here I am! This is my heart and soul\u2019s calling, and I\u2019m doing everything I can to not only get out of the way, but support it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know me, you know that I\u2019m going to do all of this regardless of the outcome of this Patreon, and that I\u2019m going to share my art with whoever wants it.

A self-taught artist, she draws influence from her years of worldwide travel as well as the nuances of everyday life and relationships.
