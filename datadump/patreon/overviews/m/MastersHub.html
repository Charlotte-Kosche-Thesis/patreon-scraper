    "summary": "Hey and hello Masters, thank you for joining the Masters Hub on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile there are a gazillion opportunities on the Internet to meet new friends or connect your business idea with others, I have always missed that extra factor of awareness and conscious creations. And I don\u0027t mean spiritual airy fairy networks in ashrams. I mean badass, real embodiment realisation on earth, while being connected to life and in life. \u003cbr\u003eThat brings certain challenges with itself and sounds far more romantic than it really is. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow do you deal with the manifestations in your life? \u003cbr\u003eAre you also sometimes confused about what is being delivered to your doorstep, because it is not quite matching what you ordered? \u003cbr\u003eWhat about\u00a0bringing forth\u00a0your true passion, while the world laughs at your creations?\u003cbr\u003eLet alone not being able to share because your environment is convinced you\u0027re speaking Kisuaheli...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are not alone on this journey! \u003cbr\u003eRight now there are\u00a0over 660 Masters in our Facebook group\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1004166116363628/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1004166116363628/\u003c/a\u003e talking about their impulses and realisations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this safe space here we share not only the good, the bad and the ugly but will share more in depth insights, inspirations and potentials to connect back to life. Because ultimately life is about living fully being aware of all your senses. Imagine what\u0027s possible when sovereign creators from all over the world meet... then 1+1 truly equals infinite potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to find a personal trainer that includes awareness in the sessions?\u003cbr\u003eAre you looking for a coach that really inspires you to walk on with your true potential instead of going through the list of childhood problems?\u003cbr\u003eLooking for an interior designer that connects with your real essence and makes that visible?\u003cbr\u003eSearching for a filmmaker that captures your business idea in a marketing image film?\u003cbr\u003eOr are you one of them looking for some inspiring connections?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an interactive space. Let me know what you would like me to address in my videos, what ideas you would like to manifest and what you want to share and who to connect to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere you will be the first to find out all about upcoming international Hub events that include special talks on a variety of topics, presentations of conscious creators, Network events, online classes, etc\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Masters Hub connects young \u0026amp; old masters, aware businesses \u0026amp; private people, visionnaires \u0026amp; searchers and most importantly consciousness \u0026amp; inspiration to create a new understanding of co-existence and co-creation on all levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBio:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe Masters Hub was founded in June 2016 to facilitate a safe space for conscious creators / Masters to connect and inspire each other. Our first gathering was in August \u002716 where 22 masters came from all over the world to present and share their creations. Since then our network \u0026amp; community has grown to over 660 members, we have had 3 amazing Masters Hub events, 30 Masters have travelled well over 150.000 km to share their journey into realisation. Some awesome co creations have been birthed thanks to the Masters Hub and it ain\u0027t stopping any time soon. \u003cbr\u003eOur next get together is in June this year where we will have a masters BBQ celebration and co host the first event, giving Master Lauren Hutton (find her Patreon page here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/laurenhutton)\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/laurenhutton)\u003c/a\u003e the opportunity to present her beautiful work.\u003cbr\u003eLater on this year we will be travelling and would love to have a few Hub events on the road. Should you be interested in hosting us, please contact sandra@mastershub.nl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout me, the founder: Being an essence coach / spaceholder / facilitator it is my passionate joy and expression to bring potentials together and connect the dots beyond what this world likes to believe is possible. \u003cbr\u003eThe Masters Hub is a new energy creation that keeps evolving and is flowing and becoming a grander version of itself all the time. It is my grandest creation yet and is nurtured by each and every master that contributes in any form - through activity in the community, actual co creations, financial support and just by the energy and love everyone is giving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sky ain\u0027t the limit!
