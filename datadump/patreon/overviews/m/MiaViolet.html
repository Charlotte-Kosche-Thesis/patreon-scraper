I have a Masters degree in Media Studies which I earned by waffling on about fandom, comic books, online communities and other geeky junk. I just adore nerdy media. Meanwhile I ran Panels And Pixels for years specifically writing about comics, video games and tabletop games, with reviews and opinion pieces.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMore recently I\u2019ve been writing about trans issues, and more general topics too such as self-love and self-care. My main focus is on pieces that aim to help other trans people or convince cis people to better understand how they can help us. If you\u2019ve followed me on Twitter, you\u2019ll know I\u2019m rather opinionated about trans rights!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo going forward I want to keep doing more of both.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the situation is:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m lucky enough to be employed, but my modest pay goes entirely towards supporting myself and my partner, who is struggling to find any work that will accommodate her fibromyalgia.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe idea behind this Patreon is that the money raised will go towards both transition and living costs.
