    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, I\u0027m Ross Connell, \u003c/strong\u003eI live in Nottingham, England\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e(famous for charming rogue Robin Hood)\u00a0and I run\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.moregamesplease.com/\"\u003eMore Games Please\u003c/a\u003e a site focused on\u00a0board game art and interviewing those involved in it. Firstly, thank you for joining me on this page, it\u0027s great that you\u0027re interested in knowing more. I absolutely love board games, they\u0027ve brought my friends together and has given me friendships with strangers that I never anticipated or expected. In the last few years as my interest in the hobby has grown I\u0027ve started photographing them (see: my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/moregamesplease\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e) and talking about them more. I also wanted to find a way to give back to this community that\u0027s given me so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59230491cd0f6848c4b2f9f5/5aae74291ae6cf0c78ccf1ad/5aafea006d2a7363591f1bea/1521478164133/hardback2.jpg?format=1500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI created my site\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0as a cultural library of board game art and the talented individuals behind it. Despite there being so many websites about board games, these are usually focused on things like reviews, previews, game mechanics or player count. For More Games Please I wanted to make sure that art was the core topic of conversation and importantly to bring those who create it to the forefront. Their stories are what my site is about and I want the opportunity to continue to tell those stories, in more detail and in new, different ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn the first 12 months\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u0027ve interviewed 40 different board game artists as well as organized a vote for the\u00a0\u003cem\u003eBest Board Game Art of 2017\u003c/em\u003e which hundreds of you got involved in. Needless to say, I\u0027ve got a lot more interviews on the way in 2018 and I\u0027m also working on some new features too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m here because as much as I love this project, keeping the site online costs me not only time but money. The time aspect I\u0027m fine with, I love talking to the artists and getting to share these stories with you, but, the web hosting and fees add up to a\u00a0couple of hundred dollars a year. If you want to help me keep the site going, perhaps we could share the cost of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals for the future: \u003c/strong\u003eI would love to\u00a0be able to do extended interviews, both in a written format as well as via podcast/youtube but that\u0027s unlikely without\u00a0more time and money being spent on my part.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m excited to\u00a0continue to work on improving the content, talking to more artists and gaining more insight on your behalf and I\u0027m excited to see where this road takes us."
