Video game fan art is okay too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I\u0027m here because I dislike working in the corporate world, and am quite simply sick of it. SO, I would like to use my skills for a living and whip up some dank arts. For you, for me, and for the betterment of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut MAD, how could art possibly have any value in the world?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI may be MAD, but you\u0027re crazy if you don\u0027t think art has no historical or current value. Art has inspired, beautified, and filled the world with meaning. Watching a single work of art can change one\u0027s life entirely. Think of a show or movie or book you like. Has it inspired any of your thoughts? If so, is it not guilty of changing your world as a result of influencing your thought patterns?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eANYWAY, long story short, I want to draw stuff that you want me to draw, that I want to draw, and hopefully we can some fun and maybe change the world while we\u0027re at it. Why not, right?\u003cbr\u003e"
