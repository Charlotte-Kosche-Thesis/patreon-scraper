After the 2016 election, the establishment partnered up with the biggest players in information sharing \u2014 Facebook and Google \u2014 to exterminate independent, watchdog journalism like MintPress under the guise of fighting \u201cfake news\u201d after Hillary Clinton lost the election to Donald Trump. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only was Hillary\u2019s loss blamed on Russia, but any journalism outlet that reported on her hawkish and exploitive political background was deemed as Putin minions spreading fake news. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need to restore the fourth estate now more than ever. We need to show the establishment that they can\u2019t silence us. And, we need your help to fight back. While Facebook, Google, and others ramp up their efforts to make watchdog journalism algorithmically disappear, we\u2019re ramping up our efforts to circumvent corporate censorship.
