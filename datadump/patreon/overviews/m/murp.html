Thank you!!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\\m/\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYour Support means:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst, we must have consistent high quality audio for our videos! \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eLet\u0027s be honest, I\u0027m not very good at the mix and master thing. \u00a0Sometimes I get lucky, but for the most part not so much. \u00a0We want to send our audio tracks to a proper studio for mixing and mastering. \u00a0As a musician, nothing is more frustrating than not being\u00a0heard the way you intended.  I firmly believe that Murp can be properly\u00a0mixed and still retain it\u0027s rawness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecondly,\u003c/strong\u003e we have got to get out of the basement!\u003c/strong\u003e  I can totally\u00a0appreciate the coolness of shooting a metal video in a basement, however we have done it almost 80 times!!  It\u0027s time to grow.  We want\u00a0badass and engaging videos!  We will utilize film majors that are eager to show off their stuff.  We will rarely use the same person twice which\u00a0will keep video styles unique and fresh.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor Live Murp\u003c/strong\u003e we are not as established.  Sure the kids have been\u00a0on national TV and played Radio City Music Hall, but that was a reality show.  We want to \u003cstrong\u003etravel to your city\u003c/strong\u003e and play shows for actual fans! \u00a0Building up this aspect of the band will take a lot of time, work and money. \u00a0 Sadly, I\u0027m not a 17 year old kid that can blow off my job to play a 50$ gig 3 states away. \u00a0A successful Patreon campaign will allow me to take time off from work to tour, pay for studio time and release a full length album!\u003cbr\u003e  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is not \u003cem\u003eeBegging\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0, nor does it create a \u003cem\u003epaywall\u003c/em\u003e for fans. \u00a0It does give perks for Patrons, \u003cstrong\u003ebut the main content will always remain free. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 If we can get even 5% of our fans to pledge 2 bucks a month, it would have an immediate and drastic effect.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/loudwire.com/files/2013/07/252204_390124727735591_529838143_n-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe upload a new Music Video once a month, you agree to pledge a dollar amount per month that you are comfortable with. \u00a0The amount you pledge will be used for the next video. \u00a0That\u0027s it! \u00a0You can change or cancel your pledge amount any time with no fee\u0027s or restrictions, it\u0027s very flexible!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThe Patreon Feed! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThis is where we can interact with our most hardcore fans and get to know you better! \u00a0This is where you can see behind the scenes footage. \u00a0We\u0027ll bounce song ideas off you, video concept ideas, stuff like that.
