    "summary": "I spent many years strongly opposed to drug use. I am the last person you\u2019d expect to start a website dedicated to cannabis. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen it was legalized, I tried it, and I began to understand why so many people turn to marijuana for recreation and medicinal purposes. This was brand new to me. I discovered many benefits. And I made many mistakes. I\u0027ll share those in the hope that you won\u0027t do the same.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eCannabis allows me to experience life-changing realizations and personal healing beyond my wildest imagination. It will be a formidable task to convey the complicated and wondrous. Imagine Maslow\u0027s Hierarchy of Needs were a pyramid of Swiss cheese; cannabis filled in all the holes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI have been studying all aspects of health since my 7th Grade Science Fair, when I began with the questions: Who am I, why, and how do I make myself healthier and happier? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow every day I also study some aspect of cannabis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my goal to take what I have learned and what I continue to learn and bring it to you in a friendly, approachable format. There are many many cannabis websites but I think my Patreon page and my website MarijuanaWisdom.com will be much easier to follow for anyone who has the least possible interest in High Times Magazine, but still wants to know what\u0027s going on with the plant.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are lots of free articles. To get exclusive content (the juicy stuff), just pledge a little. Help a writer out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I had to do for that science fair was build a damn volcano, but instead I went for the philosophical, the existential, the metaphysical. And I am continually fascinated by it every single day. (Stupid science fair.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace, \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMary Beth\u003cbr\u003e"
