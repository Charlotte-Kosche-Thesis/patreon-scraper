    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* DISCLAIMER - PLEASE READ BEFORE DONATING *\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am reluctant to accept donations as \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI CAN NOT PROMISE\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e that I will keep working on this project on a timely basis, nor did I want to be beholden to anyone who may contribute their hard earned money to this. There are times when all I want to do is work on it, other times when I really don\u0027t feel like it, so \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eONLY DONATE\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e being aware of this. Think of it as \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLEAVING A TIP\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e for work done, as opposed to \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFUNDING FUTURE PROJECTS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, which I can not guarantee will happen. I may want to just quit at anytime because honestly, making these takes up an extraordinary amount of time and energy.\u00a0 I will keep you updated on whether or not I am working on them and you just have to believe me or not.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eONE TIME DONATIONS\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e are welcome. Just join for a month. I just don\u0027t want people feeling ripped off for giving there money and not seeing enough new content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have set up this page for anyone interested in donating a dollar or any amount they wish to help fund the project going forward. Donations will be going toward expenses involved in the creation of these videos, such as paying for equipment and sound design work, and\u00a0monthly expenses in general. Depending on the donations, I may be able to get work done faster as I won\u0027t necessarily have to take freelance or studio jobs. I may even consider employing others to help. \u00a0As far as rewards go, I\u0027m open to suggestions but keep in mind that creating the videos alone is a lot of work and so I don\u0027t really want to dedicate a lot of time to updating this page with progress reports or screen shots or sending out gifts and stuff like that. On top of that I\u0027m not big into sharing \u0027work in progress\u0027 material. But maybe with your suggestions we can come up with some kind of incentive to donate. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Superman vs Hulk Project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been making the Superman vs Hulk animated videos\u00a0since around 2010. Originally I had wanted to do one long fight but soon realized it would take way too long so decided I would break them up into installments and post as I go. Currently have parts 1, 2 and 3 on YouTube and in the process of finishing up part 4. I earn a modest revenue from the YouTube views which helps to fund the production of these videos. I have no idea how much longer this project will go (not sure I thought I\u0027d still be even working on it this long) but I imagine it will go to a part 5 and possibly conclude on a part 6.\u00a0As it is a 3D animated project and I\u0027m aiming for a high production quality it is a very slow and very time consuming project, but it\u0027s a project I enjoy working on (most of the time).\u00a0I have set up  this account for anyone with disposable income wanting to donate to the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
