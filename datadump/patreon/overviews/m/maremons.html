    "summary": "Hello, my name is McKinley \"Maremons\" Hudson, and I enjoy making music for you, the people that appreciate what I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are plenty of orchestral, jazz, and chamber orchestrations/arrangements of popular music, but for a long time, I\u0027ve been interested in creating orchestral versions of pieces that seem very complex. I gravitate toward highly technical guitar music, but I strive to bring  interesting and satisfying orchestral reproductions of talented bands and artists, irrespective of genre! All that said, I compose a lot of my own music, and my ultimate goal is to acquire the proper gear and knowledge to independently create professional recordings for all of you, whether they are orchestral, guitar-oriented, etc...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past six years I\u0027ve done many projects like this in the spare time I\u0027ve had, and I have been fortunate to have gained a considerable audience on Youtube and Soundcloud. Creating these, however, takes quite a bit of time and energy. Anywhere from 10-150 hours of work might go into one piece, depending on the length, complexity, and how clearly intricate parts can be heard in the mix of a particular song. Currently, I work nights as a freight associate, but I would like to make this my primary occupation. I want to make more of these for people to enjoy (as well as upgrade the sound sample quality), and if we are going to make that happen, then I will need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for sharing and supporting; every bit is greatly appreciated! I hope this will allow me to devote more time to working directly for you, the people who enjoy all of this organized sound that I enjoy creating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, listening, and being a homie! I hope that you\u0027ll join me on this journey toward creating a ton of beautiful music together.\u003cbr\u003e"
