We\u0027ve had a good deal of attention and support from people around the world as there are simply so few working profitable Permaculture farms around, and we\u0027ve managed to do this in the challenging climate of Scandinavia. In fact, we\u0027re the northernmost Permaculture farm on the planet up at 59\u00b0N, and we\u0027ve purchased and developed our farm on a shoestring budget. We\u0027ve purchased and developed the farm with a budget similar to what the average person in Sweden spends on a house.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wrote and published \u003ca href=\"http://www.makingsmallfarmswork.info/\"\u003eMaking Small Farms Work\u003c/a\u003e, which has been sent out to 79 countries so far and received awesome reviews. We\u0027ve dedicated our lives to both demonstrating and teaching others how to design their farms and businesses to be successful. Farming is a way of life. It\u0027s tough, and always has been, but it\u0027s an extremely rewarding pathway. We\u0027re dedicated to sharing our knowledge and expertise through our publications, \u003ca href=\"http://www.ridgedalepermaculture.com/\"\u003etraining programs\u003c/a\u003e and with our growing fan base on \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/2moJnlL\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXsANNfALus\u0026amp;t=143s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXsANNfALus\u0026amp;t=143s...\u003c/a\u003e This is a link to the first video from our 4th season at the farm, the first of over 130 episodes from 2017.\u00a0 The quality has improved throughout the season, but it is the content we are very much focused on!\u00a0 As we begin 2018 we are working with Patreon so those who enjoy, benefit and learn from our content can support the development of the channel if they wish. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping to put more time into sharing the 5th season and improve the quality and consistency of the material we publish.\u00a0 If we reach our goals I will also be able to travel to other pioneering farms to broaden the benefit this channel can bring to people around the world.\u00a0 Patrons will have access to all videos a week before the public, and I will only be answering questions in this space.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is a good pledge? Well, that\u0027s totally up to you.\u00a0 If you value our channel, learn a bunch and want to get even more from it, you can decide what it\u0027s worth to you.\u00a0 One way you could relate to it is $10/month is like 2 cups of coffee on the high street here.\u00a0 If watching 12 videos a month is worth that to you, then we reckon that\u0027s a good amount.\u00a0 If you\u0027re moved to donate more, that\u0027s awesome.\u00a0 If that\u0027s too much for you, or you don\u0027t want to donate at all, that\u0027s awesome too!\u00a0\u00a0We have set a goal of 200 Patrons to grow the channel. That\u0027s just 1% of our current subscribers, but that would be an awesome start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel like you really benefit from our channel, and want to reach out, there are other ways to reciprocate\u00a0support through direct exchange;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://2261290-584709888968434153.preview.editmysite.com/uploads/2/2/6/1/2261290/screen-shot-2017-12-30-at-15-01-26_orig.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil the creation of money, the current economic system was based on direct exchanges.\u00a0 We can also see that the difficulty is assessing the number of tomatoes equivalent to a chicken and the problems of a direct exchange of chickens and whales was\u00a0probably the main drivers of the creation of money.\u00a0 From the 3rd century BC, any action or object produced by human beings, fruit of the combined efforts of the highly developed telencephalon and the opposable thumb, as well as all living and nonliving things on and under the earth, tomatoes, fried eggs, chickens and whales, can be exchanged for money.\u00a0 You know, in the end, a pledge here is going to be most practical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRest assured\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ewe will keep the focus on quality information, sharing knowledge and insight rather than fancy camera work and editing! Many of you express how you enjoy the down-to-earth, on-the-fly, rough-and-ready diary format. We do too. We promise we\u0027ll always keep it real.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much and we look forward to sharing so much more from our farm!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove Richard \u0026amp; Yohanna\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRidgedale Permaculture\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
