I am the author of twenty book and comic book shaped things including \u003cstrong\u003eBOY PROOF \u003c/strong\u003e(A Time Magazine 100 Best YA Books of All Time!) \u003cstrong\u003eTHE PLAIN JANES\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eODD DUCK\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eSTAR WARS: Moving Target\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eSHADE, THE CHANGING GIRL\u003c/strong\u003e and oh so many other things. \u00a0I am a former indie rocker who played under the name Cecil Seaskull / Nerdy Girl. \u00a0I have written a few operas. A few plays. \u00a0An indie film. \u00a0I like to do all sorts of projects like when I did a conceptual piece, \u003ca href=\"https://literarydiaspora.wordpress.com\"\u003eLiterary Diaspora.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, \u00a0I\u0027m an author, artiste and a lady.\u00a0And oh do I want to do all sorts of arty things! \u00a0There are art projects that I put on hold because when you are a freelancer, it\u0027s feast of famine. I figure that if I am able to cover my basic nut, it will free up mental space to do more arty things.\u00a0\u00a0Some things I want to do:\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWrite about one million more novels and comic books \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWrite a new play and do a reading of it. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStart working on the libretto for another opera. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWrite some new songs and put them out.  \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake another movie down the line. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ve committed to participate in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.thearcticcycle.org/ccta-2017\"\u003eArctic Cycle Theatre Challenge \u003c/a\u003eto raise awareness about Climate Change so I want to be able to do this right.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eContinue with my literary and read aloud volunteering at Mayberry Elementary School (16 years now!) and do a musical review reading to get books for the kids for their home libraries.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been toying with the idea of doing a Patreon but have been a little shy. Often times, as a freelancer, I am waiting for cheques (which honestly are not even that big) and the scary part is getting so low on funds that food becomes the last of my priorities. I often count my pennies in terms of \"Do I get to make art for another month?\" Just the idea of having groceries covered every month will be a real big boon to me. It\u0027s hard to run on fumes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know me, then you know that when I say I\u0027m going to do a project, I really do it.  And one thing I will do with your support is some kind of visible small art project every month that I will share.  This could be a story, a song, a piece of conceptual art, something. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now this is an experiment. If this works out, then down the line, I may switch to project based in order to accomplish some of the non book things stated above that I\u0027ve been wanting to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being on this art adventure with me.
