    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am passionate lover of new music and trumpet player who studied at the Oberlin Conservatory and Yale University School of Music before winning my current position with the USAF Band in Washington DC. I am also an ultramarathon runner, rock climber and am constantly searching for new adventures. My love of exploration has lead me to a passion for seeking out new music, working with composers, and trying to bring attention to their creations!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re a trumpet player, you have probably heard a new piece on an album, a concert, or a recital that has gripped your heart, or piqued your desire to perform it. You know, the kind of piece where something inside you screams \u201cI MUST HAVE THAT MUSIC AND START PRACTICING RIGHT NOW!\u201d only to discover the piece isn\u2019t published, or is only available in Scandinavia, and you end up having to go to a friend of a friend of a friend who might know the composer and get a copy. This is what brings me here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to bring you one BRAND NEW never previously performed or recorded piece for trumpet each month. I will publish a video performance of the piece and make the music available for immediate purchase (digital download) as each video is released. As months go by, we will have an ever expanding library of new music for trumpet all right at your fingertips. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis new music will be available to purchase individually, or\u2026 you can become a Patreon donator. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform where YOU can have a direct impact on helping me as an artist by contributing a recurring monthly amount. In return, I REWARD you. The higher amount you donate, the bigger and better the rewards are. In this case, \u201creward\u201d means I am able to reach out to more composers and commission increasingly significant works and bring them to you. In the case of patrons contributing $15 or more, it also means you get the sheet music for each new work as the videos are released!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe heart of this whole project is to seek out new composers and new music for the trumpet, and that is where the money goes. If we\u2019re going to get a brand new work every single month, we need to reach as many composers as possible. Together, we can extend our reach. As our contributions grow, we will be able to commission works from some of the most talented composers of our time, adding some major works to the repertoire!\u003cbr\u003e"
