Not only visions of strange dreams, deep spiritual insights during my life journey and fantastic imagery, but I do also paint with my emotions, and that\u00b4s what makes my whole art special and personal. That\u00b4s my experience since I had a meeting with my own spirit, I would say. And that was the time of being kissed by the muse. Since that moment I have been drawing and painting whenever i found some free time. I would love to have more space to create and work on new paintings every day. This is my dream and my way to communicate. \u003cbr\u003eIt will be my biggest joy to see your shining eyes every time I share a new painting with you or we have a nice talk about spirituality and life. I think everyone of us can find his own way to make people happy with their being, their energy and love. I go my way now, no matter what will happen. And all of you will benefit from the exclusive content, i will give you here :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough art I feel always connected and alive. It is my way to see and feel the world. I see Art as a part of my personal and spiritual developement and every challenge that comes with every new idea, is such an enrichment for my heart. With your support, you get many insights into my working process, I will show you my working space, my atelier and share inspirations with you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so looking forward to the patreon adventure and I hope you will enjoy the whole process with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=2140x10000:format=jpg/path/sc39a704e53a24c82/image/i5e69b2f264b18886/version/1519166521/image.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goals\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith all of your help I will develop my painting into a full time job.

In 2012 I started to work as a freelancer with photography. I still love it but i don\u00b4t want to work for big advertising projects anymore. My focus is more on creative free art projects and I love to connect photography with painting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=512x2048:format=jpg/path/sc39a704e53a24c82/image/i4088222dc7bb3d86/version/1441980513/image.jpg\" style=\"width: 378px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October last year I attended a painting workshop in Basel, held by Alex and Allyson Grey. And this was life changing. We did some meditations and I had such fantastic visions and insights into my soul.
