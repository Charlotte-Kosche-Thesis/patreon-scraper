These will be aired live for \u003cstrong\u003ePatrons Only\u003c/strong\u003e but will be posted a day later on Youtube. \u003cstrong\u003eTwo\u00a0Fursuit Raffle Build Episodes\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0will be posted \u003cstrong\u003eper month\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e(So roughly one episode every 2 weeks). The episodes will also be posted on Patreon a day before they are posted to Youtube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will I be charged for the episodes I support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSupport for this Fursuit Raffle Build series is based \u003cstrong\u003eONLY\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0on a \u003cstrong\u003ePER EPISODE\u003c/strong\u003e basis and is charged \u003cstrong\u003eMonthly. \u003c/strong\u003eThat means if I don\u0027t create content, no money gets taken out of your account. Period.\u00a0So if you choose to support me on the $3 dollar tier and I make 2 episodes a month, you will be charged a total of $6 at the end of the month. Livestreams will \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e be counted as \"an episode\" so you will \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e be charged and wont gain entries from them. Setting a monthly\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003emaximum \u003c/strong\u003eyou would like to support is also an option, so you don\u0027t have to worry about exceeding your preferred dollar amount :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the Fursuit Partial go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt the end of the Fursuit Raffle Build, all the entries will be tallied up and \u003cstrong\u003eone grand prize winner\u003c/strong\u003e will be randomly chosen to accept the fursuit partial! Based on the amount of Patrons by the end of the series, a couple of other winners will be chosen for prizes like digital art, fursuit badges, and maybe even a set of handpaws. oWo. Shipping will be discussed as the Fursuit Raffle Build comes to a close.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many episodes will the Fursuit Raffle Build be?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePredicting exactly how many episodes the Fursuit Raffle Build will take is a little rough, but I estimate the build will be around 8-10 episodes long. You are completely welcome to end your support whenever you choose. You will no longer have access to the live, weekly community streams, but your previous paid entries WILL STAND for the final raffle drawing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
