Not only due to the hard work required from a young, impoverished girl without a college education (soon to change!), but also due to battling with \u003cstrong\u003emental illness\u003c/strong\u003e and the aftermath of childhood and relationship abuse. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI remember sitting outside at the age of 13 and distinctly feeling the strong desire to help people emotionally. I even remember the first time, at age 11, I had \u003cem\u003eever\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0researched mental illness. I literally haven\u0027t stopped once; not a single day has gone by where I wasn\u0027t exploring my psyche and being driven by the curiosity of emotions, behavior, relationships, ect. or being inspired to help others with the same. \u003cstrong\u003eShadow work\u003c/strong\u003e is basically that; undergoing an exploration of the subconscious in order to integrate and discover the authentic self! I have spent hundreds of hours researching, taking classes, sitting in lectures, and undergoing training in relation to healing trauma and ending it\u0027s perpetual cycles. Amongst all my interests, this has been the ongoing, underlying theme of it all. \u003cbr\u003eSo, \u003cstrong\u003ewhy am I on patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTo do just that\u2013share my personal creations, ruminations, experiences, poetry, ideas and insights, all operating within a journey of healing from trauma \u0026amp; abuse, loving the self and creating meaning and purpose within the madness of life.\u003cbr\u003eThis includes \u003cstrong\u003evisual art, videography, blog posts, poetry, photos, dream logs, tarot reflections, dance, vlogs, integrative healing practices, vulnerable emotions, ETC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal here on Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e is to gather funds that make it possible for me to focus on creating helpful content full-time for those who need it most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main focus is to go back to school to become an \u003cstrong\u003eIntegrative Healing Arts Practitioner,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eH\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eypnotherapist \u003c/strong\u003e\u0026amp;\u003cstrong\u003e Life-coach.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I will be paying for it myself with the help of some financial aid, so anything coming my way will help me further my education and help you get even more help from me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for being here\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003eHow Patreon works:\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s pretty simple!
