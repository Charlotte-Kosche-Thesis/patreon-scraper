But here\u0027s the thing...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been trying to figure out how to release the new music and collaborations I have in my head. The old way of writing, recording and releasing a physical album feels limiting. If you know me you know I create recordings, arrangements, songs, videos, guitar retreats, and I love collaborating with other artists on them. I\u0027m a creator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a creator, guitarist, composer, teacher and recording artist, I thrive on giving my audience a direct line to my creations without having to go through labels, distributors, publicists, \u0027the music industry\u0027 machine, the mass media. I just want to be able to create music and share it with with my fanbase because you are awesome.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example I was one of the first guitar teachers to create an subscription based online guitar school, and sites like these and Patreon are revolutionizing how new music is released and funded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhat I\u0027m doing flies in the face of most conventional approaches to music (especially the \u0027Jazz Police\u0027 : )) I try to release pretty much all of my recorded music for free now; the songs, the concert videos, on my site, on YouTube, Facebook, wherever people want to experience it. In some cases I have to charge because publishers charge me for the use of other composers songs, but usually, I record my own songs so I can make it free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHAT IS HOW I LIKE IT, not everybody is into fingerstyle jazz guitar (shock horror) and that\u0027s fine. It\u0027s your\u0027s, enjoy it, share it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebut to DO this I need support, Patrons like you who will support me to pay for the recording studios, the video editors, the guest artists, the graphic designers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the same way that I was able to change how people learn music online I also want to do my small part in changing how artists like me connect directly with their fans, bypassing a \u0027record industry\u0027 that how can I put this politely... is broken. That\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore mass-produced music, artists were supported by Patrons. Mozart had Baron Gottfried van Swieten, the Medici Family supported Michaelangelo, Shakespeare had Henry Wriothesley, and Patrons like Charles Saatchi support leading visual artists. Today through crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter \u0026amp; Patreon you too can be a Patron of the Arts and support the artists you love, the painters whose work inspires you, the authors who inform you, and the musicians whose music you want to hear. You are the modern day Patron (take a bow).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some of the things I plan on creating over the coming months:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. \u0027STUDIO SESSIONS\u0027, a series of new solo recordings each of which is accompanied with a \u0027behind the scenes\u0027 video.

If you\u0027re just heard about it for the first time....here\u0027s how it works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a fan of mine and want to support me in the creation of new songs/videos/webcasts/writing and more guitar and music-things, this is the place. As you can see, the list above is pretty varied...and who knows what\u0027s next...caricatures? podcasts? I\u0027m experimenting. I like trying different things and collaborating with interesting people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY BACKSTORY:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I\u0027ve released my recordings on major labels (Sony, Universal) and independents (Linn Records, The Guitar Label). I hate having to do the salesy promotion bit of \"Hey, this is my new record, click here to buy....again.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just want to be able to go into my studio, make music with friends, film a video, write, record, and press PUBLISH when I\u0027m done and get it directly to you without a middleman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027m probably not going to give up on physical albums it\u0027s just that it\u0027s no longer the best medium for producing and distributing my musical ideas quickly and directly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE MONEY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome things cost a lot of money! Some of my projects have budgets in excess of $20,000 and some cost almost nothing. A solo recording cost me a few thousand dollars (to pay my nice engineer Adam for his time and have the process filmed).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe concept here is that you trust me to use the ongoing budgets as I see fit. Not every project will cost the same...but the more budget I have, the more awesome the projects I can create, the more musicians I can pay, and more I can spend on making things look and sound amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the deal: THIS IS A HUGE EXPERIMENT. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know me, you\u0027ve been to a live show or guitar retreat, I\u0027ve taught you guitar online, or you\u0027ve purchased an album you know I am all about quality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEven if you\u0027re a one dollar backer, I want to know what you\u0027d like me to create next or what you think about the music and videos I\u0027m creating. The conversation (via comments here, and on my Facebook page, and on the live webcasts) has already been VERY ACTIVE, and I hope to keep it that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery Patron who\u0027s supporting me is important to this community, it is YOU who I\u0027m creating for, and I\u0027m glad of your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo whether you\u0027re backing me for a dollar or ten dollars...THANK YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLET\u0027S GO CREATE!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebest wishes,\u003cbr\u003e- Martin\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ep.s. if you\u0027re just finding out about Patreon and you like what it\u0027s about, here are a few other artists/creators i suggest you look into....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSam Harris (creating a fascinating podcast) \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/samharris\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/samharris\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy But Wait (writing amazing blog posts) \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/geetadayal\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/waitbutwhy\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAmanda Palmer (making cool music and art)\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/amandapalmer\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/amandapalmer\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAz Samad (lovely fingerstyle guitar music!) \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/martingommel\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/azsamad\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ep.p.s.

Note: the patrons have voted to make these recordings available to the public, because the more the merrier. But it\u0027s the patrons like you who get to interact live, and you\u0027ll usually access get the archive before the general public does....you\u0027ll be a members of the smaller group with whom will also get to interact directly with my guests, and so forth. I love doing these live webcasts, but they only work if we keep the numbers small. I\u0027ll do the monthly webcast even if i haven\u0027t made any new music, so you may be getting free webcasts when I\u0027m figuring out what to write or record next, on the road touring, and we\u0027ll just talk online about music, guitars and the bizarre things that happen when you are a touring musician. It\u0027ll be FUN!",
