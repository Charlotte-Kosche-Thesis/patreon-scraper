    "summary": "Hey, I\u0027m Jason McMaster and I want to thank you for reading this!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent my life thinking about, writing about and playing videogames. In that time, I discovered that I don\u0027t really like that many of the \"big\" releases. I want them and I buy them, but then I end up playing a half hour and going back to something else. I prefer games with depth over graphics. I love figuring out ways to do cool stuff in games like RimWorld or Stationeers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing that makes me happy nowadays is hanging out with my wife, Sonky, my friends on Twitch, and my cats. I love to share my passion with like-minded folks on my Twitch channel. I love making tutorial videos about games I find interesting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does Jason play?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI play a lot of different stuff! I\u0027ll stream anything from Dominions 5 to Stardew Valley and back to Rainbow Six: Siege. Mostly, though, I\u0027m drawn to survival, exploration and simulation. I love to make tutorial videos about games I love!\u00a0The most popular videos I\u0027ve made so far are about RimWorld and Stationeers, but I\u0027ll record anything that catches my fancy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen does Jason play?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShort answer: Tuesday and Thursday 8-10 PM Central Time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong answer: The regular time for my livestream is Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8 to 10 PM Central Time, but I often start early and play for longer than scheduled. I also stream at off times and on weekends, but don\u0027t follow a set schedule.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/jvmcmaster\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFollowing the Twitch channel\u003c/a\u003e is the easiest way to keep up with when I\u0027m online!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReplays of streams are available on the Twitch channel and are also uploaded to YouTube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support Jason?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing forward, my videos will not have YouTube or Twitch based ads unless they are injected without my consent. I\u0027d rather provide videos to people who want to see them without the hassle of having to sit through some irritating corporate garbage. Let\u0027s just talk about the stuff we really like and skip all the nickle and dime crap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why should you support me if I\u0027m not going to put ads on my videos? Good question! Obviously, if you like talking to me and hanging out in the stream, this is a way to contribute to the cause. It could be that you appreciate some of my tutorial videos and want to leave me a tip. Otherwise, I suppose you could support me because I offer a spotlight on smaller games and try my hardest to show you an in-depth, low-level view of all the games I play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get out of this deal?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOther than the knowledge that you brought a little joy to an old man\u0027s heart?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSupporters Tier\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month, we will have a community post for supporters and above to post suggestions for games to stream. We will pick one of those games at random and, if I don\u0027t have it, buy it and add it to the streaming rotation for at least two separate episodes. Now that\u0027s interaction!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlabama \"Thor\" Supporters Tier\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you know my secret identity. I guess you ALL know it now, actually, but I digress. For those in the know, this tier offers the chance to help your buddy Jason not get busted by Hydra. On top of that, you get to enter a monthly drawing to win a game! Naturally, you also get access to the Supporters Tier reward as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRear Admiral\u0027s Club\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe refined supporter needs, nay, DEMANDS something more. That\u0027s where the Rear Admiral\u0027s Club comes in. Though you have access to them, the lower tier rewards mostly bore you. You need a more... dangerous game. Now you have your chance. Each month, we will have a drawing for a chance to appear on stream and play a game with Jason. This can be any game Jason owns or can get for a reasonable price. It\u0027s good to be the Rear Admiral!\u003cbr\u003e"
