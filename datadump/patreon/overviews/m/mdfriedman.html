    "summary": "I have been singing the blues\nand playing harmonica for around half a century now. I currently perform and record\nregularly with six different Colorado bands, primarily as a harmonica player, songwriter\nand vocalist. Over the last five years I have appeared on over 20 albums ranging\nfrom music for small children to experimental electronic sound sculpting, and I\nhave added Theremin and Native American Flute into my arsenal for spontaneous music\ncomposition.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am interested is sharing my music with anyone who\nfinds joy or comfort in it. It is my hope with Patreon to create community\naround my creative efforts, give back to my supporters and the larger\ncommunity, and at the same time, reach out to potential collaborators. Creating\nmusic, art and poetry is what I live for. I have been recently doing classes at\nvarious locations teaching harmonica as an aide to better breathing and health.\nI am willing to share what I have learned with any other harmonica players interested\nin doing this work. It has been some of the most rewarding work I have ever done\naround my music. (See the Intro Video above if you are interested; it is a clip\nfrom a local news show about the program.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am also pretty deep into poetry and spoken\nword. I have published five books of my own poems, and my poetry has appeared\nin numerous poetry publications, both in print and online. I run a small poetry\npress called Liquid Light Press (\u003ca href=\"http://liquidlightpress.com/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ewww.liquidlightpress.com\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e), and we publish \"poetry for the heart.\"\nOur sister site, the popular Internet Poets\u0027 Cooperative (\u003ca href=\"http://www.poetscoop.org/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ewww.poetscoop.org\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e), offers readers unlimited free viewing and/or\nlistening of over 30 poetry e-books, 50 videos from the Poets\u0027 Co-op TV Show and\nover 1000 mp3 audio files from the old Poets\u0027 Co-op Open Reading Series. My new\ngenre\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.poetscoop.org/InterviewDigitalPoetry.pdf\"\u003edigital\npoetry\u003c/a\u003e represents the artistic fusion of all my creative\npursuits combining original poetry, sound art, images and video into a single poetic\nexperience.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition, I have been making psychoactive music\nwith healing intent for three years or so now and have composed and recorded over\none hundred tracks including a full symphony for solo Theremin called the \u003ca href=\"https://maddogfriedman.bandcamp.com/album/symphony-of-the-heart\"\u003eSymphony\nof the Heart\u003c/a\u003e. Due to the shamanistic nature of this music, I would like to make\nit available to anyone who might find it helpful, regardless of their means. I have\nnow expanded this work to include both video and fine art.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am frankly just hoping to continue my work and\nrecover some of my expenses for recording and painting. I am also interested in\ncreating custom pieces (audio and/or visual) for both personal healing as well as\ncollaborating with artistic film makers to provide soundtracks.
