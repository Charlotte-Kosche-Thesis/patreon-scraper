    "summary": "Team Mousetalgia (which consists of Dave and Becky Breiland, Kristen Pfeifer, and Jeff Baham) is devoted to creating the most informative, dedicated, and relevant Disney podcast in the entire podcastosphere. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re based on the west coast, so our beat includes everything from the farthest reaches of the Pacific Northwest (well, just up to Seattle and the PNW Mouse Meet - sorry, Canada!) all the way down to the southernmost tip of the state... and everything in between (which is mostly all the fun stuff in LA and Anaheim - yay Disneyland and D23! - and San Francisco, which is where the Walt Disney Family Museum is located.) But we also take occasional trips to Florida and Europe and Hawaii and the Caribbean... wherever the Mouse leads, we eventually follow. You\u0027ll hear all about those escapades on Mousetalgia every Monday morning, as you have since 2008.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also talk about Disney collectibles, Disney history, Disney films, Marvel, Star Wars, and Disney communities, and we try to keep it all fun, humorous, and full of joy. If you\u0027ve never heard us before, stop reading our Patreon page and go check out the show at \u003ca href=\"http://www.mousetalgia.com.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.mousetalgia.com.\u003c/a\u003e Come back when you\u0027ve heard at least a dozen episodes and know a little bit about what we\u0027re trying to do. If you\u0027re new to us, we don\u0027t want your money. But we\u0027d love to win over a new listener, so give us a shot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you\u0027re here because you heard us advertising Mousetalgia Plus, then welcome! We love producing Mousetalgia each week, so we\u0027ll never stop, and it will never cost you a dime. Our sponsor keeps us happy, and you keep our sponsor happy, and it\u0027s just wins all around. But we\u0027ve heard your cry for more. More insight. More personal stories of struggle and triumph. More reviews of the latest Disney whosits and whatsits. More Mousetalgia. So to that end, we\u0027ve decided to \"plus up\" our current broadcasting schedule, to shamelessly borrow a term Walt Disney is said to have used. Allow us to introduce... Mousetalgia Plus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo take a look at the various pledge levels, and if Mousetalgia Plus is something you\u0027d like to support, welcome aboard. And if it\u0027s not for you at this time, we hope you\u0027ll still tune in and catch us next Monday anyway! Carpe Kingdom!"
