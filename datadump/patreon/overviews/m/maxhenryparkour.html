    "summary": "**I\u0027ll be shutting this page down in two months, so any monthly donations will only last for two months! :)**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Max, and I\u0027m a parkour athlete and coach based out of New York. I started parkour in 2007. I was fortunate enough to be one of the biggest nerds in the parkour community at the time (some things never change) and spent hours a day delving into old forums, translating blogs from French or Spanish, and watching hidden gems on YouTube. This research helped inspire my own journey, and now I\u0027m hoping to use this information to inspire others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am creating what will be the most comprehensive guide to parkour currently available. While the information inside this eBook will be helpful, the real value of the project lie in the resources that it will connect the reader to. I have taken all my years of parkour nerdery and put them into the references, linking the reader to hundreds of videos, blog posts, old forums, and books. The eBook, approximately 120 pages long, can be read front-to-back, but the reader will also have access to literally thousands of hours of content through the references. Each of the references adds depth to what the book is addressing, whether it\u0027s learning how to kong vault or discussing the effects of fear on our ability to accurately gauge distances. In this way, the eBook has become a road map to the world of parkour. Reading front-to-back takes you on the Interstate; it gets you where you need to go. But if you\u0027re not in a hurry, you can take advantage of the hundreds of side roads and visit wonderfully obscure little towns full of content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to release this eBook as a donation-based download. I\u0027d like everyone to be able to benefit from the work I\u0027ve done, and I have faith that people in the parkour community will recognize the work that went into this project and pay what they see fit. I\u0027m using Patreon to help organize what is essentially a pre-order system. I\u0027ve invested a good amount of money and a large chunk of time into this project at a point in my life where my finances are dwindling. By becoming a patron here, you\u0027re paying me now so that I\u0027ll have the time and resources to finish my road map. This Patreon account will also help to fund the build-out of my used van, which I will be living out of indefinitely. In return, PLEASE download the eBook for free when it becomes available! Anyone who donates to this project will be listed as a donor on an inside page of the eBook. I plan on $14.99 being the \"suggested donation\" for my eBook. If you would like to support the project by spending that much now, thank you! If this project is something you are passionate about supporting and is worth more to you, I won\u0027t complain!! As a thank you for reading this far, I\u0027d like to share with you the Introduction to my little project:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cParkour can\u2019t be taught.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI remember reading that on an old forum years and years ago. I didn\u2019t really understand what the author meant then (hadn\u2019t he seen all the tutorials and how-to posts??) but now I think I get it. Parkour - real parkour - can\u2019t be taught...it can only be discovered. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned in nine years of training, it\u2019s that parkour is a personal journey. This is as true today as it was twenty years ago, when the founders of the discipline split to pursue their own training under the names parkour, freerunning, and l\u2019art du d\u00e9placement. To practice parkour, you sacrifice time, sweat, and blood. It takes effort and a heavy dose of willpower. Parkour training is an investment in yourself, and you are rewarded with new levels of self-confidence and self-knowledge. This type of training requires the student or practitioner to explore themselves, and can be guided but never taught. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s not to say that the techniques of parkour can\u2019t be taught, or that the only way to train parkour is to isolate yourself and train in the woods for ten years. If that were true, I\u2019d be out of a job! But this book is called The Parkour Road Map for a reason. Without a bit of wandering, without having to search and roam for information, parkour loses some of its luster...it loses that vital sense of personal investment. I have done my best to create a guide that introduces you to the world of parkour without removing your ability to explore. The concepts in this book are outlined clearly, but filling them in is up to you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo aid in your journey, I\u2019ve provided you with links to hundreds of sources at relevant points in the text. These sources - YouTube videos, documentaries, interviews, blog posts, archived forums, news articles, podcasts, and books - are drawn from my own journey. Many of these invaluable resources would be impossible to find for practitioners starting today, and I hope their inclusion and content inspires you in the same way they inspired me. I would encourage you to delve into these links as deeply as you dare...while a map can be used to get straight to a destination, its true value lies in its ability to take you safely off the beaten path. So please, get lost. Ramble. Roam. Explore. Parkour can\u2019t be taught, but it can be discovered! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Max"
