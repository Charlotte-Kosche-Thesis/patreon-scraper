Sermons\u00a0\u201cpreach\u201d on the bygone eras of music through story telling combined with video and\u00a0audio content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarted as a weekly Twitter series in July 2017, #MusicSermon has grown over nine months into a true community of music lovers and a source for communal nostalgia, with a splash of music and cultural education. I\u0027m so proud of what \u003cem\u003ewe\u0027ve\u003c/em\u003e built, as the \"congregation\" is the heart of #MusicSermon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSermonites\u003c/em\u003e have fellowshipped over the Female R\u0026amp;B Voices of the 80s, the Male R\u0026amp;B Groups of the 90s, Juke Joint Music, and the Funk and Soul Groups of the 70s \u0026amp; 80s; and reminisced over Beggin\u2019 R\u0026amp;B Songs, New Jack Swing, Neo Soul, NY Boom Bap, R\u0026amp;B and Hip Hop Collaborations, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs #MusicSermon grows, the next step is expanding the experience both on\n and offline - a new interactive website, a podcast, expanded long form \ncontent, video content, events, etc - and I want to maintain the same \nquality and consistency of output you\u0027ve come to expect from me while \ndoing it. That will take some help. Many of you have asked how you can support, and I want to make sure your support comes with extra value. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile there will still be a \"collection\" after each\n sermon for one-off contributions, I\u0027m happy to also offer the opportunity to become a \n\u003cstrong\u003epatron \u003c/strong\u003eof #MusicSermon for \u003cstrong\u003eadditional content, perks and access\u003c/strong\u003e. Your \npatronage will allow me to offer a paid internship, create content that \nrequires higher production levels, and curate events that will translate\n #MusicSermon to in person experience. It will also allow your Pastor to\n take more time to put into the cultivation and growth of the brand and \ncontent. This takes a lot more man hours than it looks like. In exchange, you\u0027ll receive specialty content, the opportunity to provide input, and some treats and surprises. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reward levels may change and adjust as we go, but \nplease know that no matter what you chose to pledge, my \ngratitude for your support on any level is boundless. In way of thanks, I\u0027ll continue to provide you with great content and experiences, for the culture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNaima\u003cbr\u003eCreator/Curator/Sr. Pastor\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
