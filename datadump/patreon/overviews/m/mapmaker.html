We made a cargo freighter, a passenger transport, and a starfighter escort carrier! None of those would have been possible without the support of people like you, and I\u0027m extremely grateful for the opportunity. Now, in 2018, I\u0027m branching out to provide even more new content that should appeal to fans of any genre...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be another set of sci-fi map tiles, of course, but now I\u0027m adding some modern map tiles to the mix, and fulfilling one of the long-term goals I set out for this campaign:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m bringing back the \u003cstrong\u003eMaps of Mystery!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Maps of Mystery were a series of full-page maps featured in the pages of Dungeon magazine. They\u0027ve been gone for about a decade, and frankly I think it\u0027s time to fix that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough your support on this site, they\u0027re finally coming back. And if support here grows in the months ahead, I intend to publish articles with related adventure hooks to go with them and maybe even bring back the \u003cstrong\u003eGlobal Positioning\u003c/strong\u003e series of modern maps from Polyhedron, as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year we\u0027re going deeper into my sketchbook than ever before, and producing a whole host of new content along the way. I hope you\u0027ll join us for the ride!"
