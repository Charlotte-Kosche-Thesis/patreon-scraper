    "summary": "Thank you so much for supporting my creative journey. As I explore the world, and the world of human ideas, I create passionate paintings, photographs, poems, stories about art, and a journal of literature inspired by art, The Ekphrastic Review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat a long, strange trip it\u0027s been: I\u0027ve made hundreds of works of visual art and have exhibited in hundreds of shows. I\u0027m at home in Toronto, Canada, but have recently created art and had shows in Tunisia, North Africa, and Mexico, and it is my intention to continue to expand internationally. Thank you for helping me with the expenses inherent in going further afield!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI studied for and received a Bachelor of Applied Arts in Journalism, but most of my writing has been creative, about art and artists, about wine, about travel. I\u0027ve written a lot of poetry, too, including four books. My writing has appeared in at least 200 publications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015, I couldn\u0027t find many outlets that supported poetry and prose inspired by visual art, and I began The Ekphrastic Review. I have had the privilege of publishing some of the best poets writing today as well as new voices, and showing how contemplation of visual art can enrich our writing."

I can do all these things this year with as little as 500$ a month, and will expand my goals as soon as I reach this!",
