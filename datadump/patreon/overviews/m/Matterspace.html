    "summary": "Hello Everyone! My name is Quade Reid and I\u2019m an illustrator\nwho lives a Spartan life doing freelance commission work online. I live on the\nlean so that I can live off the art, but lately that\u2019s not been enough for me.\nI do commission work for the sake of working on my true passion, the Sci-fi/Fantasy\nsetting MATTERSPACE.  What is\nMATTERSPACE? I\u2019m glad you asked\u2026\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/T94YDCH.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 I made Matterspace to make a good anything, a game-mod, an\nanimation, a novel series, a card game, or even a webcomic, and I\u2019ve tried them\nall. Yes, I have even tried a webcomic before, but none of them ever amounted\nto more than a large sum of fruitless work. I am but one man, and when that one\nman works 100% commission there\u2019s not a lot of room for much else, however,\nfortune has thrown me a bone and I have finally the time to chance putting\neverything else aside and focusing on MATTERSPACE. But good things never last\nand the money problem is as inevitable as Terminator\u2019s Judgement Day but that\nis where you step in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/emLsEK3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n \u00a0 \u00a0 Patreon offers me the ability to turn my passion into my purpose\nby re-creating that ages old bond between Artist and Patron by way of a monthly\nsubscription. Your donations afford me the time and support I\u2019ll need to create\nnew content. I have a lot of ideas I\u2019d love to kick off, Live streams, World\nBuilding Discord Chats, even a monthly poll to help Dot decide what to wear\nevery month (which you can download as a HD poster). Whose Dot? Well\u2026\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/zBGwwKx.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0OK. So now the Who, What, and Where, are out of the way we\ncan get to business. I have toiled in many mediums and I\u2019ve had the most fun\nand success with the webcomics, but I still have a lot of learning to do. So\nwith your help I aim to create two comic pages a month and post them on a\nbi-weekly basis. But until I figure out my process I may be posting only one\ncomic-page a month, could I do more than two eventually? Maybe. As I settle\ninto these new habits I will be able to update the reward tiers with additional\noffers as I grow to afford them. I do intend for my webcomic to be free after\n30 days, but future auxiliary material will become exclusive to my patrons. I\nstill intend to post to my other social media, but it will not be the same\ncomprehensive access Patrons will enjoy. If my characters are to try, fail, and\nlive to try again, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m a great artist or storyteller, it\u2019s\nbecause you\u2019re the kind of person that\u2019s willing to let them. So I thank you,\nbecause you are literally paying me to draw my dreams. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NSQWZkz.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo where is the webcomic?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0I\u2019m still working on my comic\u2019s story,\nxD So until I have my act together you can expect Test pages, Concept art, and\nthe twice-a-month, world-building Discord chat, Queating Better Worlds, to be available. This initial content will also\nbe free. If you have questions or concerns feel free to hit me up, I pay attention\nto those who pay attention to me. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy did you launch without a webcomic?! \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Because I said I would launch that day and I didn\u2019t feel like starting out with\na lie. xD\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that starts when?\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eRight now i\u0027m in my Soft-Launch stage, where i\u0027m working out kinks, writing the story, and trying out Patreon\u0027s features. I\u0027ll do more of a wide-launch after I feel i\u0027m close to offering what I\u0027ve promised on a regular basis. If you are reading this, and still contributing, Congradulations! You\u0027re a Founder."
