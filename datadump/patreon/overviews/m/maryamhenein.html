You would never know by looking at me,\nbut\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.honeycolony.com/article/the-heart-behind-the-hive/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI was hit by a Ford Explorer at 45 miles\u003c/a\u003e an hour and then dragged 49 feet\nwhile negotiating a crosswalk. I broke my left femur, tailbone, L-1, and five\nribs. I was outfitted with a 14-inch metal rod and it took me a year to walk\nagain without a cane or a limp. The trauma I endured led me down a windy path\nof medical treatments and self-discovery. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a\njournalist, I used to investigative the underbelly of Los Angeles as well as\nthe human psyche. But in a quest to heal, I found myself delving into\nalternative medicine and using my investigative chops to figure out the root\ncauses behind my health issues. It\u2019s so wild how many of us blindly listen to\nour doctors when in reality, Western medicine has such a blinkered view of\nthings. They compartmentalize body parts and symptoms instead of looking at\nhuman health from a holistic perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nbecame both scientist and guinea pig. I fused solid research with first-hand\nexperience and not only became quite knowledgeable, but also healed myself and\nbecame a holistic health advocate!  I found myself in the aisles of Whole\nFoods sharing my knowledge with strangers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd\nthen in 2007, the bees literally flew into my life and gave me a bigger\npurpose. The bees pulled the curtain and exposed the wizards of Big Ag. Just\nlike you, I didn\u2019t know that beekeepers zig zagged through America with semis\nfull of bees from one monoculture to the next.  I gained a whole new\nperspective about our food supply. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf\n(organic) food is thy medicine, then the rapid spread of industrial agriculture\nand the increasing standardization of the food industry is our downfall.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.honeycolony.com/article/why-bees-are-dying/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChemicals are killing bees\u003c/a\u003e and beings, monocultures are breeding super bugs and\nkilling biodiversity,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.honeycolony.com/article/10-steps-to-genetically-modify-monsanto/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egenetically modified foods\u003c/a\u003e are making us sick and ruining\nour seeds, and factory farms are causing wide spread antibiotic resistance and\ncausing unbelievable pollution.
