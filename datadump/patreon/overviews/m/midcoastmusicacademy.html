MCMA provides high quality music instruction to students of \u003cstrong\u003eall \u003c/strong\u003eages and skill levels in a fun, relaxed, and creative environment. Classes include individual and group lessons, camp, and workshops that range in focus from rock, blues, jazz, world music, and classical. All of our classes and programs combine the fundamentals of music- theory, notation, and ear training- with a contemporary approach to learning. MCMA believes students should learn to play what they love and love what they play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMCMA currently serves 150 private and group students in addition to contracting with RSU #13 to provide free after-school music programs. The school has seven instructors and recently underwent a facility expansion to accommodate a growing demand, thanks to a $50,000 Community Development Block Grant, awarded to the school in the Fall of 2015.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe combination of our philosophy, accessibility, and geography has solidified our standing as a unique Midcoast organization:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePhilosophy\u003c/strong\u003e: MCMA provides a contemporary, theory-based approach to music education by helping students learn to play the music they love. Our students are as likely to study world music, the Beatles, or Chuck Berry as they are Handel and Bach.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAccessibility\u003c/strong\u003e: We have never turned away a student due to financial constraints.
