My goal on Patreon is simple: to accumulate a sufficient guaranteed income so that I can sustain myself without requiring a day job. Even a supplemental amount would at least provide some peace of mind and let me focus on my art rather than stress about barely making it all the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything you can contribute would be very appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d rather contribute one-time rather than a monthly contribution, you can donate at paypal.me/shalmii\u003cbr\u003e"
