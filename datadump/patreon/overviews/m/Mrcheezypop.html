I\u0027m an actor/singer/youtuber/voiceover guy/Disney nerd! You may know me as mrcheezypop on youtube where I take you to the Disney Parks on my show \"How 2 Disney\" or my Disney recap show \"This Week In Disney\"! or as Mr. Collins on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/lizziebennet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Lizzie Bennet Diaries\u003c/a\u003e, Damon in Muzzled the Musical, or as the guy who does lots of voiceovers and audiobooks! However you know me, you know how enthusiastic I am about making magical content for you guys, and how much I love talking to you all whether it be on youtube comments, on twitter, or tumblr!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I doing on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, basically I want to make better content for you!! \u00a0I want to keep making How 2 Disney and This Week In Disney, but also make more music videos and skits!! This platform might allow me to do just that! Patreon is ongoing crowdfunding for creators like me who release content regularly! \n\u003cstrong\u003eI want to take the funds I earn from Patreon and put it directly back into the videos I create.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat type of videos do I want to make?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make better How 2 Disney videos! If I had a bigger budget, I could buy lots more Disney food for my Disney food videos which always seem to be the most popular! Also, you\u0027re probably wondering, what kind of videos could you make us if you had some sort of budget? \u00a0Well, more original music videos like \"Magic In The Air!\" \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T91b9bZJLys\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T91b9bZJLys\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOr this cover of Go The Distance! These kinds of videos require people other than just me and I need to pay these people. Patreon can help me have the money to actually make more of these kinds of videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/MRVWd8AmGzg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to also make more of my \"The Blank Scene\" videos and have new Disney based skits on my channel!\u00a0Even in my normal vlogs, sometimes I require the assistance of people to help me out, through artwork, or graphic design, or ideas, or writing, or any number of things! Patreon can allow me to give small stipends to some of these people as well!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo what can you do to help?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eFirst things first. If you do not have any money to donate now, do not worry! Nothing will change for you. You will still get to see all my videos, completely free on my youtube channel. I\u0027m doing Patreon because it is extra support you can give me, and in turn I can give you better content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe way I\u0027ve set up my Patreon account is by monthly donation. \u00a0Since I make about 12 videos per month, I didn\u0027t want to set it at a per video pledge because that can get quite expensive. \u00a0This way, you can set how much you\u0027re willing to pledge to me each month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow much money should you donate?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThis is totally up to you!!! The great thing about Patreon is that you can set your monthly donation as low or as high as you want! If you have $5, amazing!! Trust me, $5 from like 5 people can go a long way in achieving what I want from Patreon. If you don\u0027t have the funds to donate anything, don\u0027t worry! I thank you for being so supportive and taking the time to read this and watch all my stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo, if you donate, what cool things do you get?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThere\u0027s quite a bunch of awesome things that my Patreon only patrons will receive! They range from private Patreon only videos, postcards from me, or be my Snapchat buddy! You pick what works for you, and you get rewarded for it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
