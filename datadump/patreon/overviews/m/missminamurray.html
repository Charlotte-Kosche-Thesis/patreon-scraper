    "summary": "Greetings and\nwelcome. I\u2019m\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://minamurray.com\"\u003eMiss Mina Murray\u003c/a\u003e, burlesque performer, teacher, costumer, culinary\nhistorian, and the one thing I never expected to be, writer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver a decade\nago I co-founded The Boston Babydolls (now\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bostonbeautease.com\"\u003eThe Boston BeauTease\u003c/a\u003e) burlesque\ntroupe and created\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://studyburlesque.com\"\u003eThe Boston Academy of Burlesque Education\u003c/a\u003e (B.A.B.E.). I love\nburlesque and all its aspects; I just wish it paid the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI never\nconsidered myself a writer. In fact, in all my many years of schooling I\nloathed writing and was constantly being told I wasn\u2019t any good at it. And yet,\nwriting seemed like the best way to reach my fans, so about 5 years ago I\nstarted a blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://missminamurray.wordpress.com\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eOh the Glamourous Life\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e,\na behind-the-scenes look at my not always so glamorous life in burlesque. Besides\nthat, I started reviewing books, reporting on burlesque events, and sharing\nvintage recipes. And there\u0027s my most constant feature,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://missminamurray.wordpress.com/tag/tips/\"\u003eFriday Tips\u003c/a\u003e: snippets of advice\nof all kinds. Think of me as the burlesque Martha Stewart meets the burlesque Miss\nManners.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLast year some\nof my favorite and most useful tips were collected into a book,\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://minamurray.com/shop\"\u003eMiss Mina Murray\u2019s Little Book of Better Burlesque\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. I have two more books \u2013 a\ncostume book and a cookbook \u2013 in various stages of progress. I never imagined\nI\u2019d be an author, but teaching is a passion and writing allows me to reach a\nlarger audience.  Through my books and my blog, I can educate people who\naren\u2019t able to come to Boston.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThey say\nthat time is money, but money is also time. Right now I have a lot of demands\non my time. I perform (which entails creating costumes, choreography, props,\nnot to mention taking classes to improve, plus marketing and travel), I run B.A.B.E. (managing and training the\nstaff, developing new courses, and promoting the school), I write\n(of course), and finally, I have a day job because none of the above would keep\na roof over my head nor give me reasonable health insurance. With patronage, I\ncan ease some of the demands on my time and work on the creative endeavors that\nsatisfy my soul.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have several goals I\u2019d like to work toward with your help. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have two more \u201clittle books\u201d in the works, but finalizing them and getting them published takes time that I don\u2019t\nseem to have. With your support I can dedicate myself to buckling down\nand turning them (one at a time) into reality.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have a new costume I\u2019d like to make based on a fabulous costume from\nthe Golden Age of Hollywood. My deadline is March 2019. I know that seems like\na long time from now, but it\u2019s going to require a lot of research and improving\nsome of my skills, not to mention some expensive materials.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour support will help me pay for photoshoots, so I can bring you more\nfabulous photos. A good shoot involves photographers, hair \u0026amp; makeup\nartists, wardrobe, location, \u0026amp;c. I don\u0027t work for free and neither should any of the people involved in making me look great.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA picture is worth a thousand words. \nIs a video worth a thousand pictures? Writing allows me to reach\nstudents all over the world; videos make that teaching more effective.  I\u2019d like to improve my video equipment along\nwith the skills to make better and more effective videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI love to travel to perform and your patronage will help make that\npossible. Right now I\u2019ve performed in 14 states. That\u2019s only 28% of the\ncountry! My goal is to reach 50% by the end of 2018.  That\u2019s only 11 more states.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"

I might strip out of a costume or maybe lingerie from my collection. It might be rehearsed or improvisational. The videos will be rated B for Burlesque \u2013 ending in pasties and a g-string. I\u2019m happy to add to my collection of shoes or lingerie with gifts from my patrons.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAll previous rewards (more posts on my blog, access to my Patreon-only posts, suggest a topic, photos twice a week, occasional brief videos, monthly video blog post, postcards)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e",
