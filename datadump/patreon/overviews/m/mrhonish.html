    "summary": "Hey, what\u0027s up? I\u0027m Mr. Honish and welcome to my Patreon page! I teach 7th grade Geography and 8th grade U.S. History at Turner Middle School in Beloit, WI. My whole philosophy about middle school social studies, and middle school in general, is that learning should be as fun and interactive as possible. I am a huge believer in the power of videos, web based educational platforms, gameification and game-based learning. I have already been creating flipped classroom videos, music parodies, and other videos for my classes my entire career. Over time, other students and teachers from various districts have reached out to me and shared that they are also using my videos to learn and teach, which has only added to my undying belief in the power of video and the internet in education. Now I am running a weekly student news broadcast as well. The main reason I am using Patreon is to try and make the delivery of that content better for the students at my school and for those that view my videos elsewhere. I have no aspirations of becoming a millionaire YouTuber with a six-figure subscription count. I would simply like to raise some extra money and be able to invest in making these educational videos the best they can possibly be, and I would love your support to help make that happen!\u003cbr\u003e"
