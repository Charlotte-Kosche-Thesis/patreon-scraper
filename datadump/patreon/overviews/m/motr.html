    "summary": "We\u0027ve been doing this show since 2006 and we love doing it for our listeners! You folks have been super supportive for more than a decade and without that support, we honestly might not have kept the podcast going all these years. While we pursue advertising options, we know not everyone wants to hear ads. And based on listener feedback on the potential for ads, many of you suggested we use Patreon so you can continue to show your support. So here we are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a new avenue for us and frankly, we know we won\u0027t be quitting our day jobs by gaining supporters here. We\u0027re OK with that! That\u0027s why we\u0027re keeping the monthly support for an ad-free show at a low $3. We don\u0027t always do 4 podcasts a month, so we figured a buck a show is reasonable plus it lets us take a week off for scheduling or other purposes if we need to. But we\u0027ll make every effort to have a show every week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re also launching with a second Patreon tier at $5 that will provide extras for our supporters. This could include some videos of devices, full reviews, giveaways and more. Who knows? We\u0027re still working this out and will be mixing it up along the way. Of course, your suggestions for these extras are welcome too: Let us know what you\u0027d like to see or hear!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of your support choice, know that we appreciate you as much as you appreciate the podcast. We know you don\u0027t have to support us at all since you can just listen to the podcast from the public RSS feed. To that end, we say, \"Thank you!\""
