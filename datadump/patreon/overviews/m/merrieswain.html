Welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Merrie. I\u0027m a (mostly) self-taught seamstress, and I\u0027m itching to turn these skills into a career. I\u0027ve been sewing since I was in high school, but I didn\u0027t start using a machine until more recently. Back in 2013, I spent the summer working in a special effects studio, creating some really bizarre shit to be put on display in a New York City gallery. A fellow ginger coworker took it upon himself to show me how to thread and operate a machine. My entire world changed in that very moment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did own a little sewing machine that was given to me as a teenager, but it was back home with my dad in Michigan. My relatives, bless their hearts, knew that I enjoyed sewing but no one ever taught me how to use it. The internet was still in its infancy at that time, so I didn\u0027t have things like Google or YouTube to rely on for help.\u00a0I found the whole thing daunting, and so it sat unopened in its box for well over a decade. When I told my dad about my newly gained knowledge, he kindly shipped it to me here in Los Angeles, where\u00a0I promptly spent the following few years tailoring all of my clothing in my free time between television casting jobs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of September, 2016, I decided that it was time to push myself out of my alterations comfort zone and into creating entirely new clothing using sewing patterns. I\u0027ve made a fair amount of things so far, including various capes, dresses, and the most amazing gold glitter jumpsuit for a friend, but I struggle to find either the free time or the income to expand my skills and pursue this as a career. This is where YOU come in and save the day!"
