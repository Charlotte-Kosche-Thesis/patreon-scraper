    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003e\nThe Idea\u003c/h2\u003e\nAre you, or someone you know, a musician? Are you a solo musician or are\n you in a band? Have you been getting together with friends for a long \ntime now, wishing that you could find other people to collaborate with \non original music? Or are you a drummer, guitarist, bassist or singer \nwho has moved to a new area and is looking for people who share the same\n love of music you do? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have been there. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis idea began as an effort between a musician and a promoter who have \nboth found it difficult to come together with other local talents. We \nare aware of how difficult it is sometimes to successfully meet other \nmusicians who are just starting out or want to collaborate on new, \noriginal work for shows and sessions. Sometimes this is as simple as \ntrying to fill a slot in an existing show. Other times, it is finding \nsomeone to fill an empty position in an existing band but being unable \nto find other artists with your same sensibilities and tastes. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want to make this easier for everyone involved.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\nThe Plan\u003c/h2\u003e\nOur plan is to connect with lesser known, local musicians and bands who \nare trying to get their name out there in the Western NY area. We will \nbe looking for original artists who would like to submit samples of \ntheir music and sit in on a small podcast type show to be aired online. \nWe would like to showcase 3-5 musicians or bands per month, air their \nmusic, and introduce them to new listeners in the area through our \npodcast. At the end of the month, our plan is to hold a concert at a \nvenue with the performers that we have showcased during the previous \nweeks so that others can hear them live and connect with them \npersonally.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo the bands and musicians, we would offer air time and the chance to \nconnect with other bands. To the venues, we would offer advertising and \nthe business that comes with these shows. Promotion would be provided to\n everyone involved through our site, our podcast, and social media.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt present, we are reaching out to those we know, but hope to be able to\n grow and reach out to others in order for us all to further succeed in \nthe business we all love. We are still looking into the possibility of \nfunding and hope that we will be able to get this project off the ground\n with the help of the community and other supporters who recognize the \nneed for what we\u0027re trying to do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\nThe Dream\u003c/h2\u003e\nEventually, we would love to see this idea grow into something which \nacts as a \"one stop shop\" for musicians of all types to connect with \nartists to venues, promoters, recording studios, artists to assist in \ndesigning logos and promotional materials, and of course other \nmusicians. We would eventually like to extend our podcast into a longer,\n more regular show or internet radio station with local music being \nplayed on rotation. With the help of message boards, forums, and \ndatabases, we hope to make it easier for everyone to connect in order to\n find the help they need. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are seriously considering acting as a Not For Profit agency since our\n main goal is to help musicians profit from their craft as opposed to \nprofiting off of someone else\u0027s work. The possibilities are endless, but\n we need the help of the community to make it happen."
