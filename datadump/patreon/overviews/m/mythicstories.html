My brother and I share stories to live by... ancient stories that deepen our understanding of ourselves and the world we live in. These stories are breadcrumbs that help us find our way out of the dark forests of our own lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i68.tinypic.com/20ihxe8.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support MYTHIC?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe short answer is because we will tell you more beautiful stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe long answer is a bit more personal...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA couple years ago I injured my leg and lost my ability to walk. I needed my legs at work, and without them I lost my job. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then: I lost my fianc\u00e9.\u003cbr\u003eAnd then: I ran out of money.\u003cbr\u003eAnd then: I moved back in with my dad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was physically and spiritually broken. I felt lost. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was moping around my dad\u2019s house and discovered a book of old folk tales that he used to read to me when I was a child. I started reading them again. The more I read, the more apparent it became that these stories were about me. Lost in a dark forest. At night. With hungry wolves closing in. And all I had was a flickering candle that was about to go out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the folktales also told me about people who got out of the dark forest. And I hoped that by following their footsteps, I could find my way out as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u2019t say I\u2019m out of the dark forest yet\u2026 my struggles are far from over. But the stories I read gave me strength and direction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had a friend who was also going through a tough time. I told her one of my favourite folktales\u2013 \u003cem\u003eThe Masks of God\u003c/em\u003e. She loved it. She suggested I share it on Youtube. I talked to my brother Alex who is an illustrator and he agreed to help. I told the story and he drew it. We made our first video. And MYTHIC was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to make a living by sharing folktales that help people. That would be the best thing ever. We give our folktales away for free. Which doesn\u2019t sound like a great business plan. But we hope that if you find our stories helpful, you will support us here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe just started this journey and aren\u2019t sure what the future will bring. But like any great undertaking, we won\u2019t succeed alone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you join us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/x2lwzq.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you like our stories, Patreon\u00a0is a way that you can pay us for each one we make. Patreon a paid subscription to our stories that you can cancel at any time. You can decide for yourself how much you want to pay for the subscription. For example, say you decide to pay us 1 dollars a story. So then every time we make a new story, you\u0027re credit card will be charged 1 dollar. And by the way, we only make around 2 stories a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour subscription allows us to produce amazing stories sustainably. It\u0027s\u00a0about frequency and quality. The more support we get, the more we can focus on making stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you like our stories, please support us. We appreciate it deeply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRegardless of our financial situation, we will continue sharing as many stories as we can. And our videos will always be free! \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "When we reach 500 dollars per video, we can afford to go pro! Our patrons are paying for a high quality production, and we\u0027re going to give it to them. We will upgrade to a professional camera... The coveted Sony A7S II would dramatically improve the appearance of our films. The colours would be better! The focus will be better. The 4K footage will allow us to zoom. Ah! Everything: Better! Plus we will buy lighting equipment. Right now we depend on sunlight for lighting... And we live in Vancouver... it\u0027s a rain forest habitat! It\u0027s cloudy almost every day! Talk about messing with our work flow. If we could buy lighting that workflow hick-up disappears. Ah!
