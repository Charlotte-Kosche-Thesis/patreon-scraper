The story will be told over four seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer\nand Autumn \u2013 what else?) and we figure it\u0027s going to be around 1000\npages.

The power of the imagination. It\u2019s how we can see hope on a\nbattlefield, find love across a barricade, and face certain death to save another\u0027s\nlife. So that\u2019s the deep theme, the idea that\u0027s right at the heart of our tale, but this is a big\ncanvas and every story starts with people.

But all of this pales into insignificance beside the one-shot comic of 3-5 pages in which your likeness will appear as a character, the original artwork of which you will own for framing on your wall.\u003cbr\u003e",

It makes a huge difference to us, not only in funding but (more importantly) because above all else creators need readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is our wildest-dreams target. If we can reach it then Leo would be working on Mirabilis full-time and Nikos \u0026amp; Mike can colour new pages as fast as Leo gets them ready. That would mean we could switch up to realeasing a new page of the comic every two days, and that way we\u0027d be able complete eight whole issues (a full season\u0027s worth) every year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d love to spend our whole time immersed in making Mirabilis, but no matter what level of funding you can be sure we\u0027re going to keep the comic coming!\u003cbr\u003e",
