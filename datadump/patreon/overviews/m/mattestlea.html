This includes projects, tutorials, reviews and finally my favourite playlist; Tool Duel where I compare competitive brands to make sure you are not wasting money on the wrong tool!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never expect any money from my viewers, infact I\u0027m trying to make a living directly from ads, affiliate marketing and sponsorship. None of that pay-per-view stuff. However, if you want to give back and help support me, you can donate what you wish whether that is $1 or $10, either way I would be incredibly grateful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis helps pay for new equipment, materials to fund future projects, it funds haircuts that I will probably never have. But most of all you\u0027re not only supporting me when making a donation, but you\u0027re helping thousands of other woodworkers by keeping me on their screens and allowing the flow of free information to be passed on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you ever so much, have a great day!"

     "about": "I\u0027m just a guy armed with mad hair, a jesus pen, and some skills with wood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to create woodworking videos that are not only fun and entertaining to watch, but also incredibly informative. Over the years, I\u0027ve noticed that people often start woodworking, enforce bad habits, become stagnant and struggle to take their woodworking skills further. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here to help with that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI studied full-time at Rycotewood Furniture Centre, a prestigious furniture making school, for 5 years in Oxford, UK. Over the years I learnt the basics of woodworking such as hand tools, machinery, power tools, furniture construction and timber technology. As well as the basics of design: initial ideas, concepts, developments, models and final designs. Being immersed in this environment for 5 years, surrounded by other creative people has given me a very comprehensive understanding of woodworking itself, and the most effective ways it can be taught.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, in addition to the 5 days a week at Rycotewood I have also worked at Axminster Tools \u0026amp; Machinery on weekends for the past 4 years. Here I get asked common questions about tools, specifications, and which is best for a job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo not only do I have the woodworking experience from Rycotewood, but through Axminster I also know the questions people are interested in finding out. An example of this is my YouTube series\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDPvEofXXRCP2yn0IMTG-FCQ6s2-qfHbD\"\u003e\u0027Tool Duel\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMy teaching style is very faced paced. We cover a lot in a short amount of time meaning you can get back to your woodworking as soon as possible. But more importantly I make sure all the necessary information is included and all the unneeded nonsense has been removed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo keep these videos coming and your woodworking progressing, consider supporting the channel as any donation will help me out tremendously! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy knowledge is yours for the keeping so long as I can continue funding myself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers!\u003cbr\u003eMatt\u003cbr\u003e",
