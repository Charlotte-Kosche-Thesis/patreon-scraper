During these crazy past 365 days I\u0027ve seen some amazing things and shared some fantastic games with you all on camera. Magic: The Gathering isn\u0027t my career but it has been a huge passion in my life for the last 5 years. I love the game, I love the community, and I love making videos that help showcase both. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Support Me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf your here, it means you love EDH and Commander as much as I do.
