Finding food and clean water while keeping yourself well-rested and in good health will all be challenges you will face.\u003cbr\u003e{Save the World} of Milohr from the 6 overpowered DoJo leaders and all other challenges as you make your way through each Biome. However, there are also zombies that you may have to fight against! Thankfully, you are not alone in your plight. There are others in the same situation. Find them, and work together!\u003cbr\u003eWhen looting and even venturing out you have a Survival chance mechanic that gives you odds of survival. This is helpful for deciding to sleep outside by a fire or looting a large building. Be careful with your choices as making the wrong one can get you or your teammates killed. With over 100 maps and 500 items (350+ items, Armor and Weapons to Craft) there is much to do. It will be a long night!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBackground?\u003cbr\u003eLong ago the Scientist of Miolhr worked on a cure for the multiple illnesses of their time. One of these \"Cures\" had horrible side effects turning man into Z\u0027s. This cause Havoc and Chaos all over Miolhr.\u003cbr\u003eMiolhrkind\u0027s last hope was left with these same scientist who continued to experiment with the Virus which changed so many of the Miolhrians into these Z\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e(As you can tell not all of the People of Miolhr were Genuses..)\u003cbr\u003eAfter years of experimentation and luck a second cure was found but didn\u0027t work as they expected.\u003cbr\u003eSide effect from the second \"Cure\" allowed some people of Miolhr to Control Elemental Skills.\u003cbr\u003eThese People were called Users. Elemental type(s) are Fire, Water, Poison and Ice.\u003cbr\u003e(User are people with the ability to control Element Powers.)\u003cbr\u003eAfter years of training, the Top Users created DoJo\u0027s to train \u003cbr\u003eand perfected their talents.\u003cbr\u003eYears later Z\u0027s stated to build immunities and split off into 3 forms.\u003cbr\u003ePoison.Blazing.Earth!\u003cbr\u003eThis also allowed them to use these Skills.\u003cbr\u003eAt the same time User trained developed 2 New Skills. Physical \u003cbr\u003eand Tool. \u003cbr\u003eWith these 6 Skills the World of Miolhr was balanced \u003cbr\u003efor a short time.\u003cbr\u003eDoJo leaders stared to develop Dual User abilities. \u003cbr\u003eThis was mostly through their training.\u003cbr\u003eThis gave them the ability to control 2 Elements at once. \u003cbr\u003eFor years DoJo leaders ruled the lands of Miolhr\u003cbr\u003e..until now...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/20mqrq.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://tinypic.com/r/20mqrq/9\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\" /\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\u003ca href=\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/WTnnjl4.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\" /\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
