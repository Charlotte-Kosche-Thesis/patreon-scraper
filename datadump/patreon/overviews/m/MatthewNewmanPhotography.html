    "summary": "Hello, Patrons! I\u0027ve been capturing the light in the darkness, shooting wide-field astrophotography for over three years. Chasing clear dark skies and capturing the stars in locations as you can really see them has been a huge focus of my photography. Inspiring others to get out, away from light pollution and see the stars for themselves is also a huge part of my mission. With 80% of the world\u0027s population never having seen the milky way with their own eyes, its been a goal of mine to capture and share the sites and scenes with them as naturally as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI first started shooting photography twenty years ago in high school. It was there that I learned on a 35mm camera, shooting on film, developing and printing my own work. I even built a darkroom in a closet in high school! Fast forward a few years and here I find myself working in the digital realm, with an intentional focus on treating it as much as I can like I were still working on film. Most of my photos are processed in Lightroom and occasionally make their way into Photoshop for limited processing. Educating my fans on how to shoot the night sky and letting them know that what they see in my photography is what they can actually experience is huge to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough much hard work, chasing clear skies and catching many lucky breaks along the way. I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to have pictures go viral, have Instagram feature my account and gain an awesome following around the globe. As an artist, without your support my work doesn\u0027t get seen and I can\u0027t pay my bills. My goal with Patreon is gain continued support from those who believe in my art and my mission, share tips, tutorials and tell you about some of the crazier stories behind some of my shots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support and I look forward to continuing to create awesome work to share with the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Matthew Newman"
