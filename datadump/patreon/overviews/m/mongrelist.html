I like to draw a little bit of everything, but I typically illustrate themes involving animals, monsters, and fantastical themes. I\u2019ve been drawing pretty much since I can remember, and specifically with digital media a bit over 10 years now. I\u0027m an artist who heavily leans in digital media, but explores traditional paints and inks time and again. I would like to bring folks far and wide with me on my journey, and encourage for them to have their own artistic experiences, whether it\u0027s through indulging in supporting artists, or creating work for themselves. I want to explore with others as we draw and create together! Maybe, with your help and Patronage, you guys can help me do a little more of both!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlso be warned, some of my work may not be suited for all ages!\u003cbr\u003e+18 and up, please!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u0027ve come here you likely already know of and appreciate my work, but in case you\u0027re curious:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mongrelist.artstation.com/\"\u003eArtstation\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/mongrelist/\"\u003eFuraffinity\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mongrelistic.deviantart.com/\"\u003eDeviantart\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mongrelist\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mongrelist.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mongrelist\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eArt is really time consuming, and I\u2019d love to keep doing it!
