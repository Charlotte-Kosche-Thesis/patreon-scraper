    "summary": "Well, I\u0027ve gotten you to this page, surely that\u0027s half the battle of convincing you. I\u0027m about to full-on grovel at your feet here, hopefully in a charming way. My lack of pride can be viewed as a very endearing trait, I\u0027ll have you know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eAlright, you got me, I\u0027m here. What is Patreon and why should I care?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon gives creators the ability to earn an income from what they create. The internet has given creators many platforms to advertise their work and garner a following, but very few of these sites give creators a way to get paid to do what they love (which, in turn, means they can do\u003cem\u003e more \u003c/em\u003eof what they love). With this website you can pledge a monthly amount to a creator you want to support, or pledge once and cancel your subscription as a donation to the creator in question (pick me, pick me!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eFair enough... Wait a minute, who ARE you?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m glad you asked. No, really, I love to talk about myself. The name\u0027s Kali, I\u0027m 20 years old, and I\u0027m pansexual/non-binary (gender labels are weird for me right now because I\u0027m tryna find the right one, but essentially I\u0027m okay with any pronouns so don\u0027t stress! Most people refer to me with she/her, but I\u0027m 100% happy with any). I currently live with my parents and am unemployed, due to a multitude of mental and physical health problems. I\u0027m sick, a lot of the time, almost all of the time. Think a stomach flu, but never-ending, it\u0027s rough buddy. So, me getting a full-time job? Nightmare material.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what do I do that is deserving of your potential support beyond just being gay and sick a lot? I tell stories. For the past three years, I\u0027ve been comfortably sharing my writing on\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/user/MelancholyMango\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWattpad\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e with the pseudonym MelancholyMango. Mainly, though the genre and plot varies greatly from story-to-story, my novels are dedicated to a young adult audience and trying to normalize/provide representation for people that are often silenced in mainstream society. So far, this has meant showcasing many healthy, happy LGBT+ romantic relationships as well as providing insight into characters suffering from mental illness while detailing their journey toward a healthy recovery and all the realistic progress/setbacks they experience along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough, I should also warn you, sometimes I write garbage. This can mean supernatural junk for the fun of it or nsfw content. You get moving, inspirational content or garbage. If you happen to like both, you\u0027ve come to the right place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is the most important part of my life, I have so many stories left to tell. Writing is what drives me, what makes the bad days worth it. The list of things I would give up in order to guarantee I could keep doing this thing I love more than anything else in the world? That list is long. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eOkay, I\u0027m listening, now tell me what\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRewards!!! Everyone likes rewards, do they not? If you glance over to the right of this page, you\u0027re going to see some different \"tiers\"; these are your options as a supporter. Depending on the amount you pledge, you will receive access to exclusive content and bonus rewards along the way. And, no matter how much or how little you contribute, you can rest easy knowing that you are supporting me and helping me toward my goal of being able to provide my audience with as much content as humanly possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you can only spare a dollar each month, those dollars will be worth inherently more than any other dollar I receive. If you give me a monthly pledge, it\u0027s a guaranteed reliable income no matter how small, which is something I won\u0027t have on any other site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eYou got me, I\u0027m considering. Anything else to say?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fact of the matter is, I can\u0027t do this forever on the income from ad revenue alone, not unless the wattpad system seriously changes for the better. It\u0027s enough to boost me ahead a little bit once every three months, but it\u0027s no living wage and it\u0027s so far from reliable it hurts. It\u0027s stressful. I want more than anything to be able to dedicate all of myself and my time to providing the people that support me most with the content they want to see most. I want to feel secure in my ability to do that while also surviving, preferably not by living in my parent\u0027s home forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what this is. This isn\u0027t me making demands or threatening to stop making content if it\u0027s not profitable, I will always find a way to write because it\u0027s what drives me in life and it\u0027s what I\u0027m most passionate about. You guys deserve free content and you will continue to receive it, regardless of my income. Your support is enough, watching ads is enough, anything you CAN contribute is enough for me. This is optional if you want to/are capable of supporting, that\u0027s all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank-you so much!! Honestly, even just taking time out of your day to check out this page and consider it is worth so much to me. I tried to make the rewards fun things that people would be interested in, but if anyone has suggestions please contact me and let me know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

The first ad revenue quarter on wattpad gave me a whopping $17 because I joined pretty late, the second gave me $175, and then this last quarter where i worked /so hard/ to fix my updating schedule and updated 8x as much: I made $146. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s still a big amount, I\u0027m still very lucky, but for it to be LESS money after me working so much harder was so discouraging. It prompted the great Misfit hiatus of May/June 2017 bc I was so at a loss for what to do when giving it my all wasn\u0027t enough. That\u0027s where this goal comes into play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I could make that amount MONTHLY instead of every three months, I would be meeting all the expectations I had when I started out on that schedule.

Real, hardcover books with my name on the cover chock-full of the LGBT+ representations we are so lacking in mainstream media. Talk about dream material, amiright?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo put this into perspective for you so it doesn\u0027t just look like a big row of intimidating zeroes: that\u0027s only 150 people pledging $20 dollars.

I\u0027m thinking long-term.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd to put it into perspective even more: In May 2016 I forced myself through the process of getting a job because my mom wouldn\u0027t stop pressuring me and talking about how I couldn\u0027t stay here \"free-loading\" forever. My anxiety paired with whatever mystery illness that my doctor can\u0027t diagnose that makes me sick almost all the time, made this a very difficult feat. But I got the job!! Even though the interview was a nightmare and I felt like I had the stomach flu the whole time!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI lasted a day at that job. One full shift. I was sick multiple times throughout the shift, uncomfortable the entire time, and then to top it all off it ended with a man screaming at me about how useless I was because I didn\u0027t know how to work the tills perfectly on my first day working. It was awful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if I\u0027d managed to keep that job? If I\u0027d forced myself through it and probably put writing on the back-burner altogether?
