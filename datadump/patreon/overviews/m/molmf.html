    "summary": "Thanks so much for stopping by! Here at Men Of Low Moral Fiber, we\u0027re all about one thing: classic LucasArts video games. We currently have a monthly podcast in which each episode is dedicated to a different LucasArts game. We love learning about old video games and doing hours of research to help educate others on the fascinating histories behind our favorite, classic games. And we aspire to do so in an entertaining fashion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more successful our Patreon is, the more time we can spend on research and production for our podcast. We will also be able to increase our overall reach and audience for our podcast and website, and the more reach we have, the more people can be educated (and entertained) about the glories of classic LucasArts video games and culture.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMen Of Low Moral Fiber is comprised of two brothers: Jason and Ben Helms. Growing up in Northern California, we played a lot of LucasArts video games as kids. (Our two favorites? Day of the Tentacle and Sam \u0026amp; Max.) We rediscovered Maniac Mansion a few years ago, and immediately the lightbulbs turned on! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe loved not only going back in time to play these old computer games, we also loved learning more about them. Because it\u0027s been 20+ years since most of them were developed, there\u0027s a lot of documentation and \"making of...\" information out there on these old games. Once we uncovered a few of their histories, we were addicted. The histories and backgrounds of how the games got made were often times just as interesting as the games themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt didn\u0027t take long for us to realize that other people would probably get a kick out of going down these rabbit holes with us, so we created a place online were people could do just that (www.MenOfLowMoralFiber.com). We started the podcast last year so people could hear about all the crazy tales of these games, and join us for the ride as we adventured down these nostalgia-laden paths together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you\u0027re able to join us! Just watch out for three-headed monkeys...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJason \u0026amp; Ben\u003cbr\u003eMen Of Low Moral Fiber\u003cbr\u003e"
