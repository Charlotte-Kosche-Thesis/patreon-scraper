    "summary": "Welcome to the shores of Madlandia! This is the land I retreat to for creative ventures. Most of my efforts focus on Crochet and Polymer Clay.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been Crocheting for almost four decades and working with Polymer Clay for three decades. Both mediums allow me to work with color, texture and to create lovely and useful items. I firmly believe that human hands were made for making. (Just to set the timeline straight, I\u0027m not 70+ years old, I\u0027ve worked on Crochet and Polymer Clay in tandem. Okay, I feel better now, let\u0027s move on.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been teaching classes in both Crochet and Millefiori (the technique I use with Polymer Clay) for years now and have been asked to create online tutorials so that I can reach more people. It makes sense since most of my community is online, so it\u0027s time. Though I blog over at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://madmadme.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMadMadme.com\u003c/a\u003e, my community is looking for tutorial videos, and some goodies along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Madlandia community is amazing! They have encouraged all of my creative works over the last several years and have challenged me to move forward with bigger plans and ideas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, I\u0027d like to offer video tutorial access to the folks that have purchased my written crochet patterns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, I\u0027d like to move from doing Clay classes in person and start creating Millefiori tutorials, sharing my owl style and tips along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThirdly, (this is a big one), I\u0027d like to pursue my plans to create a three book children\u0027s series that includes charming stories, fantastical creatures and settings, and crochet patterns to compliment these stories and allow different characters and elements from the books to come to life in the form of toys and accessories for the children that read them. How\u0027d you like that run on sentence? (I hope you liked it a whole lot.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and consideration. Will you join this Handmade Revolution?\u003cbr\u003e"
