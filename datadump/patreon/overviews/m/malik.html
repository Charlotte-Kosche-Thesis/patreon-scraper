    "summary": "Bellydance has changed my life a few times now, and teaching it has allowed me to change the lives of other women and girls around me. \u00a0I opened Hip Circle Studio, Inc. as a way to continue to spread the body positive messages I\u0027ve learned (and continue to learn) through my dance life and love that it is becoming a community staple that is self-sufficient.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging to be one of my patrons is a way to support me, as an artist, in my quest for growth and development. \u00a0That quest has a ripple effect on the women of the studio community, sure, but it also has an impact on a broader level with each video I share with the public, at each workshop I attend or lead in the bellydance community, for each party or event I perform - bellydance is something that Every Body can do and I want to empower girls and women all over the world to give it a try and find the beauty native to themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much of the creative aspects of my work go unfunded - the hours and hours of development required to craft choreography for myself and my student troupe, the hours and hours of costume design and construction, the hours and hours of practice needed to continue to thrive as a dancer - none of that is funded from anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have set up rewards - tokens of gratitude for your help to achieve my goals - for you. \u00a0The more pledged overall on a monthly basis the more I can grow and the more I can give. \u00a0I have also set goals for myself so you can see, from the other side, what your contribution is doing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you SO MUCH for being an official patron of the arts...MY patron! \u00a0:-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
