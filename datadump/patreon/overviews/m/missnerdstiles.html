    "summary": "This whole Patreon thing is a little terrifying for me, but here goes - after spending DECADES trying to make it as a legit actor and getting constantly told by Big Entertainment that I was too weird-looking, medium-sized, or too much of an alto, or living in the wrong place, or any of the other depressing things I was told as I pounded those pavements into smithereens - I accidentally reinvented myself with a ukulele and the fandom life I had been ignoring for a long time. I stepped up my cosplay game, began slowly writing my own songs (as opposed to the parodies I had been doing for years), and now I play these and nerdy covers at cons and other nerdy venues. I run uke-fests and uke-jams (mmmm, jam), I give lessons, and I foster starter ukes to give away, so others can also experience the life-changing awesome that I got from this tiny wee instrument. I\u0027m the reigning Miss Nerdstiles! I inherited the crown from absolutely no one, because I made it up, and now I am batting great big cow eyes at YOU, saying HI, thanks for reading this far, and hoping you might be so lovely as to chuck a cyber-buck into my cyber-hat every so often - I\u0027ll be able to make more things, and YOU, as an amazing sponsor, will be the VERY FIRST to get them - heck, sometimes you will be the ONLY ONES to get them! Can you STAND the excitement??\u003cbr\u003eBut seriously...thank you. From the bottom of my heart. In advance. I couldn\u0027t do this without you."
