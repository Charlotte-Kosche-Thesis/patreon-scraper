We all have bills to pay and we all work \nhard to earn a living so even a dollar is very precious.

I spread them \nout throughout a span of 1-2 months.

Once your pledge goes through, \nyou\u0027ll be able to gain access to the Patreon feed where I post the \nrewards. It\u0027s recommended you pledge in the first half or close to the \nbeginning of the month because you will be charged the beginning of the \nfollowing month and each month after that if you stay pledged. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs there a way to see past rewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePast\n rewards are available to their respective tiers on the Patreon feed. \nThey are also posted publicly outside of Patreon but has no indication \nthat it\u0027s a Patreon reward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you have 2 Patreon pages?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis page is NSFW and once you set NSFW on a Patreon page, it gets treated differently than non NSFW pages. There are also people who only want to see one of the two, especially the people who doesn\u0027t approve of NSFW at all and only want to see SFW content. There\u0027s no easy way to mix the two. Having 2 pages isn\u0027t a greedy attempt to get more support. I don\u0027t want to maintain 2 pages either. \u003cbr\u003e"
