That makes you not just a supporter, but a co-creator. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, the rights over the final product and all the privileges to earn billions of dollars and golden coins belong only to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease make sure to check the list of stuff that I don\u0027t want to draw before pledging here.

For the moment I can accept 12 (twelve) different requests. There will be a cooling list for those who got their request and thus giving a chance for the others to get them too.\u003cbr\u003eThe requests are free of any charge. However - You cannot ask for changes. The final result- is a surprise - hopefully, a good one. Patrons who pledge $10 and it\u0027s their turn to get a request from me - are getting an invitation from me on PM - inside Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe requests are also my way to experiment with styles, forms and techniques /if that could be said for the digital art/ - and to advance and evolve as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.patreon.com/file?h=16795785\u0026amp;i=1873347\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e/currently such kind of list doesn\u0027t exist, due to the simple fact: I have not enough people to pledge $10/.\u003cbr\u003eLike I already mentioned - I can do only 12 requests per month. That means the rest should wait.\u003cbr\u003eAnyways - those who already got their thing will have to wait until the cycle turns back to them.\u003cbr\u003eIt will be proportional: if I have 24 patrons who pledged $10, those who got their thing already will stay in that cooling list for 1 month, until they\u0027re able to get a request back. With raising the number of top tiers, the waiting cycle will raise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow the cooling should work: 1 gets a request, then they take a rest for certain amount of \"rounds\" months. Example: If I have -\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e12 top patrons - who pledge $10 - there will be no one to get inside the cooling list.\u003cbr\u003e24 top patrons\u00a0 - means the one who gets should wait for 1 month into the cooling list.\u003cbr\u003e48 top patrons /or closer that amount/ - 2 months to wait for the ability to request for another.\u003cbr\u003e96 top patrons/ or closer to that amount / - 3 months to wait\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order for them to save money, but if they still feel like they want to support me - I\u0027d recommend them to reduce their pledge to lower tier.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the lower tiers don\u0027t have the ability to get pdf with the content at the end :-D.\u003cbr\u003eLeaving the patreon and getting back when it\u0027s your turn, however, won\u0027t work.

However I drew them - like I mentioned on the above - I\u0027m a merc. This doesn\u0027t mean that I\u0027d draw absolutely anything that people would want for a pay.\u003cbr\u003eTime ago I used to be a graphic desginer.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m full time freelance artist now.\n\u003cbr\u003eMy style varied the past 6 years, while I was trying to discover something that I\u0027d consider to be mine or to be recognized with it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis somehow confuses people when they sees my artworks, thinking that these are works of several different people.
