Her personal assistant Ashley is also trying to get\nrecognized, but finds himself overshadowed and underappreciated. Controlling\nboth of their fates is the famous, or perhaps infamous Everett Evermore, founder\nof Evermore Industries, the newest R\u0026amp;D facility in the Nili Fossae terradome on Mars. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis Novel has been a\nlabor of love for the last seven years. It\u0027s been through 6 major edits and\nmany minor ones. Edits 2 and 4 had beta releases and were reviewed by my friends and\nfamily. Now it\u0027s time for the world to meet Rae and Ashley, but they need your\nhelp.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want\nto be clear that this is not something I\u2019m dreaming up, or something I\u0027m excited\nto start doing; this is something I\u0027ve already done. It exists! You could\nwait and get it when it comes out on Amazon after all the chapters are released. Or, you could pledge now and become\ninvolved at the community level, gaining early access to each new chapter as it becomes\navailable, and bonus content such as director\u2019s cuts, character sketches, behind\nthe scenes tech and history, and an audio book podcast when we meet that stretch goal.\u003cbr\u003e"
