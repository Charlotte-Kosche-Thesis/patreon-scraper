It\u0027s Monica here, from Maman on the Trail, and I would just love to say \"Thank you so much for being a fan and follower!\" \u2013 you are the fuel that keeps me going when the going gets tough!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mission at MamanontheTrail.com is to inspire, motivate, inform and connect with you around all things hiking, camping, parenting, and ultimately getting you and your kid(s) outside in a supported way. I\u0027m not an expert (yet) but I\u0027m happy to share what I learn and to learn along with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.mamanonthetrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Maman-on-the-Trails-Guide-to-Setting-and-Keeping-Intentions-Part-1-image-3-\u2013-family-relaxing-in-the-woods-in-hammocks.png\" style=\"width: 424px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy hiking, camping, paddling, wandering, exploring, learning and just being in the great outdoors with my family. I love to share anecdotes, advice, gear reviews, and giveaways with everyone who\u0027s along for the ride. I also enjoy creating great content, posting all over social media, connecting with outdoor and parenting brands, curating gear guides, organizing giveaways, learning about Forest School methods, and reading and responding to your comments and emails. All of this takes time, energy and money \u2013 which, we all know, are in limited supply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, I would love to be able to give you and my local community even more outdoor experiences, nature-based learning experiences, and guidance around amazing Forest School methods. In fact, I have a dream (slowly becoming a reality) of a once-a-week forest school program for at-risk kids. And I would love to be able to share those experiences with you via online courses and training. But these things require some additional training for myself, in the form the of a Forest and Nature School Practitioners Course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s why I\u0027m here, on Patreon, reaching out to you for your support. If you love\u00a0what I do, if I\u0027ve inspired, motivated, informed or connected with you in such a way that added value to your life and if I\u0027ve helped you and yours get outside together, then I simply ask that you give a little in return. And if you want to help me realize my big dreams, then your support would be much appreciated! Send me your spare change, a little something to keep me afloat while I work my tail off keeping you happy on the trails, and I promise I\u0027ll use it wisely. Every little bit helps and I\u0027ve even worked in some perks for you if you\u0027re feeling particularly\u00a0generous!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for being an important part of my tribe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you on the trails!\u003cbr\u003eMonica\u003cbr\u003ea.k.a.
