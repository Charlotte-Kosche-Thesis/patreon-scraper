    "summary": "Hello Everyone, welcome to my first Patreon project! \u00a0Most of my YouTube subscribers know me as Pinto, my real name Michael Wood. \u00a0The reason I opened this Patreon page is because I need some help with putting my new Labrador Retriever puppy (\"Micco\") through Service Dog Training.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was able to purchase my puppy from a kennel that specializes in service dogs in Albuquerque NM. \u00a0As many of you know, I\u0027ve been unemployed since 2012 because of my autoimmune disorder and the effects of the medications; consequently, my finances have been a struggle for some time now. \u00a0My disability case is also still ongoing, it\u0027s been 5 years of waiting and dealing with several unforeseen issues. \u00a0 I am still on medications that are causing daily pain and muscle wasting throughout my body, arms, legs and osteoporosis in several large bones. Thus the health deterioration has motivated me to prepare for worse times ahead and seek out help to obtain a service dog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did not have the money at first to pay for my expensive puppy, these pups are bred, tested, and selected based on criteria that qualifies them as service dog candidate. \u00a0This means we don\u0027t know exactly which male I will be getting yet, but we have already picked a name for him which is \"Micco\", a Seminole Native American word meaning \"Chief\". \u00a0The selection process is done by two professional trainers. \u00a0The puppies and the training are very expensive; however, I was able to sell some personal valuables that made it possible for me to reserve my puppy. \u00a0As of 7/5/17, he is only 2 weeks old, so we have 6 weeks more before he comes home with us and begins his training. \u00a0My deposit has been placed on Micco and the balance will be paid in full when he is 8 weeks old. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I have covered the cost of the Micco, I don\u0027t have enough money yet to pay for his professional service dog training, which begins at approximately 12 weeks of age. \u00a0This is where I am hoping for and asking for any financial assistance to help us pay for his schooling. \u00a0The entire training program will cost approximately $1500, plus his service gear and training aids. \u00a0I will be attending school with him as we both get trained together. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eANYONE may help me get Micco through service dog training, \u00a0any amount donated will be very much appreciated and will help us reach Kodi\u0027s goals for training and gear. \u00a0You can make a one time donation or become a monthly patron if you want. \u00a0 In exchange for your help on my Patreon page, I will record and post videos of Micco\u0027s travel home and his training progress. \u00a0This will include school time, practice time, home activities, public training as well as general play time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will watch Micco go through service dog selection and then through school. \u00a0 Also, because most of my YouTube subscribers know I\u0027m a knife maker and artist, \u00a0I will be making a custom knife every 8 weeks to be awarded to one of my qualified patrons by drawing names. Single donation contributors will have a drawing every 8 weeks as well; however, these prizes will be a surprise on the day of the drawing and could be almost anything I come up with. \u00a0I\u0027ll make sure it\u0027s a cool useful gift!\u003cbr\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo, if your a monthly patron and you win one of the 8 week knife or gift drawings, you will just need to send us your address if you haven\u0027t listed it on Patreon. One time contributors will be part of the 8 week drawings as well, the gifts will be something cool for each drawing. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you all might want to help me and Micco obtain his service dog training and enjoy his adventure from puppy hood to adult service dog. \u00a0My other special dog \"Dusty\" is still with me but she is aged and too short to become a service dog for my specific physical needs; however, she is still always right by my side. \u00a0You will see her almost as much as our new Micco!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease let me know if something is not working properly on my Patreon page and I will fix it as soon as possible. \u00a0This is my first Patreon project and I am looking forward to it very much! \u00a0I think we all will have some fun. \u00a0Come and join us and remember that any amount will help contribute to our goal of getting Micco through service dog training. \u00a0If you have an questions, feel free to comment, call or email us, we would love to hear from you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest Regards,\u003cbr\u003eMichael Wood \u0026amp; Micco\u003cbr\u003e"
