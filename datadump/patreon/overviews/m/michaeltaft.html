    "summary": "I\u0027ve been chomping at the bit for years to create my \u003cstrong\u003eDeconstructing Yourself\u003c/strong\u003e podcast. Now that it\u0027s here, it\u0027s a major hit. It actually got to #6 at one point recently in hot Buddhist podcasts on iTunes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for contributing to DY and helping so much to keep it going. It makes a huge difference to me, and to the wider community of fans like you who love the show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t forget to \u003ca href=\"http://deconstructingyourself.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echeck out the Deconstructing Yourself website\u003c/a\u003e to read articles on these topics as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDedicated to liberation in all its forms, \u003cstrong\u003eDeconstructing Yourself\u003c/strong\u003e is passionate about fearlessly investigating, attempting, and questioning all things to do with awakening, meditation, mindfulness, brain hacking, neurofeedback, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I\u0027m super lucky, I get the chance to interview some of the most interesting thinkers, authors, and teachers around, as well as other offerings. In this hard-hitting, radical, and fun podcast we look at secular post-, non-, un- Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta, Hindu Tantrism, philosophy, the neuroscience of the sense of self, neurofeedback and the consciousness hacking movement, aspects of artificial intelligence, entheogens, and much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re hankering for something beyond the dogma and conformism of your practice environment, think of the DY podcast as the radical cafe where you can hear from the most interesting luminaries either from the outside edges of dharma, or a fresh take from more traditional teachers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
