I\u0027m an H-game translator who started in 2015, and I\u0027m proud to have finished quite a few games. \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/m1zukis-7011761\"\u003eYou can find all my translations here.\u003c/a\u003e My goal is simply to provide the best quality translations I can for my favorite games so that more people can enjoy them.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSome Q\u0026amp;A:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat made you start translating games?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YHN07RL.png\"\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003eI like playing H-games, but reading Japanese can be a pain and machine \ntranslations are a turn off. I could never really immerse myself and \nenjoy playing games unless they were in English. Instead of waiting for a\n translation to pop up once in a blue moon, I decided to try making my \nown. Ever since then, I\u0027ve poured an ungodly amount of time into my translations to try and become the kind of dedicated and reliable translator that I always wanted to see.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eWhy should I support you?\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vN2HxUr.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003eI believe you should share things you enjoy freely, but also freely support things that you enjoy. If you\u0027d like to motivate me to complete more \ntranslations or want to show your appreciation, I\u0027d be glad to receive your support. I\u0027ve spent countless hours translating every day, but sometimes I wonder if I\u0027m wasting my time or if people actually value what I do. It\u0027s always encouraging to know that people want to support me or find enjoyment in my work, and my sincere to everyone who has thus far. :)\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAre you going to retire?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Y8hLJ6i.jpg\"\u003eI always feel conflicted because I want to keep translating, but it\u0027s a very time-consuming and draining process. I tend to go into a zone where I don\u0027t eat or sleep properly until my translations are complete. It probably helps me finish more projects than most people, but sometimes it can drive me to the brink of exhaustion and insanity. I usually work ~50 hrs/wk during the day and cut hours of sleep to translate every night. I\u0027ve been trying to take a more laid back approach ever since my health took a sharp decline, but it\u0027s still hard to keep myself from going overboard. Maybe one day I\u0027ll have enough support to translate full time but for the time being I just want to keep translating as much as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn any case, thanks for reading and have fun gaming~!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
