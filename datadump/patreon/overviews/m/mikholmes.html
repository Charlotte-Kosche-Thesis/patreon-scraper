Parlene climbs onto a hitching post, her voice cutting through the din, commanding the crowds to move to safety. She pauses only to bolster Molla, as she charges around a corner in pursuit of two other kobolds. The pair dashes into a tight alley, crashing barrels of grain behind them and scrambling up a lattice attached to a fence. Molla leaps after them, wedging herself perfectly between the two buildings. Langle slides under her legs, vaulting over the debris in chase.\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cem\u003eCursing, Molla extracts herself, uttering a protective prayer on Langle, and turns her attention to the kobold raining insults and sling bullets from the scaffolding above. She calls out the target for Parlene\u0027s longbow, but Targum has a quicker idea, taking out the scaffold\u0027s legs with his maul, taking out the scaffold and a decent chunk of the building\u0027s construction with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4hf83vS.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCHECK OUT MY COMPLETED PACKS!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, the best way to check out my completed work is to look at my packs on the Roll20.net marketplace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/set/1494/miks-mixed-roadside-maps\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMik\u0027s Mixed Roadside Maps\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/set/1513/miks-mixed-cavern-maps\"\u003eMik\u0027s Mixed Cavern Maps\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/set/1666/miks-mixed-riverland-maps\"\u003eMik\u0027s Mixed Riverland Maps\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT MIK\u0027S MIXED MAPS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey guys, my name is Mik and I do maps for RPGs! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing time-honoured techniques passed down from battle cartographers of the past, I\u0027m dedicated to making polished battle maps that look great and play well! I try to focus on things like \u003cstrong\u003eterrain variance\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003everticality\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003ereadability\u003c/strong\u003e; stuff that gives your players and monsters places to hide, climb, duck behind, or otherwise exploit, so battles can be as dynamic as possible, while being clear enough to tell at a glance what\u0027s going on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set up this patreon account to pledge for a per-map basis. I am hoping to release about\u003cstrong\u003e two to three maps a month\u003c/strong\u003e, so feel free to restrict your pledge to a certain number per month! Any pledge grants you access to all maps I produce, plus backer posts\u00a0where I show off production sketches, post battle scenario blurbs each map, and any other sketches, tokens, and bonus props I add in! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy map packs can also be purchased as \u003ca href=\"https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/search?keywords=\u0026amp;sortby=popular\u0026amp;type=all\u0026amp;genre=all\u0026amp;author=Mik%20Holmes\"\u003eRoll20 map packs\u003c/a\u003e to easily drop into your \u003ca href=\"https://roll20.net/\"\u003eRoll20\u003c/a\u003e games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/joIyNr9.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHO IS MIK?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Mik Holmes, from Vancouver, BC. I\u0027m just starting on my journey, improving with every map, and I hope that you\u0027ll be able to help me out while using these maps to get the best combat you can! I am living with Type-1 Diabetes, which means I take insulin shots and have to constantly monitor my blood sugars, which is very difficult to do when working in customer service jobs. Becoming a full-time illustrator means not only a career in something I love to do, but also the ability to give my health care the attention it deserves. Thanks to everyone who is supporting me on my way!\u003cbr\u003e"
