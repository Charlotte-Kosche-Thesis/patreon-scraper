I am a \u003cstrong\u003eHongKong-based musician\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eproducer\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eaudio engineer\u003c/strong\u003e, pianist, flutist, beatboxer, and a cappella bass singer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLittle bit more information about myself...\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, I just finished my Music Bachelor Degree in HKU and I decided to pursue my career as a professional music producer and audio engineer. I am so thankful that I got into \u003cstrong\u003eBerklee College of Music\u003c/strong\u003e (Valencia Campus) last year to study my \u003cstrong\u003eMasters Program in Music Production, Technoloy, and Innovation\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is how my story begins...\u003cbr\u003efor the past year, I have been digging into a lot of \u003cstrong\u003erecording techniques (Pro Tools), DJ skills (CDJs), Electronic Dance Music productions (Ableton)\u003c/strong\u003e, and I found myself belong to this Electronic Music world. As many of you may know, I came from a Classical (music) background and I am a long-term fan of being a Beatboxer and music producer. Last year, I spent the whole year working on my\u003cstrong\u003e thesis \u003c/strong\u003eabout putting \u003cstrong\u003eVocal Production (a cappella) with Electronic Music\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*****Here\u0027s the important part*****\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVery very recently, I am more than happy to announce that I was chosen as \u003cstrong\u003eone of the\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e6 finalists\u003c/strong\u003e representing Hong Kong to participate in \u003cstrong\u003eNetherland International Writers Camp (30/10-3/11)\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0in the next coming month. The Writers Camp is partly subsidized by a private music school called \u003cstrong\u003eBaron School of Music\u003c/strong\u003e, but the bad news is I still need approximately \u003cstrong\u003eHKD$20,000\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e(*USD$2500)\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eto make this happen.

I am deeply touched by my heavenly mom when I was 17. Her last words, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"do what you really wanted to do or else it\u0027s too late,\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e really inspired me ever since then, that is why I am pursuing Music as my career today. I guess many of us during high school period is still kind of frustrating of what you wanted to do in your life, hence you then followed the norm or your family\u0027s directions. I was lucky enough I figured out what I really wanted to do in the early time, and I keep fighting for it \u003cstrong\u003efor the past 10 years\u003c/strong\u003e. Sometimes it\u0027s lonely to walk on a Music Path by yourself, and there are moments that you just wanted to give up because of 1) the society, 2) money, 3) your family. \"Doing Music\" is not easier than working in other industries, especially it requires a lot of creativity, production skills, and connections. Not to mention about your \u003cstrong\u003econfidence, your vision, and your passion\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not know how my career path is going to be in the future to be very honest, it could be very exciting, but it could be tough as I \u003cstrong\u003eDONT EVEN WANT TO\u003c/strong\u003e think of.\u00a0I just want to take this opportunity to ask you all for one thing... to donate (as much as you want of course but it could be just USD$1) to show your support to me, my music, and more importantly, to the Electronic music scene in Hong Kong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current websites:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.martinlucy.squarespace.com\"\u003ewww.martinlucy.squarespace.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/martinlucy\"\u003ewww.soundcloud.com/martinlucy\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MartinLucyOfficial/\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/MartinLucyOfficial\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/martinlucy\"\u003ewww.instagram.com/martinlucy\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove all,\u003cbr\u003eMartin Lucy\u003cbr\u003e"
