Please join the Facebook fan page! Follow me on Instagram! The website sort of exists, but I need a lot more time and work put into it before it is really worth directing people tooooooooooo...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment my rewards aren\u0027t terribly exciting, but I am finally getting to a place where I can start offering better incentives. I am about to start offering comics ahead of time. So far I have been so busy with work that I was barely getting the comics out on time for the general public, but I am slowly working ahead enough that I am about to start offering Patreon supporters comics BEFORE anyone else gets to see them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince $5 a month is about the same as buying me a sassy coffee,  I would like to do a monthly \"coffee with Lisa\" video just for those  supporters! I have more ideas for rewards and as I get closer to my financial goals, I will be able to do more and more for you guys! Thank you SO much for looking at my page and considering supporting me and if you do Decide to support me THANK YOUUUUUUU!!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I LOVE knowing that my comics are enjoyed, and seeing which ones do better than other ones....but I can not pay my bills with Likes on Facebook.

I rarely get to enjoy the money I make and if I do I spend the next week feeling guilty or I end up having to put a tank of gas on my credit card. I literally can\u0027t afford to work less than I do. Your monthly contribution will literally take some of the weight off my shoulders and allow me more free time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT WILL I BE DOING WITH MY EXTRA FREE TIME????\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-I would like to finish my website for my own personal comics\u003cbr\u003e-I could draw more comics and different comics!\u003cbr\u003e-I would like to write and animate short stories or comics \u00a0for my Youtube page\u003cbr\u003e-I need to start sending letters and submitting my work to publishers and newspapers\u003cbr\u003e-I desperately need to edit my old comics, re-size them for different sites, completely redraw early badly drawn comics\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my comics, please support me so I can keep doing this.
