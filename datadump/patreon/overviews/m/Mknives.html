    "summary": "Aloha, person sitting on the other side of the screen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me present myself: I am Sander Miesse, a 24 years young, ambitious and passionate knife maker. I am Belgian, but I look kind of Spanish. Next to knives, I like to hang upside down on climbing walls and I enjoy making landscape - and product pictures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have chosen to dedicate my life to the journey of making the most awesome and beautiful knives that exist! My absolute DREAM is to live from my biggest passion and turn smiles on the faces of knife lovers. Instead of scrolling down on your social media pages, let me take 2 minutes of your precious time to tell you my story and hopefully inspire you to support my journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I could walk and talk, I went to the woods with my little brother Simon and made weapons out of all the things I could find laying around. He was so happy every time I made him something customised that I will always remember the joy I felt running through my body. My parents didn\u2019t like us playing with \u0027big-boy\u0027 weapons so as quickly as it started out, it ended.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I couldn\u0027t stop thinking about it and the ideas kept coming. So when I was finally old enough, I decided to start studying Mechanics, where I learned how to make all sorts of things out of metal.\u00a0I only had the opportunity to make knives, starting from the age of 20.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter spending hours on the internet scrolling through knife-pages, watching tons of Youtube videos and a journey to Japan to get a glimp of the real culture of knife making, I found out that the Japanese kitchen knives were very inspiring to me, so I decided to follow that path and try to create one of my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBIRTH OF MKNIVES\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the beginning, no one believed in me. They told me it was too hard and that I had to find a steady job to make a living of my own. But even when I tried to put my dreams to the side, I couldn\u0027t. If I didn\u0027t think about it, I would dream about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI found ways to get my materials cheaper to make beautiful creations and kept my evolution going.\u00a0After a lot of hesitation, I decided to put my insecurity to the side and started posting my work on social media. I was shocked when I noticed people were actually interested in what I had to offer to the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started taking orders from people that I knew - and didn\u0027t knew - and like this, my dream became more realistic. I thought to myself: \u0027\u003cem\u003eIs this really happening?!\u003c/em\u003e\u0027 I found the courage and fire inside of me to stand up for myself and my biggest passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNEXT LEVEL\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly talent, is not enough. To be successful I have to work hard, have the right equipment to make the quality knives I want to offer, and find a way to stand out next to competition through out strong marketing. But yeah, all of this costs a lot of money. And time. And oh, did I say money already?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know who is sitting on the other side of the screen.. But if you are still reading this, maybe in some way or another I took your interest. Maybe in some way, you can help me make this dream come true.\u00a0To start a business from scratch is hard. I\u0027m sure you can rely to that in one way or another :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started designing packaging for better presentation, started tweaking out my knives by making them lighter, thinner,\u00a0more durable and efficient. I spend all the money I have earned in the years of working as a student on buying myself some little machinery to provide the best quality for my clients. Others would maybe buy their first car or apartment, spend it all on boozing, but I invested it in my project to offer you guys the best kitchen knives, made with sweat, tears and love. Oh, and a lot of \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eblood\u003c/span\u003e. (Don\u0027t run away now :-))\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI NEED YOUR SUPPORT!\u003c/h3\u003eI want to buy professional machinery. Create a decent workshop. I wanna create a collection that stands out, that shows you what I can do. How a 24 years-young kiddo can make a high quality set of knives. \u00a0And I need your support for that. I need your help, to create a voice in this industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat makes these knives unique? Why support me and not someone else?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI take care of my clients. I will support you, the way you support me. The first persons who can provide me with 15 euros a month will receive a customised and professional \u0027Sardine Office Knife\u0027 delivered at their home. \u00a0And if this is too much, no worries.. With 5 euros you can already get personalised content and videos, be the first to pre-order, get all your questions answered and many more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn the mean time, I am brainstorming on more kinds of gifts I can give back to you guys! Woehoe!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if I will ever meet you in real life, you will see I\u0027m the kind of guy that offers you their seat on the bus, that will rescue little birds on the streets, that will always smile to people who have a shitty day, (getting emotional already?) gives you a ride home, will tell you there is still some spinach on your teeth\u00a0and will give you their last piece of cake so you can get back on your feet after a long morning of work. (= I am a NICE GUY!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eLet\u0027s skip more kissing-ass. Let me get to the point. You will NOT regret helping me and I will spend every cent you give me into good use. I will make videos where you can see which kind of knives I make and for what exactly I use YOUR precious money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you for your time and I hope you are not regretting those 2 minutes of time you spend on reading this :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease stay tuned for a personal introduction on video so you can see my face in real life!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you reaaaaaally can\u0027t resist, take a look at my social media:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.mknives.eu\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.mknives.eu\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/mknivesbelgium\"\u003ewww.instagram.com/mknivesbelgium\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/mknivesbelgium\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/mknivesbelgium\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a lovely day!\u003cbr\u003eSander\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Soo...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a knife maker, a knife maker that has chosen to dedicate his life to the making of the best most beautiful knives there are. That is why I need your help.\u003cbr\u003eBut first I\u0027ll tell you my story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a young ambitious 24 years old who started knife making 4 years ago but in my head it has been my whole life already. When I was young I had a passion for all sorts of weapons such as swords, guns, bows, \u2026 Together with my little brother we went to the woods and made these weapons out of all the things we could find lying around and afterwards we would play with it for hours. Of course my parents didn\u2019t really like us playing with these weapons as they thought it was too dangerous and that we would hurt ourselves and others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, this didn\u2019t end my passion. So when I started studying mechanics and that\u2019s is where I learned how to make all sorts of things out of metal. This is when I started reading more about how to make knives.\u003cbr\u003eThe first knife I made was out of a file, and I really enjoyed making it. After searching on the Internet I found that the Japanese style of making kitchen knives was very interesting and that I wanted to create a knife like it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBirth of Mknives.\u003c/h3\u003eWhen I showed my family and friends the knife that I made, they were very interested and wanted one for their own.\u003cbr\u003eThat is when Mknives was born. I started taking orders from people that I knew and made knives as they wanted them. After a while I went to several shops to show my design and I started working together with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext level\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eNow Mknives has come at a new stage. I started working on beter nicer packaging , tweaking out my knives by making them lighter thiner more durable and efficient cutting tools. I really want to squeeze out the best cutting tool you ever experienced, ever. There for I need performant tools. You know I started you with nothing just a file and a coal fire pit. But that is not the quality I want to give you I don\u0027t want to give you a knife I made the best I could with the things I have laying around. I want to give you the BEST knives there is. I want to create a mknife, a knife that stand for premium quality first and for all.\u003c/div\u003ein the mean while I stopped all my other stuf to go full on knife making BUT here is the thing to start a business from scratch is hard and I know it. I am prepared to work hard, very hard. But working hard will not be enough. To be creatief your mind can not be clouded with money worries or at least not much. Here is the problem to get the quality I want to give you guy\u0027s I need to invest in beter more performant machinery, a car to get them to you, marketing to let you know whats new and most important food on my table for me and my little family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am ready to start Mknives right now, without money, in fact I am already busy doing it. I\u0027m making a new series of mknives. There wil be 3 sorts of steel 4 Kitchen knife models and a Table knives set. \u00a0Alle my knives wil be stainless steel or at least partially for some models to ensure only the very best. And If all this is not awesome enough I\u0027ll also make a stainless steel damastcus knife in the 2018 series.\u003cbr\u003eWhy I do take such a risk? Just because I thrust you got my back!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can I given you back in exchange for you thrust in me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I can give you exclusive view behind the scenes\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- First view of the new models\u003cbr\u003e- First choice on pre orders.
