Welcome to the Druid Den! \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I stream video games on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/misfitdruid\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e at a rather noobish level. \u00a0I got into video games later in life, but am now completely in love. \u00a0World of Warcraft was the game that really sucked me into the gamer way of life. \u00a0I started in 2008, right before Wrath of the Litch King \u0026amp; it was all downhill from there. \u00a0Several years later I discovered Twitch though a friend, and here I am.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I become a patron? \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0You don\u0027t have too! \u00a0Any and all support is appreciated. \u00a0Just the gift of your time in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/misfitdruid\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003estream\u003c/a\u003e means a lot to me. \u00a0Should you make the decision to become an awesome patron covered in bitch sprinkles, you will be supporting the continuation of my addiction and improvement at something I love. \u00a0I work full time, so any and all stream support goes directly back into the stream to help the Druid Den expand and grow. \u00a0This includes upgrading my computer, the purchase of games \u0026amp; game subscriptions, cosplay outfits, (cause I am creatively challenged and can\u0027t make my own), and possibly toward the attendance of Cons where the Druid Cubs can congregate together and make a glorious cuddle pile! \u00a0Patrons are charged at the beginning of each month following sign up, (i.e. if you sign up in December, you\u0027ll be charged January 1st). \u00a0(See the \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\"\u003epatron FAQ\u003c/a\u003e for more information about monthly pledges.) \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNotes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 I have each tier marked to ask for a mailing address, as I like to periodically send out things to all of my Patrons regardless of tier just to say thank you. \u00a0In 2016 it was a Christmas card made from a professional photo shoot I had done. \u00a0You do not have to fill this out if you are not comfortable with providing a mailing address, (it can be a work, PO BOX, or home), but just know that\u0027s the only way I can send rewards to you. \u00a0I do not use it for anything else, and your information will be kept private. \u00a0Only I can see the address, and I have to click an extra button to see it. :-p\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
