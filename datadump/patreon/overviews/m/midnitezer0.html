    "summary": "What is up Heroes? This is MidniteZer0, and I\u0027m a guy who loves games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been playing games since early childhood, and beyond the mystical worlds, fantastic creatures, and unrelenting challenges, one of my favorite aspects of gaming has always been sharing the experience. I grew up playing games with my brothers, yelling our way through Gauntlet or coaching each other through Mega Man, and in high school, the fun continued with going to arcades and competing with friends in DDR. In college, I lost access to those friends, and I searched desperately for a new community, a group of people who shared my passion. I then found Let\u0027s Plays on YouTube. Immediately hooked, I started to follow numerous YouTubers who would later become inspirations, and it wasn\u0027t long before I wanted to give back and partake in the fun. As a result, I started my own YouTube channel, and despite occasional hiccups, the journey has been plenty of fun. I\u0027ve loved learning about content creation, the people involved in the Let\u0027s Play community, and the various games I\u0027ve played over the past years. It\u0027s my goal to continue this passion, to maintain this aspect of my life that\u0027s become intertwined with who I am. However, accomplishing this goal isn\u0027t easy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReal life often intrudes on this dream. I have other goals as well - attending medical school, learning Japanese, maintaining physical fitness, among others - and these goals are important to me as well. To accomplish these goals, much like YouTube, I need to invest an enormous amount of time, energy, and money - a sacrifice I\u0027m more than willing to make, but a sacrifice that takes a toll nonetheless, and that\u0027s why I\u0027m turning to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough positive comments, fan videos, and other encouraging remarks motivate me, any amount of monetary donation would enable me to free up mental space - to alleviate at least a few of the many stresses in my current life - so that I can not only afford to spend more time on YouTube, producing higher quality and quantity of content, but also to simply live more happily. Any donation would help me achieve all of my goals - enabling me to study more Japanese, prepare more for medical school, spend more time with Lizzy, focus on my physical fitness - without being bogged down by financial worries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, with that in mind, I kindly ask that if you feel compelled to and can, please do support me. Any donation, no matter how big or small, would be greatly appreciated, and if it helps, I\u0027ve created various rewards for varying quantities of donations. Depending on the amount, you could be able to chat exclusively with me and other Patrons about ongoing series, participate in exclusive Q\u0026amp;As, have your video or even entire channel reviewed by me, suggest games for the channel, or even co-commentate with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make this dream come true together :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eNick // Zer0\u003cbr\u003e"
