I\u0027ve always loved reading manga and this was my way of giving back to the community. Fast forwarding to now, \"MangaViewer\" is the best extension on Chrome and thousands of people are using it everyday. I have put more than hundreds of hours into developing, fixing bugs, adding more sites and keeping up with their changes. The work seems never ending and as much as I would love to carry on, my job and personal life gets in the way. \"MangaViewer\" being a free extension does not get me any money and in order to make a living I had to prioritise my job over this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is where I need your help. Consider helping me support this awesome extension by being my Patreon, so everyone can still have it for free and I cut some hours from my freelancing work and put it into this extension.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMangaViewer:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/manga-viewer/bebalkdfejapnfbngpmhchkboajaofen\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/manga-viewer/bebalkdfejapnfbngpmhchkboajaofen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHow to unlock patreon supported sites\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-to-unlock-6775791\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/how-to-unlock-6775791\u003c/a\u003e"
