    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, I\u0027m Ryan.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re reading this then its probably because you\u0027ve either seen or currently watch my YouTube channel. So whats up dude! Thanks for taking the time to come here and read this. I\u0027ve been making YouTube videos about video games and PlayStation since 2012. That\u0027s a crazy long time, and I\u0027ve loved every minute of it. So many of you over the years have always been so kind to me, and I couldn\u0027t be more thankful for your overwhelming support. With that, I\u0027d like to share a small story with you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 When I was in High School, there was nothing I loved more than our emerging landscape with online video and media consumption. I loved creators, YouTube, podcasts, everything I could digest. I wanted to create myself, and so I did. Me and a close friend started a gaming podcast. And we did it for an entire year, every Thursday night, without fail. We only ever got 1 email from a genuine viewer who found and liked our show. It was one of the coolest moments of my life. But slowly, the grind of doing that for essentially nothing got to us, and we stopped making it. Fast forward a few years, and this is when I decided to make YouTube videos. Well, here I am today, with actual viewers, you, who keep me going each and every day. Thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0As you may already know, YouTube can be a tough place to make extra money if you\u0027re a smaller channel like mine. And funnily enough, over the years, I\u0027ve seen channels blow up and see tremendous success, and that\u0027s great. But sometimes they do things that I just don\u0027t want to do on mine. Things such as baked-in ads, caps locking the title of videos, click-bait titles, heavy merchandising, sponsored videos, shorter videos, extra ads halfway into videos, the list goes on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI try to avoid all of these, it\u0027s not what I want to do. And I get offers very frequently to my email for this kind of stuff.\u00a0 At one point I turned down a $3,000 offer from Sony Ericsson to do a sponsored video on one of their phones. That\u0027s a lot of money to a guy like me, but it\u0027s just not something I want to be apart of.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Patreon gives me the flexibility to keep doing what I\u0027m doing, and focusing on the kind of videos you want to see. It allows me to reinvest in my channel. It allows me to take a day off work, to make an extra video. To work on longer videos, better videos. I can find time to stream more. Every bit of generosity helps, if you\u0027re inclined. But I want to be totally clear, you don\u0027t have to donate any of your hard earned money if you don\u0027t want to. The channel goes on, and your support whether monetary or not, still means everything to me.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
