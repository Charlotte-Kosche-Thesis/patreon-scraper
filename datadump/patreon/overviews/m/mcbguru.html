What was generated under the surface though provided an answer, if a slightly unconventional one. Masses of metal, precious and otherwise, bubbled to the surface of the world. Having already reached a technological level that involved computers and worldwide network of shared knowledge, the big corporations of the world raced to produce machines with an intelligence that would enable the world to function and rebuild itself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, a separate group are building hybrid humans using gene splicing and cloning techniques to produce loyal and capable workers. They manage to achieve some impressive results, but the Animutes are not treated like people and that creates its own problems.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe result was a whole new level of technology capable of working and operating as close to humans as possible. Unfortunately, the personalities they created were a little \u003cem\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e realistic, and came with their own collection of neuroses and quirks. All of which can make for an interesting conversation with your coffee machine first thing in the morning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA prototype replacement is under production by the programmers from the original development effort, but when it\u0027s creator dies, the replacement decides to take it\u0027s existence into it\u0027s own hand, and it escapes. Roger, an experienced, albeit, reluctant engineer, is asked to find the prototype, which leads to an intriguing mix of industrial espionage, personal feuds, and some interesting gadget therapy as he picks his way through humans and machines to find the right one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKing\u0027s Courier (Fantasy)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMovo is a courier, ferrying messages and information between different parts of the city. Although only 14, he is a member of the most important guild; the one that keeps the engines of both the business and political worlds alive. He spends most of his days distributing messages between the different businesses in the city, everything from produce orders to alliances. As messenger, he is not only trusted with this information, but also privy to more about what is going on in the city than most.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMovo helps a new girl, Tambil, who is new to the game and wants to learn the ropes. Tambil is from the north of the country and has never been in such a huge city before, never mind the desert. After a chance encounter with some soldiers at Mr Silverkin\u0027s estate, Movo and Tambil find themselves providing messenger services for an intriguing new client.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the process, the two of them get caught up in a political game involving families new and old, and information known only to a woman that Movo must visit regularly near the East Sea.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBird in the Hand (Romance)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove is never simple and sometimes we do not get to choose the people who we fall in love with. But what do you do when society prefers one model for love, and your heart prefers a different one? Following the lives of different people we will see how desire, connectivity, and society can create exhilarating and dangerous implications for modern love. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is your Patronage going to do for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eGet you access to the stories and worlds I have in my head so that you can enjoy them.

     "description": "I used to be a semi-professional photographer back when it was film-based and I used to use Kodak Ektar slide film. When I gave that up, I also gave up my SLR camera. This only becomes a problem when I find myself in places like the Arctic wanting to take photos of the northern lights and deep, dark, landscapes in the arctic circle winter light. My small point and shoot camera is good, but was not quite up to the task. I don\u0027t quite want to go back to the full professional kit, but a simple SLR and some decent lenses would help me get better photos and more inspiration.",
