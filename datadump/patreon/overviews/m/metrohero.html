    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are two software developers, James and Jen, both residents of Arlington, VA and frequent Metrorail commuters. In September of 2015, we launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hodgepig.wmata\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMetroHero for Android on Google Play\u003c/a\u003e. It was the first app to show users real-time train positions on every line in the DC Metrorail system, giving everyday riders the power to visualize train locations, delays and congestion in a way that had never been available before. Since then, we\u0027ve created\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.dcmetrohero.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea mobile-friendly website\u003c/a\u003e that supports all major platforms, we have developed an extensive system of tracking train metrics like terminal station departures and the number of 8-car trains in the system, and we have most recently started to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://dcmetrohero.com/metrobus\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edip our toes into the Metrobus space\u003c/a\u003e.

WMATA, the agency that manages Metrorail, has made great strides since we first came on the scene in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.wmata.com/about/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=6136\u0026amp;ReleaseID=6136\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eproviding better data about their trains\u003c/a\u003e, but there is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://trello.com/c/4PzL4tpP\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003estill\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://trello.com/c/ejqIOxJs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea lot\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://trello.com/c/WLsbtBAA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eof room\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://trello.com/c/trbQrxfC\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eto improve\u003c/a\u003e.

Before Patreon, we were showing ads in our Android app, and it cost $0.99 to remove them. The money we saw from the $0.99 donations and from running these ads were what we used to offset the costs of keeping MetroHero running.\u00a0We were never truly comfortable with this arrangement as it unfairly punished Android users--our first audience!--and degraded the MetroHero experience for those who didn\u0027t donate.\u00a0Instead, Patreon allows us to accept donations only from the people who care most about MetroHero\u0027s continued success so that we in return can offer a service that is truly free for every commuter, pure and unencumbered by ads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are donations used for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt currently costs at least $90/month to keep MetroHero afloat in its current state. This figure does not include annual expenses and and other miscellaneous expenses that are less predictable. The first $90 of total donations received per month go towards offsetting all our expenses. A portion of the remaining donations will go towards\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://railtransitops.org/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRail Transit OPS\u003c/a\u003e, an independent, publicly-funded group that analyzes and evaluates the operations, performance, and safety of Metrorail. Any remaining donations will be tucked away for a rainy day and to further development of any new features and projects, which may later increase our monthly costs. For example, most recently we were able to dip into our surplus of donations to fully fund the development and release of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/metrohero/id1375269139\"\u003eMetroHero for iOS\u003c/a\u003e to the App Store.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe make every effort to be as transparent as possible with regards to the donations we receive,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://trello.com/b/82MKv5uq\"\u003ewhat we plan to do with those donations\u003c/a\u003e, and what those donations actually end up funding. To that end, for a full breakdown of our revenue and expenses since we started this project through today,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qBiraucevBssE27vET-zGm7rrsaDNKkOy4NLPpIvLaw/edit?usp=sharing\"\u003eclick here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Full disclosure: our lead developer, James Pizzurro, is a Charter Member of Rail Transit OPS. \u003cem\u003eIf you would prefer for any reason that your donation not be used to fund Rail Transit OPS, please let us know and we\u0027d be happy to accommodate your request.\u003c/em\u003e)"
