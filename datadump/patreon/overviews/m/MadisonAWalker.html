I\u0027ve always enjoyed making fun of the camera guys, laughing at my own jokes, and generally pretending like I know what I\u0027m talking about on the air, and I hope to bring my mediocre disc golf knowledge to the table much more often in the coming year! If you want to enable my fantasy of believing that people actually want to hear my rambling opinion, pledge today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut seriously, I jumped into disc golf wholeheartedly with both feet, and I feel that my extensive touring schedule over the past three years has been a crash course of knowledge and experience. More than anything, I\u0027ve learned that I love the disc golf community immensely, and all your support and encouragement is overwhelming. I\u0027m working hard to play full time while also bringing relevant and entertaining disc golf content to viewers, and any little bit helps to make this demanding schedule a reality. Thank you so much, and I\u0027m honored to represent women\u0027s disc golf, and our beloved sport in general, to the best of my ability!"
