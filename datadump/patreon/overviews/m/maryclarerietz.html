At 29, I started making art for the first time. Now, my background in organizing combines with my art\npractice to fuel a keen interest in what I call\u00a0\u003cem\u003eaesthetic action\u003c/em\u003e. I engage with people and materials to create objects, performances, and participatory processes, often\u00a0in response to dis-connects that exist and carry a\npower differential.  With an aesthetic of\nrelationship at its center, the work goes further, pointing to action that\nparticipants might choose in response to changes in thought or feeling that\nrelational experiences might bring. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eProud to say I recently completed my MFA at the University of\nCincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning (2016).
