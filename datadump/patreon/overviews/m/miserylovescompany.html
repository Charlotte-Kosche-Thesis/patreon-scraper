Join as we embark on an immersive ethnographic adventure exploring \u201cThe Art of Failure.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re defying social conventions and fully embracing what is considered \u201cfailing\u201d or falling short of achieving \u201cThe American Dream.\u201d We deviate from our traditional careers, relationships and accumulated debt for a life that\u2019s more \u2026 fulfilling? Extraordinary? More often than not, our misfortune and misadventures pan out to be neither.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListen, read and watch as we adventure across the US while exploring national parks, busking for breakfast, chasing our most elusive vices and stumbling from mishap to mishap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Hosts\u003c/h3\u003eWe\u2019re best friends from the Midwest bound for the West Coast and warmer yet darker days. Our bags are packed and we\u2019re driving west with only one item on our agenda: when we fail, do it artfully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eForest (also known as Epona) is a 25-year-old farmboy with a mullet named Linda, a fondness for history and a keen eye for a good deal. He\u2019s a certified history educator who left the classroom after a year of teaching to learn more about the world and himself, an endeavor made possible through lots of odd jobs and a country-style work ethic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZach (also known as Weasal) is a 25-year-old lost boy with a broken hip, a love for literature and the unique ability to weasel his way into places he should probably be barred. He\u2019s a published ghostwriter who develops marketing management and strategy for several companies. In his free time, Zach stays vigilant writing his own book while smacking away on his very loud, very broken typewriter that gets lugged along on every adventure like a vagabond\u2019s suitcase.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy Donate?\u003c/h3\u003eBottom line is, this miserable life ain\u0027t cheap. We live beyond bare bones, as you\u0027ll learn as you listen, watch, and read. We live on uncooked beans for weeks at a time to save money and never miss a chance to dumpster dive for everything from edible food to fashionable clothes and salvageable art. Nonetheless, we do need money to get around (especially during our road trip), to finance all this content, and, of course, to salvage our futures following inevitable fuckups we plan to embrace along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re not bums! We\u0027re always working one way or another! Whether it\u0027s providing freelance marketing consultation for new companies and ghostwriting for new authors, or providing manual labor and landscaping expertise, we\u2019re staying busy all across the country. \u003cbr\u003eThe more you pledge, the more we can commit to sharing our stories with you and fulfilling our dreams of being full-time creatives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for everything, y\u0027all! Glad to have you here sharing in our happy misery -- we make the questionable decisions in life so that you can learn from our mistakes and laugh along the way.\u003cbr\u003e"
