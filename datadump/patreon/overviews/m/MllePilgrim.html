    "summary": "For as long as I can remember I\u2019ve always wanted to capture what I was imagining into an image. In primary school I always had a disposable camera with me. I studied cinema after high school and even made a couple of short films. The thing I loved most was to be able to tell a story. Telling a story in a single photograph as opposed to film is definitely much more of a rewarding challenge. I\u0027ve been studying Photography for the past few years and I believe I have found what I truly love to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotography is not just a passion for me. It is an extension of myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Ga37Pv9.jpg\" style=\"width: 669px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mffiP3V.gif\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotography is really expensive. My current situation doesn\u0027t allow me to pursue everything that I want to do - I live by myself, still go to school and work part-time at a cafe. I can\u0027t find a lot of time to work on all the projects I would love to work on. If you\u0027re interested in the work I do, supporting my Patreon can free up more of my hours to make these projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/pwWRabW.gif\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyone who decides to become my wonderful Patrons will be kept up to date on what I am currently working on. You will have access to behind the scenes photos and videos. If you like you can even receive postcards and photos in the mail. I want to give my Patrons a chance to see my process as well the opportunity to influence what I make. I would love to hear what you would like me to make. I love collaboration and I love when other people become part of my projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/T8VeElT.png\" style=\"width: 674px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fLtHycd.gif\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I hope to be able to continue working on my photography projects with less worry about financial issues. Without the support I have had over the years I probably would not be able to continue going down the path I want to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am thankful to everyone who is willing to help me do something that I deeply love. \u0026lt;3"
