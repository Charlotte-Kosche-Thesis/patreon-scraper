     "about": "Hello there. I\u0027m a horridly shy artist who enjoys putting together character designs and sharing my work, even if what I post is on the crappy side. While I still have much room for improvement, I still like to have fun with attempting things and occasionally frustrating myself trying to figure out a concept or pose. I have been working with original characters, but recently I started up a project where I draw female hunters from the Monster Hunter series in armor. Eventually I hope to put together a coloring book of the Hunter Girls soon for your enjoyment, as well as a few original print series and possibly even comic pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do both traditional and digital art, but try to start off traditionally first. I may not be the fastest at finishing whatever I start, but I\u0027ll do my best! Critique is always welcome. Much of my previous art can be found on \u003ca href=\"http://miuspot.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy Tumblr page.\u003c/a\u003e",
