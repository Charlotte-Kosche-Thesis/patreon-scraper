My passion, what keeps me up late at night and inspires me during the day, is creating stories and art. I am that person who, while attending a lecture, often drifts off into his own world of fantasy and adventure. A word or phrase spoken in a conversation can inspire a brief mental hiatus while I explore another existence, only to wake up at the awkward moment where my response is required. I have been writing and drawing since childhood and will continue to do so until my last day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\nPatreon gives me an excellent opportunity to connect with my readers and art enthusiasts in a more intimate way than ever before. I don\u2019t want to just share my novels and art with you, but open up a world from which the stories and images are produced. The Process. It also gives me an opportunity to express my appreciation to you more directly and more exhaustively. You bring my world to life. Let\u2019s explore that world together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat Can You Expect?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\nBy subscribing to my Patreon, you will get exposure to the behind-the-scenes reality of creating stories and related images. Higher levels gets you deeper content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe overall content includes the birth of ideas, everyday inspirations, character and plot development methodology, world-building, exploratory scenes, rough chapters, the editing process for the stories, and the rough to final images for the related visuals I create. Eventually you may even get to see the creation of screen-scripts and animated scenes. The possibilities are wide open. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor those who aren\u0027t ready to become my patron, I do provide some free content too. My introductory WIP images and the medium resolution final image from my art projects will be free, along with various coherent and incoherent babblings, perhaps a surprise snippet and treat here and there. Please follow me, then subscribe later.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnless specified, your Patron Rewards will be made available scattered throughout the month. Final high resolution images, process images, PSD files, and walk-through videos will be made available by the end of each month, though if I get done early and get too excited I reserve the right to release them earlier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cem\u003eShameless Plug.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\nIf you are interested in my writing, do give my published book a gander. More will follow in short order, a process you will get to witness here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/Crow-The-Awakening-AM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCrow - The Awakening\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
