     "description": "My goal is to be able to fully support myself financially, doing the things that I love. Right now this work looks a lot like Writing, Journaling, Tarot Reading, Yoga, Reiki, Digital Art, Hipster Apothecary and Intuitive Life Coaching. I have always had an interesting relationship with money. Most of the work I do has never been paid for, and most of the money I have received didn\u0027t arrive from working. This may seem strange to some but when I am doing work that I love, work that makes me feel good, there is no need to worry about getting paid because one way or another I am always taken care of. The always universe provides.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a traveler and people connector. The freedom to move freely and be constantly studying, learning, sharing, and growing is like oxygen to this body. Last year I was lucky enough to spend almost a month traveling and couch-surfing across 7 states and 13 cities. A lot of that time I did not know where I would be sleeping, or who I would meet on the way. This trip was such beautiful experience. I connected with friends I hadn\u0027t seen in years. People opened their homes, sometimes without even knowing me, and we had \u00a0conversations that were\u00a0beautiful and honest,\u00a0about who we are. I also got to practice my energy healing work in all sorts of strange locations: sitting on a blanket on the Grassy Knoll as Penland, at an art party were people were getting tattooed, in my friend\u0027s magical Mid-century Modern Asian Retro house, and sitting in front of the TV in Bucks County, PA, watching Harmon Quest. Traveling and spending time with people I care about deeply is where I feel most at home. I am the most open to magic, the most at ease, when I can be in many places and practice just being the magic that is me. I would love to travel again very soon. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
