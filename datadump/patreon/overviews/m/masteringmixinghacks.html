I actually had a studio like that once but had to sell every piece of equipment and acoustic treatment to pay for rent since I wasn\u0027t generating enough to support myself with my music.

She paid for meals, the roof over our heads and even for my musical education providing online courses, plugins, and software when I didn\u0027t have enough. She believed in me then and believes in me now enough to marry me. She deserves the wedding of her dreams:) Help me get it for her!",
