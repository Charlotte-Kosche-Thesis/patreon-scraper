    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor the past three years, Medieval Astrology Guide has been a growing resource on the history, philosophy, and practice of classical astrology. One aspect of bringing classical astrology into contemporary practice is revitalizing old texts that connect us with our history. While many prominent authors and translators have done the community a great service by translating these texts into English from Greek, Arabic, and Latin, there are still so many more texts out there that remain inaccessible to a wider modern audience. Our goal with this Patreon is to bring one of these untranslated texts into wider awareness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Text\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe text currently under translation is \u003cem\u003eThe Rationale and Use of the Critical Days\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0by Thomas Bodier. It is a treatise on medical astrology and focuses primarily on the critical days doctrine and the prediction of the course of an illness from an astrological chart. Bodier was a 16th century astrologer and physician who lived and worked around Reims, France. His work is divided into three parts with the middle section comprised of a collection of chart examples (\u003cstrong\u003e57 \u003c/strong\u003eto be exact) from his own case studies between the years of 1543 and the book\u0027s publication in 1555.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Is This Text Important?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe most significant aspect of this text is the large number of examples. While medical astrology was a common application of the art throughout the medieval period, we don\u0027t see that many working examples in the extant texts. This is true for most of astrology as historical textbooks focus more on transmitting the techniques and philosophies and less on showing practical examples.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the most influential works in the astrological tradition are those that provided examples such as William Lilly\u0027s \u003cem\u003eChristian Astrology \u003c/em\u003e(which features 35 example horary charts) and Nicholas Culpeper\u0027s \u003cem\u003eAstrological Judgment from the Decumbitures of the Sick\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0which while being another work focused on medical astrology only features 10 examples. Bodier\u0027s work could have easily had a vast amount of influence on the tradition if only it had been available in English.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you have an example of the translation?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.medievalastrologyguide.com/uploads/1/8/9/6/18961705/example_translation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAbsolutely!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe text is translated from its original Latin and comes with notes about the translation and the astrology being employed. Furthermore, the example charts have all been updated into modern chart forms to improve readability.

Please see the rewards tab for specific rewards at various levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps the most significant reward is that there are no plans to introduce the translations to the general public until completion. This means that throughout the translation process, access to the text will be patron-exclusive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Translation Team\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRyhan Butler is the creator and administrator of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.medievalastrologyguide.com\"\u003eMedieval Astrology Guide\u003c/a\u003e.
