    "summary": "Hello there! My name is Maya, and this is my patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is this page for? Well, I tend to rant, er, talk a lot about social justice issues, particularly transgender related issues, and sometimes other topics. Sometimes people find what I have to say pretty interesting. Usually these rants are on Twitter, but sometimes when I remember I have a tumblr I use it for longer things. I hate tumblr\u0027s design and layout though. It annoys me on a highly personal level I have difficulty putting into words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I figure I can instead use patreon for longer posts. Every post will be free for all to view, but if you\u0027re feeling particularly generous, you can donate for a month or two (or longer even). Or not. I suspect a lot of people who may be reading this are even more broke than I am. So no matter how much you like my posts, don\u0027t worry if you can\u0027t donate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand, if you HATE my posts, I strongly encourage you to donate, as being generous and kind to your enemies is good for the soul, and helps work out anger issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading so far, and I hope you find my posts interesting."
