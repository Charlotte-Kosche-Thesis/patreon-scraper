I have just reached over 160k subscribers and I am feeling with the ever growing number that I really need to step up my game, but I need your help. All my content will still be free, this just gives you a chance to support me in what I do, so that I can make the best videos possible for you to learn from. I wish I could do it all myself but I am only one person. So I need you, my most loyal fans, to stand up and help me improve the channel."

     "about": "Hi I\u0027m Candy from Meladora\u0027s Creations and I design crochet patterns and film them on You tube. I want to start by saying, I am by no means a professional teacher. I figure things out as I go along and I love playing with yarn! This is how I have discovered new crochet stitches. I am a mother of two, girl 6, boy 4. I live in Israel presently, but I was born and raised in Oklahoma. I met a man on an online game and became friends and through time we fell in love and I came out here to Israel to be together. From lack of knowing how to speak Hebrew, I had to find a way to help take care of our two kids, so after sharing my crochet projects online and being asked to do a tutorial on one of them, I finally broke down and tried it. Click on the \"About Me\" on the top of my webpage to read a longer version of my story.",
