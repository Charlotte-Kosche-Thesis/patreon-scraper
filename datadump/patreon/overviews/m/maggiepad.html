My work and inspiration come from being human, a curious and inquisitive nomad, and from being passionate about the lives, cultures, and issues faced by people many of us hear very little about\u2026.I am a free-roaming, story-hunting, lover of all things that I believe contribute to a better understanding of what our global community is all about today. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0cc287_4c3e64ce79b74a5ea829c1ad87fa8dca~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1767,h_1161,al_c,q_90/0cc287_4c3e64ce79b74a5ea829c1ad87fa8dca~mv2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMY APPROACH - REFINED\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI once travelled, shot, and produced stories according to the way that I learned how. Story topics needed to \u201cbleed to lead\u201d (as was the unfortunate lingo often used in newsrooms for stories that made it to air). A certain structure was always to be followed, and stories were pieced together in a way that would make them as edgy as possible. I do, of course, understand the need for that and the why (having worked in the broadcasting industry) but I am, as part of my personal work, venturing away from that now. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSure, that \u201chook\u201d is always needed but I believe that documenting and sharing the more authentic and real slices of life provide us with an even better glimpse of them. My once rigid focus is now less focused - meaning, I that am opening the opportunity for the unpredictable, the raw, and the less editorialized versions of the moments I encounter and experience along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to bring YOU along with me as I travel the world and meet some fascinating people, ride my bicycle, walk, or coast through some incredible regions and sites.
