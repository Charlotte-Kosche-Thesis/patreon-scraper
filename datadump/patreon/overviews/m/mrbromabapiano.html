    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi there!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Magnus aka. MrBromaba and I\u0027m a 17 years old pianist from Germany. I play the piano since 2008 and I have to admit, playing the piano hasn\u0027t always been \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e big passion it is for me today. So let me tell you how I got my passion: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe and my family met a friend who is a piano teacher and we talked about my piano experiences. That was in 2013. Back then, I hated playing and I never practiced until the day before my piano lesson. I didn\u0027t make any progress and I hated the pieces I was told to play. Actually, I almost quit playing because of that (so glad I didn\u0027t \u003cimg height=\"16\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/images/emoji.php/v8/f51/1/16/1f603.png\" width=\"16\"\u003e). So the friend we met asked me what I\u0027d actually WANT to play. So he sent me some sheet music of River Flows in You and Comptine d\u0027Un Autre \u00c9t\u00e9 (yeah, I know, so mainstream, hah). And I just started practicing these pieces and BOOM, I suddenly enjoyed practicing and playing. Pretty funny since I really hated playing up to this day! My passion became stronger and stronger over time and I hugely improved. A few years ago I would have never thought that I\u0027d ever be able to play pieces I play today. And I love sharing my passion with other people. That\u0027s why I started my\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/mrbromabapiano\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e with many different covers and improvisations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also happen to arrange and transcribe different pieces and songs. I transcribed many Kyle Landry arrangements and compositions like Time, All of Me, Bacon Man, Lorena, Ruins, My Heart Will Go On, Silent Night, etc and arranged pieces in form of written and elaborated scores. You can find all of my own arranged scores on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sheet.host/user/mrbromaba\"\u003eSheetHost account\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e----------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eSo why should I pledge you some money??\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThe truth is: You really don\u0027t have to! The donations are just some extra cash to save for new VSTs, plugins or notation software. With that, I could improve my sound and transcription quality and let my performances being played on many different concert grands (well, at least on digital representations of them :P). In a few months I will probably have graduated and go to a uni, so getting a little extra money will help me paying all the costs of living which I will have to face. Since I\u0027ll probably go to a private uni there won\u0027t be much money left for non-life-essential-goods such as VSTs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease let me tell you that I really appreciate everybody who watches my videos and enjoys my work! There is no \u003cem\u003eobligation\u00a0\u003c/em\u003efor you to donate me some money! Just drop me some comments and I\u0027m happy! :D\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
