Online I am known as Miss Scarlet Tanager (or just Scarlet), and I make video game Let\u0027s Plays as well as glitch and secret videos on Youtube. Once monthly, I do a 24-hour livestream for a charity of my choice in order to raise money for that charity. On the side I have a webcomic, Lacrymae, and a couple other projects in the works. All of my thumbnails and channel arts are drawn or edited together by myself, both by hand and digitally with a graphics tablet. Offline, I cosplay mainly video game characters using costumes that I make entirely by myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuying games to cover on my channel and all the time it takes to edit and post videos (and pages of my comic) cost money. This Patreon is just another way for people to support me if they wish. It\u0027s entirely optional, and while I\u0027ll have little perks for the patreon subscribers, they won\u0027t be too big of a thing. The more my channel grows and the more I can do means the more charity I\u0027m able to accomplish. Cross your fingers, everyone; let\u0027s do this!"
