BOTH OF US FULL-TIME!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe know this is a crazy high goal, but we are setting this years ahead, idk how long it would take to reach this, if ever. But me and Alyss split everything right now with the bills, I jumped into Youtube and Uber/Lyft for making money, and she is still working more than full-time at her job. This amount secured by our Patreons would be around what would be needed for Alyss to take the full time jump into YouTube. Of course we hope to grow a lot over the coming years, and so would hopefully make more adsense money, but all the YouTube channel advisors say that is way to risky to depend on. Rates change, and with Star Wars stuff you never know when the next copyright strike will come, so it is all a little scary for creators. For the younger MetaNerdz out their who love our stuff and are thinking about doing this as a career, just make sure you think about diversifying income, and pick something you really love because there are no days off. But if your passionate there will always be enough fuel, oh and coffee, get lots of it. Also for the younger readers, this may seem like an insane amount of money, but remember that life on your own is filled with unforeseen expenses. Medical bills, insurance, home repair, and saving for eventually having kids, are all things you need to consider. We keep on meeting awesome Star Wars fans everyday, and we can\u0027t thank our Patreons enough for helping to make this crazy nerdy dream come true. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e",
