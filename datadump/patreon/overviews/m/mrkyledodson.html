    "summary": "HI my name is Kyle, I\u0027m a 20 year old from the UK that has been obsessed with travel since a young age. I feel there is a lack of information out there for young people about travel, half the people I meet haven\u0027t got a clue where they want to go or what to do there, all we know, is we want to travel. I want to make a travel series titled \"the millennial travellers club\" where the audience decides exactly where I go and what I do there so you can see exactly what a country or place has to offer. I\u0027ll be running polls on where you want me to travel to and document on here and throughout the day will be running live polls over on my twitter asking you guys what you\u0027d like to see. Upon reaching the pledge goal I\u0027d like to make one episode every single month and split it into series\u0027 for you guys to enjoy. I\u0027m also offering cool rewards over on the right from behind the scenes content, to full merch drops so check them out. Thanks guys and I really hope you enjoy the content that\u0027s coming.\u00a0"
