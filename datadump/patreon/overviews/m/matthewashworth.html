    "summary": "Hello there\nguys and fellow indie gamers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are\nhere, the chances are you must be familiar with at least one of my games, but\nif not, then please read on. My name is Matthew Ashworth, and I\u2019m a sole indie\ngame developer behind Astronomic Games. I mostly specialise in 2D role-playing\ngames, particularly in the sci-fi and fantasy genres, focusing usually on\ndarker and somewhat mature stories, and some even with choice \u0026amp; consequence\nmechanic, though at times I like to try out some other styles as well and\nexperiment a little. I first started making games as a hobby that I enjoyed\nvery much, before deciding to go commercial in late 2014. Since then, with the\nhelp of New Reality Games, I\u2019ve released 8 commercial titles, and indie game\ndevelopment is a full-time career for me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince I love\nmy craft very much, I tend to spend my own money on buying assets and hiring\nfreelancers for the games I make, be it graphical, music, or even programming\nrelated. I never really went for crowdfunding methods such as Kickstarter or\nIndiegogo with any of my games, and I personally prefer not to ask people for\nhuge sums of money to fund my games. However, perhaps there are some players\nand fans of my games who do wish to support my efforts, and for that reason I\ndecided to open my Patreon page. Any money I get through here will go towards\nhelping to buy more assets for my games, be it something totally custom-made, or\nthe more expensive high-quality royalty free stuff. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAdditionally,\nI\u2019ve now begun hiring voice actors to do voices for some of the shorter\nprojects of mine, and hopefully in the future, with enough funding, I\u2019d be able\nto extend that to bigger projects as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPlease do\nnote that there\u2019s no pressure reaching any funding goals for me to be able to\ncomplete my games. I am still continuing to work on them on a consistent basis\nand will keep releasing them at the same rate as I normally do, and still going\nto continue to fund them on my own. However, any additional money gained\nthrough here will help to fund more custom or high quality content that can\nbecome part of my games. It is a huge dream of mine to one day make a game that\nentirely consists of just custom-made assets.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSome examples of assets that were\ncustom-made for my games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\ncharacter busts seen in this screenshot of my new, current game project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/ZUIyGLU\"\u003ehttps://imgur.com/ZUIyGLU\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe city skyline from Incitement 3 front cover and intro screen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://i.imgur.com/dDn0Y1c.png\"\u003ehttps://i.imgur.com/dDn0Y1c.png\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd many others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eList of games I\u2019ve released so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCommercial\ntitles (date of release in brackets):\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRenegade Grounds: Episode 1\n(September 2017)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eMercury: Cascade into Madness (May 2017\non itch.io, August 2017 on Steam)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eAtonement 2: Ruptured by Despair\n(October 2016)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eInsincere (May 2016)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eOutrage (April 2016)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eCity of Chains (December 2015)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eIncitement 3 (May 2015, Steam release\nin August 2015)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eAtonement: Scourge of Time (November\n2014, Steam release in July 2015)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eFree titles\n(date of release in brackets):\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHarbingers of Woe (December 2014)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eJust Face It!
