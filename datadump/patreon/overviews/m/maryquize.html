    "summary": "Hello, my name is maryquiZe, I am a digital artist and illustrator from Ukraine!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been drawing all my life and this activity is my main job at the moment. I prefer to draw animals, I\u0027m a violent fan of Harry Potter, potterhead and potterheart through and through! :-) \u003cbr\u003eI created this patreon account to be able to share my arts with you and to make drawing for pleasure my main activity! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso I have a huge plan for my own project. In 2016 I decided to draw 10 beasts from Harry Potter world and publish them as postcards. Unicorn was my first, then came Dragon, Flobberworms, Acromantula, Werewolf and others... It was only a start... I decided to draw more and more beasts and till the end of 2016 it was a list of 27. In 2017 I started an annual challenge called 1page1week and Fantastic Beasts arts became my passion and my main personal project. At the end of 2017 I had 74 arts done. I created a list of 117 (or so) beasts, creatures, ghosts, dragons and plants to do. \u003cbr\u003eI publish this arts as postcards. Also I made a set of playing cards and Calendar for 2018. \u003cbr\u003eMy main goal is to publish an ArtBook with all illustrations. I hope I will be able to do it in 2018. Publishing is rather expensive, so I hope to earn some extra money here, at Patreon. I would be happy if you are able to help me with my dream! I hope you would like to go with me through this challenge. Join and enjoy your staying here! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSOME WORDS ABOUT REWARDS:\u003cbr\u003e* Following rewards will be sent to PM (or real post) of those patrons who payed for the last month:\u003cbr\u003e- HD elemens of Fantastic Beasts arts\u003cbr\u003e- psd. files of some arts\u003cbr\u003e- printed postcards (10x15cm ) of all SFW arts\u003cbr\u003e- I also START drawing personal art of your character or any other creature with simple background AFTER payment.\u003cbr\u003eWhat does it mean? \u003cbr\u003eIt means that if you want to get all January rewards, you need to pay for January in first days of Fabruary.
