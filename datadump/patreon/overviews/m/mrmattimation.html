    "summary": "Hey there! I\u0027m Matt, an artist and animator who\u0027s created such abominations as \"Undertale - The Twin Souls\", which has over \u003cstrong\u003ea hundred thousand\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0views.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been animating since I was a kid. But I\u0027m not a kid anymore. I\u0027m in college now. I have to pay TAXES. I want to continue to hone my craft and make it even better than I could ever imagine! But if I want to do that, I\u0027m going to need to start making more money, because YouTube doesn\u0027t pay the bills. I\u0027m going to spare you all of that technical mumbo-jumbo about how their ad revenue system works, but the bottom line is that YouTube favors quantity over quality, and unfortunately as an animator I just can\u0027t deliver three videos a day every day. Believe me, if I could, I would, because three cartoons a day sounds AWESOME, doesn\u0027t it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what would your money be going towards? Well, it\u0027d go right back into the cartoons, of course! \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m not expecting to be able to subsist off of Patreon alone\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ll still need to take commissions, do sponsored content-type deals, collaborate... maybe sell t-shirts? The point is that this isn\u0027t the \"Help Matt buy a four million dollar mansion\" fund. What do I look like, Captain Sparklez?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith more funding I can make things quicker and better, because I\u0027ll be making money from what I love doing. I\u0027ll be able to buy new equipment to improve quality as well, like a new PC that can render things faster or a new microphone that sounds ten times better than my Snowball, or acoustic foam to pad the walls in my office so that I don\u0027t have to record my shit in a closet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, if I get enough money, I can hire assistance. Sometimes my friend BrainstormAlex helps me out, but he can\u0027t help me all the time; he\u0027s got his own channel to run! Even just one more animator helping me out with inbetweens would halve the time it takes to make cartoons. Eventually, the goal is to be able to pay a team to help me make my stuff and basically be able to run a mini-studio. That\u0027s the goal. It\u0027s a long ways away, but a guy can dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I\u0027ll take home whatever\u0027s left... and put it right back into the next cartoon, starting the whole process over again! I have a lot of big things planned, and with your help, I can make them a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote about rewards: I\u0027m only one guy and have a full time job, so if you don\u0027t get them right away, PLEASE BE PATIENT. I\u0027ll get them to you eventually.\u003cbr\u003e"
