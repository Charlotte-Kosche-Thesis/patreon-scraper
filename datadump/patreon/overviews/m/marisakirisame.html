    "summary": "My name is Marisa and I\u0027m a streamer, programmer, and also aspiring video game developer. I\u0027m only just starting in this world and although I don\u0027t have any real experience, I do believe I\u0027ve got potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may (or may not) know me as \"that one person that made that Doom video where everything was Tim Allen\". Well, I can do more than just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery once in a while I stream various games (mostly Doom mods) over at my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/magusmarisa\"\u003eTwitch channel\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m both a camera and microphone shy person, so there\u0027s not much commentary or anything to them beyond written interactions with chat. My current environment (small house shared with parents) doesn\u0027t exactly help make things comfortable for talking or using a camera anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also maintain\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65213/?\"\u003eMariENB\u003c/a\u003e, a clean and performance-efficient ENB preset for Skyrim and other compatible games, but that\u0027s more of an extreme boredom hobby to me, a kind of masochistic one, at least.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside of all that and for a long time, rather than just playing them, I want to CREATE videogames. Over the years, I weaved this massive universe with its many tales and characters, and I\u0027d love to show it all to the world. I feel that games can do a great job for what I want. Not that this would mean I\u0027d stop doing everything else, of course. I know for a fact some people enjoy the other things I make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I have a small but ambitious project called .Blank. It\u0027s a first person exploration game with horror elements and a somewhat retro aesthetic, built entirely from the ground up, engine included. Though I have most of the \"conceptual\" part done, the real work is what remains, and I can see it\u0027s going to be a long adventure full of challenges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I can\u0027t do much in exchange for now, I would really be thankful if you\u0027d help me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have come here to Patreon as a suggestion of various friends. I hope that things will work out for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you around.\u003cbr\u003e"
