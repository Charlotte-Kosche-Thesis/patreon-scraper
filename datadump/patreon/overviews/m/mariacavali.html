I started photographing this project about a year ago and so far I am in contact with 300 people all over the world of which over 60 of them contacted me themselves asking to participate. This has come to show me that it is a project that means as much to them as it does to me.\u003cbr\u003eThere is much mythology surrounding Heterochromia and very little fact. It is obviously a condition that captured people\u2019s imaginations and even fears.\u003cbr\u003eAlthough much of my research on the subject often delivers both inconclusive and vague results, I have continued documenting heterochromia around the globe and collecting stories.\u003cbr\u003eMy final goal is to make an album called \"Heterochromiacs\" whereby I document all the portraits from the project and present both \u2013 mythological and scientific heterochromia research to go along with it; the first official photographic publication of Heterochromia.\u003cbr\u003e",
