These days, my attention is divided into capturing a moment as well as letting it flow away. I pay attention to everyday ordinary activities of life and surrounding world, taking photographs of wildlife, landscape, animals, and people. I seek undisturbed circumstances \u2013 rarely staged, but always real and authentic. I am interested in un-weaving the endless evolution of moment, which to me has a multidimensional meaning. I want to reveal the underlying truth about time and the constant change it brings, which usually remains overlooked or unnoticed. There is a definite difference between my still images and my films, but all my works are dedicated to a moment \u2013 whether as a stop motion or as a continuum. The fact that I use a camera is probably linked to my vague memories about my\u00a0grandpa who first brought photography into my life.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
