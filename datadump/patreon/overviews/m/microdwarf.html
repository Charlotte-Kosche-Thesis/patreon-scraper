I live and breathe RPGs and tabletop games. I like to make games, I like to run games, and I like to play games. What we have here is an opportunity to help turn this passion of mine into a full-fledged lifestyle. With luck, I\u0027ll be able to springboard off Patreon into my dream job: working at Wizards of the Coast.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo let\u0027s cut to the chase. I like drawing high-quality maps and writing exciting adventures. You want high-quality maps and exciting adventures for your games. I do maps more than I do math, but that looks like a two, a two, and a four to me. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat\u0027s important for you as Patrons to note is that you will be charged each time I make a paid post. My promise to you and myself is to make four or five maps or adventures per month, so keep in mind that you will actually be charged close to four or five times what your actual pledge is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThankfully, Patreon gives you the backers the option to set your monthly maximum, so on months where my muse is hyperactive you don\u0027t feel any sticker shock. If you want only 2 maps a month, that\u0027s perfectly fine. If you want to drink from the firehose, who am I to say no?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eFREE MAPS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nWhat\u0027s that?
