(activist through arts).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI make Modern Arabic Fusion music (although sometimes I also sing in English). My debut album -Bahlawan/Acrobat- contained mostly songs in Arabic, was self produced, and belonged to the World Music genre. The second album -All my faces- released by Sony Music, was a fusion of World/Electronic/Pop sounds with songs mainly in English. After being signed to a major label I realised I preferred being independent, and therefore established my own label, understandably named LabelFree :-) Through which I am releasing all my works now (Like the song and music video above..)\u003cbr\u003eYou can learn more about me, and find all my music on my \u003ca href=\"http://www.miraawad.co/\"\u003eWEBSITE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Artivism?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Activism through culture and arts)\u003cbr\u003eMy passion in life is music, my goal in life is to bridge between communities. What better way to connect people than music that shoots straight for the heart, bypassing preconceptions and inhibits? :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am\u00a0half Palestinian, half Bulgarian, living in Israel. \u003cbr\u003eGrowing up with this complex identity was so challenging that I had to constantly fight back stereotypes and generalisations, to the extent that I have made it my life\u0027s purpose to remind people of the things that connect them, rather than the things that divide them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that art CAN make a shift in reality, and can bring people together. Throughout my career I\u0027ve been involved in projects that aim to bridge gaps and introduce people from different backgrounds to each other through arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that gives artists the ability to get ongoing support directly from followers. If you are someone who thinks it\u0027s important that I keep doing what I\u0027m doing, this platform gives you a chance to make sure I do. The help you can offer, will allow me to do things quicker and better, and most of all, and maybe most importantly, to know that I\u0027m not alone. \u003cbr\u003eRecording sessions, mixing, mastering, video productions, graphics and packaging, online marketing, PR and so on, all these things cost money, a lot of it! And independent artists sometimes have to make compromises because of the lack of funds. \u003cbr\u003eBut now, with Patreon, YOU can step in and help !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. You simply sign in to PATREON and become a PATRON of my work..\u003cbr\u003e2. You choose your patron level, give as much as you choose PER MONTH.\u00a0In return, you will be constantly connected to my artistic dwellings on all sorts of levels (See list of perks!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike other social media platforms, here, you will only get artistic content and updates on work in progress. I will share work processes, artistic dilemmas, updates from filming sets and recording studios and so on, and you\u0027ll be\u00a0the first to receive my new music and watch my new videos.\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll be doing everything together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is exciting! :-D\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being here for me,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMira\u003cbr\u003e"
