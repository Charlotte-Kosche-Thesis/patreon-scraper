I\u0027ve drawn a lot of fanart in the past, which you can see on my tumblr, twitter, or reddit, and I\u0027m drawing more of my own content as the days go by. One project I\u0027m working on right now is a graphic novel called \"If You Knew\", which is a romance story I\u0027m writing as my own warmup into a series I\u0027ve kept cooking on the backburner for a few years now. Thank you for checking out my stuff!"

     "about": "Hey guys, my name is Steve, but mostly online I go by Mrapplespiceman. You can find me here, on Tumblr, Reddit, and Twitch (I stream on weekends).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make a lot of fanart right now, but as time goes on and I develop both my skill and a following, I plan on working more on my own original ideas and characters and stories and all that. I currently have a manga in the works, though it\u0027ll probably be short for its first volume (100 pages, 1 vol of 3 for this story). I\u0027m using this as a sort of warm up for the much bigger, more complex story I\u0027ve kept on the backburner for the last few years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut yeah, mostly I\u0027ve been making Doki Doki Literature Club fanart, but I\u0027m starting to branch out more (it does get a lot of attention though, which is really good for me at this point in my art career). So if you\u0027re not sold on the Doki art, stick around, check out my Tumblr, and maybe you\u0027ll see something you really like!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started a Patreon around mid February, just to kind of try it out, and I\u0027m actually really surprised how much support I\u0027ve gotten so far and how much I see other creators receiving as well. Hopefully, with enough time, this can become a reliable enough means of income that I can focus more on my artwork without losing the ability to eat and have air conditioning and all that. At this point in my life, I\u0027ve dived headfirst into my dream, and I\u0027m chasing it hungrily, so I hope you find it to be worth it to support me, even if it\u0027s the minimum possible amount, every patron means the world to me.",
