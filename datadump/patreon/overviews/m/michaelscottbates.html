     "about": "After years of choral training, I began writing songs in my second year of high school due to being apart of a class called Americana, where we were required to compose and complete a song every two weeks. This quickly forced me into a habit of playing guitar and writing lyrics as well as singing every single day.  I fell in love with performing and expressing myself in the form of songwriting.  \u003cbr\u003eI started my instrumental fluencing by learning to play the drums and acoustic guitar. Mainly by collaborating with other artists.  Though I couldn\u0027t stop there. I was compelled to learn every instrument I possibly could.  Now, Over eight years later and a degree in Instrumental performance, I am currently fluent in guitar, bass, piano, mandolin, percussion, and singing with a strong focus on the slide guitar and harmonica.  My roots in Blues and Rock n\u0027 Roll began when I was 17 starting with Led Zeppelin and then quickly moving towards more traditional blues like Muddy Waters and Howlin Wolf.  After leading a rock band called Naked Gypsies for three years, \u003cbr\u003eI am currently rolling solo and have now written over sixty original songs, specialize in recording and mixing my own recordings where I perform all instruments and also shoot and edit my own videos!  \u003cbr\u003eI love and appreciate music as well as the life I was given and the path I have chosen to take.  \u003cbr\u003eI am truly beyond blessed.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
