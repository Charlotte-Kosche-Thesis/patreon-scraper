    "summary": "MELODY POND is a folk duo of Candy Lee and Emily Rowland. We write original songs, sing some covers (not many), and LOVE to sing super tight harmonies. We\u0027ve got a pretty unique sound, which we call ozark-indie-folk-jazz. We\u0027ve made the leap of quitting our jobs this past year to do this full time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe work hard behind the scenes, promoting, booking, planning, networking, making videos, etc. We definitely spend more time on the \"business\" end of things, than we do actually performing. While we do get paid to perform, we don\u0027t get paid to do the other stuff, so we\u0027re trying to supplement all of that time and energy with support from Patreon supporters, and hopefully one of them will be you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll be making video recordings of new songs as they come out that only Patreon subscribers can view, and sending you mp3s of these songs. You get to hear these songs, and get sneak peak recordings, before anyone else! We\u0027ll be doing one or two videos a month, depending on what we have time for (Candy is a new mama, so it\u0027s a bit more challenging these days). All Patreon subscribers will also receive physical copies of new albums as we release them.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Melody Pond is the song that dances on the water, echoes on the wind, and enchants your ear drums. The duo made up of Candy Lee and Emily Rowland, have a been singing together in various band formations for almost a decade, perfecting their tight, seamless harmonies. Their sound ranges from fun and powerful to honest and tender. Rooted in the earthiness of folk, Melody Pond keeps it fresh by merging modern indie influences with throwback moods of funk and blues, and jazz inspired vocals reminiscent of Billie Holiday and The Boswell Sisters. The duo has been compared to modern artists Rising Appalachia, First Aid Kit, and The Ditty Bops.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
