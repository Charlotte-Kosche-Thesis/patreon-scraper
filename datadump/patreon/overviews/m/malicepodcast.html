Each season we will examine a different case that has far-reaching legal implications. Our first? \u003cem\u003eGreineder v. Medeiros\u003c/em\u003e, or that of Dr. Dirk Greineder, who is up for a \u003cem\u003ehabeas corpus\u003c/em\u003e hearing any day now. He was convicted for the murder of his wife, May Greineder, back in 2001. The case took the nation by storm but largely fell out of collective public awareness because of its timing around 9/11 and the crashing of Egypt flight 990.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe fell into this because we are a lawyer and a paralegal who want to explore this field in a whole new way. We want to use this medium to explore these stories in depth, in ways that television and movies are unable to. Most importantly, we want to examine the interpersonal dynamics that are often left unresolved in these types of cases.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we are doing this in our spare time and have day jobs, any help is enormously appreciated. Even if you can only donate a dollar, that gets us something! Everything down to copying court transcripts and getting audio from hearings costs money, so anything and everything helps.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are so grateful to you and can\u0027t wait to share this story!"
