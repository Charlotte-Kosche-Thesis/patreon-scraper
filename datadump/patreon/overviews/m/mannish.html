Which emotions do you show?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor decades, women have discussed and raised awareness about how gender impacts their lives; how gender plays in a role in perpetuating systemic inequalities. Men have been reluctant to engage in this topic. It\u2019s time that changed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMan-ish is a podcast that looks at how gender influences men. Every three months, Man-ish will present a story that challenges how we think about masculinity, what it means to be a man, and the distance between what we are and what we wish to be."
