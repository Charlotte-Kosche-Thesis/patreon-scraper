I\u0027m fine with female pronouns, and i just wanna be friends! \u003cbr\u003eI work full time as a custodian and as much as I don\u0027t want that to be my job in the long run, the pay and benefits are astounding. After all, i do have bills that need paying! Like a new car payment, cell service and a few medical bills, some not my own. In September 2017 my father was diagnosed with throat cancer and he did not have the best insurance... On January 2nd my father passed away from his battle against such a vile disease. Some of his bill do fall to me and my family to pay unfortunately. But it is what we are left with, such is the way of things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e A dream would be to make money off my art one day, and not just in commissions. I\u0027d like to sell prints, sell cute things printed onto shirts, maybe even sell some handmade items. Commissions are nice but my opus, my greatest creation, would be my living life and creating this I want to. Not others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe one day I can look at myself and not need the full time, boring job and I can devote myself full time to my art. Yet for now, i\u0027m here. Taking it one day at a time until my work is complete.\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
