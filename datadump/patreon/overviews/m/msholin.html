    "summary": "Hello Everyone and Welcome to Patreon. My new platform for creating monthly content for you.\u003cbr\u003eI have been dreaming about getting away from the distractions on Facebook and forming a group that wants to participate and interact with all things painting and art. I think this is our place!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.corel.com/content/painter/masters/pMarilynSholin.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCorel Paint Master Elite\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e and you can see a more current list of myself and the other Elite artists\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.painterartist.com/en/pages/masters/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e. I don\u0027t know if you have ever Googled me but you will find a lot of information and tons of things I have online.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOften I change my bio and artist statement. Here is a current bio and a current list of where you can find my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eMarilyn Sholin Fine Art\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAsheville,\nNC\u003cbr\u003e\n\nInternationally known artist, author and educator, Marilyn\nSholin creates paintings about the artistry of the spirits from beer to\nmartinis, wine and more. She added coffee into her mix of art because it only\nmade sense to include it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMarilyn moved from Miami to Asheville and has never looked\nback. Her incredible 25 years as an award winning portrait photographer took a\nturn to painting in the 90\u2019s and developed into a passion for mixed media. Her\noriginal mixed media incorporate a long process of multiple photo references\nwhich she synthesizes into one image and digitally paints. That is printed on\nhigh quality canvas and then enhanced with acrylic paints and mediums, dyes,\npigments and a variety of other materials. This method creates many layers of\ntexture to each painting. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe fine art paintings are then converted to a final digital\nfile that can be printed as giclee canvas, fine art paper and dye infused\nmetals and other substrates for collectors. Color and energy run through every\nMarilyn painting. She brings inanimate objects to life with their shapes,\ncolors and textures. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMarilyn\u2019s work has won Best of Show at the juried Grace\nGallery and has also been exhibited in the Asheville Airport Gallery and many\nbreweries and restaurants in Asheville and the surrounding area. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nHer paintings are in private collections internationally.\nShe is a Master Photographer recognized by the Professional Photographers of\nAmerica and a Golden Artist Educator teaching classes and workshops on Golden\nArtist acrylic paints. Her workshops are both local and international and\ninclude a variety of art and photography subjects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u201cBeing an artist also\nmeans collecting art. Collecting art at any price is a satisfying and addictive\nprocess. As I finish hanging some of our older pieces we have finally unpacked\nand hanging some of our new pieces I realize how meaningful it is to sit\namongst other artists work. I thank my parents who collected art and my aunts\nand uncles, who were artists, especially my mother for taking me to museums for\nas long as I can remember.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMarilyn lives full time in Asheville and is owned by way too\nmany cats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://thelaurelofasheville.com/arts/galleries/marilyn-sholins-open-bar-f-w-gallery/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLaurel Magazine Article 2018\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thelaurelofasheville.com/arts/marilyn-sholin-f-w-front-gallery-march/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLaurel Magazine Article 2016\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.artmeccaofcharleston.com/blog/cheers-art-mecca-welcomes-marilyn-sholin\"\u003eART MECCA Charleston SC\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.loblollyarts.com/artists\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLoblolly Art Seneca SC\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
