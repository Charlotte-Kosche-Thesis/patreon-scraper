Tell me during my stream and I will personally welcome you to the subs and add your name to the sub list on screen. \u00a0However, you will not\u00a0receive\u00a0any sub\u00a0perks (as detailed below) until Patreon receive your first payment (usually on the 2nd of the month so in this case it would be 2nd December).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs that as clear as mud? wonderful! hahah Thank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
