    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi! I\u0027m Monotrail\nand I make weekly synth jams. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe style\nof my music video\u0027s fluctuate from calm, melodic, ambient and drone sessions, to noise,\nself-playing modular patches and experimental electro and techno. I started this project in\nSeptember 2015 when I began working with a modular synthesizer, and was looking\nfor a way to experiment and create a routine in making and sharing music. Now I have been uploading a Jam every wednesday on my YouTube channel for over two years!: www.youtube.com/c/monotrailmusic\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nI started this\nPatreon because of a few things:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1 - I want\nto keep it up! - Making a Live Jam video every week has become a solid routine, and I want to keep going. However, making a video every week costs a lot of time, and\nit has to compete with things I have to do to pay the rent.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2 - I want\nto increase the quality - Part of this is having more time to spend on each video.\nMore time to work on sounds, melodies, drums, new ideas, etc. But also plan to investing in equipment. Currently I use my phone to record video\u0027s and I could use better\nlighting.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n3 - I want\nto share more - I receive a lot of questions about specific gear, my studio and\nsetup, my journey with a modular synthesizer, and many other things. I would\nlike to make video\u0027s about this, and help where I can, but again, that will require\nmore time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nSo how does\nthis work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI love making music, and want to share my work and\nknowledge for free. You can help me do so by donating a small amount of money -\nsomething like the price of a beer or a good meal - on a monthly basis. This\nway I can do what I do best, and you can feel awesome about making it happen. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo make you\nfeel even better there are bonuses for patrons. Depending on the amount of\nmoney you donate you can get access to things like free .mp3 files of each\nweekly video I release, and free albums when I put them out!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo come\njoin my musical quest and join the conversation in the patron feed!\u003cbr\u003e"
