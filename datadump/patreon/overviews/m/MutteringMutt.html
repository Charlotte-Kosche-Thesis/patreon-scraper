The caravan traffic makes for a bustling summer season and even in winter it does not entirely snow shut. Usually. This is not where many journeys begin or end, but rather a place to pass through. Still, there are stories here, and collections of the stories around and through this place. These are the Passgate Papers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat began as a writing prompt one idle Thursday many years ago now has grown into a number of stories, as well as a widening collection of the ephemera that might collect from writing what amounts to nonfiction about places and \"animal people\" that do not actually exist. In order to continue to build this world, and as both an exercise in motivation and a certain exhibitionism of process, I have decided to bring the process of the work in progress to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stories and works that already have been published elsewhere will be, as they are organized and probably cleaned up a bit, posted here as public content, available to all, as well as general updates on the progress, trials, and tribulations of the process. Your feedback is wonderful, and any reader should feel free to leave constructive feedback, without regard to current funding status.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe supporters of this Patreon page will receive first access to the month\u0027s stories as well as posts of revisions and probably some Writer-in-Progress journaling about the process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe eventual goal is to create a publishable collection, at least e-book style, that one might buy and have for their very own but if I REALLY let myself dream I would love to hold a physical THING in my hand. As this is not a traditional novel, and I already have far bigger ideas for illustrations and knick-knackery than my current talent can give form, that thing has a very foggy shape right now. Still, if you would like to adventure in the fog and watch the beast take shape, so to speak, this is the Patreon for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
