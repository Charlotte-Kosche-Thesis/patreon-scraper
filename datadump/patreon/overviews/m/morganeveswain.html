    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy\u003c/strong\u003e name is MorganEve Swain. I live alone, with my little dog, on the third floor of a house that sways when the wind blows and when the downstairs neighbors make love. Often, the movement of the house makes the water in the toilet bowl slosh faintly and I feel as if my treehouse-like apartment were really a boat at sea. \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI have been a musician all my life, and have made my living that way since I was a teenager playing in Irish bars in Bridgeport Connecticut, though lately the musical income is sporadic at best. To offset that unknown, I earn a part time wage working as a violin technician and learning instrument repair at a violin shop thirty minutes away. \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI sometimes marvel at the ways in which I feel unprepared for life- I have atrocious math skills, problems focusing, ambition but not drive, ideas but not means, dreams but not goals. \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eRecently though-\u2013 no doubt a side effect of entering my thirties\u2013 I have come to realize that most adults never do have things all figured out, and if I can accept my life and income as something I will always be figuring out as I go, I have a chance at real happiness. (Of course, that doesn\u0027t stop me from searching for stability and looking at my wealthy neighbors with something closer to bewilderment than envy.) What surprises me now, is how much my idea of \u201cstability\u201d has changed in a short amount of time. It used to mean being with the man I loved: a partnership of intellect, romance, creativity and trust. Figuring it out as \u003cem\u003ewe\u003c/em\u003e went. The safety of knowing he was there. That I wasn\u2019t alone. \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAnd then, not suddenly but still shockingly, I \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e alone. My partner, in music, in love and life, died of leukemia in April of 2014. He was 36. I was 28. \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWe had spent the six short years we had together performing under the name Brown Bird, acquiring a comfortable and humbling fanbase and releasing three records together before Dave got sick. Our lives were so entwined, we functioned as a single being. Dave revealed in me a musician I hadn\u2019t known was there; I nurtured his remarkable talent for music and words and bathed in his capacity to understand everyone around him. \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThere is a part of me that hates writing about Dave\u2019s cancer. I hate defining myself by it. By the fact that he was here and now he isn\u2019t. But that\u2019s exactly what has shaken my sense of self and it is taking a long time to reconcile that my grief and sense of displacement are not signs of weakness but of love. \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eJust over a year ago, I felt the murky waters of intense grief begin to shift. For two solid years after Dave died, I had existed in such intense fog that reaching its edge felt like the uneasy state between sleep and waking. I\u2019d been so desperate to be cared for, so dependent on others to save me, that I lost myself in whatever affection I could receive. I spent our savings carelessly, taking advantage of what I told myself was necessary time to recover. My gradual emergence from it brought with it the realizations that I no longer knew who I was, what my path was, what I should or could do to survive or to find happiness again. I\u2019d lost my stability.\u00a0I\u2019d lost my bliss. \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eNow, finally settling into a solitary life, I am finding comfort in knowing I have only myself to rely on. Stability comes from within. I am still searching for the path to follow my bliss. I am still uncertain who I am supposed to be in this life. But I\u0027ve always been a musician and I\u0027ve always been a writer, and I can\u0027t help but think that\u00a0sharing my experience with others will begin to illuminate the places that are still dark.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
