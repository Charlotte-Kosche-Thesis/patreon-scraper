    "summary": "Hi, my name is Christopher Aguiar (MrNerdista). I am a YouTuber who creates video essays on film, TV and video games. With every video, I aim to educate and entertain while keeping my work accessible and far from self-indulgent or pretentious. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere does your money go, you ask? Pledges cover my monthly Adobe subscription and audio software, as well as any outgoing costs for the channel i.e new external hard drives, purchasing films for analysis. The money also helps put food on the table where applicable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI upload once or twice a month. Never more. Sometimes I may even miss a month due to extensive research, hence why your pledge is \u0027per video\u0027 and not on a monthly basis. I don\u0027t want to charge someone for uploading nothing that month!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf 1% of my subscriber base pledged at the lowest tier, the channel\u0027s quality would improve exponentially!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to stress, though, that my videos \u003cstrong\u003eare\u003c/strong\u003e free. I don\u0027t want to beg or exploit anyone for money. If you cannot pledge or simply do not want to, I still appreciate your support by clicking subscribe/link or even on the video itself! Only pledge if you can see yourself parting with that small fee per video I create. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this post. Even if you choose to click away, I appreciate you taking the time to read through this. If you feel so inclined to pledge, I can\u0027t even begin to express how much that means to me. Thanks once again!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-- Mr Nerdista\u003cbr\u003e"
