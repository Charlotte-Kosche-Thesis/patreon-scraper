    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHello, Everyone!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Michael Jay Tucker...and this is my (\u003cem\u003eta-dah\u003c/em\u003e!) Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point you\u2019re asking yourself something along the lines of \u201cWho the heck are you and why the flying farp in a freakin\u2019 station wagon should I care?\u201d Ah, excellent questions. I\u2019m delighted (and impressed) by your penetrating intelligence and lightening quick wit. You betcha. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, let me answer that in two parts. First, who I am:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eI) Moi\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a writer and editor based in New Mexico. I used to be a trade press journalist\u2014computers, to be precise. One of my small claims to fame is that I interviewed Steve Jobs just after he got kicked out of Apple, and just before Apple\u2019s board of directors realized they\u2019d made a horrible mistake and came begging him to come back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, also, I predate the PC...and the Web...and graphical user interfaces. In other words, yes, I\u2019m a dinosaur. But I\u2019m a nice dinosaur. Sorta Velociraptor but a lot more near-sighted and with fewer feathers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, getting on with my story. In the last year or so, I\u2019ve discovered video and limited animation. And, I\u2019ve been making little videos for the web. You can see my material on Vimeo here: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/mjt1957\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://vimeo.com/mjt1957\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy stuff ranges from being very personal and sometimes rather sad (like \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/174257866\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eShe Who Flew\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/176175965\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDrowning Boy\u003c/a\u003e) to the flat out silly. The latter sort of videos include a lot of flying cyborg octopi creatures in (I guess) some sort of future world ...maybe a colonized gas giant where humans and posthumans co-exist in some odd fashion. Or, at least, that\u2019s the explanation I\u2019m offering at the moment. Maybe you can come up with a better one. Probably wouldn\u2019t be hard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, sometimes, I get a little political, as in \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/174667786\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePolitical Porn\u003c/a\u003e, which was a kind of snarky response to the 2016 Republican platform. Yes, that means, I\u2019m sort of a liberal, but my Republican friends say they can overlook that as they do all my other personal failings...of which, there are, admittedly, many. But as failings go, they\u0027re quite colorful and, in their strange and disturbing way, rather charming. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, as I say, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of videos lately. And I\u2019ve even entered them in some film fests, and I\u2019ve actually gotten some awards...amazingly enough. I\u2019ll confess to being a little stunned by that fact. But it does seem to be true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe one problem with all this is that it does require a little bit of money. There\u2019s hardware and software, and upgrades and repairs, and fees to get into film festivals, and training, and so on, and so forth...and stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to the second part of my story: why you should care...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eII) This Page\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAh...honestly...I don\u2019t have a good answer as to why you should be interested in me at all. But, I \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e explain what I\u2019m up to here, on this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve started a Patreon account. As you probably already know, Patreon is an online service that functions sort of like a big tip jar. Artists, video makers, writers and so on can register there, and if you see something that they do and you happen to like it, you can make a little donation to further the cause. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is the way it works. Sign up on my page, and you slip me a dollar each time I release a new video. In return I\u2019ll be eternally grateful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, okay. There\u2019s a bit more than that. Become a patron, and you\u2019ll get access to some extra goodies\u2014specifically, high resolution stills from each of my productions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, for those of you who are really into being literate, you can also get copies of my working scripts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd there may be more rewards in future. Stay tuned!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo sign up now and support \u003cem\u003eThe Arts\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as a goodly batch of flying cyborg octopi creatures having an erotic frolic with future humans in the atmosphere of a super-Jovian gas giant or Brown Dwarf orbiting Gliese 229.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mean, really, you can never have too many of those.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
