My artistic way to inspire others to become better and to follow their dreams like I did. To be able to tell a story, that will help people overcome the challenges that they are facing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/hYFs0m/Who_are_yo_and_what_do_you_make.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Cris Nikolov.\u00a0 I a film maker, a writer and a business owner from Sofia, Bulgaria.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn my spare time when I am not working on MotivationGrid.com, I\u0027m creating motivational videos 3-10 minutes long. Each video focuses on a different topic. Some of the topics that I have already covered are Discipline, Believing in Yourself, Facing Your Fears and Fighting Depression.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/hySuD6/how_often_do_you_release.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s very irregular, and that\u0027s why I need you - to be able to produce 1 amazing video every week. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach video takes 1-2 days to research and anywhere from 30 to 50 hours to edit. Generally speaking, the long 8-minute videos can take over a month, so I try to release shorter videos to cover the gaps.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eJust looking for the perfect 5 seconds long scene that would mix perfectly with the music and the speech could take hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/dqHfLm\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/kvfd6R/cut.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/fwmnY6/how_can_we_help.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/bR0BRR/help.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I am doing and consider buying some strangers over the internet the equivalent of a coffee, I would very much appreciate it. If 1% of my subscribers would do this, I could expand my team and I could do YouTube full time.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me here you are not only making my life way less stressful but you are helping me produce more and \u003cstrong\u003ebetter content\u003c/strong\u003e for YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/dJmAmR/what_s_your_story.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFour years ago I started MotivationGrid.com and I created my first motivational video. I did not think YouTube would be a permanent thing, it kind of just happened - I wanted to \u003cstrong\u003einspire as many people as possible\u003c/strong\u003e and introduce people to the MotivationGrid brand. I was fresh out of high school and just wanted to do some awesome stuff and to be my own boss. Now YouTube has become a major part of my life. I tried to bring friends to help me out, but unfortunately Youtube cannot sustain a team, I was investing too much time personally, and to ask them to do the same basically for free was not possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/iNhi6R\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I am doing is from a business standpoint economically stupid. Just the licenses for the songs and sound effects can cost up to 300-400$ for a single video. So sometimes I am forced to do commercial video jobs while doing as much YouTube on the side as possible, while managing the website, editing all the articles and also managing all social media platforms. And this forces me to produce lower quality videos, that I am not satisfied with. My goal is to create a dream team that will be able to commit 100%  to create inspiring content for you guys. That is what this Patreon is for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/hsb6BR\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/imcrd6/thank_you.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nRegardless of my financial situation I will continue doing this whatever happens and my videos will always be free! MotivationGrid has become a movement that inspires millions of people and I can\u0027t let you down, can I?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
