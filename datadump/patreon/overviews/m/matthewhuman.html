    "summary": "Hi there - I\u2019m Mathew Human. I\u2019m a singer songwriter, live music producer and performer, a community organizer a yogi, a foodie, and a farmer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor 15 years, I\u0027ve toured all over the United States and beyond with my band The Human Revolution singing songs about living the simple life and encouraging people to stand up against the corporate control of resources. In that time, I have produced seven studio albums plus one live release and performed hundreds of live shows, festivals, and rallies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEight years ago, I was invited to join a permaculture based ecovillage in the mountains of Costa Rica on an epic river, where I have been developing an off-the-grid education center where people can come learn new skills and experience for themselves nature raw and unplugged. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have since built a community house out of natural materials from the land, as well as designed and installed basic infrastructure including a dry composting toilet, an outdoor shower, a garden, and fruit trees.  The next steps are to design and build some simple cabinas, where students can sleep comfortably, upgrade the solar system to accommodate the needs of the program, and continue to refine the existing infrastructure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who cannot be here physically, I have been producing a serious of videos and Facebook Live\u2019s, where folks at home can join me along the journey, meet the characters on the land, and learn fun new things like permaculture principals, new and exotic fruits and how to cook of the land.\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, I am continuing to write and produce my own mix of country and world music and I am currently preparing to release my latest independently produced studio album, \u201cReality,\u201d written and recorded in Nashville, Tennessee. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support here allows my music career to remain as independent as possible and allows me to focus on writing and creating new music, release this current album, keep making fun and educational videos from the farm, and to continue to build the infrastructure necessary to host students and change lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the old days, only royalty and the very wealthy could afford to support the arts through patronage, but today through crowd sourcing, everybody can help support the things they believe in, no matter how much they have to offer because every bit helps, and it all adds up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo the right of this video, you can check out the different rewards and extra perks I have to offer in exchange for your support, and see how you would like to get involved. Thank you for taking the time to watch this video and grow this vision from the ground up.\u00a0~MH\u003cbr\u003e"
