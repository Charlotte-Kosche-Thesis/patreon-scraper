Basically I stream from monday to friday and keep a very precise schedule - I usually schedule enough work to make them all more or less 8 hours long (a regular work day/week).

You will have about 5 days to vote as I will brainstorm the details for the winning picks a day or two before the actual doodling day. I also post a collage of the characters featured in the options so if you don\u0027t know any of the characters you can just vote for the designs you find the most appealing :)\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e___________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT 20$+ SUGGESTIONS\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e2 Weeks a month (on the weeks where there will not be polls) I will accept suggestions for the friday doodle streams - I will make the post over the weekend and will wait for people to comment on the post until Wednesday night. One week I will only allow fanart characters \u0026amp; on the other week I will allow both OCs and Fanart characters ! It will be specified in the patreon post itself along with the other rules and details. You will have about 5 days to think of something and comment !

I have a lot on my plate right now and would like to eventually expand on bigger things/take on personal projects at some point. The current number of slots this tier has is 15, which is really my limit and even makes some months a little hard and chaotic to work with - So by having it marked as unpublished it just means that if people drop their slot it\u0027ll give me time to think if I\u0027m comfortable with the current number and would like to make the slot available or would prefer to gradually decrease that tier without having to stress about little sneaky pledgers noticing and snatching that available spot faster than me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to wait until a few people drop that said tier but it will be available in the list again in the future :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e____________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT MY BREAK WEEKS\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEven Meru needs some time to breathe ! After 6 weeks of constant work, I will take a week off stream to complete all of my leftovers, backlogged files, take on a little project (animation or else), relax and have time to study/experiment on little things I usually don\u0027t have enough time to do - I always mention the date of my next vacation at the top of the page and make a post about the plan/what date the regular stream schedule will be back on during the evening around of that said vacation :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
