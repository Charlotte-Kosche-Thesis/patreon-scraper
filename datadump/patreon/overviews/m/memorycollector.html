    "summary": "Hello world! My name is Sascha Damon Frost. I am a working independent musician, lead pizza maker at Whole Foods Market, and most recently a father to my newly born son Lachlan. I began my musical pursuits on YouTube in February of 2009. Back then, I was just a shy college student who wanted to try his hand at singing for others around the world to hear. Too afraid to go out and play live, I thought that doing cover songs on YouTube was the safest alternative. That way if nobody liked what I was doing or nobody cared to listen, then at least I wouldn\u0027t necessarily experience that public embarrassment. Despite expecting to be criticized in the comments section, to my surprise I found that everyone who happened upon my videos was highly supportive and encouraging. As I started to see my view counts increase and the positive comments rolling in, I couldn\u0027t help but continue making videos. It gave me a good feeling to know that people enjoyed watching me doing something I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the encouragement and nice comments I had been receiving led me to build up enough confidence to play a live show. It was a small one at a modest venue filled with mostly friends and family, but it was a major step for me. I had finally done something I had always dreamed of doing but had never thought myself able to do. At a certain point, music was all I could think about, and one of the few things I found true interest and enjoyment in. I made the tough decision to stop going to school for something I didn\u0027t enjoy in pursuit of a more interesting life dedicated to music and personal exploration. Within the first 6 months of leaving, I had already written two full-length instrumental albums. I then moved to Cape Cod where, for a brief time, I played guitar for an indie rock band called Every Aircraft. We played a few local shows, including one at the Blend Art Expo in Boston.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point I have earned a pretty good following on YouTube and SoundCloud, as I continue to work on my own solo projects in addition to an international collaboration with the Russian IDM group Phacowboy. Although the majority of my time is spent working and caring for my newly born son, I still find time here and there to do what I love. Someday I hope to start playing live shows again with my own original songs. I am dedicated to becoming a better musician in any way I can, and will always play for anyone who is willing to listen. I am starting this Patreon in order to help me advance in my musical pursuits, as well as to help me support my family as I take time off work to be a mostly stay-at-home dad. It would mean a lot to me to have a means of supporting myself through this period of my life, and to anyone who is willing to lend me a hand I can\u0027t thank you enough. There is so much more I could say, but I will leave it at that. Thank you for your patronage, and I hope you enjoy the content that is to come!\u003cbr\u003e"
