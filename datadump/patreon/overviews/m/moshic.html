He\u2019s been touring the world for many years and has established an amazing name for himself as a great performer and an extraordinary studio artist. Northern Israel, Haifa (1977), Moshic Shlomi is born. A man, whose name thrills millions of progressive House fans today, He grew up in a family of musicians, but not everything in his life inclined cheerful singing. At the age of 18, he was enlisted to National Service, where as a medic, he had to deal with death every day. Soldiers brought from Lebanon were dying right in front of his eyes. Continuous suicide attacks and living on a time bomb made Moshic understand, what the most important thing in life is; to seize the day. When he finished paying his debts to the country, he decided to devote himself completely to electronic music. He fell in love with progressive, which wasn\u2019t too popular at that time in Israel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoshic started to conquer the dance scene worldwide. However the true fame and publicity came with the \u201cNightstalker\u201d production. \u201cNightstalker\u201d was included in Danny Howells\u2019s \u201cNocturnal Frequencies 3\u201d and Jimmie Van M\u2019s \u201cBedrock: Compiled \u0026amp; Mixed\" compilations. When \u201cDj Magazine\u201d announced the tune as the \u201cunderground hit of the year\u201d, nothing could stop Moshic\u2019s carrier to expand. The Moshic mix for John Digweed\u2019s broadcast on Kiss 100, was marked in history. Since then \u2013 December 2001 \u2013 Moshic has constantly emerged from the underground and finally became its ambassador. Every day, every week, every month masterpieces like \u201c10@ZE\u201d or the remix of Memnon\u2019s \u201cLocutus\u201d were produced. Year after the Kiss 100 broadcast his \u201cDistorted Patterns\u201d compilation was unearthed. Progressive fans went down to their knees and Moshic was asked to do the Essential Mix that was broadcasted in February of that year. Soon after that his mix was added to the \u201cDj Mag\u201d\u2019s April issue.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
