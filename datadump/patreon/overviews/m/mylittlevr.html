We\u0027re trying our best to make it as easy for everyone else to enjoy what we\u0027ve done and try to make the avatars we already ported over available for others too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy does this Patreon exist you may ask? Well, models and textures aren\u0027t cheap and we want to pay the creators who provide all these awesome models in the future. We simply couldn\u0027t make anything happen without the awesome work of all these people and we\u0027re more than thankful for that! We also want to give something back and that\u0027s why we decided to make this Patreon so people can help us out :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll rewards contain a special role on our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://discord.me/ponyvrchat\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiscord Server\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e too! The higher ones (10$ and 20$) also include an effort by us to try and port your existing OC as good as we can into VRChat! However sometimes stuff doesn\u0027t work the way we want it to so we can\u0027t fully promise that we\u0027ll manage to port it over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you\u0027re able to support us in bringing ponies into VR for everyone to enjoy and we\u0027d be more than glad to have you as a Patron :)\u003cbr\u003e"
