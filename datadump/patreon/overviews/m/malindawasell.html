    "summary": "Greetings dear strangers,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Malinda Wasell and I\u0027m a creative soul born and raised in Sweden. If you know about me at all, you probably know me as a model, but there are many layers of this cake and I hope to be able to share a little bit of everything here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, there are some huge changes in the planning, both regarding my creative work and my life in general. 2017 will be the year when I take the leap into becoming a full time traveling model, with a new base in Berlin. I am super excited about the possibilities this transfer will bring, and I hope you\u0027ll want to join me on this great adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what would you be getting by pledging? Full sets of (obviously uncensored) images from my shoots, behind the scenes pictures and videos, full sets of my own photography, self portraits etc. I will be making prints and handwritten letters for all of you who are like me, and still really love the feeling of a physical paper. You would also get to know my other creative outlets, such as writing and singing, passions that have been set aside for much too long now. I am only just starting my Patreon journey, and I am very much looking forward to hearing your thoughts; what you want to see more of, what makes you excited about contributing to my work. Because your support will mean everything to me! It will give me the possibility to grow and evolve, on both sides of the camera and as a human being. I mostly shoot film, which is an expensive process, and I would really love to expand my rather small set of equipment, with an instant camera, a cable release to make my self portrait photography a lot smoother, outfits and props etc etc into infinity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me just say thank you!!! in advance, and let\u0027s do this!"
