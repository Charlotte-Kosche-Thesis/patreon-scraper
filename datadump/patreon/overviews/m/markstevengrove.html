My name is \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Steven Grove\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e and\u00a0I am looking for monthly financial support so I can write, produce, and shoot my web serial \u003cstrong\u003eSHADOW WAR\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo begin with, I would like to clarify what a \u201cSerial\u201d is.  A serial is a motion picture format popular during the 1st half of the 20th century that typically consisted of 8 to 15 chapters ranging in length between 7 to 12 minutes each.  In most cases a serial followed the journey of a protagonist (hero) versus an antagonist (villain) in a single story-line.  Each chapter was exhibited in a theater (generally advancing weekly) until the serial completed.  Most chapters left the viewer wondering what happens next, which created the \u201cCliffhanger\u201d dynamic that would often leave the hero in a perilous position that would conclude in the following episode.  The three top studios that produced serials were \u003cem\u003eUniversal\u003c/em\u003e (\u003cem\u003eFlash Gordon\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Green Hornet\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eBuck Rogers\u003c/em\u003e), \u003cstrong\u003eRepublic \u003c/strong\u003e(\u003cem\u003eCaptain Marvel\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSpy Smasher\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eCaptain America\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Lone Ranger\u003c/em\u003e), and \u003cstrong\u003eColumbia\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003cem\u003eMandrake the Magician,\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eThe Phantom\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Shadow\u003c/em\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cstrong\u003eSERIALS OF THE GOLDEN AGE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii607/RMStunts/Serial%20banner_zpsgu4rqntr.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut now the most important question\u2026what is the\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSHADOW WAR\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0serial about?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nSHADOW WAR\u003c/strong\u003e will follow the exploits of a Ninja vigilante who uses his elite skills to fight evil in a city plagued with crime and corruption.

It is my mission to create action packed content that maintains a shorter running time in an effort to accommodate the fast paced / limited attention span of the modern viewer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO AM I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a lifelong practitioner of the Ninja arts.  It is this path that has been the guiding force behind all I have accomplished in my life.  I first began teaching these skills in 1983 and I have maintained a Dojo (training hall) ever since. I have also worked in the film industry since the late 80\u0027s as an actor, fight choreographer, stunt coordinator, firearms handler, pyrotechnician, special effects supervisor, and historical consultant. In 1999 I transitioned to the directors chair and began writing, producing and directing my own projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii607/RMStunts/MG%20director%20banner_zpsetsftsa5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY I HAVE TURNED TO PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a son, Hunter, who was born January 25th 1998.  It was immediately evident he was special.  He was born with three brain abnormalities, cerebral palsy and many other health issues.\u00a0 Perhaps the most devastating thing is that he had sensory issues that kept him from giving or receiving physical affection.  If I could explain what it is like to love someone so unconditionally and not be able to hold them in your arms to console their pain\u2026 There are no words.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii607/RMStunts/Hunter%20banner%2001_zpsr53osd5t.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003eWhen he was young it was hard, but as he has grown it has proven much harder. In his final years of high school he was the recipient of continuous negative experiences that we were unaware of, and when we did find out, it was too late\u2026 the permanent damage was done.  He now has major anxiety all the time.  He is especially resistant about leaving the house and he often lashes out physically if his senses become overwhelmed.\u00a0 As of this writing he is 20 years old and only weighs 71 pounds. He requires constant care and his health continues to diminish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii607/RMStunts/Hunter%20banner%2002_zpsdos3eqyq.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThus, my normal process of spending extended periods of time away from home to work on projects is much more difficult. I am dedicated to being Hunter\u0027s caregiver and I am honored to do so.\u00a0 However, I have always believed that in life you must be adaptable, and thus I have turned to writing instructional books, feature film scripts, and developing web based projects that allow me to remain by his side while still pursuing artistic endeavors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHEN YOU ARE FEELING SMALL, \u003cem\u003eTHINK BIG!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA situation like this can often make people feel powerless, but I have always believed that the obstacles that arise are not there to stop us, they emerge to challenge us as a way of determining if we are worthy.\u00a0 I always accept... and \u003cstrong\u003eSHADOW WAR\u003c/strong\u003e is my response.\u00a0 That said, such an ambitious project cannot be undertaken alone.\u00a0 I am joined by a small group of Colorado film professionals who share my passion and my vision.\u00a0 Like a family, we have a solid bond that has been forged by working side by side on past film productions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOLLYWOOD ICONS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond our local crew, I have reached out to two Hollywood Stunt Icons, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eJames Lew\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Avery\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.
