This patreon is a varible behind the scenes of the drawing, painting, custom toy work, sewing, button pressing, and salvaging that happens in my workshop. You get to choose the kinds of things I work on, and you even get dibs on prototypes and new items before the public does.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy making a pledge to me, you will \u00a0not only get access to all this randomness, but you will be able to help me get to to ultimate goal of being able to make art for a living and spend more time volenteering for the community rather than it be a job I can only do at night and on weekends. With your support, you will have access to my behind the scenes photos, ideas, and WIPS for the shop as well as charity items I put together which usually benefit randomacts.org.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope I make something in the future that you love."

My goal is to have tons of different items and styles so anyone could come to the online shop and find something for anyone on their list, or for themselves. I constantly try new crafts, and use different supplies to create new things for people to enjoy, many of which never make it past patreon supporters to hit the shop publicly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I\u0027m silly, fandom friendly, and a big horror fan which all come through in my work. While custom funko pops is the big seller of the shop currently i\u0027m always trying out new materials and styles. I\u0027m also VERY open to ideas, you can comment on any post asking if I can try doing a certain craft you would like to see and i\u0027ll put my spin on it for a shop offering.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
