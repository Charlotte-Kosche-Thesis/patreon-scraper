    "summary": "MAMMON MACHINE: \u003ca href=\"http://medium.com/mammon-machine-zeal\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eZEAL\u003c/a\u003e was founded in November 2013 and has grown into an online magazine of alternative and experimental comics and pop culture criticism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi ya\u0027ll. I am ZEAL editor-in-chief and founder Aevee Bee. ZEAL was started as a very modest project to fund my own critical writing and make it sustainable, while providing a new venue for emerging artists and writers. Since then, ZEAL has grown tremendously beyond my expectations! It\u0027s a place where I get to regularly read the sort of writing I loved and missed from sites like GameSetWatch, Insert Credit, and Nightmare Mode. It\u0027s a place for original comics and illustration from our favorite artists. Crowdfunding allows managing editor J Bearhat and myself to pay real wages to our contributors in a world where that\u0027s getting harder and harder to find, and (we hope) will sustain this project, like the similar sites that got me my own start in games criticism, while remaining completely free to readers so everyone can enjoy our work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re interested in finding the value in the unvalued. We want the stuff that couldn\u0027t fit anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSubmission Guidelines\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePitches for original writing on comics, games, and pop culture.\u003cbr\u003ePitches for original comics (OPEN AGAIN).\u003cbr\u003eHybrid multimedia work.\u003cbr\u003eCOOL IDEAS????\u003cbr\u003eALL SUBMISSIONS GO TO:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:submissions@mammonmachine.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esubmissions@mammonmachine.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to the number of submissions we recieve, can\u0027t always reply to or accept every submission we get. Our apologies! We often will work with writers on pitches, especially if we like your work, but responses are not a guarantee of publication. Please check these guidelines thoroughly, as we\u0027re much more likely to respond if we can tell you read them and are on board for what ZEAL is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does a good pitch look like?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll pitches should describe the full scope of what you\u2019d like to do (especially if it\u2019s beyond what we usually do\u2014but we absolutely love stuff like that so we encourage you to pitch it!) and why it would be interesting to readers and a good fit for ZEAL. If you\u0027ve done some writing before, we\u0027d love to see a link to it, too! Pitches should be no more than a paragraph in length, and let us know what is new and originalabout your topic, what your angle is, and what\u0027s interesting and exciting about it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe like to hear about comics and games that are rarely discussed, but we\u0027d also like to hear you discuss them in ways that are fresh and new too. ZEAL\u0027s had highly analytical features on Sonic Adventure\u0027s broken geometry and level design, and lyric essays on Tove Jansson\u0027s \u003cem\u003eMoomin\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0comics\u00a0combining biography, personal reminiscence, and the author\u0027s own drawings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re really open to working with people who are new to writing or don\u0027t consider themselves writers, but we do want you have an idea of substance you can execute on. Familiarity with our magazine is a must for knowing what would make a good fit, so please at least skim through to get a sense of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat makes a good fit for criticism on ZEAL?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eZEAL does what other games criticism don\u2019t. We\u2019re interested in writing on games that are not generally the target of serious criticism; games that are too weird, too bad, too forgotten, and too anime. We\u2019re also into writing that doesn\u2019t fit in the bounds of what\u2019s normal for games criticism\u2014we like revisionist fanfiction and close readings of art and design by people who know what they\u2019re talking about. We\u2019re less stoked, but potentially still interested, in literary analysis of games or personal narratives involving games, because those forms of writing are well represented in many other places. We love to have personal angles, but we love those best when they\u0027re informed by understanding of artistic work too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat makes a good fit for comics on ZEAL?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e9/6/16 UPDATE: Due to our current backlog and budgeting restrictions, we\u0027re currently closed for open submissions on comics. We just have too many! Once we\u0027ve gone through our current queue we will be reopening again for open submissions.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZEAL loves anything short and oddly shaped that might have a hard time finding a home anywhere else. We love comics about games, but aren\u0027t only interested in that. We want comics that feel the same way ZEAL does; sustainable, diverse, smart, and extremely powerful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat stipulations do you have for work that is published on ZEAL? Do I retain copyright?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe publish original work only (if it\u0027s previously published on your blog, it\u0027s not eligible unless you\u0027ve done substantial revision . We retain no rights to it unless specified; we just ask we get to host it exclusively for a month, and to continue to host it on ZEAL\u0027s website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe publish all of our work on Medium, so you\u2019ll need a Medium account to submit, which is free and easily obtainable. After your submission is accepted, we\u2019ll ask you to submit a draft that we will edit on there (while jumping through a few of Medium\u2019s annoying hoops).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you pay?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe pay $100 for 2-3k words of writing (negotiable).\u003cbr\u003eWe pay $100-150 (negotiable) for original illustrations for promotion or article illustrations depending on your rates and our budget (we don\u0027t currently have open submissions for original art).\u003cbr\u003eWe pay $150-$200 (negotiable) for comics depending on your rates and our budget.\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re doing something high ambitious and original (or would like to illustrate your own article) we can discuss applicable rates. If you\u0027re making something REALLY big, we\u0027d prefer to scale down work or put that work in installments so that we can work within our monthly patreon budget (and give you a fair cut!).\u003cbr\u003e"
