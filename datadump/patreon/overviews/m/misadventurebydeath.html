Easy-peasy\u2026right? Perhaps not. As Neil attempts to settle into his new home, he finds himself having to combat with supernatural shenanigans, a \u00a0few less than savory fellow staff members, and good old Southern charm. What could possibly go wrong?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMisadventure by Death is a monthly podcast. We plan on providing you, the listener, with a scary story while also staying true to one of the main tenets of our production company: diverse representation. We\u0027re here, we\u0027re queer, and we want to scare people when they\u0027re listening to the show in the darkness of night.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJake Song is the creator and director. The main cast includes Jack Pevyhouse, M Moon, Sarah Golding and Lauren Wisniewski. Editing is currently being done by M Moon, and episodes are being written by Jake Song and Hayden Epstein. The cover art you see at the top of the page was done by the ever-talented, amazing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kassillus.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKassandra\u003c/a\u003e, and the theme music is done by the incredible Rosemary Derocher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy the heck are we here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating a podcast is hard. Like, really hard. This show is a labor of love, and hopefully will grow into something big and beautiful, but in order for that to happen, merchandise and art need to be made, and songs need to be composed. Perhaps a live show or two can happen, as well. However, currently, we can\u0027t afford for all this to happen on pure manpower alone. We want to bring you quality entertainment, and that is more easily achieved with the help of patrons.\u003cbr\u003e"
