That began with Mordheim: City of the Damned, a game I used to play late into the night with my friends and brother as a tabletop game.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, in 2017, there continues to be so many glorious games to play and share and experience with you all. I am absolutely thrilled by the wonderful thing my little corner of the internet is, and how wonderful each of you are in it. I\u0027ve made more than 800 videos and 17,500 tweets in that time (oh my word, the tweets are everywhere). I\u0027ve done YouTube content creation as a part-time endeavor on top of my family life and full-time job. Two thoughts associated with that:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) I want to keep making things for you for a long time to come\u003c/strong\u003e. Growth comes in spurts, but I\u0027m approaching the zone where it\u0027s not out of the realm of imagination that I might someday do this full time. Making things for you is the most fun I\u0027ve ever had doing anything. In some shape or another I want to keep doing these amazing, engaging, and fun things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) To do YouTube the way I want to, I need it to be self-sustaining.\u003c/strong\u003e The fact is that I cannot do everything I aspire to due to the real time and energy requirements of my day job. It\u0027s not healthy for me to stake out as much time as I want to, around my day job, family time and sleep schedule (which is a balance I\u0027ve struggled with in the past). In the meantime, I must triage my time and energy to make the things I most want to make, but many of the things I want to make must be put on the back burner until I can get to them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is that viewers can donate whatever amount they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. Every single contribution adds up fast, and is far and away the fastest track to my doing YouTube full-time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect or assume anyone will contribute any more to my goofball projects than simply watching my videos. Truly, I appreciate that by itself. But if you feel like contributing more (in any amount!), it\u0027ll all go back into creating more stuff...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eJust to be clear,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI\u2019m not charging for my content, nor\nwill I: I\u0027m just trying to have a more sustainable and reliable source or\nrevenue to support the creation of the things that I make.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?patAmt=1\u0026amp;u=426530\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ePatreon\nis the most powerful platform I know of to support the creators you\ncare most about\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e. \u003c/strong\u003eThe consistent revenue\nthat I receive from Patreon allows me to 1) Save for my future, and make me less reliant on my day job! 2) make plans for those funds such as commission glorious art for my channel (supporting them in the process), or hire help in making my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs an example of my Patron\u2019s support at work, my \u201cExplain\nlike I\u2019m 2 Reviews\u201d (in which I can only use the 1,000 most-used English words)\nare \u003cem\u003eproduced with the direct support of my Patrons\u003c/em\u003e.
