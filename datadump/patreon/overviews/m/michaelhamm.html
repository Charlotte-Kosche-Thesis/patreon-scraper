I am a geek, model, Cosplayer, and social media personality with an addiction to comics, cats, chips and possibly alliteration. To be honest, I\u2019m not very good at talking about myself so I\u2019ll just answer a few important questions!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e How Did You Get into Cosplay?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpending my entire life surrounded and obsessed with comic books, cartoons, and action figures hasn\u2019t always been a great experience. Throughout high school, I always felt ashamed of my interest in geek culture. The things that I liked as a 10-year-old boy were no longer cool. Cartoons\u00a0were for \u201cbabies\u201d, comics were for \u201cnerds\u201d, action figures were \u201cdolls\u201d, and wanting to dress up in costume on any day other than Halloween was \u201cweird\u201d and \u201cgay\u201d. l was always excitedly, and impatiently waiting for Halloween because it was the one time a year I could dress as one of my favorite characters without any feelings of shame. It wasn\u2019t until I attended my first Comic Book Convention in Toronto and experienced \u201cCosplay\u201d that I finally realized the only thing I had to be ashamed of was the fact that I spent so many years denying who I was and what I loved doing. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e How Did You Become a Social Media Personality?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell coincidentally, that all started with Cosplay as well. After my first convention I promised myself that I would do cosplay at the next convention I went to and surprise, surprise, I didn\u2019t. I was too anxious and overwhelmed with fear of being made fun of or having people look at me. After two years of lying to myself, and with the support of my friends and family, I built a Robin costume that would later go slightly (very slightly) viral. I was humbled and overwhelmed by all the friend request so I decided to start a fan page. Eventually, I realized that although people were interested in my cosplay, they were also interested in my life, my cats, my modeling, my acting, my opinions, and so much more. What was originally meant to be a cosplay page became my platform to introduce the world to who Michael Hamm really was, and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to all the amazing people who allow me to do that and follow along.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e I Don\u2019t Have Time to Read Your Sob Story, Just Tell Us What You Want From Us!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGeez, tough imaginary crowd, I made up. Look, to be completely honest, I decided to start this Patreon because I need your help. I have a longing to be creative and currently, I just don\u2019t have the mean to do so. I want to keep creating bigger and better cosplays, I want to start shooting on locations, I want to start making youtube videos, fitness vlogs, live streams, and much more. Basically, I just want to create the content you have come to love seeing and that I have come to love making; just on a bigger, better, and more frequent scale. Additionally, I love giving back to you guys and this is a wonderful way to go about that! Who doesn\u2019t love a little mutual gratification? I simply can\u0027t tell you all how much this would mean to me and I hope we can work together to make something special!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Like, Any Examples of What it is That You Do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure!\u003cbr\u003eI (try to) Do videos!\u003ca href=\"http://shaunsimpson.ca/Hamm/images/Screen_Shot_2017-07-29_at_1.01.51_PM.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shaunsimpson.ca/Hamm/images/Screen_Shot_2017-07-29_at_1.01.51_PM.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI Do Cosplay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shaunsimpson.ca/Hamm/images/Hamm_Edits_-_389_copy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shaunsimpson.ca/Hamm/images/Hamm_Edits_-_393_copy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAm Into Fitness!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shaunsimpson.ca/Hamm/images/SpringPrint.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI Model!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shaunsimpson.ca/Hamm/images/Hamm_Edits_-_034.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI Do Boudoir!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shaunsimpson.ca/Hamm/images/Hamm_Edits_-_059_copy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI Take Dumb Selfies!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shaunsimpson.ca/Hamm/images/IMG_0784.JPG\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut\u00a0Most Of Time I Combine All Of The Above!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shaunsimpson.ca/Hamm/images/IMG_3791.JPG\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfessional Photos By:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ShaunTheShooter/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eShaun Simpson\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAll Dumb Selfies By: Me\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Spending the majority of his life obsessed with comic books, cartoons, and action figures, Michael\u2019s passion for everything geekdom hit a peak when he attended his first Comic book convention in 2009. Originally attending conventions strictly as a fan, it wasn\u2019t until 2013 that Michael fell in love with Cosplay at his home town convention \u201cHal-Con\u201d. As someone who was always impatiently waiting for Halloween, Michael was ecstatic to get the chance to dress as his favorite characters more than once a year.\u003cbr\u003eWith the support of his friends and family, Michael built a Robin costume that would later go slightly viral which enticed him to start a fan page due to the overwhelming friend requests. Less than 3 years later there is no looking back as Michael has been able to balance work and university while also amassing a large following on social networking sites and piecing together over 20 costumes. Whether an invited guest, a panelist, a judge, or just a fan, Michael strives to promote that Cosplay is about more than costumes, it\u2019s about enjoying your passions, being creative, and doing whatever makes you happy.\u003cbr\u003e",
