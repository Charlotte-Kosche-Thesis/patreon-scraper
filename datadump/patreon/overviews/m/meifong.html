    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSupport a book on one-child policy that people in China can read, and strike a blow against censorship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy book, \"One Child,\" on China\u0027s one-child\npolicy was published this year. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) It was a timely debut,coming out just as China announced a switch to a two-child policy. \"One Child\" was also critically acclaimed, the culmination of many years work, including a decade\u0027s experience as a Pulitzer-prize winning China\ncorrespondent for the Wall Street Journal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUnfortunately, the people most affected\nby the policy are not able to read it. I\u0027ve put up a one-time funding appeal here on Patreon, but those who prefer a simpler, also one-time donation,can go to my \u003ca href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/support-a-book-on-onechild-policy\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGoFundMe\u003c/a\u003e campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks to tightening censorship in China, I am unable to get a mainland Chinese\npublisher. \u003cbr\u003ePreviously, books on \"banned\" topics in China used to find their way\nto mainland readers through Hong Kong or Taiwan, but the chill on publishing has\nextended even beyond China as Beijing\u0027s influence grows.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, in a twist worthy of Kafka, several\nbooksellers in Hong Kong who dared print unflattering stories on China\u2019s leaders mysteriously disappeared, only to appear on mainland China making televised\nconfessions to a host of alleged crimes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNeedless to say, this has created a\nclimate of fear among writers and publishers to produce anything remotely critical\nof Beijing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo write a book about China that most Chinese cannot read is to accept defeat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have interviewed\nmany Chinese people for this book -- from academics to officials to everyday\nfolk. They spoke honestly, and at some risk to themselves, about how the\none-child policy shaped their lives. Their observations and experiences deserve\nto be part of the conversation about China\u2019s past and future. I was not willing\nto have their voices silenced. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, I have created a Chinese version of my\nbook, and am releasing a free download of it aimed at mainland Chinese readers. I will also have versions in simplified and traditional Chinese available for sale via electronic download or print-on-demand, for folks outside the great Firewall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this has taken a significant amount\nof resources: I have had to pay for a translation out of my own pocket. Even\nfinding a translator was no an easy task. One candidate bowed out for fear of\npolitical retribution. My current translator has asked to remain anonymous. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve also had to turn myself into a\nmini-publisher, learning about file formatting, marketing, cover design,\ncopyright issues, rights management\u2014all for a book which I am, for the most part, giving away free.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am turning to you to help me cover\nthe costs of this highly unorthodox approach to publishing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere is a risk. I expect authorities in\nChina will try to shut-down or remove digital copies of my book as it appears\nin Chinese cyberspace, but hopefully not before it has had a chance to be\nwidely disseminated. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you help me succeed in this venture,\nit will inspire others to scale the Great Firewall. It might also encourage other writers whose works have been repressed by authoritarian regimes to consider new ways of reaching their audiences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will be a nod to human\ningenuity, journalism and truth-telling.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost of all, it is a gesture of hope that the\nfreedom of ideas will prevail.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you--Mei Fong\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"A searing, important, and eminently readable exploration of China\u0027s one-child policy.\"\u003cbr\u003e \u2014 \u003cstrong\u003eNICHOLAS D.
