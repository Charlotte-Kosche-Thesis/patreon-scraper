She is also joint editor of the British Fantasy Society\u0027s fiction publication BFS Horizons. Shona lives on the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond with her husband and three children. When she\u0027s not writing or wrangling children she can usually be found with her nose in a book. She is very excited to be collaborating with Joe on this story and hopes you\u0027ll join them for the journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoe Slucher\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoe\n is a freelance illustrator that has spent most of his career working in\n the game industry including clients such as Wizards of the Coast, \nCryptozoic Studios and Supergenius Studios. His personal work shows a \nlove for textures, the dark and melancholy. Joe has developed an \naddiction to reading more books than is healthy and is really looking \nforward to helping to craft and tell this story. He wants the work on \nMiranya\u0027s Oath to have emotional content and look beautiful.
