Unfortunately, this work is \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e time consuming and I don\u0027t get paid for it. (What little ad revenue I do bring in is comparable to a child\u0027s lemonade stand... on a cold winter day.)

So if you enjoy and appreciate all of the work I do for the ADHD community and would like to help bring ADHD Awareness and Advocacy to the world, \u003cem\u003eplease\u003c/em\u003e consider being a patron. \u00a0If you can chip in a little every month (as little as $1 even), not only will my family and I be incredibly grateful, I will be able to continue doing what I do best to help make the world a better place and you will be a part of it! Plus, patrons get special perks! (The more you donate, the better your perks are. Take a look on the right!
