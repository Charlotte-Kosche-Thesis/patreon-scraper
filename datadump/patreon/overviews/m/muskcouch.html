    "summary": "A recent campaign has been created on GoFundMe to raise $1000 to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://au.gofundme.com/buyeloncouch\"\u003ebuy a new couch for Elon Musk\u003c/a\u003e. As you may be aware, Elon Musk\u0027s net worth is 19.2 billion dollars. The humor in fundraising for him is not lost on me, but let\u0027s take a moment to consider just how much money $19.2 billion is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAssuming that a couch costs $1000 as requested by the GoFundMe and the average couch has a length of 8 feet, he would be able to purchase 19.2 million couches, which laid end to end would be\u00a0153600000ft, or\u00a029,091 miles long, which could encircle the Earth plus a bit more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/29vnfax.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsidering my debts, my net worth is around $2000, so if a penny were to fall out of my pocket, it would represent\u00a00.0005% of my net worth. If Elon Musk were to drop\u00a00.0005% of his net worth in the street, it would be $96,000, an amount that would significantly improve my quality of life, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/ezwwze/the-high-price-of-insulin-is-literally-killing-people\"\u003esave the lives of countless others\u003c/a\u003e, and he would miss it no more than I would miss a penny.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/scvwue.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to make a graphic showing the scale of his penny in relation to my penny, but in order to have my penny appear as a single pixel, the image would have to be much larger than the width of my monitor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf Elon Musk were to split his fortune equally among every homeless person in the United States, estimated at\u00a0564,708 people\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0they would each receive 34 thousand dollars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf I were to steal a couch from Elon Musk every day, he would be able to afford to replace it for\u00a052,602 years. This would of course be good for people in the business of furniture delivery and Musk\u0027s staff could probably automate the orders to the point that he would never notice that the couches were missing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/2mqmf6f.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn other words, for those of you who love Elon Musk, it would not only be utterly inconsequential if not amusing to him for us to break into his office and take his couch, every day (let\u0027s say every business day; even thieves need weekends and holidays), for the rest of our natural lives and the lives of our and his descendants, it would create jobs for me, my heist crew, and a number of people in the furniture business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe could sustain this business by selling the couches to some extent, but the real money is in periodically finding one of those big pennies under the cushions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to need to raise funds to hire a team of hackers, locksmiths, acrobats and so on as well as all the necessary equipment, vehicles, and classy suits we\u0027ll need to pull this job over and over forever or until the Earth can no longer sustain human life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I have to ask you:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/25a2n9g.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis account is a work of fiction/satire purely for entertainment purposes and does not promote any actual illegal activity.
