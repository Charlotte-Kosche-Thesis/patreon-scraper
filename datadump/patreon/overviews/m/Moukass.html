    "summary": "Hello guys Moukass here\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI always loved doing videos, at age 14 I was already doing montages for my Counter strike Clan, I didn\u0027t realize this could be a carrier! So I spent years in college studying science, years in high school studying art and computer graphics, I then finally graduated and found a job... Most disapointing experience in my life! I was so bored, so depressed, I hated getting told what to do because I always had this voice telling me I could do better on my own. My gateway was creating a youtube channel on something I loved at the time: Planetside 2. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI play video games a lot... my parents never liked it, they often told me it will \"loose me\" and that I was \"wasting my time\", I vividly remember one time when my father smashed my computer into the ground and shatered it to pieces :( because I played too much baldurs gate II. I think I always grew up wanting to prove them wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have several Youtube channels, the biggest one being about FPS gaming and especially PlanetSide 2, this is why most of you know me. I love this game because it has epic moments that will remind you some moments in the best movies:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTracers everywhere explosions people dying left and right the commander shouting orders, this makes some seriously cinematic stuff! In all my video-editing carrier, I never had a game that allowed me to express the Epic stories that are in my head. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA mix of War stories, heroic actions and fantasy tales, I must have watched too much war movies\u003c/strong\u003e, too much Lord of the Rings, and probably too much video games in general. This is who I am, I grew up like that with a bunch of other NERDs, all of them went to do \"normal\" jobs, now they envy me because I kept doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this patreon account for the people who want to support this kind of videos, videos that give you Goosebumps videos that doesn\u0027t get old. I believe that good gameplay and good audio well mixed together can be the most beautiful thing ever in a video, something you cannot explain, you just appreciate it flowing so smoothly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach music tells a story and each killstreak is a story, so I just try to find the right music for the right killstreak, I find a great satisfaction in seeing gameplay that is well synchronized with the music. It takes it out of the gaming world and takes it into the Cinematic world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you want some more of these cinematic videos please consider supporting this patreon campaign. Most of my videos are free to watch but some are private for those who choose to support me. These videos are the unfinished montages, videos on older games and other personal projects that I never shared publicly, over 100 videos done over the time and that will show you what it took to create the \"Moukass\" you know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now my objective is to make enough money online so I can put more time and quality into my videos; I would love to upgrade my internet connection so I can stream consistently, for now the only solution is with the 4G of my phone but my credit is limited to 8Gb per month.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI would also love to not have to wait 10 to 20 hours for every video to upload. The lenght of my videos has quadrupled since I started posting (slowly went from 720p/30FPS to 1080p/60FPS after a lot of requests), so a connection upgrade will be extremelly appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother goal is simply win enough to have more time to play and edit, with a company to run it got really hard these last 2 years but I\u0027m slowly getting at the end of the tunnel. I hope to get to a point where I can spend most of my time making videos, vids I will love forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for the support so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoukass\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mGUTAQv.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/CdmOM2G.jpg\" style=\"width: 607px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/O0KlMy0.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
