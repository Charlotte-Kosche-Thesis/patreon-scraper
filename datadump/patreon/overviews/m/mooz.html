    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo as of the moment I plan on only using this Patreon as a form of a Tip-Jar.\u003cbr\u003eI do plan on eventually progressing into a fully tiered Patreon page with rewards and access to artwork before its posted etc. But for the moment I just want to start off light and build my way up to something :]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo - A little about myself.\u003cbr\u003eI go by the name Muzz online, I am mostly known within the Furry Fandom.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been drawing animals since I was about 3 years old and progressed as I got older. With the typical influences and inspirations of disney movies and animals/animation in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the internet was born (I feel so old right now), I discovered a lot more out there, more people such as myself who prefered drawing cartoony animals. My main base to begin with was on The Lion King Fan Art Archive, drawing Lion King fanart and making my own characters. From there I found Anthro Art within the website Size 7 - From there I went onto DeviantArt, then Sheezy Art.. And eventually Furaffinity, which is where I have resisded for the last 13 years!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course my main area of artwork is adult anthro artwork, I do clean artwork too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I wanted to set this page up for tips, and possibly to help me with a little extra money coming in on the side to go towards bills, upgrading my drawing tools and such. And of course as I mentioned, I will build this up into something with more tiers and rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for reading! And thank you if you decide to contribute to my tip jar!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main locations as of right now are:\u003cbr\u003eTwitter: @MuzzArts\u003cbr\u003eFuraffinity: @Muzz (obviously will contain NSFW artwork!)"
