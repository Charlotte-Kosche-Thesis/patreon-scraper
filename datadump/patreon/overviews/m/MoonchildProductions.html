Thank you for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003eMoonchild Productions, originally the name for my personal works in art, music and software, has grown to be a small community of dedicated people who, \nfor almost 10 years now, have brought you the \u003ca href=\"http://www.palemoon.org/\"\u003ePale Moon\u003c/a\u003e web browser. This Patreon page has been set up to support that project (and the future XUL platform).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for wanting to support our efforts in creating a community-driven browser!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour\n support through Patreon will directly help our development by keeping \nthe lights on, assuring we aren\u0027t forced into compromising deals, and \nwith your help may even become fully independent and ad-free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a service where you \ncan pledge to send a regular payment to creators, so they can support \nthemselves and keep making new stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is better for \ncreators than advertising or sponsorship. The content is 100% \nun-compromised, payment is more predictable, and we don\u0027t need to \nstoop to questionable high-rate advertisers or other shady practices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon \nmeans that we can serve our users, not advertisers or corporate \nsponsors.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eAnd you are free to pledge any amount you can afford or want to give, with no strings attached.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will I end up paying?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou\n pay per month. We always aim to have regular updates to the browser each month, but as things go with software development there is no guarantee that a release will be ready in any given month, since we go by the premise to \"publish a new version when it\u0027s done, not enforced by a calendar\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need the money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027d love to become completely advertisement free first and foremost, but our irregular \ndonations and sponsors simply haven\u0027t provided us with something steady \nenough to do so. To ensure \nour independence and avoid any censorship or bias enforced by advertisers, this will be our first goal to reach.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDevelopment of a complex, modern browser is no easy task, and I personally put hundreds of hours into it every month as a full-time commitment (it\u0027s not a hobby!). Aside from myself, other people spend lots of time improving the browser, providing support to users, etc. all as volunteers - I\u0027d like to be able to give back to them as well! Next, we have bounties for people who want to help with our development of specifically challenging things, that can also be funded by you as a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money will also be used to pay for our hosting of servers and services that users of the browser get access to (like Sync). Occasionally, hardware will need to be upgraded and replaced too in workstations used to develop software and compile the browser.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAlthough\n we don\u0027t have any rewards set up (yet!), rest assured all your support \nwill be put to good use in terms of offsetting development and hosting \ncosts, remaining independent, and keeping the necessary coffee flowing. So for now we can only provide you with the good feeling of supporting something that will keep pushing back against the corporate strong-arming going on on the Internet.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
