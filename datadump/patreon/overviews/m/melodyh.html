A few \nyears ago, right before moving to China, I decided to teach myself how \nto knit by watching videos online. I barely touched my pointy stitcks \nduring the two years that I spent there, but right after coming back to \nFrance, I got completely hooked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\n new hobby quickly reached the point where it became an obsession. When I\n first started, I didn\u0027t know anything about fibre, and how important it\n was to work with good tools and materials. After a few years of \npractice, I became a proud yarn \u201csnob\u201d, using natural yarns exclusively,\n with a preference for naturally dyed yarns with high sheepy content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n graduated university with a BA in international law and languages, but \nsoonly realised that this path wasn\u2019t for me. I completed my studies \nknowing that I would not find a place working in a corporate job, and \ndecided to focus on what really mattered for me by following my dreams.\u003cbr\u003eI\n wake up every morning with the goal of owning a piece of land, \nsomewhere in rural France, where I\u2019ll be able to keep working with yarn \nand fiber while growing a vegetable garden, and share my journey and \nwork with this amazing online community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
