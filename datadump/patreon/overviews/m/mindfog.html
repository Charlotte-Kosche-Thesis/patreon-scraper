    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you, anyway?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just a guy from the woods and mountains of New Hampshire, now living in New York, who wanted to try to do something creative that had some sense of structure. This is my tribute to my favorite video game franchise of all time, Fallout, and to its creators at Bethesda Studios, to whom I am eternally grateful for giving me so many hours of happiness playing their games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.mindfog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/WritingDesk.jpg\" style=\"width: 312px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you doing this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always loved video games, and have always loved reading \"on the trail\" diaries from hikers - getting to explore places and even their own minds as they travel. I thought creating a Fallout diary would be a great way for me to become enthused about writing regularly. With the release of Fallout 4, I had no more excuses. I could start a game from scratch, discovering things along the way and writing about what I found, and what I thought.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOK, so WHAT is this exactly? A diary or a podcast?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s really an audio drama in the form of a \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/mindfog-a-fallout-4-diary/id1065322804?mt=2\u0026amp;ls=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epodcast\u003c/a\u003e that starts as a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mindfog.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog entry\u003c/a\u003e. I thought it would be a lot easier for folks to listen to a podcast rather than come to my site and read a whole blog entry. I figured if I put in-game music and sound effects to back up some of the story, it might be entertaining. I started at the beginning of December 2015, and to date, the podcast gets about ten times the attention as the blog, and I\u0027ve been VERY grateful that some podcast listeners have taken the time to give me some pretty touching and heartwarming reviews on iTunes and have donated enough to keep the site and podcast going, covering most of my expenses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.mindfog.com/patreonmultitrack.jpg\" style=\"width: 351px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eSo what do you need from me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing! My sincere hope is that you enjoy the diary/podcast. It takes a long time to do each episode (about ten hours to write and edit around 4000-5000 words, and then another ten to fifteen hours or so to record a 25-30 minute episode and add sound effects and music. But I\u0027m doing it to keep doing it, not for any financial reward. But if you do happen to\u00a0enjoy the tales of Commonwealth resident, Samuel J. Tannin, as he tries to find the people who killed his wife and took his son, and feel like sponsoring me on this project, I\u0027d love that too! If you prefer to make a one-time donation, there is a PayPal button on the website at www.mindfog.com. But rest assured, financial support will always be voluntary. I will never charge for access to this story, and I don\u0027t even advertise anything on the podcasts, not even for myself - no links, no promotions, nothing. That\u0027s a promise. MindFog is even created under a share-alike license which means you are free to download, copy and distribute the audio files all you like. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does the Patreon money go toward?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt costs about $200/year for hosting, templates and plugins. Anything above and beyond that will go into better equipment. Also, if you pick the CD reward, some of your own money goes toward making and mailing the CDs, \u003cem\u003ewhich contain \"Hi-Res\" versions of the audio files\u003c/em\u003e (full CD quality, not just mp3\u0027s put onto CD).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything else?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main hope is that you enjoy the diary and podcast, and maybe even chuckle to yourself when you read something that sounds familiar to your own playthroughs! Thanks to my Patreon supporters and those of you who have taken time out of your day to review my podcast on iTunes!"
