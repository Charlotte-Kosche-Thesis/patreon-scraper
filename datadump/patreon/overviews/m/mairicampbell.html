Writing songs, leading choirs, teaching fiddle, singing at folk clubs, playing for dancing, singing, encouraged to make music wherever and however I\u0027m asked.\u00a0Much of it is at a community level, local and grassroots engagement.\u00a0\u00a0My songs and music reflect my love of Scotland, this land, its energies and concerns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomething I\u0027m very excited about right now is my new one-woman show \u0027Mairi Campbell - Pulse\u0027, which is part of the Made in Scotland Showcase at the International Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2016. \u003cbr\u003e\u0027\u0027Consummate, visionary musicianship....Campbell opens her throat in a spirit of\nbelonging that is ancient and modern, and life-affirming for all of us.\" \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMary Brennan, Herald 2016\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to continue to work with my team and a growing community of creatives here in Scotland to create visionary shows that resonate for these times. That\u0027s a bit scary to write as there\u0027s no road path but then I\u0027m used to that. \u00a0 It\u0027s time to find new routes, fresh ways of connecting and bold steps into the unknown. \u00a0I\u0027m looking for walking partners, friends and backers...folk who want to see this work unfurl.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic won\u0027t let me go. There\u0027s some sort of \u0027work to be done\u0027 kinda vibe but it\u0027s a clear voice and lines up with my true desire, so I\u0027m going with it. \u00a0It says \u0027make art, dig in, keep singing and create a community of  creatives and have fun while you\u0027re doing it!\u0027\u00a0So that\u0027s what\u0027s happening. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA fabulous team has come together to organise, market and support this work leaving me to create art. And create I shall: songs, tunes, pictures, videos and resonant collaborations with other artists. You shall be the first to hear new work and unique offerings.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a new route for creatives and for you I hope it\u0027s stimulating, engaging, has an air of spontaneity and moments of deep quiet, when a song you got sent that morning hits you right in the heart...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support through Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can make enough money to support my family, but not enough to support a working team. So this is where you come in:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that allows you to directly support an independent Scottish artist. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging, you directly support my art and become part of a community linked by the love of my music, Scotland and Her music. Ancient and new.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can stop at any time, and set an upper limit per month. \u003cbr\u003eI will be sending out one, maximum two \u003cstrong\u003ethings\u003c/strong\u003e per month. When I send you a song, a \u003cstrong\u003ething\u003c/strong\u003e, then you pay me the amount you\u0027ve agreed to pledge.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in supporting me you can check out my different reward tiers.\u00a0From as little as $1 per \u003cstrong\u003ething\u003c/strong\u003e you\u0027ll receive exclusive Patreon offerings - new songs, tutorials and paintings and more...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting and I look forward to welcoming you into Campbell\u0027s Clan.\u003cbr\u003e"
