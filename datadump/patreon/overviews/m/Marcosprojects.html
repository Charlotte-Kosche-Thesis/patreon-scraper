Guitarist\u0027s, who would like to open their minds up to theory, and find a trick way to \"know what the pro\u0027s know\" about the music as it relates to the guitar.\u00a0\u00a0Guitarists that are at this stage are usually feeling \"stuck in a Pentatonic box\". To break through I hammered out a visual method, that cracks the code of the fretboard. And can help you grasp any aspect of Music Theory in a visual way.\u00a0 I want to share with this the world!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZRhCFBqlVBmx8gvLFCyV2g?view_as=subscriber\"\u003eDIY Guitar Kit\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e\"...

Check it out!If you know someone about to take a roadtest, please direct them to the channel!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhy support it? The more support I get here, will equate to getting to spend more time creating and editing instructional video\u0027s. Even a 5 minute video takes hours to make something look a little presentable... that can\u0027t happen without your input! So and little donation Help\u0027s!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd Finally, I\u0027ve taken a liking to the hobby of building and touring around on electric assisted bicycles.\u00a0 I have a Facebook page about it here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EbikingROC/\"\u003eEBiking ROC\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd a budding\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IBWkOviiEnPzyfGmOYg8g?view_as=subscriber\"\u003eYoutube channel:\u00a0 EBiking ROC\u003c/a\u003e I simply have 0 time for.\u00a0 If I was supported here to my goal, that would change.\u00a0 I would have time for weekly video updates involving trail exploration\u0027s.

If I was feeling daring I would take a shot with a random guess.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, sometimes you get lucky, but with guessing you mostly hit wrong notes and harmonies that didn\u0027t keep listeners interested or even hanging around, and worse yet... covering their ears and running away!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI desperately needed, like many of you to move beyond that point, \u00a0and started on my Real musical journey.\u00a0 So I dove head first into all that music theory you can find online. That jumble of information suited more for understanding theory in a classical orchestra sense....and not so focused on Blues Rocker Guitarists that yearn to be one of those players that can transform Riff\u0027s into MUSIC.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I trudged through it, and took a looooong 2 year journey using the Baby Step\u0027s method, to get myself up to speed...\u00a0 \u00a0And ever so slowly, an New Understanding took shape, and a new musical journey truly unfolded for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I found myself there.... I looked back at what I didn\u0027t know and put it together with the thing\u0027s that gave me the light-bulb moment\u0027s and I feel like I came up with a novel way to get novice riff player\u0027s up to speed with the Theory based information they need to know to begin their musical journey, that expand\u0027s your abilities greatly on your chosen stringed instrument of Riff Raff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis method is geared for Visual Learner\u0027s who wan\u0027t fast access into the field of music creation and theory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I hope your ready to be able to communicate with other musician\u0027s, watch other great\u00a0 Youtube Music Theory channels like \"Adam Neeley\" and \"Rick Beato\", and be able to follow along when they go deep!\u00a0 You\u0027ll enjoy being able to effectively Communicate musical idea\u0027s to that smallish music community of \"those in the know\".\u00a0 And be able to\u00a0Compose music that could have interest to a listener...\u00a0 And be able to Explore and Express your EMOTIONS in music!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eIn any key! With any other instrumentalists... Become a real \"Improviser\", master the mysterious \"Mode\u0027s\" once and for all...\u00a0 it\u0027s all No problem!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share this!\u00a0 \u00a0But I need your support for the time to create this amazing content, and to be able to constantly upgrade my video and recording equipment to get these video\u0027s looking and sounding professional.\u003cbr\u003eThis is where your support would transform this endeavor and take it to the next level. I\u0027m ready are you???\u00a0 \u00a0Support me and let\u0027s Rock!\u00a0 Even the tiniest amount will get you some membership perk\u0027s.\u00a0 Let\u0027s do this!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eOK, So whats this Patreon jazz? \u00a0How will being a \u0027Patreon\u0027 to my content help you be the best guitarist you can be??
