Dolsen, the founder of Mintster Monsters of Tumblr!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make a long story short, for as long as I can remember, my favorite thing to do has been to make people smile. \u003cbr\u003eLast year was the start of my Tumblr blog, MinsterMonsters! And in just a few short months, the following I\u0027ve gotten has been overwhelming, with so many of you telling me how much you love my writing and characters! It\u0027s been a great surprise, and I love that you all love my crazy ramblings so very much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to be able to do more in the future, including publishing ebooks (and possibly printed versions as well) and creating a monster dating sim with lots of different stories to play through. Depending on the goals I can reach here, I may be able to bring in help in the future, such as other writers and/or artists, which would help the production speed increase and get beta versions out much faster, as well as a finished product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also like to be able to make my giant monster plushies for a somewhat lower cost, but that won\u0027t be unless I reach a particular goal further along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got some big plans for the future, and I\u0027d love your help to accomplish them! After all, more monsters, more better, right?\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit helps, and it all goes toward making the world a more colorful, weird, and happy place."
