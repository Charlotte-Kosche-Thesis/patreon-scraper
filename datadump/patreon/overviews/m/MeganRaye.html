I just want to say thanks for visiting my Patreon page. By becoming a\npatron, you\u2019ll get to see all the behind the scenes in my studio, with all my prep work, work in progress photos, experiments, and final products. I\u2019ll also be taking you on a creative adventure\nwith different pursuits and mediums.  Who\nknows? Maybe you\u2019ll find something you want to try in the process. Art\nis an adventure, and everyone should be able to explore and enjoy it. Be a part of my community and we\u0027ll see what kind of mess we can get into\ntogether. lol\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://37295075-622779312974477958.preview.editmysite.com/uploads/3/7/2/9/37295075/editor/e0411d71dc2d2b69613c6e2d2004d500.png?1516407750\" style=\"width: 526px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI have so many goals I want to achieve this year, where do I begin? First and probably my biggest goal this year is to enter into local and regional Art Festivals/Craft Fairs. They require booth fees, jury fees, travel expenses, tables/display furniture, a large stock of prints, business cards, etc. Which can add up to $600 or more per show. That is where you can help! The second goal would be to get more comfortable with being on camera. So much content out there revolves around getting your face and your artwork in front of people on a more personal level. So this year I want to start making video blogs, Demos, and live Q\u0026amp;A sessions. Lastly, for fun, I want to take sewing lessons to learn more about costume making and also get into more digital drawing and painting. Big dreams have to start somewhere!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://37295075-622779312974477958.preview.editmysite.com/uploads/3/7/2/9/37295075/f97e54fa370b648bbbb6e14f3c1469a0_orig.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\tWho Are You?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHi!

Obviously, as a full-time artist, Most of my income is through selling my original artwork, through commissions. I am still fairly new to the art world so outreach and getting known is still a hurdle. Your pledges help me grow my audience and continue creating, whilst being able to pay my bills every month.
