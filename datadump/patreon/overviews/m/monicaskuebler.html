    "summary": "A couple years ago, I launched this Patreon in the hopes of turning my first novel, Bleeder, into an audiobook, then my life imploded in truly spectacular fashion, and I\u0027ve spent the long months between then and now figuring out what comes next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, it\u0027s not a Bleeder audiobook, though I\u0027d definitely still like to make one sometime in the nearish future. No, what comes first, what comes now, is a new focus on writing and creation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been doing for much of 2017. Being quiet, hiding behind my computer monitor, and writing fiction. But now it\u0027s time to pull up the blinds and let the sun (and the readers) back in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll that said, full disclosure: I\u0027m no longer employed full-time; consider me yet another of the countless victims of the great publishing world downsizing of the last half-dozen years. So now, I\u0027m just one of the many writer/editors trying to figure out this new \"gig economy\" we\u0027re living in. I feel like Patreon is part of that - or should be - because writing is my #1 favourite gig.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so that\u0027s what this Patreon will do: it will give you my words. From advance chapters of my about-to-resume serial, the Blood Magic Saga, to a monthly poem and semi-regular Q\u0026amp;As with horror authors, as well as various extras and curios from my writing-related adventures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are also some \"big\" perks for Patrons who may want to take advantage of my professional editing services (while supporting my ability to support myself writing) or would be interested in receiving a carefully curated reading list from me (after all, I have been Rue Morgue magazine\u0027s literary editor and resident book nerd for nearly fifteen years now).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyhow, thank you for reading this and thank you for funding my dream. I hope you enjoy the stories. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
