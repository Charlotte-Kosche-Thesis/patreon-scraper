You may be wondering why I\u0027ve started a Patreon rather than doing a kickstarter. Well the game isn\u0027t quite ready to have a kickstarter. If I\u0027m asking for a large lump sum of money I want people to see that the game is in a decent state of development. Far too many kickstarters are just concepts and I feel like people are becoming wary of those.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, what would you be funding if you choose to become a Patron? Well.... me... basically, my living costs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://monobraingames.com/AllTerrainVehicle.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHistory (why I need Patrons)\u003c/h2\u003eI\u0027ve had various jobs in my life, I\u0027ve been a web designer, video editor and for the past decade up until 2 years ago an Operations Manager with a legal and finance company. I\u0027ve wanted to make game for as long as I can remember and it was just something that I never got round to doing. Life got in the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was depressed and unhappy for the last few years of my previous job. I knew that I needed to do something with my life that my heart was in and at age 35 I felt that time was running out to get into development. So I started learning game development in my free time. I was putting together simple prototypes and getting a grasp of all the skills needed. Eventually on one particularly day I decided that I needed to quit my job and give game development my best shot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game has gone through various prototypes as I locked down the look, style and feel of the game. I\u0027ve been hard creating the various elements that will make development much faster in the future. I\u0027ve been working on the music and developing a style that I feel fits the look of the game. So the game is in a decent state but there\u0027s not much in the way of set pieces just yet to make a trailer that really wows people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://monobraingames.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/header2-1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAbout the game\u003c/h2\u003e\nThe game is a Sci-Fi Metroidvania style game. the game is set in 2182 and follows the story of John Servo, an ex soldier, as he explores a mystery terraforming moon to try and find his brother.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://monobraingames.com/RunBig2.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with most Metroidvania style games, you unlock new weaponry and skills throughout the game unlocking previously inaccessible areas and which allows you to continue your journey. There are 3 main factions within the game world and during Servo\u0027s journey he learns about the relationships between them as well as some startling information about himself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe game leans on lighting and emissive materials heavily to create a high contrast world with a unique style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently in the process of putting together some videos to showcase the various aspects of the game. I\u0027ll update this page with links as soon as they are done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://monobraingames.com/BossBattle1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading. If you want to help support the development please become a patron. I will be forever grateful to anyone that chooses to support me. My life has been this game for the past 2 years and with your help I know I can make something truly special. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://monobraingames.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-ProcessingDriodArea.jpg\"\u003e"
