We want to keep making more \ncontent like that - but to keep going we need your help.  We put time, \neffort, and money into making our videos and it turns out releasing them\n for free isn\u0027t super profitable.  Your support means we can keep \nworking full time on making more cool content for you.  And as our way \nof saying thank you we have a ton of special rewards just for our \npatrons"
