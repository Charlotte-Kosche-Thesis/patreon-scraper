We hope to minimize advertising in each issue, which is why we\u2019re asking for your support as a Patreon subscriber. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are we asking for money when this is a free publication? Not only do we want to minimize those ads, but the revenue from those ads barely covers the production costs \u2014 all of our writers and photographers are currently working for free. As much as we\u2019d like to perpetuate the myth of the starving artist, we have bills to pay and families to support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, we\u2019ll use the latte argument \u2014 for about the cost of a pumpkin spice latte, you\u2019ll be supporting our hard work. And you\u2019ll be keeping your weight under control, too! Maybe you can write this off as a healthcare expense\u2026 (just kidding, if you\u2019re a tax lawyer).\u003cbr\u003e"
