    "summary": "We\u0027re thrilled to be able to share our passion for roleplay (RP) with the Final Fantasy XIV and larger MMO / gaming community. We\u0027re asking for your help in funding the production efforts. In addition to the many hours of work that go into writing and producing our podcast, we also incur certain\u00a0monthly and capital expenses which, outside of donations, come from our own pockets.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe greatest cost we incur in producing the podcast is our time. We heavily emphasize quality over quantity. Between lore research, writing notes and scripts, recording, editing, content management, and marketing, it takes at \u003cem\u003eleast\u003c/em\u003e 15 hours of work to produce a 60-minute episode on a bi-weekly basis. As a team, Emi and Remix bring to the table all the necessary skills to produce the necessary audio and visual content. This is due to our respective educational and professional experiences in voice acting, public speaking, audio production, graphic design, and marketing. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur chief monetary expenses come from software. The largest of this is the monthly bill for Blubrry Podcast Hosting, with enough space and bandwidth to post 2 to 3 episodes per month. We also pay yearly for domain name registration. We purchased the intro and outro music from iStock Audio, and may occasionally purchase other stock music and sound effects. We use a\u00a0mix of free software (Audacity, Google Drive, Tumblr, etc.) and paid software legally licensed through school and business (ProTools, Adobe Creative Suite). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur chief capital expenses come from audio recording hardware. Emi uses her own professional audio setup, the cost of which we want to amortize due to increased use, as it is part of her livelihood. Remix uses a microphone, preamp, cables, headphones, and accessories bought second-hand.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we\u2019re able to break even on costs, we\u2019ll be able to use any additional funds to invest back in the show and the listener base. We can purchase contest giveaway prizes such as Mog Station items, game time cards, and merchandise. We may be able to purchase additional hardware equipment or software that would increase the quality or release speed of the show.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAny contribution, however small, will help us offset these costs and make sure we can continue to deliver high-quality audio content every time. We thank you in advance! \\o/"
