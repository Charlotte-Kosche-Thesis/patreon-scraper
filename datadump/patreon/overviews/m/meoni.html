None of them giving more than a few months contracted work at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is not a sob story, i don\u0027t want this to be a charitable thing at all. Life is what you make of it, you make your choices in life and you stick to them.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy escape from reality has and will always be my YouTube channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nSo i want to make it bigger, better and more helpful and entertaining to each and every one of\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nmy viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTime has passed by quite quickly since i started my YouTube journey, with many years of hard graft in real life i want to turn towards making my dream a reality, as appose to just the hobby it began as and still is to this day.\u003cbr\u003e\nYouTube has recently unveiled an incredibly unfair and frankly ridiculous advertising policy that can essentially render any work you create \"un-advertiser friendly\", which in laments terms essentially puts this big flag against you creating any Ad-revenue off of your creations.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis would be fine, had it not been that over the past year i have seen incredible growth on YouTube; the support has been overwhelming for the content i create for Final Fantasy 14 and ultimately you the viewing public enabled me to see that a glimmer of hope still remains for my projects.\u003cbr\u003e\nI would not usually think of creating such things as Patreon had it not been people asking if i had one, which until now had been replied with a simple \"no\" and a laugh out loud.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe fact remains however that a great deal of other content creators are finding success with less\u003cbr\u003e\ngrowth than my own through this service and when i look at my hopes for the future, they almost seem possible.\u003cbr\u003e\nI have stepped up my game, deciding to release videos DAILY, which at first was daunting, but now feels second nature. Be it, guides, reviews, customisation of characters, mounts or minions in Final Fantasy 14, I\u0027ve covered all aspects of the game as best to my ability.\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to continue to do this and push for much much more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WQarYEZ.png\"\u003eMy dream then is to dedicate myself to my content even more. I have put hours of time and money into my channel; previous giveaways, time i should of spent finding more work irl, time i should of been working elsewhere, but none of it can compare to the satisfaction of a video going live and the first few comments thanking me for making the video, or praising my work.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is then for this reason i give to you the possibility to support me further; to really help me push the limits of my creativity, to say goodbye to a \"real job\" and to do what i\u0027m passionate about.\u003cbr\u003e\nBroadcasting.\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to cover events far and wide and show you what they are really like first hand. I want to interview people from the industry behind the latest games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to cover the games i love and those YOU love with the quality and time they demand.\u003cbr\u003e\nEssentially to give back the time and money you give me back to you the only way i know how.\u003cbr\u003e\nTo cover everything i physically can to the best of my ability and in a timely manner, responding monthly with potential giveaways of in-game codes for the games i cover or other merchandise i may get my hands on from events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m fed up of having managers and bosses tell me what to do in the most demeaning ways imaginable, instead i give you the chance to be my bosses collectively and shape the content i create to your likeness.\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve always been a firm believer in community and to respect every single person who got you to every milestone, however small to others they may be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would genuinely appreciate any help you could give towards this goal and i will always be up for sharing ideas/collaborating with the community to try something new and exciting.\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the end of the day, i want to make as many people as possible happy by giving all my time to each and every project!\u003cbr\u003e\nIf that requires a system like this, then so be it! :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
