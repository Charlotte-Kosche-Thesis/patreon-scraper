I have passed my comprehensive exams, and am working to finalize my prospectus and then finish my dissertation, and you will help keep me motivated to do it! I\u0027ll be the first person in my family to earn a PhD, and it\u0027s something I\u0027ve put off a long time in my life in order to raise two children. Now is my time to meet this goal and reach this milestone! I hope to be finished by May 2018.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m one of two lead game designers for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://magischola.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNew World Magischola\u003c/a\u003e, a blockbuster larp set in a new magical universe for North America. NWM was written to test these principles of game design and seeks to develop a community culture and larp ethos around player autonomy, value, and consent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be working to turn my academic dissertation into a publishable manuscript that contributes to the literature about larp and roleplaying game theory. I\u0027ll also be working on making the writing accessible to a non-academic audience. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn between some more official posts on my work analyzing data and discussing rhetorical theory of fiction writing and game design, I\u0027ll be writing some informal posts that help develop my thinking -- and which will need comments and feedback from you, the readers! I may also write about being a female game designer, in general about larps I\u0027ve studied or attended, or principles I am chewing over. \u00a0There will be some New World Magischola developing content for patrons of a certain level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate your interest and support in these topics and in helping keep me motivated and on target!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to post about two times a month, because part of this gig is for YOU to help me stay on a schedule and to GET THIS DONE. So part of your support is to cheer me on in this huge endeavor! Thank you!"
