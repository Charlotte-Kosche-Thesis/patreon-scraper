    "summary": "Thank you for taking the time to check out the MichaelBtheGameGenie pareon page, whether you decide to pledge to me or not. And thank you for your\ncontinued support in watching and sharing my work!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy becoming my patron, you can have a direct impact on not\njust the quality of my videos but also which future videos I produce! Your\nsupport here helps keep me going, and also makes it easier for me to connect\nbetter with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is MichaelBtheGameGenie?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell, check out the video trailer above. That is me in a nutshell (remove obvious pantomime joke).\u00a0I\u00a0have been playing and collecting games since I was 7 years old and I am so thankful that youtube has given me\u00a0a medium to share my passion with all\u00a0of you. Every second week I try to post a video that is either a review on a game I love and feel has been overlooked, Video Game Nostalgia which is looking back on a gaming topic from my childhood and\u00a0reviewing a few games that fit that criteria or a retrospective Top 10 list.\u00a0\u00a0I try to put out the highest quality videos I\u00a0can and\nI\u0027m always looking for ways to make\u00a0them even better. There is always something new to learn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI love making these videos on youtube and wish that I had the time to do something every/day week but this is primarily a hobby for me and I have a demanding full time job, Wife with an even more demanding career and we have a beautiful 6 month old baby girl who has taken most of our time and attention. I have a hard time justifying to my wife the time and effort I put into making videos let alone the expenses to improve the quality of that content and this is where pareon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo why have I finally decided to add a Patreon Account?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell it\u0027s not to get rich and famous that\u0027s for sure! But the\nfirst thing you need to know is that\u00a0I\u0027m not going to put\u00a0videos behind a\npaywall. I am thankful enough that anyone would want to watch my videos and share my passion for gaming and by no means arrogant enough to feel I deserve anything for making these videos. You can\nstill watch them for free on Youtube. By donating you\u0027re basically helping me \nout and it is 100% optional. I don\u0027t really make anything from my youtube ad revenue so this is basically a passion project/ hobby for me. If there was some revenue coming in from the channel, I could justify to my wife the time, effort and expense that is going in to it.\u00a0So basically by becoming a Patron you\u0027re helping me\nout and you can cancel or change your donation amount at any time. Only become\na Patron if you truly feel comfortable with it and want to support\u00a0my videos\u00a0in\nthis way! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOK, but what is the real reason?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell, I have spent so much money on setting myself up to make youtube videos....Computers, Cameras, Lighting, Green Screen, Sound Equipment, Editing Software,\u00a0Capture Equipment\u00a0and the list goes on and on and that doesn\u0027t even take into account the time and effort involved. I am at a point in my life where I have other responsibilities such as my wife being home, we bought a house, had a beautiful baby girl and then had to evict our tenant from the apartment in our house. I\u0027m not asking for pity but an understanding that I no longer have the flexibility I used to either financially or with my time. Now when something breaks or I need to update/ replace something I do not have the expendable income to do this on my own and if there was some support from you guys, I would have an easier time keeping the show running and justifying to my wife the time I am putting into it. Maybe one day the channel will grow to the point where I get enough ad revenue to do so and I wont need to look for support from other avenues....here\u0027s hoping.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nSo what do I get if I pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTHANK YOU! I would be so happy if anyone was even willing to donate $1...I am amazed sometimes that so many people have watched me over the years. With your support I am hoping to get my channel to the point where I am constantly pumping out good and concise content for you on a weekly basis. Hopefully you would be satisfied with taking part in helping me get my content out for all to enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast but not least, don\u0027t feel any pressure to donate anything, only do this if you want to and can. I would be heartbroken to take money from someone who doesn\u0027t really have it to give. Just know that your consideration is more than enough and if you can\u0027t financially assist me in any way, there are other ways such\u00a0as doing as\u00a0little as watching and enjoying my stuff to sharing my videos and helping me get exposure. I appreciate everything you guys have ever done for me and looking forward to continuing to entertain you in any way I can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
