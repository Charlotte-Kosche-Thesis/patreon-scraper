Those that see my work, like it.\u00a0 \u00a0My problem is that I simply need more people to find out about it.\u00a0 In order to do that, I need higher, more consistent levels of marketing.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe modern digital publishing paradigm presents a fantastic opportunity for authors and readers alike.\u00a0 I mean, where else can you go and get a full length novel - several hours (maybe days) of entertainment for $2.99?\u00a0 I think that delivering quality, affordable, high-value entertainment like this is a worthwhile cause.\u00a0 Those of you who join me will help further this cause.\u00a0 You\u0027ll help me present more of my work to a bigger audience.\u00a0 In so doing, you will have my sincere thanks and you will receive the M.D. Grayson Patron\u0027s Newsletter.\u00a0 HIgher levels will recieve advance copies of my work in digital format, plus signed paperback and hardbacks.\u00a0 If I hit my goals, I\u0027ll add in merchandise from the M.D. Grayson store.\u00a0 (See the Rewards Section on the right for more details).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
