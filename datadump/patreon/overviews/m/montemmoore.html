    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my Patreon page for myself (Monte M. Moore) and my Art Attack series on youtube. \u00a0I\u0027m one of the those fortunate folks who knew what they wanted to do at a pretty young age and I relentlessly pursued those dreams of being a professional artist until the hard work and dedication paid off. \u00a0I\u0027ve been fortunate to have worked for great companies like Lucasfilm, DC Comics, Marvel Entertainment, Sony Online, Wizards of the Coast and so many others. \u00a0I LOVE getting to work on projects for Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Dungeons and Dragons, Magic the Gathering, Pin-up Art, Trading Cards and host of other awesome stuff! \u00a0There are lots of artists with great talent or skills who don\u0027t \u0027make it\u0027 in this industry which is now a global marketplace and is highly competitive, so I count myself as lucky that I\u0027ve positioned myself as a freelance illustrator, and I LOVE MY JOB! \u00a0But it is a job, and one that takes perseverance, business savvy, long long hours, world-wide travel and unwavering persistence. \u00a0I mean as an artist who wouldn\u0027t want to draw beautiful women, dragons and magical heroic scenes! \u00a0It\u0027s a dream come true to get to do this stuff! \u00a0But the downside is you often have to deal with unrealistic deadlines and expectations, clients who don\u0027t pay their bill or publish their projects and a host of other pitfalls which an artist has to avoid. \u00a0Don\u0027t get me wrong, I love the fact I\u0027ve met legions of awesome fans in conventions all around the world, but it can be a very competitive business at times. \u00a0 If you aren\u0027t familiar with my work, then please check out www.mavarts.com where you can see art I\u0027ve created for sculptures, comic book covers, prints, art books and so much more. \u00a0Along the way I\u0027ve won the World Fantasy Art Show twice for Best Black and White Art, and had my work seen in Spectrum and many other well-respected publications. \u00a0 I\u0027m also a bit unique in the industry, in that I also put my art skills to good use custom painting one of a kind images on motorcycles, cars and even airplanes, so please check out www.maverickcustompaint.com to see those creations. \u00a0One more thing about me I think you should know, I love and respect the Renaissance Art period and the Old Masters, whose work is still unsurpassed in sculpture, painting and architecture to this day. \u00a0One of the things that was great about that era was the Art Patrons like the Medici Family of Florence Italy, and how they supported great artists like Michelangelo and Donatello (not the Ninja Turtles guys) in the creation of their art. \u00a0The Medici were responsible for helping these great artists be able to pursue their passion for art, and the great thing about Patreon is that it puts YOU in the same position in being able to support artists and the art they are passionate about. \u00a0Even though I\u0027ve been in the business over half my life, I feel like I have so much more to learn, create and share, so if you would like to be a part of that journey and support those efforts, then I would truly be grateful and count you as a friend and a True Supporter of the Arts. \u00a0- Thank you and remember - eARTh without ART is just...eh...\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m a 25 year veteran of the comics, gaming, pin-up and fantasy art industries and have worked for some amazing companies like Lucasfilm, Topps, DC Comics, Marvel Entertainment, Sony Online and many others! \u00a0I count myself as one of those fortunate folks who really LOVE THEIR JOB, and yes it is a job and it takes decades of hard work, travel and promotion to make it in this awesome but highly competitive industry. \u00a0 I\u0027ve met legions of great fans in many countries where I\u0027ve attended conventions as a guest or an exhibitor, and that is one of my favorite parts about being a professional artist. \u00a0 But I also love the fact I can \u0027create\u0027 something from nothing, and that is the \u0027magical\u0027 part about creating art. \u00a0Along the way my art has appeared in Spectrum, been on dozens of covers for comic books, novels, games and more, and even won the World Fantasy Art Show twice for my pencil art for Best Black and White art. \u00a0I\u0027ve also enjoyed designing over 80 fantasy sculptures that are available on my www.maverickarts.com website and also a wide variety of prints, play mats, gaming products, art books and more. \u00a0I\u0027m also a big fan of the Renaissance art, and think the Old Masters are surpassed by none. \u00a0One of the unique things about that era, was the fact that there were great art Patrons like the Medici family of Florence Italy who supported great artists like Michelangelo and Donatello (not the Ninja Turtles, the artists :). Patreon is an opportunity for us to carry on those traditions and support the Arts and those who toil (often in obscurity) to create beautiful things in the world. \u00a0My goal is to continue to create new and challenging illustrations, paintings, sculptures and more, and if you would like to help me in that endeavor, I would truly be grateful. \u00a0Thanks for checking out my Patreon Page, and remember -- \"eARTh without Art is just eh...\"",
