    "summary": "Hello, I create 3D art and photo sets of \u003cem\u003eglamorous female peril\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s that? \u00a0Well, if you were ever a fan of the scary scenes on TV where everything goes wrong for the plucky heroine and she gets captured, this is the place for you. If your favourite bit in Dr Who is where his assistant wanders off on her own, you\u0027re on the right track. If you read Nancy Drew books, and secretly enjoyed the bits where she gets knocked out and tied up, make yourself at home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t seen it already, do check out my free page \u003ca href=\"http://torqual3d.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://torqual3d.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e where you can meet my original characters: Amanda Jones the amateur sleuth, Ciara Nightingale the hapless archaeologist and Penelope D\u0027Arcy, the novice spy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why make a Patreon account? \u00a0Well, 3D art costs me money to make (on 3D content). Photography likewise costs money as models aren\u0027t free either. So, like many creators I am thinking it would be really nice if it both actually generated some income! This in turn helps me to devote more time and money to better work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if there\u0027s already the free site on deviantART - why subscribe here? Well, only a small fraction of what I create makes it onto deviantART. \u00a0It\u0027s an art site, so only finished \u0027art quality\u0027 pieces get uploaded. \u00a0And, because it\u0027s a public site, uploads stay within... certain limits. \u00a0Also, in the case of photo sets, I just can\u0027t bring myself to share any more original, exclusive and expensive (to me) photo sets on there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMoreTorqual3D\u003c/strong\u003e is a chance for me to share what is normally never seen. This means often unfinished pictures, some of a more adult nature, and with less self-imposed restrictions on say nudity or violence.\u00a0There is also work I\u0027ve held back over the years because, after time or money invested, it honestly didn\u0027t feel right to just throw it all on a free site. \u00a0This includes commissions that I scripted and bought from talented photographers and artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnowing what to charge was difficult, so I have borrowed the tier pricing from a leading coffee retailer. \u00a0The basic idea is that this is a club where, if you can afford to buy me a coffee per month, I will share all my art with you. \u00a0Therefore the membership tiers are named and priced after different sizes of cup. I hope you will join me in the club and find a size that works for you!"
