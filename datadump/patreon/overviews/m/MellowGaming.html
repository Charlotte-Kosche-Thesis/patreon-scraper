    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Ant and this is the Patreon page where you can support me creating a video series called \u003cstrong\u003eMellow Gaming Recommends\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what is that? Well, the channel \u003cstrong\u003eMellow Gaming\u003c/strong\u003e has been around for a few years now and has almost entirely been let\u0027s play focused. It wasn\u0027t always meant to be though. If you go searching through the channel you\u0027ll find some super old videos called Retro-Perspectives. They were bad. Please don\u0027t go looking for them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust over a year ago I got thinking about bringing back the review format with all that I had learned about editing since then. I settled on the imaginative name of \u003cstrong\u003eMellow Gaming Recommends\u003c/strong\u003e, and launched the first episode which was all about an obscure Konami SNES game based on the Biker Mice From Mars cartoon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then I\u0027ve covered (at the time of writing this) Assault Android Cactus, Astro Boy Omega Factor, HeroQuest, the works of Terry Cavanagh and Missile Cards. I try to pick games that haven\u0027t been covered a million times before and, one day, hope to bring in a few youtuber buddies to share their favourite games too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I can start improving these videos more and more. I could have proper lighting provided by lamps and not the sun, which bleaches my face bad. I could record on a camera I\u0027m not borrowing from a friend at great inconvenience to him. I could employ green screen for some better presentation or maybe get more ambitious with shooting on camera elements. The sky is possibly the limit, but not beyond that. beyond the sky is dangerous and cold.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why not have a look at some of my videos which you can check out in the handy playlist I\u0027ll link below, see how they\u0027ve improved to get an idea of how much further they could go, and maybe consider backing me here on patreon. Even if you back me for just $1 it will be greatly appreciated. Also, i don\u0027t plan on locking anything out to higher tiered backers just yet. You back at $1 and you\u0027ll get everything. Previews of up coming episodes, access to the Mellow Gaming Discord group, a thanks in the credits (Note to self: Start making credits) and any other rewards we may come up with. I\u0027ll be asking you guys regularly for feedback for sure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, thanks for reading, have a look at a few episodes and tell me what you think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"height: 0;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQK1cVdw5P1ih7NGHys65GvJfU-kkmIY7\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMellow Gaming Recommends The Playlist\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
