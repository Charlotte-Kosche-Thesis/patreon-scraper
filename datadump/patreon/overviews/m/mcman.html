    "summary": "WELCOME!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter 10 years of living in East County in San Diego, in late Jan 2017, I hit the open road. The idea entered into my head about a week after recovering from heart surgery in July, 2016. When my cardiologist asked if I had any questions, I replied, \"Only philosophical ones.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTen months, 30 states, and 13,000 miles later, sleeping mostly in my tent in the wild, I arrived back where I started. Ten days after arrival, I headed back out. If there are answers, I will find them on the road. In the meantime, I\u0027m asking questions. Welcome to my journey ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you may know of me as the award-winning  expert patient who writes on depression and bipolar disorder. My near-death experience has taken my writing in a new direction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY, HEALING AND CONNECTION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter being out on the road for more than a year, I now know that I was born to write this book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWE\u0027RE IN IT TOGETHER\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy heart should have stopped beating back in 2016. But here I am. Maybe that\u0027s what this journey is about - to question why I\u0027m still here. You are with me on that journey. Maybe you have been following me since 1999, when I first started writing about mental health. Maybe you are a new boon companion, looking for answers, asking similar questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy signing on as a patron, you will supporting me in my journey, and will be part of the creative process. For those who have supported me here at Patreon and continue to support me, a heartfelt thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy journey remains a leap of faith into the unknown. But I am not alone. You are with me on the adventure of a lifetime ... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOH, BY THE WAY\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case your wondering what I\u0027m doing in the top picture, I am playing the didgeridoo on Ryan Mountain in Joshua Tree National Park, my first stop on my journey. The instrument is a large part of who I am, and informs me in my healing and creativity and other areas of my life. It\u0027s a long story, and I\u0027m looking forward to sharing it with you.\u003cbr\u003e"

Since 1999, I have assisted untold thousands in their recovery from depression and bipolar disorder via my \"expert patient\" information in blogs, in website articles, in videos, and in books. For fun, I also self-published two novels. Now, in the wake of my recovery from heart surgery, my writing has taken on a whole new dimension. Life just got interesting ...",
