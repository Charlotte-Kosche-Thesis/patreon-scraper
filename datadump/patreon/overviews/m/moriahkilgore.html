I am truing my love for reading and desire to learn into a program that helps connects readers and their favorite authors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis program is also to give authors a chance to mentor writers without having to teach a class. I say this as I am currently working on my first manuscript myself and I know I have much to learn.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBooks have played a important roll for me growing up. My parents separted when I was young and while my father moved on to his next military station, the rest of my family and I stayed on a small Air-Force base in England. Where I went to school as the only American. Though I had my fair share of tough times books gave me a way to escape my woes and enjoy amzing worlds created by authors. The fact that books had that affect on me was always magical to me. I hope is to write a book that has the same power to for some one who needs it.\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e",
