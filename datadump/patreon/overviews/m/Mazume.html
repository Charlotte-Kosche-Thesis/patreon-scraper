If you\u0027re reading this though, chances are you already knew all that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/CAGpKqL.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the reason I signed up for Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, without going into too much detail, I set this page up in hopes of relieving some financial problems I\u0027ve been having. The main purpose of this Patreon is to help pay back debt that built up back in 2016 and since I\u0027m still struggling with money, failing to find long-term employment, I\u0027m hoping that Patreon will be a way to at least keep things from getting worse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Pateon is basically a tip jar that helps me to be able to continue what I do. Everything earned here helps towards rent, utility bills and the aforementioned debts, so every little bit helps. If you would like to commission me directly, check out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mazu-meh.tumblr.com/commissions\"\u003ecommissions page on Tumblr\u003c/a\u003e for more information. For examples of what I do, check out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mazume.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=/\"\u003eDeviantArt gallery\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mazu-meh.tumblr.com/tagged/mazudraw\"\u003eTumblr art blog\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I post here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the time being, I will be posting collections of any art that I\u0027ve done throughout the month. This is basically a monthly \"scrapbook\" witch includes sketches, doodles, and previews of stuff I\u0027m working on (WIPs) that I wouldn\u0027t otherwise post online. You can expect to see a lot of my catgirl characters in these, as well as character concepts and whatever else I end drawing, including silly doodles and the odd gesture sketch.\u00a0I will also be posting full resolution image collections of finished art and source files for certain drawings and animations one a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future, I would like to have animation and comic previews posted here, if/when I get those bigger projects going as well as maybe monthly patron voted art,\u00a0although I\u0027ll only be able to commit to these once I\u0027ve lightened my current backlog of commission work as well as life not getting in the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support,\u00a0I will be able to keep on doing what I love to do and I hope that what I can offer in return is to everyone\u0027s liking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith all that said, thank you for your time and thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Fjd0WeF.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
