I\u0027m returning to Twitch in full force to provide entertainment, edutainment (electronics and more!), and a view into the crazy industry that I\u0027m a part of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you know, I work for Twitch. I\u0027m a community manager of sorts (although my title is vague, my workload is large). I get the chance to travel and be a part of some of the most amazing projects, and I want to take you guys a long for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelping to support me here on Patreon means that I can buy more equipment, purchase more broken down consoles to fix, and breathe a little easier knowing that I have some spare pocket change to spend on making great content for you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided not to do rewards or anything of the sort, to be perfectly honest I don\u0027t have the time to take on that kind of responsibility. It would be nothing but hollow promises, and I\u0027m not about that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you decide to toss a few dollars my way, thank you! If not, that\u0027s okay! Every little bit helps, and I\u0027ll never be upset if you find something better than me to spend your money on :]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks all!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTwitch:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/flamegoat\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.twitch.tv/flamegoat\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003eYouTube: \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/mrflamegoat\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/c/mrflamegoat\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTwitter: \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/mrflamegoat\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.twitter.com/mrflamegoat\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
