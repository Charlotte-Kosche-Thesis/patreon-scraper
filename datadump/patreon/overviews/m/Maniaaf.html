My pen-name is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mcstories.com/Authors/Mania.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMania\u003c/a\u003e and I write erotic short stories hosted over on Simon Bar Sinister\u0027s wonderful website:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mcstories.com/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Erotic Mind-Control Story Archive\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an aspiring writer, I work for free and it shows. There are long delays in production where a story might circle, lost in the woods of a dozen revisions. In the end, while I take what I do with unaffected stone-faced self-seriousness, there is not a single short story of mine that I wouldn\u0027t change. Just to remove double negatives and the like. Fasten the belts, quicken the timing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI agonize over my works. I try to make them the best they can possibly be. I may very well go to my grave having never topped\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mcstories.com/WeddingBelles/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWedding Belles\u003c/a\u003e. That story is perfect. It\u0027s a ridiculous premise told by some real-ass people dealing with real-ass problems. My porn is going to educate you and get you off at the same time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m into rampant pan-sexuality. It\u0027s for everyone. Each story tries to escape the gravity of my own prejudice and explore the outer-space regions of what\u0027s \u003cem\u003enormal\u003c/em\u003e. My work ends up at a \"Mind-Control\" fetish website, but I have real problems writing a story in which glamorizes coercion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMind Control is the basis of a central confusion that obfuscates the real world from the characters of the story. When you start digging into what\u0027s actually real and how do you know?Our real world is built out of so much \u003cem\u003efiction\u003c/em\u003e it\u0027s not hard to blur the lines. Especially when sex is involved.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why donate, why \u003cem\u003epay\u003c/em\u003e, why become a \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou ask good questions, have you thought of a career in nosy-busybodies? When I write a story, it\u0027s powered by two engines. One is some element that I find arousing, this is pornography after all. The other engine is a political or social idea which the characters can meditate over.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mcstories.com/FuckTheMonarchy/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFuck The Monarchy\u003c/a\u003e, my first completed story, was absolutely written in response to the way people were treating the birth of a new monarch and how much that rankled me. I had to create this story as an outlet for my feelings. I am very much Gary Marshal and to write that story I had to research so I could be Emily too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s the kind of shit you\u0027re paying for here. A guy that does \u003cem\u003eresearch\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0for his erotic socio-political fiction. \u003c/strong\u003eI try to make my stories for everyone. I\u0027m not into disempowered women or abusers that try to circumvent consent with slight-of-hand. I\u0027m into people that break taboos around sex and fucking because they are so insanely, hopelessly, aroused that they would rather go ride dicks than pay their mortgage. Crazy right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have not read my works, I\u0027m frankly astonished that you would have ever made it here. Who are you? What kind of raving lunatic would ever get here \u003cem\u003eNOT\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0having read my stories. To anyone who has not yet been indoctrinated, know that you are a huge weirdo and your opinions are probably invalid.

Even if I wanted to support this author with some small donation, there are no goals, or thresholds or funding targets that provide any real incentive here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy is that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, the short answer is because I already have a full-time job. This is not me trying to break into the world of full-time writing. This is me trying to jangle my tin cup at internet passerbys. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to give me some money, great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf not, please read my stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf not even that, then \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ewhat the fuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e Open your mind a little.

For example, Chapter 4 of perfectly normal hospital is going to be about 4500 words. However, in writing those 4,500 words, there exist 6 separate drafts of this chapter\u00a0totaling\u00a0almost 23,000 words. These drafts include alternate endings, nixed conversations with the doctor, and other scenarios which all take the character of Brittney Fields in radically different directions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGood Writing is Re-Writing\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think I came away with the best version but . . . I don\u0027t know about you and how you write things - but my first drafts are freakish and raw. Hard iron takes refinement. Separate the wheat from the chaff.
