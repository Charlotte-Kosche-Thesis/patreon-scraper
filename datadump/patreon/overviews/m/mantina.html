    "summary": "Hello people!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re reading this, thank you! I have a lot of projects to do, from daily speedpaints to animations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. DAILY SPEEDPAINTS\u003cbr\u003eI want to do a speedpaint or sketch (30-40 minutes) every day. This will improve my art and my drawing style. Everyone can see these works, you have just to follow me without support. You can suggest me a subject and I will decide if I will draw it with the next speedpaint.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. ILLUSTRATIONS\u003cbr\u003eI will transform to illustrations my best daily speedpaints. You can suggest me which daily speedpaint do you like most, and I will choose it to make an illustration. Everyone can see the illustrations, but only who support me can download the high resolution file.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. HOW TO | TUTORIALS\u003cbr\u003eOnly if you support me, you can see video tutorials and making of.\u003cbr\u003eI will record my speedpaints and I will post the making of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. ANIMATIONS\u003cbr\u003eI think patreon would be a great opportunity for me.\u003cbr\u003eI have a project to carry on, but It\u0027s very hard to realize it without funds.\u003cbr\u003eThe video that I have uploaded here is my last animation: I\u0027ve realized it working alone, for a whole year, without funds, in a period in which it was difficult for me to buy also some food. I used poor materials and cheap methods, but I completed my project despite to the huge difficulties.\u003cbr\u003eI like to combine phisical and digital 3D because I\u0027d like to apply a theory of cosmopolitism to animation: different things and people can be combined together and live in peace.\u003cbr\u003eNow I have an other project, but I can\u0027t make it without funds. I\u0027d like to realize a project about the fear of the unknown, the dark, the night, but I want to mantain a magical and curious atmosphere. I want to realize a short animation\u00a0more complex\u00a0than my last work. I\u0027d like to use a rig for the stop motion puppet, latex and professional clay. And, above all, I want to pay some collaborators for the composition of the music and the help for the render and the stop motion.\u003cbr\u003eI will public soon some concepts and more detailed ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to everybody who supports me, both with funds or simply following my work.\u003cbr\u003eKind Regards,\u003cbr\u003eValeria Degli Agostini | Mantina\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Mantina is my nickname on the web. My real name is Valeria Degli Agostini.\u003cbr\u003eI was born in 1989 in Padova. Since I have memory, I\u2019ve always drawn. When I was 9 I started drawing comics, when I was 11 I said: \u201cI want to be an animator\u201d. Ok ok, when I was 9 I said also \u201cI want to save the world\u201d, but it doesn\u2019t matter!\u003cbr\u003eIn 2008 I graduated in an Experimental Artistic High School \u201cA. Modigliani\u201d, Padova, where I\u2019ve studied architecture, Painting and Polymer clay modeling. During high school I studied by myself Adobe Photoshop and I started to paint in digital, with the mouse. At the same time I tried to animate in \u201cstraight ahead\u201d, I wanted to reproduce a fragment of an hip hop choreography in traditional animation.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2009 I started an animation course at Nemo NT Academy in Florence, but I stopped after the first year. I stopped because I was very demoralized, I\u2019ve always been working hard for a job that doesn\u2019t exist in Italy. People everywhere discouraged me, and at the end, when you have the obligation to grow up and assume your responsability, you have to give up to your dreams and to learn a \u201ctrue job\u201d.\u003cbr\u003eSo, I stopped drawing.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I continued study animation. In 2010 I obtained an Autodesk Character Certificate at Big Rock School in Treviso. I learnt 3D computer Graphics, from modeling, rigging, animating, to rendering and post producing. I was enthusiastic.\u003cbr\u003eThen, I tried to work. I found a job as graphic designer for slot machines. I was lucky to find a job, and also a job which permitted me to draw and to animate. But I didn\u2019t agree with the ethics of my new job. Moreover I was curious and tireless, I was feeling incomplete. I was able to do a lot of things, but I didn\u2019t own theorical thinking. I was only an empty instrument.\u003cbr\u003eSo, in 2011 I started university. Visual and performing Arts at IUAV, Venice.\u00a0I\u2019ve studied a lot and I\u2019ve discovered that I\u2019m keen on anthropology. I started again to draw, because I was suffering, I\u2019ve understood that drawing is part of me.\u003cbr\u003eNow I have realized a short animation called \"The Pearl Under Giants\u0027 Furrows\", I\u0027m very happy! :D\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot of project to do. I want to realize an other animation and a web comic that I have been planning from a lot of years.",
