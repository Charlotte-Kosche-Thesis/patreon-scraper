    "summary": "Mission Outdoors was created in 2015 by myself, David Enstad, shortly after leaving the military. Being a multi tour combat veteran who just so happens to really love the outdoors and filming my own outdoor adventures, I quickly transitioned over and started mentoring and filming hunting and fishing adventures of other military veterans and youth who are either new too the sport, or just having a hard time finding other veterans with the same interests. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of forming a 501c3 company like many of the other groups often do, I decided to do things on my own and out of my own pocket. Call it pride, or just craziness, but I just feel that when it comes from the heart and with zero expectations of pay from any of the vets or kids I take out on their adventures, I just plain feel better about it all as a person.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately however I\u0027m starting to find out it\u0027s not my pockets are just not as deep as I\u0027d like for them too be, and it\u0027s getting harder and harder to be able to maintain or buy new equipment, or pay for some of the classes that will make me a better videographer, which ultimately will benefit the veterans and youth who are being filmed on their adventures. I\u0027m hoping that this patreon account will afford me the opportunities to continue doing what I love, while also assisting me in expanding my efforts as time and resources allow."
