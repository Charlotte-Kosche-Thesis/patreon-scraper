However, when we started this podcast in 2017, we put our own money into it and while that has served us well and created the show that you (hopefully) listen to and love, we want to do more. But we can\u0027t do more without YOUR help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging to support Mistconceptions, you will help us pay website hosting fees, buy upgraded equipment, give paychecks to our cast, and eventually make this podcast a full-time job. And if you pledge your support, there are some pretty neat things in it for you, too. You know, besides keeping this wonderful podcast afloat. So, come along and help us in our endeavor to make Mistconceptions even better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(For pledge tiers with physical rewards, please allow three (3) months from placing your pledge to allow time for us to print, get, and eventually ship your physical rewards.)\u00a0"
