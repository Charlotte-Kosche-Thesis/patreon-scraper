I\u0027m finishing my senior year of art school without worrying so much about whether I can afford paint or food. The more patrons I have, the more security I have, the more art I can create without feeling I have to hustle and bustle to survive...!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m looking to resume normal drawing activities, which means that I\u0027ll be bringing my \"Secret Art Stash\" paysite content to Patreon, versus the conventional paysite. So patrons can expect I\u0027ll be giving them exclusive raunchy art, stories, comics, and more! Any people who don\u0027t want to be a patron can buy most of my content via my online download shop."
