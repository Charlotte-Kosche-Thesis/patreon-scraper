To be completely honest, I started posting videos because I was bored and wanted something to do. Now we\u0027re at 235k subscribers, and I\u0027m having a great time creating educational/comedic content. \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 style=\"color: #ff3333;\"\u003eWhy Do I Do This?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"color: #666666;\"\u003e\n\tSomehow, after all the, tedious work and painful debugging sessions, I still love to program. A lot of software developers experience something called the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOverjustification Effect\u003c/a\u003e. Programmers start out just coding for fun, but as soon as they get a job programming, they experience a huge drop in passion for the craft, and I\u0027m no different. To regain my enjoyment for programming, I started taking on stupid, personal projects. It worked amazingly well, I wasn\u0027t trying to make anything useful, or appease any managers, I just made things. Eventually, I wanted to share my creations, so (in combination with crushing boredom), I started my \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtHaxi4GTYDpJgMSGy7AeSw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"color: #666666;\"\u003e\n\tI also think that learning to code is incredibly important. A lot of software videos/ tutorials are monotone and boring, so it\u0027s a lot harder to get excited about programming. I really hope to inspire people to program with a mix of stupid creations and comedy.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 style=\"color: #ff3333;\"\u003eSo Why am I on Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"color: #666666;\"\u003e\n\tI just want to make more shit, more often. I\u0027ve got a 9 to 5 job to support myself, and I\u0027d love to supplement some of those hours in favor of making more videos. Your Patreon donations will allow me to create bigger projects, more often. Thank you for considering supporting me.\u003c/div\u003e"
