    "summary": "I am writing essays to introduce Shinto, the native religious tradition of Japan, to an English-speaking audience. Your patronage will enable me to spend more time researching and writing the essays.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach essay will be about 5,000 words long, and most will cover a single topic. I am not writing to convert people to Shinto, but rather for people who are interested in learning more about a diverse tradition with well over a thousand years of history. The essays supported by this Patreon will be as objective as I can make them, describing the way Shinto is and has been practised.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons get one essay, a general introduction to Shinto, when they sign up. I will not release more than one essay per month as a paid item, and I do not guarantee to have one every month until the $300 goal is reached. Once that goal is reached, I plan to switch to monthly payments. You can also set a monthly limit to your support to ensure that I cannot charge you for more than one essay per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tangible contents (insofar as electronic publications are tangible) of the $1 and $2 rewards are the same, as are those of the $5 and $10 rewards. The higher cost rewards exist for people who would like to further support the writing of these essays, so the additional thanks are entirely genuine, if hard to measure exactly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons get all the essays published during the time they are supporting the Patreon, but it is possible to get essays that you missed: the details are on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.mimusubi.com/patreon-essay-back-numbers/\"\u003eMimusubi website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAbout the Author\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am David Chart. I am a Japanese citizen, although I was born in the UK, and have lived in Japan with my Japanese wife and daughter for over a decade. I have practised Shinto for most of the time I have been in Japan, and the header photo is of my local jinja at New Year. I have also passed the highest level of the Shinto exam for lay people set by the largest Shinto organisation in Japan. If you are interested in my personal take on Shinto, I will post occasional pieces on the \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.mimusubi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMimusubi website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
