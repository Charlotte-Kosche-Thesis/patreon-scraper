I started out doing game reviews for a small independent site then moved onto streaming on Twitch with another small group and have recently branched out on my own. I play any number of games and also do a lot of Magic the Gathering/Board game related streams. If you are here, you are here because you may have an interest in some of these topics. Check out my Youtube and Twitch channels for some of the content I put together."
