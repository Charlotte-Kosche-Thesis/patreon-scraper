    "summary": "Hey Kids!\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Maki. You may know me from comics Boxplot and Sufficiently Remarkable. Or maybe you just saw me on Penny Arcade\u2019s Strip Search.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in 2013, I decided to quit my day job and go freelance. It was easily the most important decision of my life. But being a freelancer is tough. Going from gig to gig is exciting, but it doesn\u2019t leave much time for personal or experimental works.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter Strip Search, I crowd funded my newest comic, Sufficiently Remarkable, and it went really well. But I can\u0027t say I wasn\u0027t burned a bit by the process. Fulfilling a crowd-funding campaign is a lot of work, and I made some big mistakes along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I found Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon makes more sense for creatives like me who regularly produce work. It also makes more sense for you, the patron, as you\u0027ll have a lot more control over how much you give. Instead of making a big donation to an upcoming project, you can make smaller contributions on a monthly basis. You can also set up a budget so that you never pay more than you\u0027re comfortable paying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions would not only support Boxplot and Sufficiently Remarkable, but they would also go towards drawing those extra ideas I\u0027ve had swimming around in my head. They\u0027ll also\u00a0help me stop worrying about paying bills, and instead worry about how I\u0027m going to cram all these comic ideas onto pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, you\u0027ll have not only my eternal gratitude, but a look behind the curtain at what I\u0027m working on and maybe some extra goodies down the line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
