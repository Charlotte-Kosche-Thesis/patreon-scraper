Since I currently film with mainly natural light I\u0027m at the whim of the clouds and weather and can only get good footage during certain times of the day.\u003cbr\u003eReaching this goal means I will get a light and a lens better for low-light situations. This will not only improve the quality of the videos but will give me more freedom to film at different times of the day and greatly\u00a0reduce the time I currently spend color correcting and adjusting lighting.",
