    "summary": "Why hello and welcome to Marshmallow Machete\u0027s new erm Patreon page!! Wohoo!! To be perfectly honest I\u0027m weirded out by the whole donation thing so I\u0027ll do the best I can here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have channels on Youtube,Twitch and Vidme where I do let\u0027s plays, the occasional gaming music videos and have recently ventured into game reviews and my new \u0027Marsh Plays the Porn Games\u0027 series where I play silly adult themed games and basically make fun of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am primarily a video creator but have done some streaming here and there and would like to make this a more regular thing in the future if there is a demand for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t set this page up to beg for money for a PC or upgrades, I clearly have a PC or I wouldn\u0027t be doing any of this in the first place. At the moment I am not making any money from any of the platforms I am putting content out on, because of this obviously I have restrictions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few examples of the restrictions I have currently:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy let\u0027s plays are limited to 720p\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI can only play PC games at the moment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI am not able to play AAA/expensive games very often\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAny series that I create will not have green screen and cam will also be in 720p with poor lighting.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThis doesn\u0027t particularly bother me personally as I absolutely love making videos and am used to working with restrictions.\u00a0 I love doing what I do and engaging with the gaming community and will always do the best I can with what I\u0027ve got. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why the hell have I set this up?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell I\u0027ve set this up mainly for you guys and that sounds cheesy but that\u0027s the truth of it.\u00a0 It\u0027s for you guys to tell me what you want, support me if you want to and help me produce the content that you want to see.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e if you would like me to play console games your support would mean that I am able to provide that content, tailored content for you that you want to see.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u00a0If you would like me to stream more then funding would help me turn this more into a full time job and I would have more time in the day to provide live streams for you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you aren\u0027t happy with the quality of some of my content and would like me to improve it then your help and support would mean I could do so.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you just want to support me and keep the channel going, that\u0027s what this is here for.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eI do want to continue making bigger and better content, venturing more into other things such as reviews, weird indie game episodes and possibly weekly live streams.\u00a0 I want to keep improving and providing quality entertainment for you and am going to continue to do so as long as I can regardless, but with your help and support, no matter what the amount, we can do this together and faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have set up a couple of simple goals to start with as to be honest I really don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing but I will be working on rewards schemes in the future, hopefully with the help of patrons so that you get exactly what you want and not some crappy reward that you don\u0027t care about.\u00a0 They will be simple as I do want my content to be available to everyone but possibly exclusive videos/early bird viewing schemes, adding credits to my videos with your name in them.\u00a0 I don\u0027t know feel free to message me your ideas! Maybe I\u0027ll make some Marshmallow Machete t shirts...who knows??!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading......if you got this far....erm.....well done....here\u0027s a gold medal!! I don\u0027t have one, it\u0027s imaginary but seriously I appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks Everyone!! :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
