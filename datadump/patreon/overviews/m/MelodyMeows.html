You can also find me on \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Melody_Meows\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter @Melody_Meows\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nWhy should you give me any money? Well, to be honest, I\u2019m\nnot sure. There are many other people in gaming who both deserve it more and\nneed it more (some of them are listed on the left column on my blog) and there\nare many other causes far more important than gaming that need funding. I\u2019m\naware of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, I like to imagine that someone, somewhere, enjoys\nmy work, or better, finds it interesting, engaging, or thought-provoking. Not\nme, I\u2019m getting impostor syndrome just writing this, but someone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the truth of the matter is, I can\u0027t keep doing this for free forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy circumstances\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m 22, I studied philosophy and literature at the\nuniversity of Essex for two years, where I had great marks. Then I had a major\nbreakdown due to some mental health problems. I had to leave university and go\nback home before finishing my degree. I had an awful year and a half as a\nconsequence of those issues, but I have mostly recovered since then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince I left university, I have been living with my father.\nHe has a full time job, he pays the rent, he pays the bills, he pays for my food,\nhe pays for my psychologist(s) and he even pays for my games and my computer. I\ndon\u2019t have a job at the moment, and my dream is that I can make a living, even\nif humble, doing what I\u2019m passionate about, which, for the purpose of this Patreon,\nmostly means writing about games critically, to the best of my abilities.\nThat\u2019s why I started my WordPress blog, just a few months ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, if you don\u2019t give me anything, I\u2019ll survive. I won\u2019t\nbecome homeless, I won\u2019t starve. And yes, I\u2019m very lucky for that. My father is\nfar from rich, we\u2019re a fairly humble family, but he can provide for me just\nfine. That\u2019s the reason for that disclaimer at the beginning. I do urge you to\ngive to those who need it most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re still here, I\u2019m setting up this\nPatreon because, as I mentioned, I can\u2019t afford to do this for free forever. Realistically, that\nmeans that I have until \u003cstrong\u003esummer 2015\u003c/strong\u003e, not necessarily to pay for myself\nindependently, but to show that I \u003cem\u003ecan\npotentially\u003c/em\u003e make a living off my writing. Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to find a\njob or go back to university and finish my degree. Which is not the worst fate\nin the world, but it means I won\u2019t have time or energies to do what I do now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow will Patreon\ninfluence what I do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want everyone to be able to enjoy my work, so, at most,\nI\u2019ll do timed exclusives for my patrons (most of my work isn\u2019t time-critical\nanyway) but I have a strong commitment to release everything for free to\neveryone, because I know what it feels like to want to support someone but not\nbeing able to afford it. I guess, if I get enough patrons, I may do things like\nlet you choose from a list what game or subject I should write about, if I feel\ncomfortable enough doing it, but ultimately my decision is final.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also chose a monthly format instead of per-article because\nit makes it easier for me to give my pieces the time and space they need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for reading. You\u0027re wonderful. Yes you. Yes, even if you didn\u0027t pledge.\u003cbr\u003eHave a lovely day. Meow \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
