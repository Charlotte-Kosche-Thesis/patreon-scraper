My goal is to bring you quality tutorials, which are written in a simple and sometimes humorous fashion to prevent you from getting bored while learning new stuff :) I try to bring down complex things to as small parts as possible and my explanations of stuff are informal and easy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to support me, I would be more than just glad if you became my Patron :) Even 1$ per tutorial helps and motivates me. So if you find these tutorials useful, you can become my patron. If you don\u0027t find them useful and you don\u0027t know where to put money, you can also support me :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides I\u0027m a drummer, I\u0027m playing in a Slovak band called N.D.E., and I work as a programmer (not to be mistaken for pro-gamer, although I enjoy playing Starcraft II :D ).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you and I hope you will always enjoy my tutorials in the future :)",
