Arts have always been a firm passion of mine where as long as I am able to do something creative I am happily at peace~ Throughout play and testing all the art styles that intrigued me, photography has to be the one that makes me most happy. I love composing a picture with elements everyone can enjoy, subjects and colors, memories and keepsakes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I have started my Patreon page is due to not being able to have enough funds to do what I love full time and be able to pay my bills. My equipment has been well used the past couple years and is in serious need of repairs/upgrades. I am perfectly OK using old equipment as long as it works. I have some decent skills and I love improving them every chance I get! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEquipment I would need to upgrade/obtain and why:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew camera: I currently use a Nikon D5200 however within the past year the camera was dropped (and mainly) survived. The mother board in the camera was hit hard and sometimes refuses to read the memory card or record data until the device is reformatted. The shutter speed will depend on the mood of the camera and it has failed to turn on during several occasions. I will not need an extraordinary camera, As long as I can use my manual settings and not so many dead pixels I will be a happy camper. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePortable Flashes: For the entirety of my photography career I have used natural lighting and reflector disks. I would really like to get some portable flashes so I can do more night photography and be able to experiment with and have some genuine creativity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore Hard Drive space: One thing I have learned the hard way is that photography takes up A LOT of space. I currently have over 3 TB of photos and its building as I do more shoots. I am in the process of thinking about a server but may just end up getting a couple more 2-3 TB externals. One stationary and a travel one. That way I can back up and keep photos safe during my travels. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTravelling expenses: With great photos comes great cost, Travel is not as cheap as it used to be, be it with flights or travel via car/bus. I often travel to conventions across Canada (and soon to be US and other countries) and with most of these conventions I do not get paid due to getting new clientele. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRent and Living: Unfortunately, Due to health, I have been unable to hold a steady job and my ONLY form of income is my photography. I have been diagnosed with Lupus, Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that slowly breaks down the body from the inside out. It most often leads to inflammation, joint pain, Organ failure, and most often leaves people with extreme fatigue. (The most common way to explain it, is it is like when your body is fighting a cold or virus, except instead of fighting the virus, the body is continuously attacking and tearing apart at itself. There are so many occasions where I am unable to leave my bed, and when I am out and doing anything, I most often have to take a bunch of pain medicine just to be able to function outside of my bed room let alone my house hold. It is a constant struggle being able to come up with enough funds to live on let alone improve my equipment to bring people better art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be doing my best to continue bringing you best content I can possibly manage and continue to better both myself and my skills. I am working on some new ideas, and glorious content that will bring my content to a whole new level! (Movie quality edits where it looks like it comes right from the movies!) I love recieving feedback so please, if you guys have any advise or anything, please feel free to let me know!"
