    "summary": "Hello! My Name Means Bent Nose. That is to say, I\u0027m Cameron Niebuhr, and I am currently writing a science fiction series that I loosely refer to as \u0027Bought and Sold\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a writer had always been something in the back of my mind. A profession and a goal I never quite thought enough of myself to truly pursue. I\u0027ve done a few little intros to stories that quickly died off but it was only recently I started writing seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially, I didn\u0027t like the thought of writing science fiction. It was intimidating to me. Fantasy seemed like a setting where I could play it much looser in terms of how everything works and ties together. Science Fiction always felt like it demanded a higher degree of respect in my mind. If I wasn\u0027t serious about writing, then I couldn\u0027t seriously consider writing Sci-fi.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I found a sub-genre and a board called HFY or stories that make you go: \"Humanity Fuck Yeah!\". A genre of stories with an uplifting theme and feeling about the \u0027average awesome\u0027. My brother had always preferred science fiction and I suspect he would have loved what could be found therein. So a science fiction story is what I decided to write. I started writing it for myself and for him. Now, I\u0027m happily writing it for my readers too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who have found your way to my Patreon by means other than Reddit. You can find my own story amidst a great number of other excellent authors here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe nice people over there even helped me get my own little wiki:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/authors/mynamemeansbentnose/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMyNameMeansBentNose Wiki\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it seems that I do indeed have fans! This leads me to believe that I\u0027m doing something right here. And so here I am asking your help as I begin this new journey. I intend to write the best story that I can, but Patreon has the potential to allow me to arrange all those niggling life problems around me to truly encourage the writing, instead of interfering with it. And if I manage to write a story that earns me a big enough following I can dedicate myself entirely to this writing, and nothing would make me happier or more grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of how it goes here, I intend to continue my writing, and I hope you all enjoy the stories I have to tell.\u003cbr\u003e"
