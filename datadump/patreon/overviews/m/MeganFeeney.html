    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWell! It\u2019s finally happening. I\u2019m finally here, on Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, look! You\u2019re here, too!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m \u003cem\u003esuper \u003c/em\u003eexcited that you\u2019ve come to visit my Patreon page. Thank you! Truly. Thank you for being here. :) This is a new, and daunting thing for me. My best friend told me about Patreon, and believed I could do well. My success hinders \u003cem\u003eimmensely \u003c/em\u003eupon your support, and I am incredibly gracious for any and all you will provide.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am what my friend calls a baby writer. I\u2019m new to writing, but not to story creation (DnD DM, baby!). With a mathematic and scientific background, it\u2019s crazy to think that my true love is with story writing. That, however, is the truth. (Well\u2026 That, and creating worlds \u2013 I\u2019m still a scientist after all!) I chose to use Patreon as a way to fund my love, while giving others the chance to immerse themselves within my world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMY World.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m not writing fanfiction. I\u2019m not taking the world someone else created, and writing stories to fit within their realm. I\u2019m taking the world that I created, the characters I love, and the insane number of stories within my mind, and putting pen to paper! (\u2026let\u2019s be honest, I type things. Fingers to keys?)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn a world where chaos is everywhere, hate and rage is on every channel, financial situations leave you anxious or depressed, television and movies run reruns or remakes, and life just doesn\u2019t seem fair, isn\u2019t it nice to just \u2026 leave? Leave the world behind, and relax within a good, fresh story. That\u2019s what I hope to provide. I live in my world every day, and it relaxes me. It\u2019s comforting to know that magic exists, elves are beautiful and graceful, and dragons are still the head of the food chain. Won\u2019t you join me?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYour support will not only help me continue to entertain the masses \u2013 \u003cem\u003eincluding you!\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 but will help me to publish my stories (the big time! Whoo!). Your support will help me pay bills so I can continue to write and go through the grueling path an artist must take from story to publish. Your support \u2013 which I am forever humbled by! \u2013 will help me smile, especially if you do. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIncidentally, it might also fund my side joy of baking nummy things for awesome \u2013 often random \u2013 people. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI talk a lot, so I need to stop myself. I am super happy you are here! Help me become famous! (Too far? \u2026a little too far. HA! Okay... Baby steps, then.) Help me live so I can create fun, enjoyable stories for everyone \u2013 not just you wonderful people!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMost of the things you will see here will be part of a larger whole. It will be relatively \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eunedited, and raw content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. I\u2019ll fix some typos so it\u2019s not too difficult to get through, but I am still a baby writer. Still new to all of this. My patrons will be able to see my words, hear my voice, and hopefully help me grow to a toddler writer(no more crawling!)\u2026 then a teenager(I AM INVINCIBLE!)\u2026 then an adult writer(adulting like a pro!)! \u2026maybe we\u2019ll skip the teenager phase. Not even my godling characters are invincible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTable of Contents: Aura of Life\u003cbr\u003eChapter 1\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hey hey, I found an about section! More places to write stuff. Whoo!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, you want to know who I am, do ya? Alright! Strap in, here goes...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally, I was born in California. I wouldn\u0027t consider myself much of a California girl as far as politics (EWW!) go, but I definitely love the scenery. Trees and mountains are some of my favorite things about the earth, and that\u0027s probably why I write so much about elves and forests.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA decently long time ago, I started role playing and playing video games. Dungeons and Dragons table top role play, AOL chatroom role play, forum role play, messenger role play... any kind of role play that was medieval or fantasy. This means I have a character, and I play its life out. It was okay, but the stories weren\u0027t as interesting to me... so I started making them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt started off simply by destroying one thing or another in my character\u0027s life... then quickly adapted to creating actual villains. From there, it moved to long, drawn out stories that had people signing online just so they could figure out what happened next! Good times those.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring that time, I met a man who \u003cem\u003edared\u003c/em\u003e to question the choices my characters made, and began to persuade others to follow \u003cem\u003ehim\u003c/em\u003e. My nemesis, at the time, was still good at heart - therefore could not be destroyed - but was still just wrong. And, you know, when one is wrong, they must be corrected. So, finally, one day - after stockpiling evidence for weeks - I corrected him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSkip ahead four years... I\u0027m moving out to Texas to finish my schooling, and be closer to my best friend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSkip ahead another year... I\u0027m engaged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been married for four years, and he\u0027s likely my biggest supporter. (But he was still wrong way back then. I charmed him in to believing it. Look, ma, I\u0027ma bard!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy background is in the sciences. I LOVE ROCKS! Nothin\u0027 can change that. I\u0027ve loved rocks since I was a kid. Now I use my science-y knowledge, and love of rocks, trees, and all things living to create living worlds full of magic, elves, dragons, and all things AWESOME!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still play video games. I still read. I still create stories in my mind, even if they don\u0027t all make it to paper. I still think. I like to sing! I love Disney! \u00a0...and I bake.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh... okay... I guess we\u0027ll learn more about me through my writing. Each character has a piece of me in it anyway. (Yes, even, if not especially, the villains)\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
