    "summary": "Welcome to The Art of Mel Juarez Patreon Page! Thank you so much for checking out my page. I am a transgender (FTM) artist based out of my hometown Austin, TX. I never attended art school so most of what I do is self-taught through the method of trial and error. I love pop culture and use it as my focus in a good majority of my artwork. I typically use pencil and ballpoint pen in my traditional drawings but I am branching into other mediums such as digital painting/sketching and using markers. I call my style nostalgic realism focusing on moments, people, events, movies, shows, etc which have had and continue to have a great influence on me. I can\u0027t do art full-time just yet but through this page, and with the support that persons like yourself provide, I will be able to create new pieces and experiment more with new mediums. I have personal goals of putting my artwork up in local coffee shops, breweries etc and maybe eventually a full-blown gallery show someday. Your support keeps these dreams of mine alive and thriving! Thanks for taking the time to be a part of my little art world!"
