I was born and raised on the Big Island of Hawaii and grew up \nsurrounded by a large loving family, lots of gatherings, good food \nand....of course....music! Someone in the family always had an\n ukulele and a song to share so it was natural for me to start singing and composing at an early age and it became my passion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNow I live just up the road from where I was raised in a house my \nhusband and I built ourselves. I\u0027ve been blessed to build a life with my husband and our four children,\n homesteading, homeschooling, off-grid living, and night time gigging - \nit\u0027s been awesome!! I\u0027m also a Hawaiian wedding planner on the side - between the music and the weddings I can throw a great party! In between all these activities somehow I find time to write music about my life, my \nGod, daily struggles, love and so much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will make it possible for me to carve out time to write more songs and to help get me into the studio so I can record them.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s in this for you? You can receive access to different things depending on how much you\u0027d like to participate:\u00a0 free downloads, ukulele lessons over skype, an invitation to attend a local sound check for a meet and greet before a show, comp tickets and priority seating, access to behind the scenes videos, and an autographed ukulele. You can change your subscription amount or cancel at any time. As I develop my career, I\u0027ll be adding more perks :). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to getting to know you and I\u0027ll do my best to reward you well with great music and fun times in exchange for your support. Your patronage is a tremendous gift to me so mahalo, mahalo, mahalo!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAloha, Maka"
