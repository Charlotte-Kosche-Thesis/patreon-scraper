I\u0027ve been doing this since\n2000, and I have been lucky enough to become one of more respected rope artists\nin the northeastern US. I have taught rope and performed at numerous rope\nconventions across the country. I have done rope for fashion magazines, music\nvideos, and even a movie. I believe there is a spiritual side to the rope, and\ndo my best to help people learn how to cultivate those facets of bondage as\nwell. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also do a bit of rope\ninspired art. I\u2019ve been working on photos and artistic photo manipulations, as\nwell as performance videos and stories. We do a bondage calendar every year\nthat folks seem to like. I\u2019m also working on a few rope education projects\nincluding a DVD video series and possibly an instructional book. But to get\nthese projects moving into high gear, I need your help. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI would use the funds from\nthis Patreon to help pay for equipment, models, occasional wardrobe and sets.\nMost importantly, it will pay for time. My time. I wont need to take every\nsingle gig no matter what it is just to make ends meet. I could invest some of\nthat time into these new projects. I could plan some time to work on those instructional books.\nOr to film a set of videos. Or to research and rehearse a few performances in\nadvance to make them even better. Or my next bondage photo book.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs well as the incentives\nposted, every 3 months (and sometimes more often), I\u2019ll be having random\ngiveaways of stuff. It might be some of my older rope that was used in\nperformances. It may be a fresh new kit. It may be a calendar or a print or a\nt-shirt. Whatever it is, it will be cool and my way of telling you thank you\nfor supporting me in bringing rope art and education wherever I can take it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHelp me save the world\u2026 one\nknot at a time. \u003cbr\u003e"
