     "about": "Megan Lenhardt was born \u0026amp; raised in the beautiful state of Oregon. She and her husband, Josh, continue to live, work, \u0026amp; raise their son Brendan in the amazing place where they both grew up. Megan is a creator, of arts, crafts, vlogs \u0026amp; now, finally, music again! She grew up performing \u0026amp; singing her whole life and was a part of the University of Oregon\u0027s Premier Women\u0027s A Cappella Group, Divisi from 2006-2010. She now directs the Oregon Children\u0027s Choir\u0027s all-female high school a cappella group, Synergy \u0026amp; co-directs, with Josh, the co-ed high school group, Sforzando. Megan has also been involved in teaching, choreographing \u0026amp; directing shows through a local children\u0027s theater, Rose Children\u0027s Theatre for the past 5 years. She loves teaching \u0026amp; helping kids grow in what they are passionate about, but has missed being on stage herself. The internet and more specifically, YouTube, will hopefully be her \"stage\" now to help her share with all of you one of her biggest passions: music.\u003cbr\u003e",
