With just a tiny dollar donation for every story, essay, journal entry, or other expression that I make, you get access to my private patreon space, and feel good in supporting a queer writer\u2019s hard work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWho is Sinclair and what is Sugarbutch?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.sugarbutch.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/072015screenshot.jpg\" style=\"width: 606px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m a writer, a non-binary butch, a feminist queer dominant, and many other things, currently living in Oakland, California. My current online project is\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.sugarbutch.net\"\u003eSugarbutch.net\u003c/a\u003e, where I\u2019ve been keeping an online journal, publishing essays about kink and gender, and writing queer kink erotica since 2007. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSugarbutch updates 2-5 times per month, which often include a sex toy review (usually focused on strap-on technology), an essay on feminist kink, a dirty story, a journal entry, and sometimes an erotica story by a guest author. Above all, Sugarbutch is a personal writing project, where I\u2019m working out my own ideas about sex, gender, kink, and relationships. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI write a few other places online, too. Primarily, I\u2019m part of a spiritual community called\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.bodytrustcircle.com\"\u003eBody Trust\u003c/a\u003e, and I write an essay on the wheel of the year once a month, as well as editing the monthly podcast, Pleasure Lab. But aside from that, you\u2019ll occasionally see my articles published on other sites, or podcast episodes where I\u2019m a guest. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePatreon has made it possible for me to:\u003c/h4\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eRemove all the text and photo ads from the footers on Sugarbutch, making it a cleaner reading experience as well as easier to read discreetly\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eUpgrade the web hosting plan I\u2019m on so that there\u0027s a lot less overload and no more server crashing\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMove the mailing list to a better provider and actually keep up with folks that way\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFeel supported in my writing and publishing, knowing there are folks who are willing to give a little back and care about my growth and progress as a writer\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut beyond that, \n\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon has helped to create a little group of people who I trust with my work\u003c/strong\u003e. I feel excited to update with what\u2019s going on with me, and I love hearing from all of you and your work and lives, too. It feels like an inner circle of friends, and I\u2019m ever grateful for that support. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSome of the things Patreon patrons got recently:\u003c/h4\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFree pre-releases of my ebooks \u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eDiscount codes for online workshops and other books\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePrivate photographs from photo shoots (the ones that I don\u2019t want to find their way to tumblr)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eJournal entries that include details of the latest emotional work I\u2019ve been doing, which have to do with developmental trauma, re-traumatizing events, communication skills in a long term relationship, and how to maintain being a Master through also having a cycling mood disorder\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eDirty stories that feel a bit too edgy to have available to the general public\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSo hey, don\u0027t you want to become a patron?\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eImportant Note:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is set up to charge per post, not per month. That means if you pledge $1 and I post four times, you pay $4 at the end of the month. But you can also set a monthly limit on how much you pledge, regardless of how many times I post. At the very end of the checkout process, you can opt to add a \"monthly max.\" If you want to be charged $5/month, just say that you want to support one time per month. Otherwise you\u0027ll be pledging $5/post and not $5/month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eDo you want to support me, but don\u2019t want to/can\u2019t pledge here on Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you!

I never really thought that\u2019d be a reality, but Patreon makes it feel possible. There have been so many times where I was ready to quit, ready to delete it all from my online archives and stop paying all the money per month to host it all. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m just throwing my work out into a void, and I have no idea if anyone is listening. But having just a little bit come back to me by way of money and personal interaction has made a huge difference. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy helping me here, even at a $1 level, you help me make and publish all sorts of queer, genderqueer, kinky writings into the world. I will keep writing regardless of the support, but \n\u003cstrong\u003eit really is magical that some people choose to pay for free art. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
