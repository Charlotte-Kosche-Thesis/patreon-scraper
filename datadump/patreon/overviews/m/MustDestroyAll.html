    "summary": "Your support definitely helps the content I produce so I can keep it going and possibly get better stuff for my videos. It\u0027s obvious that when it comes to us small content creators (and yes 20k subs is still very small) on YouTube and being with a network, the payouts are feeble. In no way am I saying I can\u0027t make videos without donations. It\u0027s just appreciated that I get support from people that enjoy my content that I produce and want me to do better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome may seem to think that the reason why my opinions on crowdfunding have changed is because I want money now. Not at all. We could argue what goes on in my head for the longest time, but I\u0027ve had an interest to make money on the internet for years. I could\u0027ve set up a Patreon or a Paypal donation link anytime I wanted to. My opinions changed on crowdfunding because it really isn\u0027t that big of a deal to me UNLESS somebody is scamming. If you really have such a big issue with it still then you need to realize a lot of your favorite YouTubers have done the same as well. Even back then people I never thought would even want donations. People like freddiew, wheezywaiter, Alan Becker (the guy who made those stick figure fight animations), hotdiggedydemon, RicePirate, and so many others. People don\u0027t realize there\u0027s more to my channel than just turning on a camera and talking. If it were that easy, I would do videos easily everyday. So I do think trivializing my work is definitely a slap in the face.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I also find to be a slap in the face is people telling me I\u0027m greedy. I wish I was, but you don\u0027t know well to even assume I\u0027m greedy just because I have a Patreon and make money online. It\u0027s just as ridiculous as people saying PewDiePie is greedy or only cares about money when he has proven time and time and that he contributes his money to good causes. The difference is, I don\u0027t make enough to be that generous and donate to charities. My profits go to other things to help others."
