I\u0027ve been all over the place on this journey - I\u0027ve done shows, I\u0027ve done radio, I\u0027ve made an album, I\u0027ve had a record deal (and walked away from it), I\u2019ve supported some amazing artists, I\u0027ve written hundreds of songs for myself and a quite a few for other people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving spent the past year writing with and for other people, (which I have loved) I have finally decided that I\u0027m very much ready to get back to my own project and start putting some new musical vibes out there as an artist. The main plan being to release an EP at some point next year. Exciting times!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe way that Patreon works is that you can subscribe\u00a0to my project for as little as $1 (around 76p depending on how Brexit\u0027s going!) a month and you get to be part of a\u00a0secret club, hearing new music that I create before anyone else and sometimes in its rawest form.\u00a0Whether you pay \u00a31 or \u00a3100, your input is truly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003eIf you fancy coming along for the ride, your support will help me to get some amazing producers involved and have the music sounding at its best, as well as hopefully helping me out with some marketing so I can get it out there to as many peeps as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what do you get in return?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you join this community, you\u0027ll have access to new and early demos of songs, videos and the odd living room gigs for those who are up for it! You can also be part of Patreon online chats so we can all get to know each other a little better :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be posting demos every few weeks or so and I\u0027m open to suggestions, so if you fancy an online chat, live sessions or if you have other creative ideas, I\u0027m all ears!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy vision for this is simple, to keep creating and sharing music. With your help, it will be even better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy first post will be this month! (November) So join in and get listening :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBig Love,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMaddy xx\u003cbr\u003e"
