    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho is\nMortze?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMortze\nis a name I made up several years ago in an RPG context. I was so fond of the\ncharacter it belonged that I decided to adopt that name as an artistic name. I\nam a fairly new (2014) 3D artist who has found a passion and who is living it.\nI\u2019m from southern Europe, in my mid 30\u2019s. I love erotica. Always have. And I\nlove to create stories and characters. That\u2019s what fuels me. So I thought I had\nto mix both and give myself fully to something I really enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I want to do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nwant to do erotic games. I want to make stories. Most of all I want to explore my\nfantasies and allow people to enjoy theirs. There are some themes I will not\nallow myself to explore but others, considered taboo, I do. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nwant to make games and stories the way I most enjoy playing and reading them. I\nknow it won\u2019t please everybody but I also know some will greatly enjoy it and\nrelate to it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I define my works?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\ndo prefer to center my stories on characterization and a coherent plot. I\nunderstand that to be a game it needs to have challenges like puzzles and\nchoice-related consequences. My RPG background made me understand that, and\npart of the characterization I cherish is the player\u2019s character development. But,\nfrom where I stand, an erotic game must, first of all, be erotic and that\u2019s the\ngoal I want to achieve with my games. I support a strong sexual build-up,\nrealistic dialogues and choices, and down-to-earth plots. You will not find\nfemale objectivation in my games. I try to build realistic character concepts, with\nrespect and dignity in mind. I do not like to call my work Porn because of\nthat. I do not have anything against Porn but I think, abstractly, it is more\nabout sex and less about environment and story and with my games I\u2019ll try to have\na healthy mix of both.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I use to make my games?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNot\nmuch really. For the pictures rendering I use DAZ3D Studio. For editing I use\nPhotoshop and to mount the game I use Tlaero\u2019s Adventure Creator. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my purpose on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell,\nsimply said: a revenue. To be able to make games in a relatively short time I\nneed to focus all my time at it. There are several kind of similar games out\nthere, and you\u2019ll notice that, either the paid ones, and the free ones, take no\nless than 6 months average to complete, some even more. That is because making\nthese games is very time consuming. And, let\u2019s face it, everybody has to make a\nliving. Having patrons support means that I\u2019d be able to fully dedicate myself\nto writing a script, developing characters, posing and rendering them, and\nbuilding the game to be played on your computers. Besides, having I will be\nable to invest in better hardware and software, 3D content, to enhance my\noptions in making the games, build better environments, clothings and morphs\n(character\u2019s bodies), and, also very important, speed up the rendering process\nand the pictures quality. That will result in faster and better games for you\nto enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat have I done so far?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nhave had the great honor to collaborate with Tlaero in making Dreaming with\nElsa and Redemption for Jessika. And also Pandora Part I, by myself. It has achieved great criticism so far. It\u2019s free so enjoy it. You can\ndownload them at \u003ca href=\"http://www.mortzeart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.mortzeart.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy \u00a0current project, will be Pandora and games made with Tlaero. My intentions are\nto release them freely. But my patrons will have access to exclusive material,\nlike extra content, commissioned pictures, and even commissioned little\ngames/add-ons to the game.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ll take great attention to\npatron\u2019s opinions regarding what kind of game will follow.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about Pandora?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019d\nconsider Pandora more a visual novel than a game. Sure it has some choice\ndialogue and actions but, contrary to most of these kind of games, the main\ncharacter, the one you play, as a defined personality and consequential\ndialogues options. It is a fairly easy game once you understand those premises.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\nis a story about discovery and mystery. A story about people. This isn\u2019t the\naverage \u201cdate\u201d game. There is no seduction path. But there is empathy to be\nbuilt. I\u2019m trying to design the character as a fairly normal young man, and not\nas a womanizer. I believe this will be a new approach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSite and contact?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou\nwill find more about me and my work at \u003ca href=\"http://www.mortzeart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.mortzeart.com\u003c/a\u003e  and you can contact me\ndirectly at \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emortzeart @ gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is also a brand new Facebook page:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011350357377\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011350357377\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019d\nlike to thank you for your time, reading this, and to thank you for your\nsupport!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCheers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e"

The\nfirst is work time and learning time. 3D art is a constant learning process\nmeaning you got to devote yourself to follow more proficient artists, learn\nfrom them, purchase and learn from 3d art sources, like books or video\ntutorials. More money means more time for me and more time to learn. The second\npoint is that it will allow me to upgrade my hardware and software. The\nsoftware I use, DAZ3D allows for another rendering engine, IRay, which runs\nfully on the GPU card. My actual renders are from the other engine 3Dlight that\nruns on the CPU but are not as good looking. For the moment I can\u2019t render on\nIRay because I do not have potent enough GPUs to get a render in an acceptable\ntime. But with your help I could purchase better GPUs and begin to render in\nIRay, meaning a great advance in quality image and colours, and also realism.",
