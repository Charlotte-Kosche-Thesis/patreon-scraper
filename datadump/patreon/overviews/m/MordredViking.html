My name is Mordred Viking, and I\u0027d like to welcome you to my Patreon page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make Let\u0027s Play videos for computer games, and I also stream games on Twitch. These are usually strategic in nature, for example Crusader Kings II, Europa Universalis IV and Hearts of Iron IV, though I do also dabble in other genres, for instance first person shooter or survival!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the decrease in YouTube advertising income, it has become increasingly important to rely on alternative revenue streams, so any support that you can offer is very greatly appreciated. By supporting me here, you can receive a number of great rewards and participate towards certain goals which will enhance the viewing pleasure of everyone! Even a single dollar here is far more revenue than I can expect from even 1,000 views.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI absolutely love doing this work, but in order to justify all the time I put into this, I need to be able to earn something in return in order to pay the bills. If you would like something which I currently do not offer here, then please do get in touch with me, and I am sure that we can work something out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the content I create, then please do consider becoming my patron and chipping in what you can. Thank you!"
