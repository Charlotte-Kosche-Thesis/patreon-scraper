    "summary": "Thank you\nfor considering supporting my art. I will do my best to make your participation a valued experience. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://alchemistgift.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mark-table-book.jpeg\"\u003eWho am I? I\nam an artist/author/artisan/lover of handmade things/self-taught musician/art\nfurniture maker/painter/parent/grandparent/loner who loves\ncompany/humanist/hard worker and generally happy soul.  My day job for many years is cabinet and\nfurniture making. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI was born\nin up-state New York and emigrated to Southern California as a lad and have\nlived here ever since. I earned an English degree from SDSU with an emphasis on\ncreative writing. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have\nalways made art in one way or another for the satisfaction and love of\ncreativity. It seems no matter how much I wanted to be able to have my art\nsupport me; life had a curious way of distracting me with mundane necessities\nthat somehow were untimely. Now with the help of patrons like you and without\nso many distractions I have come full circle and can devote my efforts to get\nmy art out there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://alchemistgift.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/markfurniture.jpg\"\u003eA few years\nago I made a built-in desk for one of my clients whom I have known, approaching\ntwenty years. The man is a successful author of murder mysteries and he has\nprospered. He has thirty years of writing under his belt.  I had just finished my first novel, \u2018Alchemist\nGift\u2019 and in a starry-eyed fit of enthusiasm asked for some sage advice on\ngetting the novel published. It was somewhat disconcerting when he told me newbies\nhad to, \u201cpay their dues\u201d in order to be taken seriously by a publisher as well\nas being considered a writer. I gritted my teeth and smiled through the rest of\nthe project. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"http://alchemistgift.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/markpaint.jpg\"\u003eAt first I\nwas overwhelmed with the thought of \u2018paying my dues.\u2019 The more I thought about\nit, I had paid my dues; I had paid them every day of my life. Every day I was\nconsumed with securing the necessities of life kept my art at arm\u2019s length, not\nonly from me but the public as well.  I still\ncreated art. I painted, carved, wrote music, wrote books, but not as much as I\nhave in me. I don\u2019t have the luxury of a lifetime ahead of me. Patreon makes\nsense. This platform gives an artist the ability to connect with people who\nappreciate and understand the importance of art and writing and the importance\nof the artist who needs to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerks for patronage.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you donate, you will \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://alchemistgift.com/patreon-perks-books-and-ebooks/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eearn points\u003c/a\u003e that you can use to get short stories, novels, art prints, cups, t-shirts, and more.\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://alchemistgift.com/patreon-perks-books-and-ebooks/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://alchemistgift.com/patreon-perks-books-and-e...\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the $5 level and above, you will have access to audio and video files about the books, short radio play of Old Nick, and an audio, video reading of a short form of Robbie\u0027s Ap and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the $10 level and above, you will also get access to my Diary where you can find out what I am doing and even join in while I write. You can watch the writing being done and make comments. I am currently working on a screenplay for Eden Towers, a new short story, Hacked, and the second book in the Alchemist Series, Curious Journey. Occasionally I\u0027ll do a video of working in the shop, painting, or composing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $20 or more you will be invited to join in an interview with Mark every 3 months. Ask him questions about his writing or artwork.
