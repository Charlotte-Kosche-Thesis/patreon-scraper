I create illustrations ranging from pure line work to full-colored digital pieces as well as physical pieces using a wide range of mixed media. With graphic design, I offer professional services with logos, branding, typography, and general information organization (flyers, menus, brochures, etc.). As a writer, I write blog posts and short stories. I\u0027m currently working on my first full-length novel which will ideally be released in 2018. You can check out my website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://miketre.com/\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s most important to me as creator is seeing people like myself and other members of marginalized communities effectively represented.\u00a0I want to contribute to the movement of centering positive representation by telling stories and creating worlds more people can see themselves being a part of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will You Be Funding?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created a Patreon as a means of better connecting with my audience and to create curated content on a consistent basis. With your support, I\u0027ll be able to more frequently produce writings and visual pieces. You will get a real-time look at my growth as an artist as I experiment with new techniques and supply myself with better equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be releasing brand new illustrations and/or designs weekly and new short stories or blog posts monthly. Patreon supporters get early access to all of my new content. Each month, a raffle will take place where Tier 4 supporters and higher can submit illustration ideas and fan art requests with a chance to see them executed. With my higher goals met, I\u0027ll be able to invest in better illustration and design equipment to deliver work of even better quality on a more frequent basis. I will also be able to travel and distribute work in other places, create Patreon exclusive tutorials and additional content such as podcasts and live streams.\u003cbr\u003e"
