I expect this book will give children an animal to relate to. Growing up, children try many behaviors that they expect to be perfectly find and natural only to be corrected in ways that vary from place to place, person to person. Some people are mean to \"misbehaving\" children. Some gently guide them to be more acceptable. Some accept them as they are. Situational norms can be a whirlwind, as Monkey finds every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen in a forest, monkey climbs trees, eats wild fruits at will, discards peels and cores anywhere, makes noise at any volume, and bonds with others with closeness. Take the monkey to town and the monkey\u0027s behaviors are suddenly confronted by situational social standards foreign to the monkey. Will society embrace this monkey with it\u0027s predisposition behaviors, or will the monkey be ostracized or forced to conform to situational social norms? Where will the monkey find hate and where will it find loving acceptance?\u003cbr\u003e",
