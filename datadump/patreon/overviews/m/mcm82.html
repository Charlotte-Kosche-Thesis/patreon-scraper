    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m McManus\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started modding quite a few years ago, with Skyrim afterwards moved on to Fallout 4 and later did some mods for XCOM 2.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy passion and hobby is asset creation, i like to tweak around in 3D :) So it came naturally to start modding HoneySelect / Illusion games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you will get for supporting me:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eInstant access to new character and outfit releases (10$+), \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNon patrons get the mods two weeks (14 days) after the initial release\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003e3-4 character / outfit mods per month, and a request mod if there is any.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should you support me: \u003c/strong\u003eI like and enjoy creating mods, but it takes a considerable amount of time and resources(you guessed it right, money), the games (for assets), tools (to edit said assets), all cost money, not to mention that a single character takes at least about a weeks worth of work (6-10 hours a day) and as you most likely know, time is money. I live in the EU, but unfortunately (almost) the crappiest part of it, meaning i cannot afford a lot of things on my salary, my PC i use to make the mods and do all the work is a first gen i7 which is quite outdated not to mention my GTX 760.. Your contributions will allow me to acquire better hardware, more games and have more time to do mods. You can check the goals for specifics about these.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat characters will i choose:\u003c/strong\u003e Mainly characters from KOEI / TECMO games, like Samurai / Dynasty Warriors, Nights of Azure and so on, with a hint of characters that are just too famous to exclude. I\u0027m also open to character / game suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill future Illusion games be supported: \u003c/strong\u003eShort answer, Yes. Once everything settles down, i will look into conversion of the characters / outfits to PlayHome, you should expect this in about one month time(mid-late December).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReward tier descriptions, please read for specific details and conditions before applying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTipper:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePreview post access of upcoming character and outfit mods\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOption to participate in polls, regarding what characters / outfits to do next, and other decisions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e1$ Patron votes count as 1 point in polls (5$ Patron votes count as 5 points, 10$ Patron votes count as 10 points)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSemi-Supporter:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to new releases 7 days after posting, non patrons get access two weeks after  release.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOption to participate in polls, regarding what characters / outfits to do next, and other decisions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e5$ Patron votes count as 5 points in polls (10$ Patron votes count as 10 points)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIncludes all previous rewards\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupporter:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eInstant access to new character and outfit mod releases, non patrons get access two weeks after  release.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOption to participate in polls, regarding what characters / outfits to do next, and other decisions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e10$ Patron votes count as 10 points in polls (5$ Patron votes count as 5 point)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIncludes all previous rewards.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWisher:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOption to submit one entry to polls regarding what character / outfit to do next.\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eExact character / outfit must be available in a publicly release PC game not older than 5 years.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOr you must be able to provide the character mesh / textures in a suitable quality.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf your submission to the poll wins, this is basically a discount request(next tier).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIncludes all previous rewards.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRequester:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOption to request one character / outfit to do next.(after i finish the current character / outfit, if there is one)\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eExact character / outfit must be available in a publicly release PC game not older than 5 years.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOr you must be able to provide the character mesh / textures in a suitable quality.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRequests are done in a first come first served order, one request per one month of subscription.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCurrent request queue list will be made public few days before the end of every month, please decide to renew / cancel your tier based on the lenght of the queue.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIncludes all previous rewards.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eI do not give permission to anyone to redistribute or repackage my mods, especially while they are Patron only.
