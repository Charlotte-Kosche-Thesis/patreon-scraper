     "about": "Born and raised as a 90\u0027s baby in Lower East Side, New York. I found my entry into the creative world. During middle school after 2001, I found my creative mind controlling my physical style of life, gaining a spark for developing characters and my drawing skills with inspiration from Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Dragonball Z.\u00a0Durng high school, I ventured deep into my mind and my creative potential, drawing and writing poetry, when I met my first producer, Ammobeats. From there I would start a demo of the tape now known as \"TransFormation: The Monochrome Experience\". After all the pressure of negative feeback, high school drama and personal issues I was dealing with, I left all of my hobbies behind in 2009, in favor for a new hobby, Photography.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotography eventually lead to learning how to DJ. After a few years of being a DJ and a Photographer, I decided to retire in pursuit of a Career in 2014, all while a spark of music was beginng to shine in my mind. While I made my attempt to work in the I.T field for Corporations, I developed and mastered my first and second mixtape for a double-release in 2016, under the name \"Majik the Mage\".\u00a0The future of Majik the Mage has been developing since my 2016 debut. After I lost my employment in the same year, I released my mixtapes as a declaration of making my creative mind and passion my career choice! I am passionate in successfully building the Majik the Mage brand so I can expand and help with the development of small business and business networks within the creative field. I dream hard and I have chosen to invest now only in my own dreams, but ever dreamer that envisions a world of unity and compassion!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
