    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon page! Your monthly pledge* is a subscription that gives you insider access to my research and creation process, and helps me to carry on as a full-time artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work, as I have come to understand it, belongs to the tradition of sacred art: Art that points beyond our daily experience to a larger and immutable reality.\u003cbr\u003eSome of the themes and techniques that weave in and out of my work:\u003cbr\u003e- Geometry, the system of relationships that holds all things together, and particularly \"mandalas\";\u003cbr\u003e- Cosmology, mapping the symbolic universe and our place in it;\u003cbr\u003e- Archetypal themes, often drawn from Sufism, with its universal message of love;\u003cbr\u003e- Kufic, the first Arabic script to be made consciously beautiful;\u003cbr\u003e- Alchemy as a process of deep transformation, that also turns up in a literal way in the preparation of some of my materials.\u003cbr\u003e- Natural materials, as I turn increasingly away from plastics and chemicals in favour of natural, home-prepared materials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy research in all of the above is ongoing, so that alongside sketches and finished pieces you can expect to see things such as recipes for natural art materials, Kufic letter sets, and other how-tos. Pledges tiers and their associated perks are listed on the right.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBy subscribing, you become part of my creative journey, and help me bring more a little more beauty and magic into the world. In former times, the artist was responsible for society\u0027s mental well-being. This is long forgotten, but I think we still know it instinctively. Art is not a luxury but a basic necessity! As our bodies need food, our souls need beauty and remembrance, especially in these fragmented times. Thank you for keeping this alive!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(165, 165, 165);\"\u003eDon\u0027t hesitate to join for only a short while, or to pause your pledge when you need to.
