    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/beladina/Hey%20block.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t know who I am, my name is Troy Maturo. \u00a0I create\noriginal styles of New Age/Ambient/Electronic music.  After 20 years of playing as an independent\nartist, I have 5 albums, 3 EP\u0027s and 3 \"Hollywood Music in Media Award\" nominations. \nI have fans all over the world - often because they heard me play at Disneyland and Universal Studios and took a CD home - and I have made some\nvery cool friends this way.  I\u0027ve also been\nworking on film scores since 2012, and as music has changed, how I share that\nmusic has to change, too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/beladina/P%20Pix%20block%201.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/beladina/Why%20this%20Format%20block.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe music industry is changing every year with more and more people buying, listening, and sometimes even watching their favorite bands and acts online. So the need to be at the vanguard of these trends is the way of the future in music. Venues in\nSouthern California, where I live with my family, are becoming fewer and\nfewer.  The competition for gigs is\ngetting fiercer and fiercer.  So I\u0027m faced\nwith a choice - continue to perform at gigs in the area, or spend that time\ncreating new tracks for dedicated fans each month.  So this page is dedicated towards those fans who want\nto hear new songs ASAP,  and before new\nmusic is available on iTunes, CDBaby,\netc.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf\u00a0you\nlike listening to what I do, Patreon is a cool and convenient way to stay\nconnected. \u00a0Plus it\u0027s immediate. \u00a0You don\u0027t have to hunt me down to see if I\u0027ve got anything new - you\u0027ll be the first to automatically receive new releases.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m also\nkeeping this simple.  There are only musical perk levels for now because I\u0027m a composer first, performer second. You\u0027ve got a life, too, right? \u00a0For now, instead of creating\nnon-musical perks that take up time to fulfill, \nI\u0027m going to keep fresh songs in your playlist on a regular basis and\neverybody wins. But, I will be listening with open ears if there are any interesting requests from you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/beladina/Joining%20block.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a Patron of mine and you\u0027ll get the first four tracks of the new album free. Yep, the full EP: \u003cem\u003eAurora\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eAurora \u003c/em\u003e(the nubile mix), \u003cem\u003eElan Soul\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003ePassing\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0You subscribe by clicking on \"Become a Patron\" at the top right of the page, or click on one of the perks on the right.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/beladina/How%20it%20Works%20block.png\"\u003ePatreon is a subscription service that works like this - you agree that every time I create a new song, EP or album, you are\nautomatically:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA) \u00a0Sent the song (or collection)\u003cbr\u003eB) \u00a0Charged for it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is original high quality downloadable music that\nyou can play on all your devices or burn to a CD for your car - these are *NOT* YouTube video links!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith me,\n\u003cu\u003eyou\u0027re only charged when I finish and send the song\u003c/u\u003e or collection to you, but I don\u0027t create\non a schedule. That means we\u0027re looking at 8\nsongs minimum, 16 maximum, per year.  You\nmight get 2 songs back-to-back, and then nothing for 6 weeks or so.  So this won\u0027t ever break the bank.  But just in case, you can set a maximum\namount in your patron account so there are no surprises. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSongs are sent to patrons prior to public release on iTunes, Spotify, etc. \u00a0EP\u0027s and Album collections will be a mix - some songs may have already been released publicly, but you\u0027ll get others in advance. \u00a0Everyone will get copies of any digital art associated with the albums or specific songs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/beladina/Money%20goes%20block.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBelieve it or not, my music is very expensive to create as far as the investment in gear I use. I always keep up with the newest software, keyboards, sound libraries, and hardware available. I have a fully customized studio which lets me immerse myself in my element of creating music. But along with the initial and ongoing investments there is a lot of unseen overhead:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/beladina/P%20Pix%20block%202.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.\u00a0I have my music professionally mastered so you receive the best quality product. \u00a0This is pretty pricey per song and is something a lot of indie artist don\u0027t like to splurge on. \u00a0But it matters to me that you get the best format.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. I\u0027ve got a manager (Beth Vickers) who\nhandles all the contracts, legal things, and helps out with social media. She gets a percentage (she earns it).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. I license art/photos for cover art, and on rare occasions I license or hire musicians and/or vocalists, too. I pay these\u00a0artists for their work, too. \nBecause that\u0027s the right way to do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Finally, this compensates me for my work. I can easily spend 20-40 hours on a single song. But now you get that song, and I get paid for it! It\u0027s a win win. Plus, this format also goes a very long way to motivating me\nto compose new songs on a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/beladina/Side%20note%20block.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do\noccasionally run contests for cover art submissions, CD names and the like and\nthe prizes may be physical CD\u0027s, a thumb drive with the entire collection of\nalbums, or clothing items with the logo on it. \nPatrons will have first-shot, and sometimes even exclusive opportunities\nfor these items.   Because hard-core fans come first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if you\u0027re signing up for a physical CD tier, please make sure you select the right one. \u00a0Shipping fees are included, so if your address doesn\u0027t match the right tier (US or International) then you\u0027ll be refunded instead of shipped and charged the wrong price.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFYI - Patreon is priced in US currency, but they will automatically convert it for you at the time of payment. Please be sure you check the exchange rate before you sign up so you know what to expect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/beladina/Goals%20block.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon\nwants everyone to have goals.  I just\nwant to make music that you want to hear. \nBUT - because I want to thank everyone who helps spread the word about\nthis Patreon page, I\u0027ll have a few things to offer when we hit certain milestones. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank\nyou so much for checking out my page.  I\nhope you\u0027ll subscribe today and let me know what you think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj259/beladina/Sig%20block%20800%20x%20100.png\"\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eCheck out\nprevious releases at:\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.MaturoMusic.com.\"\u003ewww.MaturoMusic.com.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
