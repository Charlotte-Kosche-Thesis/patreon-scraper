Balancing inter-cultural issues, school drama, and life-threatening monster hunting, these guys thought they had enough to worry about. That is, until they begin to realize that the monsters their fighting pale in comparison to the monsters living in their own world.\u00a0\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003eSet in modern America.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMostly action and drama.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWill be in traditional manga style~\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eStill needs a lot of work, though.

This story is about Ross, a high school\u00a0graffiti\u00a0artist wannabe who falls in love with - you guessed it - a Christian boy. For one, how do you deal with\u00a0these weird feelings and desires you know can\u0027t ever be met? And another thing, how does Christian boy Samuel learn to keep his faith strong in love, while also becoming friends with what those self-righteous\u00a0Christians\u00a0would call \u0027sinners\u0027? Other characters weave in and out\u00a0of the scene to help out, but\u00a0ultimately, its their\u00a0choices that affect them.\u00a0\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003eSet in modern America.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMostly drama and angst.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEpisodal-style writing (think Natsume Yuujinchou)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWill be in traditional manga style\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVarious short stories that might develop into longer stories, I dunno (titles are just the main character\u0027s names so far, I guess.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZephaniah - a story about a winged man who travels to our world, is hunted down for experiments, and... other things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoot - a story about a mute boy who\u0027s about to take his own life when a thief walks in on him, and\u00a0inadvertently\u00a0saves him.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSepa \u00a0- a little epilogue about Sepa, like, 100 years after the events of Paripety.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEgyptian boy - about a boy who is captured in Egypt and, condemed for believing in a god other than Ra, is locked in a cage with gators.
