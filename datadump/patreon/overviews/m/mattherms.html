    "summary": "Howdy! My name is Matt Herms and I\u2019m a professional artist and comic book colorist. I\u2019ve been a freelance artist for just over a decade now \u2013 coloring, penciling, T-Shirt design, video game graphics, and more! You may have seen my stuff before, coloring comic books like Sonic the Hedgehog, Mega Man, or the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! Or you might have seen me around on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://herms85.deviantart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantART\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mattherms\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, or may even know me from way, WAY back in my webcomic days!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.mattherms.com/uploads/4/8/4/6/48467019/patreon01.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThese days I work pretty exclusively as a comic book colorist. It\u2019s a lot of work and a pretty rigorous schedule, but the books are awesome and I\u2019m fortunate to work with some incredibly talented writers and artists to produce kick-ass comics month after month! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u2019d love to be able to do a bit more. And hopefully I can with your help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u2019m on Patreon\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, as a freelancer with a family to support, investing in my business tends to be on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis. For example, I work with some old equipment \u2013 my Wacom Intuos would be going into Junior High now, it\u2019s \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHAT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e old! And while I strongly profess that you don\u2019t need the shiniest or newest tools to create quality work, my aging rig definitely cannot support more strenuous endeavors like streaming or recording my coloring process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal here on Patreon \u2013 what you guys will be generously helping me accomplish \u2013 is to put a bit more money back into my business on a more regular basis: to upgrade some equipment, to fund making it out to a couple more conventions per year, and free up a bit more time in my schedule to work on some of my own projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.mattherms.com/uploads/4/8/4/6/48467019/patreon02.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWith your help, I can do more. Draw more. Color more. You guys will be helping me continue to do what I do, and do a little more on top of that! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me on Patreon for just $1 (Or more!) per month, you get: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to the Patreon feed: a guaranteed minimum of weekly content like sneak peeks at upcoming projects or prints, sketches, tutorials, and behind-the-scenes blog posts. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFree digital versions of ALL my sketchbooks! \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly access to some content, like new videos of my coloring.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive Patron-Only streams!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGiveaways! Like books, prints, or original art! \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon also allows us to interact directly! We can chat about comics and games, you can suggest drawings or ask questions, and more!\u00a0This is a really awesome platform - you can donate as much as you want! If you feel the content here is worth more than $1 and you want to pledge more, that\u0027s awesome and I sincerely appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have an \u003cstrong\u003eOriginal Art Commission \u003c/strong\u003etier! I don\u0027t take many commissions outside of conventions, so if you\u0027d like to get some original art by me - this is your chance! Pieces are full Copic Marker color, illustrated on 6x9 Bristol board - just like the commissions I do at cons! Shipping within the US is included, and shipping is available internationally for just $5 more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.mattherms.com/uploads/4/8/4/6/48467019/patreon03.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThank you guys so much! Your support has made a world of difference these last ten years, and I am so grateful that I get to do what I do in large part because of you!"
