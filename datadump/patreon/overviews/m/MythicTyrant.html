    "summary": "Hey guys and gals!  And welcome to the MythicTyrant Patron site!  If you\u0027re here, you must be one of my AWESOME community members from my site \u003ca href=\"http://www.mythictyrant.com%21/\"\u003ewww.mythictyrant.com!\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, who am I?  Most people know me from the online strategy guides I\u0027ve created for the Halo franchise.  Others know me as the first person in the world to beat an entire Halo campaign on Mythic/LASO difficulty from start to finish without dying and then creating a strategy guide on how to do it.  I started this venture nearly 10 years ago when I wrote my first guide for the good folks at halo.bungie.org for Halo 3 and continued this tradition for Halo 3: ODST, Halo: Reach, and Halo 4.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNearly 7 years ago, I finally graduated to YouTube where I was able to create Legendary Walkthroughs for every single Halo game out there as well as strategy guides for several other games.  I enjoyed doing this part time up until a little over two years ago when I was the victim of a terrible motorcycle accident that rendered me crippled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo longer able to fulfill the physical attributes of my job field, I decided to go all in and make YouTube my full time job.  It has been immensely rewarding to not only create useful strategy guides but also fun, new shows to further entertain my community.  I now post a new video every single day on \u003ca href=\"http://www.mythictyrant.com%2C/\"\u003ewww.mythictyrant.com,\u003c/a\u003e working 7 days a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I was hoping to eventually get to a point where Adsense would be able to pay my basic bills (rent, food, internet, etc.), constant policy changes on YouTube as well as the dreaded event known as \"Adpocalyse\" have continued to push me back further and further.  With each step forward I take, YouTube continues to push me back.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope in setting up this page is that YOU, my dedicated community members can assist me in keeping my site alive and well for years to come so that I may continuously deliver the content that you\u0027ve been enjoying for nearly 10 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you immensely for all of your support both here and on YouTube, and to show my gratitude, those who wish to become patrons will receive a variety of rewards ranging from exclusive access to the community discord all the way up to participating in community play dates and even guest starring in one of my future videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your continued time and support!  Remember, amazing folks like YOU are the reason I continue to create, and I am very honored to have every single one of you as a member of my community! :-)"
