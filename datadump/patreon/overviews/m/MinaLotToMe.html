    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello there!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Kylla, otherwise known as MinaLotToMe! I make animations on YouTube, and I could use your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"So what\u0027s the dealio?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs most of you all know, animations take time to make and time is something I don\u0027t have a lot of. Money is a touchy subject and I don\u0027t like talking about it, but there\u0027s no way around it. Because of youtubes policy of getting revenue based on the number of minutes watched instead of the number of views, the amount I earn has dropped, which puts me at risk in not being able to pay for college. Which is bad because I won\u0027t be able to major in Animation and prove this can turn into something I can do for a living. So as of right now, Patreon will be my temporary solution since the option is there. Before you say \u003cstrong\u003e\"But you\u0027re animations are so short!\" \u003c/strong\u003ejust know this is \u003cstrong\u003eCOMPLETELY OPTIONAL\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0027s like tipping your waitress after you eat at a restaurant, you either do it or you don\u0027t, it\u0027s completely up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Your animations lack detail! Why would I support that?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI know they lack detail, but because of the style the animations are in now, it helps me make content faster. However, I do plan on doing more detailed, full length, and original animations or fanimations in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Do I have to pay to watch your videos now?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, they\u0027re still free to view on youtube. Patreon is like the youtube tip jar (only I trust it more). It\u0027s completely optional if you want to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Where\u0027s my money going?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBetter software to produce more videos on both MinaLotToMe\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLiving expenses and books for college.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"How does the payments work?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePer animation. I do not get money for any other video I make, only the animations themselves. Since I only upload a few videos a month, that shouldn\u0027t be a major expense on you, but sometimes I can upload an animation once a week. If that happens, you can set a cap on how much you pay so you don\u0027t have to pay more than you can afford.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
