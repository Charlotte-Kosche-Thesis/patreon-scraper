(about the length of Comedian in Cars Getting Coffee length, a show we love and a good length for web)\u00a0We have been developing the pilot or EPISODE 1 for almost a year now and are ready to bring it to you all! This page will help fund our efforts in taking this all to the next level turning this into a full time production for our small creative studio in the small town of Sabina in southwest Ohio. Our studio is the house I grew up in called \"ELM ST. Creative Studios.\" There we will create jobs and a vision of a scene that connects incredible talent that truly helps put light out into the world. ELM ST. Creative Studios can and will house our musical guests as they swing in from the road to freshen up and take part in what will hopefully be some serious viewership to promote their latest albums, songs, and art. Featuring all the behind the scenes, private concert series, including series premiere of EPISODE 1 and tons of organic content weekly of process and really a overall direct connection with me and the makers of this show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eINFLUENCES\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love all things Frank Oz and Jim Henson touched \"Dark Crystal\" being one them. One of my wife and I\u0027s\u00a0favorite movie is \"Big Trouble In Little China\" which helps maybe put things into perspective of where we are headed with all of this. Kubrick, Burton, Spielberg, P.T. Anderson and Tarintino are some of my Fav directors. Karate movies like \"Bloodsport\" \"American Ninja\" to awesome war type movies like \"Red Dawn\" (the original) and \"Toy Soldiers\" for sure are influences to create a world where the underdog\u0027s have to rise above and solve an impossible situation. This theme has pushed me to the narrative of this project. Pulp fiction, Apocalypto, Indiana Jones, and Wizard of Oz are on my all time favorites.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePRODUCTION\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eELM ST. Creative Studios provides a space to grow this production and provides space for our sets and models. Green screen and workshop and of course housing bands as they stop in to be on the Monster Trap show. On the team a friend of mine is artist Arthur Pauley and his family own a junkyard that turns into a haunted hollow type attraction that is open in October called \"The Final Resting Place\" \u00a0thefinalrestingplace.com \"haunted junkyard.\" It\u0027s an incredible world created by Arthur and a team of awesome creature creators and actors. \u00a0There we can do incredible scenes and expand the magic of this world. Getting to do fun imaginitive effects outdoors allows us to do effects that can be done large scale. The point being is that a lot of stars are aligning and stories coming together around our small town in southwest Ohio to offer you our audience something incredibly unique. The world of \"planet scaremare.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFUTURE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeries, Movies, Toys, Video Games, graphic novels, and more are in mind in the future for this world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis project really puts all our strengths into one pot and I think we can bring you something different and fresh!\u00a0I really appreciate the support and even watching the trailer.
