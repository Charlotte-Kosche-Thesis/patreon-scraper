This means that all of my content can be watched as many times as required - completely free of charge. I would like to continue providing this service for as long as I can, which is why I have formed a Patreon creator\u0027s account. As of August 2016 I have made over 350 English lessons, some of which are over 30 minutes long. Each video lesson consists of vivid explanations done in a fun and interesting way. I also make many of my lessons outdoors, which helps to make the lessons more vivid and engaging. My aim has always been to make English a fun and exciting subject. My lessons are aimed at everyone...everywhere, and they are all free."
