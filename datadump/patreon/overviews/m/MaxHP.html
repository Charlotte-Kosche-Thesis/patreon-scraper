I make a variety of videos (many surrouding Fire Emblem and generally video game stuff).\u00a0 I have a lot of fun making my videos but many of them take a lot of time and energy. So If you would like to directly support me and my videos, this and stream donations are the best way to do so!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThings that I make\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFire Emblem Character Analysis and Reworking - Similar to a series like Ghast Station\u0027s Support Science, here I take a look at a character or multiple characters, take a closer look at them, and then see what could have been done better or differently. (See my video on Rowan for a good example of this)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eReviews - Here I just analyze and take a close look at a game, show or movie that has captured my interest.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTop 5s - I think this one is pretty self explanatory, I\u0027m hardly the first person to make these.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDiscussion/Podcast type videos - Myself and some of my friends get together to discuss some hot topics in the gaming sphere (usually revolving around Nintendo and often Fire Emblem)\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eKazoo Covers - I play a song with only Kazoos.\u00a0 Shenanigans ensue.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eStreaming - I stream from time to time, often on Saturdays at 8pm. Every month(ish) I\u0027ll gather some friends as we play Monopoly. It can get pretty intense.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eOther - (Reactions, shitposts, updates, Stream highlights, etc)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eAbout Patreon\u003c/h1\u003ePatreon will help support me directly so that I can continue to make my videos bigger and better. I\u0027m finally finding my ground on this big wide platform and this will hopefully help me grow more as both a content creator, and as a professional video editor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIts also important to note that pledging via Patreon is \u003cstrong\u003e100% OPTIONAL\u003c/strong\u003e and that I will never charge to see my content.\u00a0 All of my content is and always will be available for anyone to view on my YouTube channel.\u00a0 This is just a method for those who would like to support me directly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhats in it for you?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\nAs I\u0027m still a relatively small channel, I only see it neccesary that I have one reward tier of $1.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nFor $1 per month you get access to my Patreon only Discord server! This is your direct through line to me and most many of my frequent collaborators. You can ask me questions, have discussions with other patrons, and occasionally I might throw together some voice chat related events.\u00a0 In addition, you get access to the Patreon only blog where I\u0027ll post behind the scenes images and WIPs of things I\u0027m working on! plus your name in the end card of my videos.\u00a0 You\u0027ll also get to see my videos 1-2 days before everybody else!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for reading! Regardless of whether you decide to pledge, I\u0027m glad to have your attention and viewership! :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
