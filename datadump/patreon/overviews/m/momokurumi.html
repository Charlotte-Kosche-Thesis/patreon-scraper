As a way for people to support me, I have created this Patreon here as a way for people to offer their financial support. In return I\u0027ll be sharing tips and WIP photos of some of my projects, and for those at higher tiers, I\u0027ll be offering monthly print rewards as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eAlthough I have turned my focus to earning revenue through Etsy, I still wanted to offer an option for friends, family, and fans to support me financially through this channel! I know not everyone is interested in my patterns or owning my costumes, but simply want to support me as an artist, and every little bit helps, honestly!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be posting some more in depth progress photos than on some of my other social media, but don\u0027t worry if you\u0027re not interested to pledge. The same content will still be available on all of my other social media! This is just an extra little bonus for those that are kind enough to pledge. \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eAbout Momo Kurumi\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt was in 2007 that I began cosplaying. I lightly dabbled with creating some costume pieces, but really began making the majority of my costumes in 2011 and on. I now makes several costumes a year and attend around 10 cons a year. My hope with this Patreon is to offer content to creative individuals that they can learn from, as well as allow fans and friends to show their support!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what kind of cosplays do I usually do? Well, started off focusing on anime cosplays, such as characters from Rosario Vampire, Gurren Lagann, and Macross Frontier. My first cosplay was, embarrassingly enough, Sasuke Uchiha from Naruto! Haha, trust me, there are no photos. There is, however a video on YouTube. Props to you if you can find it- I won\u0027t deny it if you do. ;)\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://cosplayers.acparadise.com/69718/6eb92e9af9ce0274752868b24637f598.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\tPhoto by Koji\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnime was a great intro to cosplay, but I was quickly drawn to recreating childhood favorites from various animated shows and films like Danny Phantom, Peter Pan, The Incredibles, and more! Disney cosplays are one of my favorite things to cosplay because of their timeless designs and the fact that Disney is always popular- mainly with the kiddos! Nothing like bringing magic to peoples\u0027 days.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://cosplayers.acparadise.com/69718/69718-590c7c83fbeb1ed84cd0c94623e12b70.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\tPhoto by Anya Braddock Cosplay\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, I have dabbled with some console and online game cosplays here and there, but would love to do more! There will always be a soft spot for anything I played religiously as a kid *cough cough Neopets*, so no doubt look forward to seeing some more nostalgic throwbacks! But also keep an eye out for some more modern video game projects as well- hint hint. Even more recently, comic cosplays have been a fun genre of costumes for me. There\u0027s nothing more empowering than getting to play a super hero (or villain!) for a day, so expect to also see more comic costumes!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://cosplayers.acparadise.com/69718/69718-1649706db4c3abfffdca48492ea7cd48.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\tPhoto by Koji\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat else lies in the future? Pop trends, famous figures, historical fashion- all genres and sources of inspiration that are just the tip of the iceberg! Just this past Halloween, I made Selena Quintanilla\u0027s famous sparkling bodysuit from The Last Concert.\u00a0The possibilities are endless!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition to cosplay, I also enjoy drawing and illustration, photography, videography, and fashion. Luckily, most of these skills come in handy quite often in cosplay! There really couldn\u0027t be a better union of skills, honestly, which is why I enjoy this hobby so much.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/CAt83G4.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\tPhoto by Koji\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eMomo\u0027s Cosplay Goals\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nReady to take on new challenges and adventures, I have three main goals:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo provide educational, creative ideas that inspire artists and individuals, or to entertain those who enjoy my work with engaging and fun content!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreate new and ambitious cosplay projects will be worthy challenges of my skills, and showcase just how much I have grown as an artist over the past 10 years.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo begin traveling to cons as a cosplay guest where I hope to offer content and programing for the convention, and selling some of my work and products at the convention as an artist or vendor.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\nWith your help, Momo can fund her dream of turning her hobby into a full-time passion.
