I\u0027ve been unable to give all my time to my passion as I would like, as I\u0027m mostly trying to scramble up enough money to live by other means. That\u0027s unfortunately easier said than done for me, since I have a myriad of various health issues that are preventing me from working a regular job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me, I\u0027ll be able to bring more content to you that you\u0027d enjoy, as well as be able to afford necessary doctor visits and rent and other vital things like that! I\u0027ll also be able to help you improve as well, since I\u0027ll have time to make video processes and commentary over them! Step-by-steps will definitely be coming your way, and should this take off well, even a webcomic! (I\u0027m excited for this, but it\u0027ll take a lot of time, hence why it\u0027ll probably take a larger monthly sum for me to be able to afford to do this.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven the smallest amount will make the biggest difference, but even if you can\u0027t pledge anything, I still really appreciate you following me and liking my art. And I am still going to make most of my content free! (Most video processes, .psd files, things like that will be patron-only, however, but my step-by-step processes will be open for everyone! ...Just patrons will be able to see it before anyone else.)"
