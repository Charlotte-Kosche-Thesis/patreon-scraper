I make my living performing customized shows for major corporations. However, my real dream is to perform live theater shows around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis summer (2017) I took time off from my corporate gigs to go on tour. It was an experiment to see if the show was ready and how much time/energy it would take. The good news? The show received rave reviews and several awards. The honest truth? It was much more expensive than I could ever have anticipated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027ve decided to start this Patreon. A tour is expensive and I need all the help I can get. Money goes into show creation, props, photography/video equipment, rehearsals, promotion, marketing, printing costs, ticket sales, publicity, and more. As a Patron you will be helping me take my live show to the masses in a way that wouldn\u0027t be possible if I was doing this alone. With your help, I\u0027ll be able to go on an even larger tour and keep creating cutting-edge, mind blowing shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal is to take the show to better festivals and bigger venues. Eventually, I hope to film the show professionally and release it in full on my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that live entertainment is one of the most important things we have left today. We live in a world of technology and fast-moving ideas, but there is still something oh-so-exciting about sitting in the dark with several hundred other people and experiencing something that will only exist in that moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ln1ys3K.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I work with my wife to book corporate events around the world. Everything from poster design to promotional photos to client relations is done by just the two of us. It is a time consuming but rewarding pursuit, and it doesn\u0027t leave much extra time or resources to work on shows for public audiences. With additional support from patrons, we will be able to part from corporate work for a portion of the year to bring shows and content straight to the fans - people like YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YlKG2fv.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some other questions I get asked a lot:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I see a show? \u003c/strong\u003e- Most of the time, unfortunately, the answer is no. 99% of my work is for private/corporate events.\u00a0Thanks to Patrons, I\u0027ll finally be able to take the show on the road and answer this\u00a0question with a resounding YES.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow long have you been reading minds?\u003c/strong\u003e - For over 20 years! I was obsessed with it as a child and kept working on it. I always forget how different my job is because I have been doing it for most of my life and it just feels normal to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I hire you for an event?\u003c/strong\u003e - The point of this Patreon is not to advertise my services. I\u0027m really just hoping to find people who value my work and want to support interesting projects. If you really wish to book me you can find more information on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.marktoland.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you read minds?\u003c/strong\u003e - Now you\u0027re asking too many questions. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for becoming a Patron and supporting my projects.
