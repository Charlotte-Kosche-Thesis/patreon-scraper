    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m here because someone recommended it and I\u0027m still here because it actually help me move forward in my lifelong passion to tell stories via comics. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a kid, I scribbled on the wall and cupboards. Instead of spanking me, Mum gave me paper and crayons (God bless her). I fell in love with anime \u0026amp; manga. How can one not love huge mecha, magical girls, assassin samurais, ninjas, chibi creatures, youkais and wizards? \u00a0Since I grew in church, I often wondered who is Jesus, why are there denominations, why the bible has weird stories, why the hypocrisy and stuff like that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I typically write shoujo or slice-of-life stories with faith-based perspectives. I also used to\u00a0actively update\u00a0a website (theproject.us) with a bunch of like-minded cool folks. However, we all ended up getting busy with jobs, travels, parenthood, bills, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy short term goal is to simply pick up from where I left with unfinished projects so that I can move on to new projects and develop my drawing skills. Yay! Any pledges will go towards basic art supplies and mini-publishing ventures.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy long term goal is to explore switching to drawing comics full-time. I\u0027m currently a full-time scientist with management responsibilities. I work between 7.30 am to 7 pm. Therefore, I only draw during the weekends when I\u0027m not travelling/running errands/socializing/serving in church. My updates are terribly sporadic. In fact, I just came out of a hiatus. One day, I hope pledges will be enough so I can make this leap of faith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy didn\u0027t I pursue this earlier? \u003cbr\u003e#1)\u00a0I was advised to study science and be a doctor, dentist, engineer, lawyer or accountant. I was told that I\u0027d be a\u00a0homeless, starving and poor artist. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e#2)\u00a0I was also told comics are for kids and I should grow up.\u00a0I \u003cem\u003estill hear that today\u003c/em\u003e whenever I tell others about my hobby. Some are surprised I\u0027m still drawing. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e#3) I was also told that I can serve God better in \u003cem\u003eother\u003c/em\u003e ministries or missions. Anime-manga is considered dirty/vile/perverted by some. I guess drawing comics is not considered a talent or gift worth taking seriously. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve tried different things in life but I know drawing ultimately makes me happy and I really wish I could do it more. It\u0027s my ultimate life dream to have a studio and draw until I drop dead (haha!). I\u0027ve procrastinated all these years but I\u0027d like to pursue it before it\u0027s too late. No regrets, right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you find my humble portfolio of comics worth your reading time. I have 1 ongoing story (\u003cstrong\u003eKingdomCome\u003c/strong\u003e) and 2 completed stories (\u003cstrong\u003eHome,\u00a0Merry Gentlemen\u003c/strong\u003e) at the website.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eDanielle\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(a collaboration with ymiblogging) is hosted at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ymi.today/2011/12/danielle/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://ymi.today/2011/12/danielle/\u003c/a\u003e). EDIT: Yes, Merry Gentlemen is completed! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank for your support in advance and welcome any feedback, ideas or suggestions at \u003ca class=\"__cf_email__\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e[email\u00a0protected]\u003c/a\u003e\n/*  */ I still have a lot to learn, grow and improve in.

     "description": "This series is my first online webcomic. It has gone through 1 round of revisions and it got stuck in hiatus around 2010. Since I feel committed to close a project whenever I start one, my goal is to breath life back into it and keep it going until the end. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, it stands at Chapter 11. I plan to step back and revise Chapter 10. After that,\u00a0I estimate another 10+ chapters where of 25 pages/ chapter = minimum 250 pages. Woah. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow much time should I project for this ambitious goal? I target to bring it to a close by December 2016. With estimated amount of ~$20/month to i) maintain TheProject website ii) global transactional fees (2%) iii) art supplies + hardware upgrade ==\u0026gt; I suppose reaching the total maximum $2-3 per comic page should suffice? All I can say that it\u0027s one of my more Christian-explicit comic projects that seems worth pursuing until the end.
