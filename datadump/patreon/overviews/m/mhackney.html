Most of my life my friends have called me a Renaissance Man \u2013 well before I even knew what that meant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been\u00a0pushing the envelope in FFF (fused filament fabrication) 3D printing for over 12 years.

So here I am!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got started in 3D printing in early 2005 - about a year after\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://reprap.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRepRap\u003c/a\u003e was founded. When I came across RepRap, I realized that I had the core of a 3D printer in a CNC milling machine that I converted from an X2 mini mill. The \"only\" thing it needed was a hot end and extruder! Little did I realize that additive manufacturing would become an obsession and passion. I spent several years with that simple printer, tinkering off and on and making a lot of really horrid parts. But I recognized the potential and, on the rare occasion when one of my CAD designs became a real part, it was magic - and very addictive. I know where my followers and compatriots are coming from when I see the glimmer of excitement in their eyes or read their emails.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I\u0027ve made some significant contributions to the art and science of 3D printing. In the early days of all-metal hot ends and the E3D V5 hot end, many of us experienced odd - barely reproducible - problems with filament jams. I spent an inordinate amount of time designing and conducting experiments that ultimately led\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://e3d-online.com/index.php?route=extras/blog/getblog\u0026amp;blog_id=21\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eE3D Online to redesign the nozzle geometry\u003c/a\u003e for their (awesome) V6 hot end. I was also an early advocate for PEI print surfaces and my instructions on how to install and use them have helped literally 10s of 1000s of printers world wide. In fact, Lulzbot sent me one of their Taz printers as a thank you for my work. Several years ago I developed a functional, completely 3D printed fly fishing reel. \u003cem\u003eField \u0026amp; Stream\u003c/em\u003e magazine asked me for one and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdDskTQPK_s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecreated this amazing video\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve had a few other firsts too.\u00a0I could go on and on but I\u0027ll spare you unless you ask!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough this Patreon is focused on my work in 3D printing I do have many, many other interests and expertise, starting with my Ph.D. in Inorganic Main Group Chemistry. I hold three patents in three completely different fields of chemistry, materials science and software. I find that my expertise and experience in many other areas often provide a different way of looking at a problem or design in 3D printing - everything is oddly intertwined in that way. I own and operate\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.eclecticangler.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEclectic Angler\u003c/a\u003e where I offer machined fly fishing reel kits that I develop and manufacture. I also run\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://reellinespress\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eReel Lines Press\u003c/a\u003e where I publish books I\u0027ve written on fly fishing as well as books from several other authors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo sum it all up...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m constantly seeking knowledge, sometimes in very odd places. I am a technologist, scientist, artist (frustrated), designer, manufacturer, author, publisher and many other things. What I\u0027m not is bored or boring!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve benefitted from my work or even direct help, I hope you will support me by pledging here on Patreon. Although I do what I do simply for the love and pursuit of knowledge, your contributions are a big motivator to keep me forging the new trail.\u003cbr\u003e"
