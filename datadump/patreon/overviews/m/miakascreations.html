    "summary": "*Quick note* You may have come across this page accidentally recently and are curious as to why no one is here. Well, at this moment, the page has not been publicly announced, even though it is public. The current scheduled release date is set for June 1st which is after my next PET scan and I get the big thumbs up. Until then, I will post tidbits here and there for practice and I would absolutely love any advise on how to make my projects, posts, or even my tiers better. Hey, don\u0027t let that stop you from signing up if you wanted to get a jump start on my awesome page! Just be aware that none of the larger tiers will be honored until June 1st. June is my birthday month, after all, as well as my anniversary month (12 years) for IMVU, so I think it is quit fitting. :D\u003cbr\u003eAlright, you can now read my intro below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for joining me on my journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! My name is April, aka miaka618 on just about every site I sign up with. Trivia time! 6 18 is actually my birthday, so let\u0027s eat cake!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk...about me. I am a 3D designer and animator primarily for IMVU and have been for the past 12 years. For about half of that time I have been dabbling in 3D printing using Shapeways as my go to printing service. Last year I got my own 3D printer...now I have 2. Oh happy times! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout 2 years ago I was diagnosed with cancer. Now that the cancer train is finally slowing to a crawl, I want to use Patreon to get back to doing what I love and possibly pay some of my medical bills in the process. I am going to share videos of my work process as well as provide 3D printing and IMVU files for my awesome patrons and maybe throw in some silly tidbits with our ferrets and/or kids and cat. You know, behind the scenes stuff.\u00a0 ;)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you are as excited as I am about joining a community of 3D enthusiasts and getting some need stuff in the process!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eGo team!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat to learn a little bit more about me?
