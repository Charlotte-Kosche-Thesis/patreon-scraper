You can see more of my work on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.danamariehosler.com/\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.shopdanamariehosler.tictail.com\"\u003emy shop\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mightypigeon_art\"\u003emy instagram\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began my professional career as a freelance children\u0027s book \u0026amp; magazine Illustrator, and a one-of-a-kind doll maker, creating limited edition plush for collectors all over the world. Over time, I started freelancing less and less, and stepped back from publishing, as my business grew and other projects took over. And now as I enter my 20th year in business, I find myself wanting to reconnect with some of my former goals and pursue some others that I have had to put off for far too long... and that\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have some pretty big goals for 2018... \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I want to get back into the publishing world, freshen up my portfolio and start sending my work out to Art Directors again. I also want to create and publish the 2nd series of my Under Appreciated Animals Alphabet\u2122 (the 1st series was released in 2012 and its definitely time to meet some new creatures!). I plan to eventually utilize Kickstarter\u0027s platform to fund the massive overhead of producing the actual cards and other merchandise-- series 1 had its very successful start on Kickstarter way back when), but in the interim, I need to able to fund the many hours of research and creation time... \u003cstrong\u003eand that\u0027s where YOU come in!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eEvery month \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI will be creating a new Illustration for my professional portfolio \u003c/strong\u003e(I mean, hopefully I\u0027ll be making more than that, but the goal will be at least one piece SPECIFICALLY for my portfolio). The idea is that I\u0027ll end up with a piece I love \u0026amp; could use as a promotional mailer to send to Art Directors and other creative professionals I\u0027d like to work with.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0You\u0027ll get behind the scenes looks into the studio and my process; there will also be exclusive content you can only see here on my Patreon (things like\u00a0time-lapse videos, rejected sketches, Q\u0026amp;A and more!). \u003c/strong\u003eI will need to send postcards out to ADs so why not send you all some too? Help me stay on top of my game, friends!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdditionally, I\u0027ll be working on those animal illustrations! \u003c/strong\u003eAs I complete my research and work on sketches, you\u0027ll be in the loop on the project.

And without taking risks, its hard to move ahead with passion projects. And without passion projects, well... you may as well be a robot. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvery month, your reliable contribution allows me to:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* \u003c/strong\u003eTake time \"off\" from production work and soulless design jobs, and strike out into new creative territory on passion projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e* Actually pay myself a living wage for those behind the scenes aspects of making new work that won\u0027t be able to generate its own income for many months-- that legwork like research and sketching and product testing and more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e* Purchase promotional mailers in bulk (which is the best bet for us all!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e* Quite literally keep the lights on in my studio!\u003cbr\u003e* Take the risks of dreaming... what ELSE could I do?!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e* Spend less time cutting corners and saying no \u0026amp; more time exploring what I\u0027m truly good at and saying YES to new opportunities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU *so* much for reading and I do hope you\u0027ll consider supporting me and my work! \u003c/strong\u003eOver on the Rewards page is the CURRENT (1/1/18) Rewards Tier Levels breakdown; please note that I will be adding to these options in the months to come, so people can increase their support level \u0026amp;/or opt into the Under Appreciated Animals packages, as well as getting larger prints \u0026amp; more.
