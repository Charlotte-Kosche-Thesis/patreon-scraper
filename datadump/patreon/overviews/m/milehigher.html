Truly you guys have made this dream of ours possible, and without you, it would not have been possible. We have decided to make a Patreon page together because we feel that we are a package deal now and also because our content goes hand in hand together. This Patreon page will directly support both of our YouTube channels including our podcast we started together. Both of us have so much more exciting content planned for the future many of which won\u0027t be advertiser-friendly so we hope you will consider becoming a patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did we start a Patreon page? Simple answer because of YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUnfortunately, the very website which has allowed us to grow our channels and platform has begun turning their back on creators. Over the last year or so channels like ours have had videos demonetized by YouTube, due to the fact that they don\u0027t abide by a strict set of \"advertiser-friendly\" guidelines. That means many of our videos including conspiracy theories, where is, and missing person\u0027s videos have made a fraction of the amount money from advertisements that they used to because they have been deemed not \"advertiser-friendly\". Not only are many of our videos not considered \"advertiser-friendly\", but advertisers now have more control over where they want to run their advertisements including on opting out to advertise on video content like ours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is the part I hate...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of all these changes at YouTube, it has made it much harder for us to focus 100% all of our efforts on our channels and continue making the content we love. We don\u0027t want to have to feel like we may not be able to keep the channels going because of the instability of our income. We have never wanted to ask our viewers for anything, but with YouTube ad revenue the way it is now, we did what many other YouTubers have done and started a Patreon. We decided to create this Patreon page, in hopes that your support will allow us to continue making content, without having to worry about Youtube, or it\u0027s poor treatment of creators. Patreon will be its own unique community where we will be offering special rewards to those who pledge support, and we are excited to continue to improve them as time goes on. We are still figuring out the ins and outs so bare with us. But we have a lot of great plans for Patreon so stick with us, it will get better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately,\u00a0 we don\u0027t want to make content that pleases advertisers. We want to make content that we love, and that you guys will appreciate and enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the bottom of our hearts, we want to thank you for dropping by and supporting our work and YouTube channels. We understand not everyone is able to pledge, and by no means do we want to make you feel any pressure to do so. You can still support us in so many other ways like subscribing to our Vlog channel Kendaily, subscribing and listening to our podcast or by just simply following us on social media. Our only wish is to continue this channel and keep creating interesting and thought-provoking content for you. We hope you will consider lending your support so that we will be here for many years to come.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe thank you and hope you all know how much you mean to us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay woke!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKendall Rae \u0026amp; Joshledore\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.thatawesomeshirt.com/images/get/935/430x550/\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
