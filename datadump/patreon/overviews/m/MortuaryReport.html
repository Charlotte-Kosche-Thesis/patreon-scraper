    "summary": "Hiya! My name is Heather. I used to be a funeral director, embalmer, and crematory operator. I spent a year working in the cannabis industry after my work in deathcare and another year as a tech writer for a software company. That company recently terminated my contract with them, so I\u0027m currently sans employment.\u00a0When I\u0027m not giving my all to my community, I\u0027m a writer - and, perhaps more importantly - a chronic pain patient. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn June of 2014, I was diagnosed with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehlers%E2%80%93Danlos_syndromes\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome\u003c/a\u003e (hEDS). Long story short, it\u0027s a genetic disorder that causes my body to produce collagen incorrectly. Unfortunately, collagen is in all of your connective tissues. My joints dislocate daily, and I live in a constant level of pain that most people rarely reach outside of the ER. I deal with a number of co-morbidities as well, including\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell_activation_syndrome\"\u003eMCAS\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen_sclerosus\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elichen sclerosus\u003c/a\u003e (nsfw), and bipolar disorder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a patient means lots of specialists, lots of medications, lots of medical management and lots (and lots!) of surgeries and surgical interventions, such as nerve blocks and ablations. Since March of 2013, I\u0027ve had three major joint surgeries. Because EDS is a degenerative disease, there are more to come, without question.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year, I ran an amazing medical fundraiser to help pay for foot surgery, but I hate not giving back to the badass community that supports me.\u00a0The income from this page helps to cover my exorbitant medical expenses\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon Works\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is pretty amazing because it allows you, my support system, to pledge a donation every time I produce a new piece of writing. You pick a donation level (with a minimum of $1!) \u00a0to be charged every time I upload a new bit of artwork. Tuesdays are #TwitterTuesdays - I\u0027ll link to storified verisions of my most popular tweetstorms for the last week. Thursdays are #TBT, as voted for on Twitter. Fridays are for Photoessays - these are usually Patron only, but excerpts may be available outside of Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m working on rewards! Right now I\u0027m finding it challenging to manage my chronic illnesses and making art.\u00a0If you\u0027re frustrated with Patreon and interested in making a one-time donation instead, my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePaypal\u003c/a\u003e can be accessed at \u003ca class=\"__cf_email__\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e[email\u00a0protected]\u003c/a\u003e\n/*  */ If you want to work something out for regular patronage via Paypal or another payment platform, shoot me a message and we\u0027ll work something out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEternal Return\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor patrons who were originally here for my novella, Eternal Return, let\u0027s just say that I completely gutted it and I\u0027m working on turning it into something readable. I\u0027m not sure it ever will be readable. If you\u0027re interested in a copy of the original mess of the first five or six chapters, let me know. Anyone who pledges more than $3 can have access to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove you guys."
