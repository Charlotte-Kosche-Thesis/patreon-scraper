I\u0027m a content creator, a lover of all things cat, an advocate of mindfulness, compassion and positive psychology, a member of the LGBTQ community, an online personality, an offline personality, a Canadian, and most importantly, a YOUTUBER. I\u0027ve been making videos in various bedrooms (not like that, stop it), cuddling various cats, for years now. It\u0027s been an incredible adventure. I love what I do, and I want to do more of it. Do it better and more and do it more and do it better. The more doing it the better, is what I\u0027m trying to say (stop it).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon? What is this site? Where am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowd-funding platform for content creators. It\u0027s sort of like Indiegogo, only instead of supporting one big project one time, continuous, small projects are funded through your monthly support.\u00a0Becoming someone\u0027s \"Patron\" helps content creators like myself maintain a consistent stream of funding.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eMy content is free and will remain free\u003c/strong\u003e, don\u0027t worry! Patreon is simply\u00a0a way to support the creators you really care about, \u003cem\u003eif you choose to do so\u003c/em\u003e. Every bit helps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what do you make and when do you make it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make videos every Friday (and Tuesday if you\u0027re lucky) on my main channel\u00a0- MissFenderr. I create videos on a wide range of topics, including mental health, sexuality, and compassionate living being my specialties. I also run The Compassion Revolution, a community dedicated to bringing more mindfulness and compassion into our lives and the lives of those around us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are here, reading this, I take it you are already a part of the Fenderr Family. A part of this community. I want to thank you for that. Whether you become a Patron or not, know that I appreciate you and every second of support you give me, and have given me for years. Thank you.\u003cstrong\u003e I love you all so much.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
