Since then, I\u0027ve learned so much more and have had some amazing experiences I never imagined I would have when I started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of what I\u0027ve learned along the way was from creating episodes where we discussed and demonstrated topics such as choosing \u0026amp; using tools, joinery techniques, and especially by building projects (both big and small) on the show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut an even larger percentage of what I\u0027ve learned came from all the amazing interactions with \u003cstrong\u003eYOU the audience!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nContent on \u003cstrong\u003eMatt\u0027s Basement Workshop\u003c/strong\u003e has always been influenced by you. It\u0027s from your ideas and suggestions that I\u0027ve steered the show to be what it is today, and with your continued support we can make it even better than before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goals are simple. I plan to use the income donated by \u003cstrong\u003ePatrons of Matt\u0027s Basement Workshop\u003c/strong\u003e to continue creating content because for once I\u0027ll be freed of having to spend time searching for advertisers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn other words, I\u0027ll be able to spend less time on the business-side of the podcast and concentrate more on the content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis would free me up to get out from behind the keyboard and in front of the camera or the mic to produce bonus content, which could possibly include the return of the wildly popular \u003ca href=\"http://spokenwoodpodcast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Spoken Wood Podcast,\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eALSO\u003c/strong\u003e maybe even turn on the live-stream cameras and hangout with my fellow woodworkers online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTogether we can make \u003cstrong\u003eMatt\u2019s Basement Workshop\u003c/strong\u003e an entirely audience-funded \u0026amp; driven show, won\u2019t you help me?\u003cbr\u003e"
