    "summary": "Hi there!\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Myrna Moonstruck; a model hailing from Eindhoven, The Netherlands. I\u0027m on a quest turning my hobbies into my profession. For over 6 years I\u0027ve been doing fantasy and gothic photoshoots, as both a model and designer. After graduating from fashion school, I\u2019m dreaming of taking my passions to a new professional level. And, with your help and kindness, I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll be able to make it so!\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u2019ve started this Patreon account. I\u2019d love it if you could consider making an investment in my modelling and designing career. In return I\u2019ll make sure you can benefit from a whole bunch of rewards ^^ Whether you want to make a one-time donation or a monthly pledge, you\u0027ll help me a lot, and make me incredibly happy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Does Signing Up Get Me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I have a pretty long (and still growing!) list of rewards to give to the Patrons who are helping me achieve my dreams. Starting at just $1, you can pick your favourite rewards from sneakpeeks, high-quality photosets that are Patreons Exclusive, to personalized photos in both digital and print form, polaroid imagery and even photoshoots! I\u0027m also open to creating new reward tiers, so if you\u0027re interested in something that isn\u0027t listed yet, I will be more than happy to discuss the possibilities with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn time, though, I want to take this even further. The aim of this Patreon is to help me get the funds together to help invest in better equipment. With your help, I\u0027ll be able to create a photo studio at home, so I can make more epic content. One of my goals is to introduce GIFs and videos but, at the moment, I simply lack the equipment to do it right. \u003cbr\u003eSo, whether you want to benefit from getting access to exclusive goodies that you can\u0027t find on any of my other social media, or if you just want to help me support my long-term future with photoshoots and costume design, you\u0027re in the right place!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Do You Need A Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get this question a lot, and it\u2019s obviously a very fair question! As mentioned above, I am using Patreon to help me get better equipment, which in turn will help me carry out higher quality photoshoots. The money I earn from my Patreon will go directly into things like my shooting wardrobe and personal sewing projects, as well as travelling expense and equipment costs.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ll also use what is left to cover the \u2018dull\u2019 stuff like health insurance and bills :\u0027) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe long-term goal is to be able to do photoshoots abroad (there are so many amazing artists out there), invest in studio equipment (oh, how I love making self portraits) and take what was once something I just enjoyed doing into the professional realm.\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my work and would like to help me reach that professional pinnacle, please consider subscribing as a Patron; it would mean the world to me! \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e What If I Don\u0027t Like Patreon, But Still Want to Support You?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel like Patreon isn\u0027t for you, you can always donate at\u00a0https://www.paypal.me/MyrnaMoonstruck. You won\u0027t get any of the nice rewards, though!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003eX Myrna \u003cbr\u003e"
