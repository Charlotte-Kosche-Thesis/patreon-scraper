    "summary": "Hi ladies and gents! I\u0027m Mikomi Chan, and I\u0027m a cosplayer turned costume designer and fabricator! I started cosplaying when I was getting ready to start my junior year in college, and it has been a roller coaster ever since. I have always been heavily influenced by video games, anime, and comic books, and may aspects of geek culture have been some of my favorite things in life. I\u0027ve been an active cosplayer since 2011, but my technical first cosplay was Princess Zelda for Spirit Week in middle school back in the early 2000s. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplaying just kind of came out of the blue for me. With one of my friends from high school, we decided to go to Otakon for our first ever convention. We were the most excited weeb trash you could possibly imagine; we had individual highlighted copies of Otakon\u0027s panel schedule the day they came out. We had everything all taken care of for the con WAAAAAAY far in advance, and about a month and a half out from the con, we were like \"Should we cosplay? People do that at cons, right?\" So we decided to quickly buy some cosplays off eBay and cosplay for the first time ever. It was the weirdest feeling for me to walk from the parking garage to the BCC, but once we got there, it was so amazing. There were dozens of others in cosplays, just like us, and it was almost like a child going to Disney for the first time. Needless to say, I had an amazing time, and it got me hooked. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, fast forward six years later, and a lot has changed for me. I am out of college, I\u0027ve gotten married, and I\u0027ve created my own spawn! The one thing that has remained constant through all of this has been cosplay. Through this time period, I\u0027ve developed skills in sewing, foam work, design, weathering, metal casting, leatherwork, and woodwork. I actually have completed a formal apprenticeship for leatherwork and woodwork for theater and film fabrication. I make most of my own costumes, and I have a successful design and fabrication operation within the cosplay community. I have won awards both in and outside of the cosplay community for costumery, and my work has been featured in all forms of media including magazines, newspapers, television, film, websites, and art galleries. I\u0027ve even been brought in as a guest lecture to local colleges to speak about costumery and cosplay. Occasionally I also appear at conventions across the country as a cosplay guest! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I want to accomplish with this Patreon is to gain more support for my online ventures in the cosplay community. I\u0027ve recently taken up streaming on Twitch, so I can help teach others things about costuming, and I use it as a platform to do monthly tutorials for specific character cosplays. Another thing I want to do with this Patreon is do more donator specific content. I think it\u0027d be a really cool idea to do cosplay requests. I always get so many cosplay requests every year, most of the time for characters I already wanted to cosplay anyways, but the only thing that has been keeping me from making these cosplays has been money. Needless to say, with a family and the many monetary responsibilities that goes with a family, I have a very limited budget for making my own cosplays. Last year I funded almost two cosplays from Patreon, and I\u0027d love to be able to fund more cosplays from Patreon ^_^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

For the first two days of every month, I will take one suggestion from every patron in this level, and I will compile them into a poll. Whichever one has the most votes amongst you all by the end of week one, I will make and photograph by the end of the month. As an added bonus, I will include high res files for three of the images from the shoot to send to you to use as wallpapers, backgrounds, and personal prints.\u003c/p\u003e",
