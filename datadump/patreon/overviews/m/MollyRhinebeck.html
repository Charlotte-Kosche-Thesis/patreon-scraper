It\u0027s been extremely rewarding to be able to produce these shows for you all and I\u0027m so excited to continue doing so for... Well, the foreseeable future! I\u0027m making this Patreon here to help me cover the costs of spending my time on this hobby, considering that the amount of time I spend on it probably amounts to that of at least a part-time job! With your help I can get better mics, headsets, keep my bills paid, and make sure I can bring y\u0027all the best possible stuff I\u0027m capable of each and every week. Thank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to @pollyannadays on twitter for putting the banner above together for me, as well as @definitelyexists, @knitspecibus, @snorlaqs, and @deathofrats01 for the art contained within! \u0026lt;3"
