Women of every age, size and shape wake up in the morning feeling discontent with the bodies they were given. Women die every day, sad that they didn\u0027t reach physical perfection in their lifetime. Help me spread awareness so that fewer women spend their days and nights torturing themselves by focusing on what they hate, and instead, learn to accept- and eventually love- the things about themselves they \u003cem\u003enever \u003c/em\u003ethought they would.
