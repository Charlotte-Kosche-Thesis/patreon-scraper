I then take what I have found and build a form that will honestly reflect what I have learned.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough my research on this project I have learned about the lives of kids in poverty, who were wrongly targeted to be trained and used as mercenaries, before they were old enough to understand what this meant or the impact it would have on their lives. This exploitation was carried out with the approval of authorities within the US government. These were illegal acts. Later, after they completed their work, some of these same kids were used as patsies, to be falsely charged with crimes which caused fear in targeted segments of the American public.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis research was began by my late father, who was a managing editor at a major newspaper in the Seattle area. He was told to drop his investigation, refused, and died shortly thereafter under questionable circumstances.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLearn more\u00a0\u003ca\u003eabout the project\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
