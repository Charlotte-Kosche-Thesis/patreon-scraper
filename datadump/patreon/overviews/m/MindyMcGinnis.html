    "summary": "I\u0027m author Mindy McGinnis. In 2010 I signed with a literary agent after having spent ten years in the query trenches. Many of the mistakes I made during my path to publication were easily avoided, and I could have been published much more quickly if I\u0027d done the necessary research. After learning the ropes through a large and scattered network of writer sites, blogs, and forums, I finally found a measure of success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started the blog Writer, Writer, Pants on Fire shortly after landing my first book deal. I decided to pay it forward by hosting a blog where I asked published and agented authors all the questions I\u0027d had when I was aspiring. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017 I decided that if the blog was going to keep existing it also needed to grow and offer my followers something new. The\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://writerwriterpantsonfire.podbean.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWriter, Writer, Pants on Fire podcast\u003c/a\u003e came from that idea. \u003cbr\u003eI have been broadcasting weekly since March of 2017. With 57 episodes aired, more than 1500 followers and over 13k downloads, the podcast is doing well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the content on the podcast is free, featuring author interviews and monthly roundups listing the guests and topics covered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the introduction of a Writer, Writer, Pants on Fire Patreon, you can have access to premium content. Agent and editor interviews will be in the tiers, as well as the chance to pose \u003cstrong\u003eyour\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0questions to upcoming guests.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, if you\u0027re just a fan of mine, there\u0027s plenty of opportunity for you to received signed swag, first printings of upcoming books, and collections featuring my short stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
