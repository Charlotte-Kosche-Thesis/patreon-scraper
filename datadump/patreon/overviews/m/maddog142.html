I am in my mid 30s and have a young family who I love spending time with. Along with my job in property in Australia, life is pretty busy and I dont get a lot of spare time but what time I have left I love to game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first experience as a gamer was in 1995, playing Transport Tycoon Deluxe on my 386 MS Dos computer. It was a big day for me that opened up an entire world of enjoyment, entertainment and escapism. I quickly became hooked on gaming and now, 20 years later, it remains an important and defining part of my life. Once a gamer, always a gamer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me creating content is an excuse for me to game. I get to play some pretty cool games, including sandbox, scifi, strategy and retro games that either take me forward into the future or hark back to my early years as a gamer. I invest a lot of time into producing content and love responding to comments, listening to your advice and suggestions and generally having fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I was focued on Youtube but now I am streaming more which is a lot more fun. More interactive and engaged with my growing community. I am streaming over on mixer.com so check me out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I need your help. I want to continue to improve the content I make, uprgrading my tech so I can playing games that you want to see. To do that I need your support. Pledge anything you can afford, but do not over commit. I am intentionally capping the rewards atm to the $20 level. But even $1 would be amazing. It would show you appreciate the effort and value the content I make.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that is it. Thank you for visiting my Patreon page. It means a lot of me. I hope you have a good day and I will see you all again next time. Bye bye now :)"
