I have always been a journal keeper. Father Christmas used to bring me a new journal every year at Christmas time and I always filled them with thoughts, quotes, doodles and pieces of ephemera. I was much happier as a child with some empty cereal boxes and glue than I was with dolls and toys. As an adult (in body not in mind ha ha!) nothing has changed. Well actually it has a little bit, I use lots of different art supplies and mediums whereas when I was a kiddo I only had felt tips pens really!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.mrsbrimbles.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/journalexamples1.jpg\" style=\"width: 645px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a whimsical sort, a lover of life and of herbal tea. I am a big contradiction... I love colour but I also love black and white especially when it comes to washi tape. I am not \u0027girly\u0027 yet I love splashes of \u0027hot pink\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy style can often be referred to as childlike as I like to draw whimsical cute characters. I also like to get my hands in there with paint and ink as well as create sketches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere on my Patreon I want to create lots of art with and for you. I want to share how I create art and give you lots of tips and inspiration so that you can get started on your journey. Through my chatty videos I want to connect with fellow journal and art lovers about the things that inspire us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.mrsbrimbles.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/journalexamples2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI have kept a journal for years and years, both written and visual, before I even really knew that there was a genre called \u2018art journalling\u2019 to me it was just my journal and in that journal I use what ever media I fancy. I don\u2019t like defining my journal as an art journal or a smash book it is just a journal and it is as much a part of me as my left arm is!  I am also a planner and have been so for years too much like art journalling and I love being a part of the planner community.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also sell my artwork as physical products in my online shop some examples of which are shown below. These are my own hand drawn artworks which have then been digitally enhanced by me using Photoshop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.mrsbrimbles.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/artworkexample.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChatty vlogs will be posted on 2nd of the month with the creative content posted on or as close to the 15th of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
