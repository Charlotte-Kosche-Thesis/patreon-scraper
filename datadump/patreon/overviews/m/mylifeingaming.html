    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027re Coury and Try. We started My Life in Gaming (MLiG) in October 2013 as a joint project so that we could utilize our professional video production and post-production expertise in making projects that we could get excited about.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe create highly produced and tightly edited videos that are casual, enthusiastic and... for lack of a better word, \n\u003cem\u003enice\u003c/em\u003e. We have no desire to rant. We just want to talk about things that we like and stuff we think is cool. We got a bit of recognition early on with our \u003cstrong\u003eHow to Beat\u003c/strong\u003e VHS-style series, which was heavily inspired by the old \"How to Win\" game tapes of the late 80\u0027s. We\u0027ve greatly expanded our offerings since then.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe don\u0027t like to think of ourselves as reviewers, so we prefer to refer to many of our episodes as \n\u003cstrong\u003eShowcases\u003c/strong\u003e. In other words, we want to show you games and hardware in the absolute best way possible, providing thorough information and historical context. We also have a series called \u003cstrong\u003eTips \u0026amp; Tweaks\u003c/strong\u003e, which presents ideas for setting up your gaming space, and how to use game hardware in ways that you might not have considered previously.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur most popular series right now is the \n\u003cstrong\u003eRGB Master Class\u003c/strong\u003e. This series is all about getting the best picture out of your retro console games, with a focus on what\u0027s possible using original hardware. The series is broken into \u003cstrong\u003eRGB 100\u003c/strong\u003e (the basics for getting into high quality retro gaming), \u003cstrong\u003eRGB 200\u003c/strong\u003e (console-specific episodes), and \u003cstrong\u003eRGB 300\u003c/strong\u003e (special topics and new developments). Our goal is to build the ultimate video resource on this subject that \u003cem\u003ewe\u003c/em\u003e wish existed back when we started getting into RGB gaming.\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjtD1mOZlPc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tRight now, we are extremely excited about creating \n\t\u003cstrong\u003edocumentaries\u003c/strong\u003e. This is something we have envisioned since the beginning of the channel, but we\u0027re just beginning to get into a position where producing more of these, more often, is becoming feasible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/df2zptiviBo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhy Patreon?\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe strive to constantly improve our work, and if you\u0027d like to help us do so, we\u0027d like to give you that option. If you decide not to, we totally get that too. Patreon itself doesn\u0027t change our goals, but it absolutely helps improve our show\u0027s look, production efficiency, and our ability to cover a wider variety of topics in greater depth.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe RGB Master Class\u003c/strong\u003e made it clear to us that we needed Patreon.\u00a0Things can get complicated (and expensive) when you want to cover these subjects as thoroughly as possible. Most consoles have several different revisions and mods available, and we want to address them all if we can. All of this stuff adds up.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon has continued to improve the depth and quality of these episodes in a profound way. We\u0027ve been able to get our hands on many more devices to include in each episode... whether simply because we could afford to cover shipping costs for special console revisions that we\u0027re borrowing, or to purchase particular cables and gear for testing. Just compare the episodes from 2014 and 2015 to those from 2016 and 2017... it becomes very apparent what Patreon has done for this series.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDocumentaries\u003c/strong\u003e are also a major part of our Patreon plans. We\u0027ve been stretching our Patreon funds to accomplish what we have so far, but every bit helps expand the scope of what we can do, and where we can do it. We\u0027re excited to begin producing more documentaries per year, but the cost of travel means that we have to save up for longer to go where our topics are. International travel for documentary work is absolutely in our future plans, which would not be even remotely possible without the help of patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do the pledges go toward?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eEvery donation goes toward improving My Life in Gaming. Whether it be video equipment to raise our production values to new heights, plane tickets for documentary travel, additional hardware to cover for the RGB Master Class, shipping costs for borrowed items, games we want to show and talk about - everything. We want to create the best-produced and most thorough videos that we possibly can, and we\u0027re very excited to share what you can make possible through your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
