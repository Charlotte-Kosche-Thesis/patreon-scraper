For a year and a half I was a paid staff writer for Creepy Catalog. Over the summer I decided to branch out on my own and essentially work for myself, exploring new projects and opportunities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile my experience with Creepy Catalog was fantastic and my new adventures are exciting, they\u0027re not exactly paying the bills. (A divorce out of the blue definitely didn\u0027t help either.) While I\u0027m not one to beg for money, exactly, it would make things a little easier to have some padding while I work towards becoming the next Stephen King.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously I will continue to create and write and spook, if you feel so inclined, a donation would be appreciated more than you\u0027ll ever know. And who knows, maybe if I hit it big someday, I can repay the favor."
