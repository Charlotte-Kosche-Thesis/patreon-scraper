Before there was an iPhone, there was Mac OS Ken. Before there was an iPad, there was Mac OS Ken. Apple Watch? Mac OS Ken preceded it by over nine years. Yet listeners to Mac OS Ken saw all of that coming... heard rumblings about Apple\u0027s entry into each category every weekday for weeks and months before their respective arrivals. From quarterly earnings to annual conferences and media events, Mac OS Ken has been a go-to destination to know more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support through Patreon will help keep Mac OS Ken going and growing. It will also help ease Ken\u0027s worried mind."
