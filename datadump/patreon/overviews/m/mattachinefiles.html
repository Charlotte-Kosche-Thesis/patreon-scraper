We\u0027re excited to be here so that we can gather support from listeners like you in order to make a better show with compelling stories from our past.\u003cbr\u003eSeason 1 took about 2 years to research, write, and produce, while my day jobs took most of my time and funded all of the production costs for the show. Now here\u0027s a chance for you to help spread our history, and along the way, give your feedback on what you\u0027d like to hear from the show in the future. We have a lot of ideas in store! We\u0027d like to hear yours as well.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeason 1 of \u003cem\u003eMattachine\u003c/em\u003e follows the secret organization created by Harry Hay, which catalyzed the gay rights movement in 1950. From its spark of inspiration in 1920s Chicago, through secret speakeasy-style meetings that brought together anonymous homosexuals, this season journeys into the McCarthyist paranoia that pulled the activists apart and scattered the seeds of the homosexual rights movement long before it was immortalized by Stonewall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003emattachinepod.com\u003cbr\u003eourhistorypod@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003eDonations of any size (outside of patreon, with Gold level benefits included) can be made through our website at mattachinepod.com/support.\u003cbr\u003e"
