    "summary": "Hi I\u0027m Morgan, I\u0027ve been animating, rigging, and writing tools in the visual effects industry for over 10 years now. Whatever I\u0027m working on, I tend to think a lot about improving workflows and efficiency though scripting. Early in my career and during my education, I relied a lot on tools and tutorials shared by the ever generous people of our industry, and so I\u0027ve always liked sharing back. Over the last several years, I\u0027ve put a handful of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://morganloomis.com/downloads/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eanimation tools\u003c/a\u003e, a few\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://morganloomis.com/category/tutorials/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etutorials\u003c/a\u003e, and a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://morganloomis.com/maya-rigs/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epuppet\u003c/a\u003e or two on my\u00a0website for free, and my goal was to get back into doing that regularly for at least a year. In 2016 I produced 1 tool a month, thanks to my patrons. Going forward, I\u0027m not holding myself to a regular schedule, so the pledge scheme is now per-creation, rather than per-month. My tools are open source and freely available to anyone, so your pledge is more about keeping myself inspired through accountability to you all, and building connections to artists who use these tools. As a pledging patron, you\u0027re essentially my client, and so I\u0027m also interested in your guidance and feedback. I have a short list of tools and tutorials that I\u0027d like to complete, but I also want to be working on things that people really want. So if you\u0027re interested in some new tools, or being a part of a dialog, or maybe even just want to say thanks for the tools you\u0027ve downloaded in the past, I\u0027d appreciate your contribution!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the gist of it, so you shouldn\u0027t feel obligated to read any more unless you\u0027d like some extra context...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think crowdfunding is the greatest thing to happen on the internet in the last several years. Kickstarter has been practically an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/morganloomis\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eaddiction\u003c/a\u003e to me:\u00a0the combination of discovering unique projects, and then the gratification of helping driven and talented people to achieve their goals is super fulfilling. More recently,\u00a0Patreon has been an exciting new way for artists to fund their passions, while also allowing patrons to easily and affordably support the arts. Both platforms provide a new, democratic distribution method that empower people with even the smallest scale projects to succeed, by the strength of concept and enthusiasm rather than capital. I just think it\u0027s the epitome of the internet, connecting people in meaningful ways to help one another directly, and reward creativity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thanks for your consideration, and even if your not a patron, feel free to visit\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://morganloomis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emorganloomis.com\u003c/a\u003e to follow where this goes!"
