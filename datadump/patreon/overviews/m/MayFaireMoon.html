    "summary": "There are so many places you can buy clothing now. You can walk into a million stores and buy the exact same thing in any of them. Where\u0027s the fun in that? Where\u0027s the expression? Either for you, or the person making that stuff? If you want something made by hand, crafted by hands and brains and passion, you need to find the people who are still doing that. Still pouring themselves into that work. It\u0027s a culture we all need to nourish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you know what else? We need more people who want to put art on your body, and don\u0027t care what size you are. So much commercial clothing is perfect for lower-number sizes, and leaves higher numbers out in the cold. Really small sizes get the short end of the stick, too. What\u0027s up with that? Does the size of your body somehow affect your sense of taste? Bah. I think not.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI run a business: \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MayFaireMoon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMayFaire Moon Corsets \u0026amp; Costumes\u003c/a\u003e. No bones about that. I make pretty things for awesome people, and I love what I do. I have customers all over the world, and they introduce me to their fandoms and passions, and let me be a part of that. It\u0027s wonderful, and it\u0027s the best job ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut when you\u0027re working hard on stuff for other people, sometimes, it\u0027s hard to create the things you really want to make just because. Not for a client, not for a show, but just because ohmyG-dwhatifItriedthiswouldn\u0027tthatbethebestthingever? Like, what if I could make corsets with embedded video screens? What if I could do an entire line of costumes based on Russian fairy tales? What if I tried dip-dyeing a finished corset just to see what would happen?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt present, I can\u0027t. I don\u0027t have the time, and sadly, I even more just don\u0027t have the money. I have to concentrate on the paying work, and on getting more paying work. So that\u0027s where-- I hope-- you come in. You, O Noble Patron, with your donation, give me the gift of breathing room. Space. A way to expand my creativity into not just what I have to do, but the cool things I COULD do: experimental ingredients, assistants, research. All the stuff that has to go to the wayside now because, like most artists, I\u0027m just too close to the edge. Which is awesome in classic rock songs, but not so much when rent and utilities are involved, you know?"
