    "summary": "I make videos specifically for the LGBTQ community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it didn\u0027t start off quite that way - not at first, at least.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI discovered ASMR several years ago, fascinated by the tingles and different ways the body responds to sound triggers based on tone, repetition, etc. After a while, I began to notice sounds I could create in my own home, and became interested in the idea of creating my own ASMR channel. While mulling the idea over, I stumbled on ASMR Roleplay, and was blown away by what I heard. People were providing comfort for others who dealt with loss, grief, depression, or other personal experiences in ways I hadn\u0027t thought of before. I\u0027d always been interested in acting in general, so discovering this was like opening a door to a new world of possibilities. While viewing one such channel, written in the subject as \u0027gender neutral,\u0027 I started reading comments and found one that simply said, \"Thank you so much for gender neutral content. It\u0027s so hard to find good stuff out there like this for the LGBTQ community.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWell, that\u0027s not fair\u003c/em\u003e, I thought, and searched through several videos out of curiosity. This person was exactly right - while some videos meant well, there was still some evidence to suggest the \u0027gender neutral\u0027 description had some heterosexual undertones. \u003cem\u003eMan,\u003c/em\u003e I thought, \u003cem\u003eI can\u0027t imagine how frustrating it must be to want this content, or need it, and have to substitute it for something else because you can\u0027t find it here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s when it hit me - \u003cem\u003eI \u003c/em\u003ecan do that. Friends had always told me I had a great voice, and there was clearly a need, so I wanted to answer. The first video I posted was comfort from an anxiety attack from a girlfriend, and the response was overwhelmingly positive. Since then, I\u0027ve posted videos twice a week and have started taking requests to help others who might be looking for comfort from a female voice, whether it be on a first date, help with insomnia, or something fun and playful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point of this channel, and every video I make, is to help others. The older I\u0027ve gotten, the more I\u0027ve realized how much I want to live my life helping anybody that I can. And, having gone through a lot of tough experiences in my own life - ranging from a strict upbringing, to terrible and damaging decision making, and dealing with my own depression and anxiety disorder - I use those as a way to comfort and hopefully aid others. The emails and messages I\u0027ve gotten since I\u0027ve started have all been very humbling, and every day I\u0027m grateful I took the chance. I had no idea it was going to become what it did, but I can\u0027t imagine things any differently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the channel has gotten popular, more and more emails have been requests usually followed up by \u0027I suffer from this, and a video would really help.\u0027 While still working on two videos a week for my channel on YouTube, I started this Patreon account as a way to possibly help people further - providing personalized content for whatever their needs may be. A video is well and good, but sometimes hearing someone say your name while providing what you need does more than you realize. With your support, I\u0027ll improve the quality of my work with better equipment and software, and continue to spread support and love to LGBTQ people all over the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much \u003c/strong\u003eto everyone who has viewed my content, subscribed, shared, and supported me!! I can\u0027t tell you enough how much it means to me, and I\u0027ll continue to do my best to give you content you can use to help yourself. Talk to you soon!\u003cbr\u003e"
