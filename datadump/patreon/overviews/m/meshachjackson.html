    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eFirst, thank you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was an aspiring artist since my teens, and struggled to find a way to support myself while making things since then. I built a career in technology \u0027on the side\u0027, to support my music and travel habits, and in 2014, I made a leap of faith. Again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter many ups and downs in music and business, art and life... I made a decision. I had waited long enough. It was time to put everything I had into making music, and into fulfilling a life of making things that mattered to me. I closed my web development company after 5 years in business, dramatically scaled down my possessions, and have lived out of suitcases and sublet apartments for years now to give myself the best chance at a good start down a path that has for so long called my name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour immediate support was overwhelming. And the experience has been better than I could have imagined.\u00a0For your part, you came to shows,\u00a0bought T-Shirts, requested cover songs, downloaded singles, and even took me into your homes with incredible generosity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I have taken many tours around the country (5 on Amtrak, and now in my car), I\u0027ve written dozens of new songs, and I\u0027ve worked on incredible projects with inspiring artists from all over the place. My path has taken me from music to film, comedy, politics, and beyond. I have worked on film crews in Fargo, North Dakota, and in abandoned subway stations underground in New York. I\u0027ve played private shows in picturesque vineyards, and in first grade classrooms. I won at open mic contests. I\u0027ve bombed at open mic contests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike with my career in technology, where one new skill leads to a new job, which leads to a new skill... I\u0027ve learned that creative fields tend to thrive on a wide variety of skills and influences. Therefore as a creative freelancer, you build your career on the back of thousands of small projects which lead to other, bigger ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is what brings me to Patreon, and the exciting new way that myself, and other creatives can build a career around these projects as we make them, and give them directly to you, the Patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon, I now have a way to provide new projects, releases, and products directly to you as I work on them, and offer you all kinds of exclusive access and swag to say thanks for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally...\u00a0I could not have done any of this without you, so for that I say again sincerely, Thank You.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- (Me)shach\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s In It For You?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much. I\u0027m transitioning to Patreon with full-force, and I\u0027m working every day on new content to release directly to this page. Here\u0027s just the starting list of things I\u0027m creating for Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA 91-day journal of my 2015 train tour around the country.\u003c/strong\u003e This is my daily journal which includes all sorts of stories, thoughts, names, places, and experiences I had on my full-summer trip with my guitar, too much gear, and a journal.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnreleased Original Music\u003c/strong\u003e. I have already pre-loaded several weeks worth of videos containing unreleased original songs. I\u0027ll be writing new songs, recording demos, and making videos for weekly release exclusively on Patreon.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive Video Streams. \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ll be doing monthly streams of living room shows, Q\u0026amp;A sessions, guitar / voice / songwriting lessons, and even collaboration sessions for whatever you\u0027re creating.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMerch Boxes\u003c/strong\u003e. As I grow my online store, and add new merchandise to sell, I\u0027ll send out boxes of new products, complete with treats like USB jump drives full of music and archived footage of shows from around the country.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eSo check out the Tiers to the right, and the current Goal on the left, and join me in a life full of art, exploration, and lots and lots of music."
