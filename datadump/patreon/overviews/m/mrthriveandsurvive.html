    "summary": "Hello to all of my subscribers. I have set-up this account in order to receive donations from those who are willing to support this work. I am currently in the process of working my way through the Social Security Disability application process. Without having to read all of what is below - my goal is simple: To spread the word of truth regarding the real ramifications of space, the earth and human\u0027s part in it and to shine a ligh into the darkness of evil which has spread the lies that we live on a spinning ball, hurling through space at nearly 1/2 BILLION miles per hour when considering all of the movements involved. Movement we never feel by the way.\u003cstrong\u003e A BIG LIE is coming, and nearly all will be deceived by it.\u003c/strong\u003e Belief in a round spinning ball earth allows that lie. The TRUTH about the earth, the solar system and such are all outlined on my channel with some of the highlights listed below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI initially started making videos under Mr. Thrive And Survive on YouTube in 2010. Initially, I was trying to help people realize that sooner or later, the government spending and the disregard for the value of the US Dollar (borrow now - pay later) would eventually lead to an economic crash of epic proportions. The idea was simple: Help educate people by exposing the problem and the lies to cover-up the problem, and also help people get organized in a fashion in order to prepare for their families. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn May of 2015, I stumbled rather randomly onto a video which tried to \"prove\" that the earth was \"flat\" rather than a ball. The video I saw presented a weatherman (a previous position I also held in the Us Navy) who was explaining away an \"impossible\" photo of nearly the complete Chicago skyline from a photographer located 60 miles away across Lake Michigan. The weatherman was dutifully explaining away the phenomenon as a \"superior mirage\" (a weather phenomenon and possible optical illusion caused over water under certain conditions). Having taken literally thousands of weather observations over the ocean while a weatherman in the US Navy, I immediately recognized that the \"superior mirage\" explanation was a pure work of fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I was making the video to \"debunk\" the Chicago skyline image as a possible superior mirage, I realized at that instant that the only possible explanation left to me was that the earth was indeed NOT a spinning ball. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was brand new to the subject but it captivated me instantly. I had always been into studying science (I do have a science degree - but not in physics) and enjoyed earth science particularly. Logic was always an attribute I was proud to display as well. Logically, I was left with no other explanation other than the fact that the earth was indeed FLAT. However, this was just the start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a Christian, I started to dive into the pages of the bible to see if any knowledge could be gleaned from the scriptures. Ashamed as I am to admit it, I first looked at secular science before I looked at the bible. A mistake I will never make again. We had been so programmed by science to take the subject of a flat earth with ridicule, that I first leaned upon science for the answers to my new dilemma. Much to my surprise, I quickly found out that all of the so called \"proof\" that the earth was a big, blue, spinning-ball, was nothing but speculation and circumstantial evidence. I also quickly learned that after nearly 50 years of space exploration, there were only two (2 - TWO!!!) supposed \"real\" photographs of the earth - just two! I would have thought the number would be in the tens of thousands - if not even more. But even here there was a catch. NASA admitted that both of the supposed images of the earth were only CGI - computer generated images - not real photography. So, not one real \"picture\" of the earth actually exists - even to this day. Can you believe that? Its true - Just ask NASA! But just when that was bad enough - it got worse! Much worse. The thing it, the two images don\u0027t match-up. They aren\u0027t even close. In one image, North America is quite proportionally large as compared to the hemisphere as a whole. It doesn\u0027t even look natural and it certainly didn\u0027t fit the \"globe\" we were all exposed to in school. There is much much more - but I was NEARLY convinced at this point, that a BIG lie had been told to all of us. The \u003cstrong\u003e\"WHY would they lie?\"\u003c/strong\u003e question is rather difficult to summarize briefly. However, I think I can summarize in two short sentences:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Control of the population.\u003cbr\u003e2) Causing the people to believe in anything BUT a creator. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat brings me back to the scriptures. Much to my surprise, I found the bible was absolutely LOADED with passages which support a non-moving, flat earth!!! Say what? Yes, it is quite true! The bible not only supports a flat, non-moving earth, but believing otherwise is to make void the word of God.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent the last 17 months in the quest to \"debunk\" the globe model and to prov the flat-earth model in a secular way. I now feel I have accomplished this with only one major video left to produce to put forth a model which shows that the earth\u0027s procession, every six months in it\u0027s supposed track around the sun, and the ensuing 23.4\u00b0 \"tilt\" on its axis, in reality, INVALIDATES the sun\u0027s path that we observe in the sky as compared to six months ago. This is difficulty to explain fully here but soon, as the modeling can be done and the animations created, \u003cstrong\u003eI will present th\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eis\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eultimate PROOF\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/span\u003ewhich leaves no room to \"wiggle\" free for the support of a \"spinning ball\" earth. Again, this proof, IS PROOF. There is no way around it. Some already understand it WITHOUT the physical model. The rest will get-it as soon as work on that project is completed. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSurprisingly, science ALREADY has dis-proven the current model taught almost universally worldwide (some Arab and Hindu / Buddhist cultures excepted as they had always known the truth from primitive writings until now - much like the ancient Hebrews of the bible). Certain men of science (not famously known - I wonder why?) have long ago shown MAJOR problems with the spinning ball theory. \"Airy\u0027s Failure\", a simple experiment performed in the late 1800\u0027s showed, with no doubt, that the earth did not move - in any direction! Other experiments (conveniently swept under the rug at many universities) also verified the earth\u0027s lack of any movement. There was a series of experiments performed by Albert Michelson in the early part of the 20th. century also proved that the earth had no movement. Then came Albert Einstein to show it was all relative and the experiments simply can\u0027t know for sure. Yea right! The creative juices of the early scientists were not daunted however and Michelson teamed-up with other scientists to perform variations of the original experiment (which measured the return of a beam of light traveling in a moving space). this produced experiments named: Michelson-Morley, Michelson-Gayle, etc. All these are just the start. And Airy\u0027s Failure (an experiment performed by pouring water into a telescope to determine if the earth has movement which causes stellar aberration or no) is itself exempt from the \"convenient excuses of Einstein and his relativity theories (one of which is 100% wrong as proved by science FYI - but have you heard of that one)? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are more ways to determine the shape and the movement (or lack thereof) of the earth. One of the most amazing proofs that any human can explore for himself or herself is that of using a gyroscope. Originally, a man (whom I fully believe to be a liar - only he knows why he lied!) named Leon Foucault stated that he had, with a very primitive gyroscope, noted the procession of the earth by using that device and examining it under a microscope (thus only his eyes could witness the earth\u0027s movement as shown by the gyroscope). Today, we have infinitely better precision engineered gyroscopes which can be operated nearly indefinitely Whereas, Foucault\u0027s original gyroscope could only be \"spun-up\" for seconds at a time - now we can spin them constantly for days if needed. So, what are the results today? UNIVERSALLY - NO ONE, not one person has observed the movement of the earth which MUST be shown by a gyroscope if the earth is indeed spinning. Even \"gravity\" and all the magic aspects attached to that theory can\u0027t save the day for the non-moving gyroscope.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI firmly believe that THE LIE which is coming upon the earth, will be accepted by the masses, and even., if it were possible, the very elect would be deceived by THE LIE which I believe is at our doorsteps - the revelation of contact with extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) life forms. If that sounds far fetched, one of the recent Wikileaks leaked email\u0027s from the Hillary Clinton campaign showed a discussion on how this \"contact\" with ETI could and would be explained to the public in the times ahead of us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are no \"aliens\" but only evil spirits and demons. There is a three pronged attack on science which will allow the masses to believe this lie:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) The theory of the Big Bang origin of the universe.\u003cbr\u003e2) The theory of evolution.\u003cbr\u003e3) The theory of inhabited, easy to travel through space with planets, stars, etc.\u003cbr\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eIf you knock any one of those three out, people won\u0027t fall for the lie. I take it as my mission in life to destroy the idea that space is habitable, that the earth is a moving, spinning \"ball\" which is simply a small speck in the vast expanding universe which has no center, and no creator. When you realize that the earth is stationary and that ALL of the heavenly bodies revolve around it - you then take our place as SPECIAL in the universe - with a loving God who made us the center of the universe. That is my goal - to expose the lies of space science. I spent the last 17 months building a foundation on the \"science\" or physical side of the coin. Now it is time to bring-in the creator and the Word of God into the picture so that the ENTIRE PICTURE is seen and the lie that is scientism is exposed. Time is short - we need to work fast!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you for your support. I currently have no other form of income other than some of the sales of a product called Colloidal Silver Gold (www.colloidalsilvergold.com) which is a company I built and turned over to my sons. Therefore your support is not only greatly appreciated, until I am approved for disability pay, it is my entire income. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support and may God bless you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRich - Mr. Thrive And Survive\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
