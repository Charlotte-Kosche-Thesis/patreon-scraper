    "summary": "Hello! My name is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.meghunt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMeg Hunt\u003c/a\u003e and I am an illustrator, educator and maker of things based in Portland, OR!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1024/ed/4773c1de412bb6e3-IMG_0003.JPG\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy clients have included the New York Times, Chronicle Books, Disney, Dreamworks, Storey Publishing, American Express, Coach, and Jamie Oliver. I love how much variety my career has allowed, and it\u0027s evolved and grown with a lot of nudging and experimentation. I love to share this with both students and my creative community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, balancing others\u0027 projects often means that personal work gets pushed off-course, and for years I have been dreaming of making a project that allows time for me to dig into the many subjects I am fascinated by. This project, \u003cem\u003eWunderkammer\u003c/em\u003e, is a series of quarterly Risograph zines that will function as visual essays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003eWhy Risograph?\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been screenprinting for over thirteen years; it has given me a deep appreciation of limited color and the ways that shape, line and texture can mingle on the page. \u00a0My limited color work heavily utilizes transparency and overlays to get the effects I want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI found out about Riso a couple of years ago and have been obsessed. A Risograph is a printing machine that is kind of like a lovechild between photocopying and screenprinting-- you only can print one color at a time, but you can overlap colors and create a wide variety of tones through transparency and halftone printing. Chances are if you love indie comics you\u0027ve seen a Riso comic-- the soy inks are bright and luscious, and the textures and printing imperfections have a handmade appeal. Riso, in short, is affordable and beautiful and a fascinating new medium to explore!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1024/af/69b3e6c8d066e4e3-IMG_0006.JPG\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003eWhat is \u003cem\u003eWunderkammer\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn German, \u003cem\u003eWunderkammer\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0translates to \u0027cabinets of curiosity.\u0027 Historically, a Wunderkammer was a collection of objects that inspired wonder, from natural history, archeaology, antiquities, and mysterious relics. \u00a0These spaces (whether furniture or entire rooms) were the early forebears of museums and gave a personal focus to curation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a deeply curious person, I want this zine project to be a space for all the subjects I\u0027m fascinated by, from astronomy to etymology to mental health to food to mythology to the future... the list goes on. In this way, \u003cem\u003eWunderkammer\u003c/em\u003e will be a projection of the amazing world that I see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach book will be at least 16 pages and 2-4 colors (ideally with silkscreened covers, if I can swing it), which will allow me a playground to work in limited color and overlays. Word and image may play on the page in many different ways to allow me to be experimental about how each issue functions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1024/5f/9d8d8034f6ac4ed8-monkey.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePrevious sample spread for a Riso project.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, I\u0027m determined to produce \u003cem\u003eWunderkammer\u003c/em\u003e. But I need your help to make it thrive. Having my audience there to cheer me on, take a peek at all stages of the process, and offset financial strains of the \u0027feast or famine\u0027 freelance lifestyle will keep me going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe secondary goal with this Patreon is to more deeply connect with my community on an honest and curious level. Through the \u003cstrong\u003eNot-So-Secret\u003c/strong\u003e posts that I\u0027ll release to patrons, I\u0027ll have a home to showcase an in-depth look at my work and the world of illustration-- from process, research, experimentation, growth, and the knowledge I\u0027ve picked up through working and teaching illustration. It\u0027s my belief that illustration is a fascinating medium not just because it can look beautiful, but it can also solve problems and incite dialogue. This point of view is often hard to showcase in the modern oversaturated social-media landscape, so I think making a place to slow down, examine and talk about the practice of being an illustrator will be invaluable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1024/6b/fee6c574d0401dcb-IMG_0006.JPG\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003eHOW IT WORKS:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI am currently anticipating process posts may touch on \u003cem\u003eWunderkammer\u003c/em\u003e or other projects I\u0027m working behind-the-scenes on.\u00a0Work on \u003cem\u003eWunderkammer\u003c/em\u003e will begin in 2017 released on a quarterly schedule (March/June/September/December) and balanced by my freelance schedule. \u003cem\u003eWunderkammer\u003c/em\u003e posts during the first month of every quarter will focus on research, ideation and experimentation whereas the second month will focus on execution of final art. Higher-tier patrons who elect to get the PDF copies will receive it when the book goes out to press, and those who get the print copies will get them before anyone else!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
