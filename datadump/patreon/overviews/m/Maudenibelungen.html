Designing was never part of my career plans. Of course, I always had interests in arts and fashion, but never thought of it as a possible path. I left my hometown at 17 to study Anthropology and History. After college, I started working various jobs that I didn\u0027t really care about. At the same time, friends would ask me to knit them beanies, then scarves, then sweaters... I always took on the challenge of creating something new. After a few orders, I started feeling like knitting was the only way; it made me feel good, i finally found something that felt right to do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fymq3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/224440_243583849008975_5658962_n.jpg?oh=8fef1fcdd0bd747608ec8aa0ec5d8147\u0026amp;oe=5AD89940\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ephoto: Andy Long Hoang (2011)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fymq3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/319168_290151484352211_1616553178_n.jpg?oh=925356e5c239aca442d7f104b3d21138\u0026amp;oe=5B20B180\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ephoto: April Lea (2011)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my brand on February 10th, 2010. I had no money, or actually less than that; I was getting out of a bad relationship that had left me emotionally and financially depleted. However, whenever I\u0027d have a few dollars, I\u0027d buy yarn and try to make something. Sometime, someone would buy one of my pieces so I would use those few dollars to buy better material and tools. I had to work different jobs to be able to make a living, up until 2014. Since then, I have been living solely off my designs.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fymq3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/426282_349412718426087_129567533_n.jpg?oh=1dc647b163c2f9cd1ab35736cac71996\u0026amp;oe=5B18B3F9\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ephoto: April Lea (2012)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fymq3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/1441490_682247325142623_659130344_n.jpg?oh=e9bd5577fc347da53e06d19b9bcd7245\u0026amp;oe=5B1F7AA0\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ephoto: Michele Cote (2013)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI consider most of my pieces as non gender specific and usually try to capture them on as many people as possible.My first collections were often based around mythology. Later on, they became more emotional before turning into a study of texture and design. No matter what the inspiration is or where it comes from, my collections are always very personal. I devote a lot of time and energy into designing, choosing the materials and creating each garment.

Let me explain; when I would tell people that I was a knitwear designer, some would laugh and would say \"like my grandma\". Interestingly, I would often model my sweaters with only a pair of knickers or something sexy - not what you\u0027d expect of a grandma. That\u0027s how knitwear makes me feel. I decided to push it a little further and it\u0027s one of the best decision I have ever made career wise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fymq3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/11760300_1001795439854475_1103455267991335834_n.jpg?oh=e0130bd40fe8e991f1afe322b5075320\u0026amp;oe=5AE73507\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ephoto: Lawrence Fafard (2015)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fymq3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17308705_1458850824148932_761647452294957643_n.jpg?oh=9187101e451effd53527a5a0fcdfe8bb\u0026amp;oe=5AEF6D22\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ephoto: Audrey Belval (2017)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fymq3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22281639_1673961565971189_4886882772823379981_n.jpg?oh=a6df792f0af461787b9e33db15c4efb1\u0026amp;oe=5B22AA16\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ephoto: Audrey Belval (2017)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have collaborated with brands and shops such as Noctex, Ovate, Sisters of the Black Moon,\u00a0 Sloomb, The Order, Trusst, Velvit, Wrkdept, etc. I have also been published in several paper and internet publications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fymq3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/1424279_673267846040571_1276137338_n.jpg?oh=2ed712b0d38d7d573dbe9aba7fc4ec77\u0026amp;oe=5AE75532\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCollaboration with Sisters of the Black Moon (2013)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fymq3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/1609586_712183088815713_1000206818_n.jpg?oh=a9fd841196e360a7778dff1dcd99a85e\u0026amp;oe=5AE21376\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCollaboration with Ovate, photo: Michele Cote (2014)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fymq3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22405827_1682051895162156_7811294725990023940_n.jpg?oh=ea71497fcbba452d35a9ad4a1d799344\u0026amp;oe=5AE019FE\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMaude Nibelungen x Sloomb, photo; Nicole Riggs (2017)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am really proud that I was able to start a business and grow out of nothing; I am self-made. Lately, I have realized that I need more. I need to be able to grow. I need to be able to invest. here are a few goals that I have that I hope your patronage will help me achieve:\u003cbr\u003e- Hiring one or more employee (contractual and on payroll) to help with production but also things that are not my cup of tea (email, finances, website, etc)\u003cbr\u003e- Financing material, time and funds to be able to work with a wider range of models. I think there is so much beauty out there and I would love to represent as many people as possible. \u003cbr\u003e- Financing the equipment and labor to work on a ready to wear line. I would like this line to be on a lower price range so it would be accessible to more people.\u003cbr\u003e- Work on couture, one of a kind pieces. As much as I like creating collections, I also love working on unique/ impractical/ showcase knits with gorgeous and expensive materials.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- Create a certain amount of pieces ahead of time so I can participate to more gift shows and exhibits.\u003cbr\u003eThese improvements would help me grow and share more of my work with the world. I feel so lucky that I get to do something that makes me feel good, send some beauty in the world; I want to share it. I want to be able to hire people, give a chance as I was given many times before. I want to have a steady income so I can take care of my family and still have time to spend with them. I just want to make people feel good \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time\u003c/div\u003e"
