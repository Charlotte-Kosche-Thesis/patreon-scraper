Thanks for visiting my Patreon Page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a storyteller and author currently working my way toward a Masters of Fine Arts in creative writing. As I get closer and closer to my graduation, as I learn more about storytelling, writing, and gain a greater sense of my vision as an artist, I realize that I don\u0027t want to be reliant on publishers or the fickle odds of the book reading crowd in order to maintain my ability to make a living as a writer and storyteller. I\u0027m here on Patreon looking for people who believe in me and will help support me\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a fan of my work -- whether it\u0027s my writing, my storytelling show, or both -- I hope that you\u0027ll consider supporting me in this crazy creative journey and follow along as I explore the strange and odd paths of my imagination.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
