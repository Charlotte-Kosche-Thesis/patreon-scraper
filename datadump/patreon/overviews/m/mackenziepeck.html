I am working to foster an open, sex-positive world by nurturing healthy conversations that transgress and remove boundaries around sexual freedom. Math Magazine is at the center of the Next Sexual Revolution, redefining pornography and celebrating sexual freedom! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s revolutionary, it\u0027s exciting, and it\u0027s a lot of work! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHelp me continue this important work and grow this company by becoming a Porn Patron. Math Magazine was founded in 2015 and is consistently and quickly growing. I have ambitious plans for the future, and in these nascent stages, every bit of help makes a very big difference. With your support, I\u0027ll be able to focus more of my time on maintaining and growing this business and stressing less about how to pay for groceries and rent. This Patreon is my salary. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help ensure that Math Magazine lives on! Plus, you\u2019ll gain exclusive access to my experiences as a pornographer and business-owner hustling in New York City. I\u2019ll share more about myself, my process, wild adventures, behind-the-scenes moments, and my ambitious plans, hopes, and dreams. I\u2019ll look to you for emotional support and feedback on my work and decisions moving forward. I\u0027m excited to share my journey with you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo tell you a little more about Math Magazine, we are a progressive print porn publication headquartered in Brooklyn and made in collaboration with editors and contributors all over the world. We are always looking to share new perspectives on love, lust, and sex! Each issue is full of artwork, poetry, stories, and photography showing off all types of bodies, genders, desires, kinks, and fantasies. It\u2019s a great way to see what other people are into and, quite possibly, discover something you\u2019d like to try out for yourself! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWith a passion for re-envisioning porn through depictions of desires that are often sought but rarely seen, we celebrate sex and sexuality. \u003cem\u003eMath Magazine\u003c/em\u003e maintains a dedication to highlighting an array of genders, an assortment of bodies, and a bouquet of beauty types in every issue. Help me keep doing my thing by supporting my livelihood, here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
