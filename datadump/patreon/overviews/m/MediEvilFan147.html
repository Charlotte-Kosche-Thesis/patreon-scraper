    "summary": "Hello There. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Stephen Mckay. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a young adult from the North of Scotland in a small town called Thurso.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a bit of an indoorsy person and have a major interest in art, cookery, video editing, and when I\u0027m in the mood I love to play videogames, particularly from the earlier PS1 and 2 Era, both just for liesure or to record for fun for YouTube videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor relaxation I love to listen and dance to music, whether it\u0027s from a favourite artist or a game I enjoy the score to. I also love comedies such as funny YouTube channels like Miranda Sings or Jaclyn Glenn among many others, or TV Shows like Red Dwarf, Miranda, Bottom, Will and Grace, Still Game, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love watching other people\u0027s YTP\u0027s and Let\u0027s plays of videogames, mostly by channels that are actually pretty small and I believe deserve more notice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made my patreon, as a way to reach out to anybody who watches my content who would also like to provide some support to the videos I put out. I do in fact monetise my YouTube channel\u0027s (Not All Videos Though, e.g. Full CD Soundtracks) but the earnings on it just are so unbelievably low, and I hate having to put so many ads on my videos to generate more revenue. I understand how much they annoy people and I am so sorry, I do insist on making them skippable though, I don\u0027t want you to have to sit through ads constantly, and having support on patreon would help me not need to do that as much, it really is entirely optional, I love all of my viewers and all the kind words I get from people on my videos already, this is seriously just an option out there for people who wish to support my content. I will still keep providing free videos no matter what, but this will help me to mantain it and not to stress over copyright claims some of my videos recieve as fair use can be so hard to discuss with some sources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt means a lot to me, how many comments I get, showing me how many people I help out there (despite the fact I can be so bad for inactivity on Stephen\u0027s YTP\u0027s), who manage get some laughs from my YTP\u0027s who as myself suffer from very similar problems to me relating to depresison and anxiety, and I am so happy to see how much of a gay following I have too on Stephen\u0027s YTP\u0027s, being gay myself that\u0027s just, freaking awesome. I love my fanbase. Keep on getting along guys you\u0027re amazing, I know I do get the odd hater too but they\u0027re very rare, you get those everywhere. Hahaha. I\u0027m aware my channels are far faaar from perfect, and I have so many people who are just, so cool and down to earth supporting me and I couldn\u0027t be more greatful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will not only help support my work, but will also help support my wellbeing and the wellbeing of my family. I myself suffer from Asperger\u0027s\u00a0 making my outlook on things pretty different to other people\u0027s but, I feel as though YouTube\u0027s a great way for me to vent and show interests, and YTP\u0027s are a way of getting creativity out there, and I have very bad panick disorder, depression and anxiety. My Mum also suffers from a range of physical conditions making her unfit for work, on top of depression, and my Sister, as well as myself, also suffers from Asperger\u0027s. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso at this current time, my Grandma\u0027s physical health is very poor, so any support you can provide on patreon will be MAJORLY appreciated. Love you\u0027s loads regardless though. Keep on being awesome. xx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
