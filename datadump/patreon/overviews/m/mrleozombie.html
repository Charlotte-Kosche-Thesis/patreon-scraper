    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YeNgiG6.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey everybody! Quick introduction here. My name is Leo and I\u0027m just a nerdy dude who is fascinated with pop culture and has latent childhood escapist tendencies. What I mean is, I love all kinds of things that allow me to flex my imagination and be part of something more than the day-to-day. I love to go to Disneyland, cosplay, talk about movies, and make youtube videos about all the aforementioned geeky stuff I\u0027m into. I also have a youtube channel called Thingamavlogs that is devoted to bring you Disney related videos every single weekday!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been cosplaying for quite some time now... maybe 6 or 7 years, but my fascination with costuming started when I was just a kid. I try to go to as many cons as possible, especially in California, and I\u0027m always trying to find the next character to portray. I\u0027ve always found that cosplay enables me to be an extention of who I am in ways I couldn\u0027t normally be. What I mean is, when I dress like Captain Hook, I get to be a little bit more devious. Nathan Drake allows me to be a bit cockier. This has really allowed to be stretch the boundaries of my creativity and has introduced me to a wonderful community of like-minded people who just want to have fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the last few years, cosplay and Youtube (I\u0027m looking at you Disney fans) have allowed me to branch out into areas of entertainment I wouldn\u0027t have even dreamed of before. I\u0027m now making more videos on youtube than ever before, flying out to cons to speak on panels, and it\u0027s even gotten me into acting and modeling! It\u0027s been an amazing journey and I\u0027m grateful for all of you who have come along with me via social media and made it possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/QmWuQww.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT... cosplay and production \u00a0is VERY expensive. I will spend, on average, anywhere from $200 to over a $1000 on a cosplay and this is simply not sustainable on an average budget. I always value my real life priorities before my hobbies, particularly cosplay, so my own money always goes towards bills first. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in. With your support I would have access to resources that would allow me to produce more cosplays, and create content based around those cosplays (and Disneybounds) on my youtube channel! Photoshoots, behind the scenes, con-floor videos and my personal favorite, short films and skits using the cosplays themselves. Heck, I might even be able to afford to fly to a con near you and explore it together! I want to create content for your entertainment guided by your suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make something clear. I want to be able to create more content in order to share with you. I\u0027m not asking for these funds in order to pay my rent or help me eat. I\u0027ve got that covered. I just want to share my nerdy creative world with all of you through your support and input.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really do hope to forge friendships with all of my patrons and I intend on giving back to everyone who helps me along. I want everyone to get something out of this. I want everyone to win. For now, we\u0027ll have to internet to strengthen or bonds, but over time, who knows where we\u0027ll go and what we\u0027ll accomplish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to check out my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHere are some examples of my cosplay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/IQG85pa.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePoe Dameron Cosplay\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/MzYf3tT.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHook Cosplay\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GIW7lee.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrince Eric Cosplay\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/eDrySgl.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLegend of Korra Cosplay Group\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YMcCe1y.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNathan Drake Cosplay\u003c/div\u003e"
