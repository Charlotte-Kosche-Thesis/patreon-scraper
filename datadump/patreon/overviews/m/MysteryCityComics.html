    "summary": "Thanks for checking in; I\u0027m Craig Bogart, writer, cartoonist, comic book self-publisher.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been producing my own comics for over twenty years, and started my long running series \"The Ineffables\" in 2001.\u00a0 I\u0027ve made numerous comics of my own and contributions to various anthologies, and several different one-shots and series\u0027 over the time I\u0027ve practiced as an artist.\u00a0 I have been a member of the Columbus, Ohio-based collective of comic artists known as PANEL, to which I contributed many projects while that group was active, and in 2016 my work was named one of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.columbusalive.com/content/stories/2016/10/13/25-essential-columbus-comics.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eColumbus\u0027 Top 25 Comics\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eby Columbus Alive.\u00a0 I\u0027ve also picked up a few awards at the midwest\u0027s largest small press comic show, SPACE (Small Press \u0026amp; Alternative Comics Expo), over the years, including a nomination for Dave Sim\u0027s Eugene Day Prize.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had a blast telling my stories and working alongside other artists who have inspired me, and hearing from people who have appreciated my work.\u00a0 I have never suffered under the illusion that drawing comics would be the key to prosperity and a life of comfort, but I\u0027ve felt priviledged to be able to express my creativity and hopefully share some of the sense of wonder I picked up from the pages of the books I enjoyed leading up to the beginning of my own creative pursuits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe primary goal of my endeavor has always been to get my work into as many hands as possible.\u00a0 Besides the small press-friendly comic stores I\u0027m lucky enough to have nearby, the primary vehicle for that has been appearances at comic book conventions.\u00a0 I\u0027m grateful to have a few small press themed shows within driving distance each year (such as the aforementioned SPACE), but I have always hoped to find a means of reaching a wider audience on a more consistent basis.\u00a0 Recently, a musician friend became a creator on Patreon, making me aware of the possiblilities to be found here.\u00a0 A way to connect directly with those that have followed my work without having to simply hope I catch them at the next comic show, an impetus to keep my own work coming at a steady rate rather than plotting a project or two around certain shows each year, and a way to spread the word to newcomers about what I do without the hurdles of weekend table rates and hotel fees.\u00a0 And maybe, just maybe, the prospect that my creativity could pay off well enough to do a little more than buy the next set of pens and paper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always valued the support, encouragement, and feedback of those that have enjoyed \"The Ineffables\" and other projects of mine over the years, as well as those that pick up one of my books for the first time.\u00a0 I hope you\u0027ll be willing to join me in this next step as I embark on a more direct relationship with my readers, asking for your support and offering much more of the work I hope you have always enjoyed.\u00a0 You\u0027ll find several different ways to engage with the creativity I have to offer, each with it\u0027s own set of rewards, from access to my newest works through this site, to downloadable pdf\u0027s of complete books, to actual physical collections of comics and original commissioned art.\u00a0 You\u0027ll also be occasionally privy to my thoughts about my own creative process, the self-publishing experience, other artists I enjoy and comics in general.\u003cbr\u003e"
