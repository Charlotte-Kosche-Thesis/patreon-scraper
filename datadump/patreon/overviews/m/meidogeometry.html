    "summary": "Salutations~ I\u0027m Kei, an impoverished writer of modest means, a turbulent life, and no idea what I\u0027m doing. I\u0027ve been writing stories for as long as I can remember words, having played with both original fiction and fanfiction, with a slant towards the fantasy and science fiction genres, often with a gaming fandom when it comes to fanfiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2013, I have switched to focusing on quests, a form of interactive fiction akin to the old \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books. Questers, the participants, discuss and vote for what choice the protagonist makes at critical junctions in the narrative, thus involving them in the storytelling. This is what I will be mostly doing for the near foreseeable future, and most of my works can be found on the forum \u003ca href=\"https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSufficient Velocity\u003c/a\u003e, where I am also known as \u003ca href=\"https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/kei.761/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKei\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goals here are twofold. More modestly, I\u0027d like to be able to pay my bills and subsist off something more healthy than a cup of instant noodles, if not stave off dumpster-diving entirely. More ambitiously, I\u0027d like to build up a portfolio and a reputation as I work to write a work of original fiction to one day publish as a professional author. If you like what I do and what I write, and if you are so inclined, I would be humbled to have your support as I reach for that distant, elusive dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an impoverished writer of modest means, I regret to note that I have very little in terms of rewards to offer for your support, nor am I seeking to establish a commercial pay-to-play enterprise. I will not paywall most of my content, nor will I offer patrons extra votes when making choices in my quests, for example, nor confer any special advantages that would disadvantage others. As much as I\u0027d like to make a living off writing, I write because people enjoy it, and I will not take a course of action that diminishes the enjoyment of others. If you support me, it is because you like what I write. If that is insufficient, then I apologize but thank you all the same, and hope you enjoy my works nonetheless. This being said, I\u0027m always open to creative ideas from everyone for how to structure rewards, as well as anything Patreon-related, so please don\u0027t hesitate to send a message my way~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current major work is \u003ca href=\"https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/on-the-elsparian-road.30513/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eOn the Elsparian Road\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a fantasy quest wherein a young dryad girl trains to one day become an elite mercenary, even as a war with a neighboring superpower draws to a close, with all the consequences to follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://meidogeometry.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKei and the Writing Stuff\u003c/a\u003e is my Wordpress blog, with much of my writing tidbits. I don\u0027t go there anymore, but I also have a \u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/~sudentor\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFanFiction.Net account\u003c/a\u003e and an \u003ca href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/Sudentor/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArchive of Our Own account\u003c/a\u003e, with old works to be found therein.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering supporting me, and if you enjoy my work, regardless of whether or not you support it monetarily, please do me the honor of telling all your friends. Fiction was never meant to be enjoyed alone.\u003cbr\u003e"
