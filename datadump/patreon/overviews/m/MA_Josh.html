    "summary": "Hi there! I\u2019m Josh, an Australian games writer who got hooked on Toys to Life games and eventually started up \u003ca href=\"https://www.monamiibo.com/\"\u003eMon Amiibo\u003c/a\u003e, a Toys to Life fansite. Mon Amiibo was my first attempt at running a website of this scale, and despite a few speedbumps (like some of the main Toys to Life franchises bowing out of the genre\u2026) it\u2019s gotten to a place that I\u2019m quite happy with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMon Amiibo has been providing news, guides and reviews of Toys to Life games for a few years now. Our main focus now has become writing detailed guides that explain the functionality of various amiibo in each new amiibo-compatible game that releases. You might be familiar with our guides for \u003ca href=\"https://www.monamiibo.com/super-mario-odyssey-amiibo-guide/\"\u003eSuper Mario Odyssey\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.monamiibo.com/fire-emblem-warriors-amiibo-unlocks-guide/\"\u003eFire Emblem Warriors\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.monamiibo.com/hey-pikmin-amiibo-guide/\"\u003eHey! Pikmin\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.monamiibo.com/conga-master-party-amiibo-costume-guide/\"\u003eConga Master Party\u003c/a\u003e. I\u2019ve also tried branching out into other content like a \u003ca href=\"https://www.monamiibo.com/yo-kai-watch-2-psychic-specters-new-quest-guide/\"\u003eYo-kai Watch 2 quest guide\u003c/a\u003e and fortnightly \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xf3QNDHJzZckhJJ-Vcxvp7cO8IrxCbl\"\u003enews round-up videos\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Oexpofr.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started Mon Amiibo because I knew a lot of people who were feeling quite intimidated by various Toys to Life games - where do they start? What toys do they need? Where can they get things the cheapest? They encouraged me to start up my own site on the subject because I\u2019d gotten quite knowledgeable on these various games and they were usually brushed to the side by most of the more mainstream games sites. Australians have also gotten the short end of the stick in regards to Toys to Life because the sites that do provide comprehensive coverage of these games are usually US-centric, so it\u2019s important to provide a voice from the other side of the world. I\u0027ve gone through a few slumps of demotivation while running this site due to a lot of Toys to Life brands going bust after I finally got things moving, and some general difficulties that games writers face in Australia, but overall I\u0027m really happy with the site and community I\u0027ve managed to build.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut right now, I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had to invest a lot into this site and its respective \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/MonAmiibo\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e. While I generally get review copies for all the games I need to cover, that\u0027s not always guaranteed; and I have to buy any amiibo (or other toys) that are needed for articles and videos myself. Then there\u0027s the fact I need to pay for the website and any themes and plugins that make it a more useful and pleasant experience for all of you. And if that\u0027s not bad enough, YouTube is becoming increasingly frustrating to deal with. My videos can often get flagged for copyrighted material or marked as not being advertiser-friendly, which means I can\u0027t monetise those videos until those claims are dealt with. Sometimes they can\u0027t be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help cover the costs of any toys, games and equipment I need to purchase for myself in order to write guides or record videos, and will also subsidise things like YouTube\u0027s flaws in the system. But more importantly, having you all behind me will allow me to produce more content for you all! It\u0027s often hard to justify working on time-consuming video content and guides for older games, but with a backing it won\u0027t matter if the content gets blocked from monetisation or just doesn\u0027t make back the costs. I\u0027m really wanting to push into video content that\u0027s not only informative and useful, but fun and weird as well, and seeing people putting their faith in me through this Patreon would be a big confidence booster. Check out my Kirby Star Allies review below for an example of the kind of stuff I want to make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sT3uQ7Rli0I?ecver=1\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u2019s in it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange for at least a dollar a month, you\u2019ll get access to any behind the scenes updates I post here on Patreon. I\u0027d also like to start some semi-regular game streams, and there will be opportunities for Patrons to get involved with that (like being given session codes for Jackbox streams). You\u0027ll also be able to hold me accountable if I\u0027m not producing things regularly enough, and who doesn\u0027t like being the boss? If you donate $3 or more each month, then you\u2019ll also get a cute little title for use in our \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/F36Zfkq\"\u003eMon Amiibo community Discord server\u003c/a\u003e. Access to this server is free, but these donors will stand out a little more to show thanks for having Mon Amiibo\u2019s back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for reading this far, I hope to see you in the Discord :)"
