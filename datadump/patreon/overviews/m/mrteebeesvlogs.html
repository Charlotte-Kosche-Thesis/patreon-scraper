Plus it helps me to keep improving what I do as time goes by. You also can make a one time donation by just becoming a Patron choosing the tier amount you would like\u00a0to give the one time donation for then cancel being a Patron once payment has went through\u00a0which is usually the first of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo not worry about missing out on my regular content if you decide not to contribute as a \"Patron\" because my regular content will still be free.
