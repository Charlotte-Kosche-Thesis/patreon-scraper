Mark as Played. As you can tell from that list (which you probably gave up on finishing around \"Original Remake\") podcasting is quite the time consuming hobby that loses me money, quality time with my Catahoula, and most importantly my hairline. My hair can\u0027t be saved but the increasing quality of this podcast can with your donation!"
