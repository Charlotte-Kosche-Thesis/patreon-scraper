This city is known as Fruitopia. Since ancient times, for a reason unknown to anyone in the world, the people of Fruitopia all hold a special \"power\". However, the power isn\u0027t exactly beneficial to them... you see, whenever the people feel negative emotions of anger, distrust, depression, anxiety, fear, and emotions such as them within the city limits, a creature is born. These creatures, made of thick smoke, dark as night, with iridescent red eyes, take the form of an animal, and besides the one emotion they were born from, the only thing they feel is an unstoppable thirst for human blood. They devour the person who created them, along with any other unlucky humans who cross their paths. They hunt the humans, and humans have no way of fighting back on their own, since the shadows can phase through normal weapons, and can easily devour any who try to stand up to them.\u003cbr\u003eLuckily for the humans, thousands of years ago, about the same time the inexplicable power that creates dark shadows from emotions was created, so were six magic stones. They are the only hope humans have to defeat shadows and live on. Made from the mana the fruits of their magical land had to offer, these six stones incase and control the magical powers that are capable of destroying shadows. They attach themselves to a user\u0027s soul, mind, and body, and allow them to magically transform into clothing that shadows cannot phase through, allow the user to manifest a special magic weapon specific to their individual skill and potential, that is capable of destroying the shadows. These six stones have been passed down through generations for thousands of years; the parents train their children to fight as they do, and when they are ready, usually around ages 12-16, they are passed down the power to fight. The six families are also named after the gems, Melon, Tropia, Stone, Pomme, Citrus, and Berry. The families have always been treated with deep respect, and while they are Fruit Fighters, it isn\u0027t even expected of them to get a job, as it as seen as a noble deed and a career to fight shadows. There are multiple annual celebrations for them, as well. However, is being respected a worthy exchange for risking your life every day? For having your soul purpose in life, since birth, to be fighting ravenous creatures?\u003cbr\u003eNow, in our story we join the newest generation of Fruit Fighters. Otako Melon and Mayumi Tropia are trying to create an unstoppable team, so that destroying shadows is made easier. They meet the most experienced but most difficult member of their generation, Hikari Berry, and try to get her on their side. They also meet Kai Stone, a proud, strong fighter, who seems to be fighting for a cause, but what? Tetsuya Pomme, a childish but gifted fighter, and Naomi Citrus, an unexpecting young fighter also cross their paths. Fighting shadows gets harder and harder by the day for Otako and Mayumi, but as they learn more about their new friends, they also learn that things are about to get much, much harder for their generation.\u003cbr\u003eCan they escape their fears and defeat the shadows?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou should become a patreon and read the story to find out !! ;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease enjoy the story, i have worked on it for years, these characters mean more to me than you could imagine.
