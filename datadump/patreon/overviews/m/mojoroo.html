     "description": "I want to make a sparkly funny commercial for my new novel, The Change Room. (As soon as the $2000 goal is reached, I will post another goal, so any patrons will be funding work as it comes around.) The Change Room is about marriage, sex work, sexual joy and housecleaning, to put it in a nutshell. I want to make an upbeat, funny, intriguing little piece of video art that pulls you into this familiar and unfamiliar world through the actual book--I want to show the pleasure that is also to be found in using that age-old slow technology: the humble book. I know it may be hard to believe but this will be a sexy advertisement for the book itself, and for books in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have the vision, but I need a producer to help me along and an editor to teach me some editing skills. This video is tentatively title \"A Glance in The Change Room\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money will be used to pay the cameraman, the actors, the producer, and the editor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "GOAL #2\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDear Reader, I really need to start working on my next book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what should it be? The story of my brother\u0027s tragic accident in Thailand and a family memoir (disastrous, estranged family comes together to save brother\u0027s life) OR should it be a sequel to The Change Room? Or, should it be both?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce The Change Room is published in mid-April, I am going to be taking a poll. In fact, I am going to be having conversations with my patrons here on Patreon about what they want me to write. One of the reasons I wrote The Change Room is because the women I visited in book clubs (and some of the men) often ended up talking about relationships and sexuality following a read of my last book of prose, \u003cem\u003eBurmese Lessons\u003c/em\u003e, which involves a complicated and political love story . . . My readers led me to think that writing frankly about sexuality and domesticity in contemporary women\u0027s lives IS as political in my other work, though in a very different way. So: let\u0027s see what happens next . . . \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love for readers and patrons to join me in a creative discussion about what to do next.",

     "description": "GOAL #3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I get \u0027A Glance in the Change Room\u0027 launched, I\u003cbr\u003ewant to take the skills I\u0027ve learned and start a youTube talkshow or a podcast. I want to experiment to see what potential patrons prefer and what feels best to me as a talk show host and sometime lecturer. In my daily life I interview a lot of fascinating people about many different subjects--the present insanity of US politics, how a woman can really miss sex work--the paying kind--the ancient and modern benefits of Tantric practice, Buddhism and meditation, professional clowning, the complexities of helping the Syrian family a group of us have sponsored as refugees, what is was like to working in the refugee camps on Lesvos . . . and that\u0027s just in the last couple weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to transcribe many of my lectures, talks, and readings, and bring them to you in podcast or video form. What do you prefer? Turning them into both would be ideal, to make them available first to Patreon donors and sometimes to others, too. I\u0027ve been told countless times over three decades that I am a gifted, inspiring speaker and reader . . . I think it\u0027s time to share that in a formal, organized way. I will need more equipment, a helper or two, and more training on the technical side of things. I will have to pay people as well as finance better equipment. I am a much-loved editor of language--but I want to become an editor of my own video material too. Looking forward to meeting you here again in a different form . . . \u00a0Thank you!",
