    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e20 years on the road as a traveller, roving English teacher, teacher trainer and as a big believer in \u0027giving back\u0027 brings about a shed load of stories\u003c/strong\u003e - from black mail, to evacuation due to civil unrest, detention as an illegal alien, deportation and surviving multiple organ failure, I\u0027ve travelled through 35 countries (to date), worked with over 90 cultures and been on 14 overseas postings before creating a second base for myself in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThey say what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u2019ve often said if I was any stronger I\u2019d\u00a0be forged steel, but I don\u2019t take back a second of any of the hair-raising adventures I\u2019ve\u00a0taken myself on. Each one of those experiences has transformed me and I don\u2019t regret a\u00a0single one of them. I have lived and loved to the very fullest, taken every opportunity by\u00a0the horns, slept rough, eaten with Presidents, built houses with the poorest locals on the\u00a0planet, I\u2019ve been head over heels in love and desperately heartbroken by the people who\u00a0I\u2019ve cared about the most but nothing has transformed me the way that the past 6 years\u00a0have. Part of this transformation has been about getting back to what I really love doing, and that is writing, travelling, learning more about culture, and understanding the most complex conundrum on the planet -\u003cstrong\u003e what makes people tick.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got enough stories to keep a road trip entertained for hours and so this is my mission - to \u003cstrong\u003etranslate the journals and the diaries, the blogs and the emails I\u0027ve collected over the past 20 years into a series of short stories, \u003c/strong\u003ewhich will eventually be turned into traditional paperbacks and audio books, narrated of course by the lead character - moi! Every story brings with it a healthy dose of giggle snorting and a life lesson of some description, carefully curated and written from the heart of what those experiences taught me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I had a dollar for every time someone asked me \u0027so when are you writing the book?\u0027 I\u0027d have enough to self publish this book 10 times over - so I\u0027m mixing things up a bit and putting forward a proposal. I promise a new chapter every month to all those who are contributing to the cause. \u003cstrong\u003eNot only will you read the chapters as they\u0027re compiled, you\u0027ll also be gifted a paperback when it\u0027s published, and I\u0027m promising to pledge dollar for dollar; every dollar donated, I\u0027m going to match - and give directly to a Giving Back Project like I do every year, to a school in need\u003c/strong\u003e - teacher training, curriculum development, whatever the school needs to up-skill their staff and make learning something that every kid in that school is excited about turning up for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo. \u003cstrong\u003eThe longer it goes on, the more chapters will be written and the more schools will be helped. \u003c/strong\u003eWho\u0027s in? Many thanks to my Auntie Pam who planted this seed a few years ago, by turning up on my doorstep with a manila envelope full of the stories I\u0027d written over the years, saying \u0027Maria, write the book\u0027.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreate quality learning experiences; create real change\u00a0in the world. Create stories that change lives and make the world a better place to be.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
