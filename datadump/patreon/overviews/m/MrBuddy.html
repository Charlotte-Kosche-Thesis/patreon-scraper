    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s going on everybuddy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past couple years my Youtube Channel has grown and evolved with the help of you guys. At the start I was only making videos for myself in the hopes that someone out there would like them too, and it makes me so happy that years later so many people have found enjoyment from them as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile creating videos has and will always be my passion, I\u0027ve been slowly running into a little bit of a problem . As my videos get bigger and (hopefully) better, the budget for them increases, as I\u0027m constantly commissioning great and talented artists to incorporate into my videos, and I\u0027ve reached a point where I rarely break even on any of the \"bigger\" videos (Regional Videos, Team Buddy videos, etc) I\u0027ve created.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where I need your guys help! I really don\u0027t like asking/begging for donations like this, it\u0027s always felt weird to me for whatever reason, but in order to get my bigger videos out even faster, and with the same (and even better!) quality as my other larger projects, any kind of donation or support would be extremely appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow this will work\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy Patreon is currently set up as a \"Per Creation\" model, which means that instead of you guys donating monthly on the dot, it\u0027s instead dependent on when I make a certain \"Paid Video\". These \"Paid Videos\" (which I\u0027ll go over more in just a second), are essentially the videos that will trigger your donation, and will be spaced out roughly 1 to 1 and a half months apart from each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow the reason I\u0027m doing this \"Per Creation\" model is because I don\u0027t upload frequently enough to make a monthly donation reasonable, and so instead I\u0027ve opted to do the \"Per Creation\" Patreon. Due to how long it takes me to make bigger videos (roughly 2 months), I think this method of \"Per Creation\" will work out as almost like a slightly extended \"monthly donation\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow just a couple more things that I\u0027ll put into some quick bullet points:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\"Paid Videos\" are going to consist of 2 different types of bigger videos I currently do on my channel. \"What If ___ Was A Pokemon Region?\" videos, and \"Team Buddy Videos\". I\u0027ll give everybody a heads up a week before one of these drops.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll other videos I upload to my Channel (such as Top 10s, Let\u0027s Plays, speculation videos, etc), won\u0027t be counted as a \"Paid Video\", and thus won\u0027t trigger your donation. It\u0027ll only be the 3 video types I listed above (which once again, will probably only happen every 1 to one and a half months)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
