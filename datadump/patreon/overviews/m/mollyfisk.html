If you don\u0027t know me, the short version is this: I\u0027m a seasoned writer who\u0027s gotten less productive in recent years in order to make a living, and I\u0027m finding that a dreadful trend. I want to become \u003cstrong\u003emore\u003c/strong\u003e productive while making a living, and am exploring Patreon\u0027s \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003ecrowd-sourcing, Medici-inspired\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003emethod\u003c/span\u003e, where you can support, with a pledge, the creation of something (poem, radio essay, blog post, painting, book) as well as the finished product. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a way to help creative people carve out time to do their work (and afford supplies, equipment, help, etc., too). It\u0027s also a strong motivation for me to create. If you\u0027d like to participate and join my merry band, I thank you! I love crowd-sourcing because it\u0027s a radical break with our current economic system and fosters community instead of competition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(235, 241, 221);\"\u003eUPDATE\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter one year (2017), I have 41 patrons and many of my hopes have been realized. I\u0027ve been much more productive, have started a new project (my long-planned book about teach writing to cancer patients to boost their immune systems), and through your steady donations accomplished a big goal: to redo the rotten floor of my writing/painting studio, which now just needs two more coats of paint and then I\u0027ll be able to reinhabit it. I am busting with gratitude and will be sending everyone a surprise present in February. Thank you so much. If you\u0027re new to my page, read on...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003ePATREON?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 15th-century Italy, the Medicis supported Michelangelo and Leonardo Da Vinci at various times, so they didn\u0027t have to be grave diggers and sculpt or paint on the side. Patreon\u0027s version of support is built of \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003emany people contributing a little\u003c/span\u003e, rather than one family contributing a lot (and getting influence over the work because of that). It\u0027s a way to support a creative person \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eas\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e they create, rather than after the fact. This ensures that they \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e create, which is one reason I\u0027m revamping my life to include Patreon and, if you\u0027re interested, \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eyou\u003c/span\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eMY WRITER/ARTIST HISTORY\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing poems since 1990, and have published \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003efour collections\u003c/span\u003e (see \u003ca href=\"http://www.mollyfisk.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e). Ten years ago I was asked to do three-minute commentary on my local community radio station, and am now up to about \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e400\u003c/span\u003e of those, give or take, some of them \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003ecollected into books\u003c/span\u003e that I published myself (see banner photo, above). On paper, the commentary are called essays. You may or may not know that being a poet is perhaps the least-well-paid profession in the solar system, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.kvmr.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecommunity radio\u003c/a\u003e comes in as a close second. This is not why I chose them. I didn\u0027t choose them, they chose me, the way sometimes love will wash over you and there you are, suddenly married, or the sole emotional support of a traumatized Queensland heeler named Ruby, or sitting on the couch under a pile of sleeping cats. (Five cats, in my case.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this time, I\u0027ve worked to pay my bills, sometimes outside the writing life (restaurant book keeper, office manager), sometimes in it (newsletter editor, writing festival director, writing teacher, copy writer, freelance editor). I\u0027ve been \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003elucky\u003c/span\u003e enough to receive grants in support of my work (NEA, California Arts Council, Corporation for Public Broadcasting), and ran a \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003esuccessful\u003c/span\u003e Kickstarter campaign in 2008 to match the CPB funding and get my commentary heard farther afield than Northern California, where I live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last few years I\u0027ve been training to become, and then working as a life coach in the Skills for Change tradition, an offshoot of transactional analysis. I love this work, which supports about half my bill-paying life and all my poetic life, because it involves emotional inquiry as well as \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003elooking at the world sideways and upside down\u003c/span\u003e, something poets are quite good at. I don\u0027t want to stop coaching. I do want to stop teaching, which is how I pay the other half of my bills. Even though I love teaching, it seems to use up all my creativity and leave me with none for my own writing and painting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWHY PARTICIPATE?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason to do this is because \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eyou want more of what I know how to do\u003c/span\u003e. You want there to be a next poem, essay, blog post, and book, and you want to read it. You want to watch my painting evolve and see how painting and writing get mingled together in my particular way. And maybe you want to be part of a group, a community. No algorithms. Maybe you\u0027re looking for a way to belong to the world more directly than, say, futures options trading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eHOW DOES IT WORK?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou choose the level you\u0027d like to participate (on the right side bar), and sign up. I start making things and posting them here on this page. I send you your presents. The \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eunknown variable\u003c/span\u003e is how much I will create once I\u0027m let loose. But Patreon allows you to cap your funding, so you could, say, pledge $3/thing and then cap your pledge at 4 things/$12 per month or 20 things/$60 per year or whatever works best for you. This is a \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003esustainability\u003c/span\u003e model, not a one-time event. (If you\u0027d like to participate but only make one donation, the way to do that is with me directly, instructions \u003ca href=\"mailto:mollyfisk@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.) It\u0027s like the CSA idea many of us use for food these days (Community Supported Agriculture). We pay farmers in advance to plant crops and grow our food, which we then get in weekly portions throughout the growing season. You\u0027re paying me in advance to write poems, which you then get in random portions throughout the writing season. And poems don\u0027t need to be composted! It\u0027s fabulous.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this whole darn thing, and welcome, if you decide to join in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eI MEAN IT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!! AND LOVE.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
