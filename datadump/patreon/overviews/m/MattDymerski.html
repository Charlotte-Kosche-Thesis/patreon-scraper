    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello there!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always enjoyed writing. A great many years ago, I found myself part of a little community called Creepypasta, before it became the ubiquitous horror trope we all know today. While there, I wrote a story called \"Psychosis,\" which later spread across the Internet, finding its way into numerous video adaptations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFour years ago, I found a budding horror community called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNoSleep\u003c/a\u003e, on Reddit. The unique required format of story submissions there intrigued me, and I began contributing. I was surprised to find that some people already knew who I was - because of Psychosis - and I realized I\u0027d found the resettled remnants of the defunct Creepypasta community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, NoSleep is a public default subreddit on Reddit, and has reached over three million subscribers. In that time, I\u0027ve often pushed the boundaries of the strict format, and I\u0027ve built an ongoing style that offers a unique blend of terrifying ideas and grounded realities that involve realistic characters. I would describe my work as a fusion of horror and science fiction specifically because I don\u0027t believe horror can truly reach our emotional core unless the world surrounding it makes sense. The science and realism makes the rest that much sweeter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe one thing I promise, above all, is that my stories will never be cliche. I\u0027m an avid horror fan myself; I\u0027ve read them all, and I want new experiences just like you do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream would be to produce fresh new horror content on a permanent, full-time basis. That\u0027s what this Patreon is about - for the price of a cup of coffee, you can help me bring you cutting-edge horror and science fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I do with your money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I run my own e-publishing company. For many years, I\u0027ve worked with other authors to edit, format, publish, and market their work. As I began compiling more self-written content, I used those skills to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Matt-Dymerski/e/B00A82LSW4/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1432943752\u0026amp;sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecreate my own books\u003c/a\u003e, exactly like the ones I\u0027d created for other people. This is my proven track record for you - I\u0027m already doing it, it\u0027s already my passion, but I want to do it full-time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to bring fresh content and professional books to you on a regular basis, rather than whenever my scant free time allows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support given through this Patreon will first go toward shifting my time more fully into writing. Once I have enough time and money to write full-time, the rest will go toward sweet upgrades and paying the fantastically talented people I partner with. For example, I feel that I truly struck gold with the covers from the art talents at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mc2studio.co/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMiller Creative Consulting\u003c/a\u003e. I think the difference between my self-made covers and their fantastic designs speaks for itself - and they have contributed these covers with their own free time, purely because they believe in what we are doing here. The same is true for a great many writers, artists, and editors I work with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Internet is entering a new era - one in which \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0get to decide what content gets created. This is exactly how that happens. With your support, we can produce ever-better content specifically for you! The ebooks I produce will always continue to be available for free, and print versions will also be available for those who want hard copies in their homes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e"
