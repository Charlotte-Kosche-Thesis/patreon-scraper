    "summary": "ROK Music Review is meant to be a community where fans of Korean Music can gather and freely share and discuss their opinions on the latest releases and news. I founded my channel with the intention to share my honest thoughts and have made it a priority to encourage viewers to do that same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome things that your help will help me do in the future.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore in depth and detailed videos. \u003c/strong\u003eI love making reaction videos but the nature of the video format means that they are not the most in depth looks at new music. I would love to release more detailed song reviews and album reviews but those take more time to make than a reaction video. If I have more free time then I can make more review videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExpand coverage to K-Indie. \u003c/strong\u003eK-Pop is easy to follow and there is a massive amount of easily accessible content for me to make the basis of new videos. Korean Indie is much harder to follow in many respects and takes more time to stay well informed and up to date. More free time means that I can spend more time researching and following Korean Indie and I can work that into my content. I do not want my channel to be exclusively about K-Pop but to cover all aspect of Korean music no matter how well known it is.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuild A Team? Yes. \u003c/strong\u003eI would love to build a team of people to make content for ROK Music Review. Of course everyone\u0027s work is valuable and they deserve to get paid for that work. This is another way to expand the areas of Korean Music that can be covered on ROK Music Review.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat in in it for you? How will I show my Thanks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col style=\"\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eAccess to Patron only feed. \u003c/b\u003eThis is one of the most direct ways to interact with myself and other members of the community. There will be a variety of posts that will help you get to know me a little better on a personal level.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo Topic Polls. \u003c/strong\u003eI will have weekly polls where Patrons get to decide the topics for upcoming videos. I will present the options for upcoming Sunday Discussion Videos as well as Throwback Reactions and Patrons are able to vote for what they want to see next. This will enable you to become much more involved and your voice will be better heard. Who doesnt like getting to determine what videos get uploaded?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore in the future. \u003c/strong\u003eIf you have any good ideas be sure to share them with me! I also have some other ideas but they will be saved for when the community gets a bit larger.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHere are probably going to be tons of crazy ideas that I have and I will use this page a place to get feedback on the ideas that I want to implement as well as asking for any ideas that you have. \u003cstrong\u003eI want you to be involved in shaping the future of the channel and whatever comes in the future.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
