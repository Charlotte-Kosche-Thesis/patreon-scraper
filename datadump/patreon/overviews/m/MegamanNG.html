    "summary": "I am Jose aka \u003cstrong\u003eMegamanNG\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ve been a YouTuber for almost a decade, specializing in content relating to video games. I\u0027m mostly best known as someone who has done footage of the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAce Attorney\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e series,\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKingdom Hearts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.and at one point \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBlazblue\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e but that is no more due to the likes of Arc System Works. I also do episodic reviews of TV shows and anime such as \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Flash\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTMNT 2012\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAce Attorney\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e anime. Though I provide great content, I have to struggle with YouTube and its various changes that has brought ire to many, including me. Made no different by the fact that things are much difficult now, which is why stuff like \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0has come about, giving content creators opportunities to keep doing what they love while keeping a steady income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHence why I\u0027ve decided that after weeks of planning, I decided to open up a Patreon of my own with the goal of hopefully making my YouTube channel be a full time gig. I have been doing this fully since 2012, during my college years. What I will do with the support I get from this range from better gear like a new mic or a brand new computer that can allow me to do livestreams. I want to improve, I want to grow but I can\u0027t do it alone. I need all the help I can get and that\u0027s what my Patrons come in to play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of my video content that\u0027s on YouTube is free, no matter what. But if people want to pitch in and help to make a difference, they\u0027re more than welcome to. I won\u0027t bite. Believe me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am \u003cstrong\u003eMegamanNG\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and welcome to my Patreon. Hope to make your acquaintance.\u003cbr\u003e"
