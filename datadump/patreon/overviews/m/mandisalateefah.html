In addition to running BN and traveling to wherever I am invited to participate, I will be creating content and having discussions that are important to me and this movement. For those of you who aren\u0027t more familiar with me personally - be prepared, because I can get extremely real and raunchy. And now, I won\u0027t be limited by the constraints of a corporate job setting, as I was for many years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the places you will have seen me in the media are as follows:\u003cbr\u003e* CBS Sunday Morning\u003cbr\u003e* CNN.com\u003cbr\u003e* JET Magazine\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also serve on the board for American Atheists, and previously for Foundation Beyond Belief, and the Secular Coalition for America. Currently, I serve as the chair for the Board Nominating Committee for the American Humanist Association (whew!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you like to have fun yet informative dialogue, and would like to receive great information, this will be the page for you. I really appreciate all of the support I have received over the years. Your patronage will help me continue my work with BN, as well as extend my personal and professional outreach to those who need it. You will also help me support various related causes that are important for both me AND you. With the express permission of other content providers, I will also share some interviews, videos and other material that is relevant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to your support, and making you even more of a fan. Hope you enjoy the ride!!!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMandisa"
