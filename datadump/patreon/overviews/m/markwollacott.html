    "summary": "Greetings,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting my Patreon profile and for considering helping to fund my work. I have said for so long that I wanted to be a writer and a creator, that for the main part, I forgot to do any writing or creating. Caught up in a thought bubble, I did not do what I defined myself as. However, then Jordan B. Peterson said \"clean your room\" and \"compare yourself to the person you were yesterday.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing and I love creating. Going on video or doing podcasts will be a huge challenge, but in the last year I\u0027ve watched a lot and have had the desire to contribute. My plan is to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Make videos about history, philosophy, and ideas\u003cbr\u003e* Comment on events in the world and stand up for what I believe in\u003cbr\u003e* Write novels - I have over 100 ideas and many ongoing\u003cbr\u003e* Work on non-fiction books - I\u0027m currently translating Beowulf which will take a year or so - so these are long-term projects\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd more. By backing me, you are going to get exclusive content, regular blog posts (I\u0027d like to say 1 a week), and access to unique live streams, and Q\u0026amp;As when there\u0027s enough patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFiction: It\u0027s mostly fantasy or magical realism, though I am considering types of literary fiction too. My debut novel, \"The Girl Who Made It Snow\" is already available. Check it out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eValues: I\u0027m a classical liberal and individualist, a pagan, an open minded guy who loves hearing different views and having open dialogues with people. I love terrible puns (comes from being on the autism spectrum) and am dyslexic. I am also proud to be English, love Europe (the continent not the political organisation), and have lived in Hungary, Japan, and South Korea for varying amounts of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistory: I have a degree in Ancient History and Archaeology, but my favourite period of study is the so-called Dark Ages. I like facts, stats, evidence, and building up pictures of what happened from them rather than going with conventional wisdom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you can give me a dollar a thing or ten or twenty, you are helping to make this dream come true. You are putting yourself on a list of the best people ever. I will always be grateful and will do my best to not only reward you, but support you too if I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMW\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s make it happen\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuick Q\u0026amp;A\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince launching the campaign, there\u0027s been a few questions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan we pay in pounds? - \u003c/strong\u003enot yet, it seems Patreon is a USA only platform right now\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Often Will I be Charged? - \u003c/strong\u003eyour card will be charged once a month. I am going to aim to create things on a regular basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease remember, you will be charged per item per month, so one item is say $1 or $10, but four items (the max I\u0027d ever produce) would be worth $4 or $40.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDon\u0027t forget to set a cap on how much you pay a month just in case, so you are not over charged. Once again, thank you so much for supporting me!!!! :D\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
