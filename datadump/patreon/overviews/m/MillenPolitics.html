Thank you for reading, thank you for listening, and thank you for being a part of this movement. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt \u003ca href=\"http://millennialpolitics.co/\"\u003eMillennial Politics\u003c/a\u003e we\u2019ve embarked on a mission to shine a spotlight on progressive candidates, causes, and organizations in order to re-frame the public narrative to be seen from the millennial perspective. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are completely volunteer-run.\u003c/strong\u003e Every podcast that you listen to, every article that you read, every tweet or Facebook post -- it\u0027s all done by a dedicated team who do this in our spare time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn average, we reach 9 million people per month across our social platforms (you\u0027re probably one of them), and we\u0027re just getting started. So why do we do it? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn today\u2019s crowded media environment, it\u2019s becoming harder and harder for candidates and organizations to get their messages out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe right-wing media-industrial complex is alive and well. From outlets like Fox News, Sinclair Broadcast Group, InfoWars, The Federalist, The Gateway Pundit, Breitbart, NRATV, The Daily Stormer, and more, \"news\" is under attack from conservative bias (and in some cases, fringe conspiracy theories). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe public narratives on issues are often framed from the right, and lately, we\u2019ve seen far-right outlets drive the public narrative with increasing effectiveness.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can even see this in the \u201cmainstream media\u201d. The New York Times hired \u003ca href=\"https://millennialpolitics.co/bret-stephens-new-york-times/\"\u003eBret Stephens\u003c/a\u003e and Bari Weiss, and The Atlantic hired (and then fired) Kevin Williamson, a writer who previously said that \u003ca href=\"https://millennialpolitics.co/anti-choice-death-penalty-abortion/\"\u003ewomen who had abortions should be hanged\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCNN, despite being attacked almost daily by Trump, routinely features talking heads from \u201cboth sides\u201d \u003ca href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/cnn-jeff-zucker-thinks-this-is-a-game\"\u003efor higher ratings\u003c/a\u003e, even though it gives credibility to \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/25/politics/rick-santorum-guns-cnntv/index.html\"\u003efringe figures\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/02/what-cnn-analyst-jeffrey-lord-got-very-wrong-in-that-kkk-debate-with-van-jones/\"\u003ebigoted views\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs millennials, we have the most to lose in this fight. \u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s why it\u0027s absolutely imperative we\u0027re active and having our voices heard. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut we can\u2019t do it without you.
