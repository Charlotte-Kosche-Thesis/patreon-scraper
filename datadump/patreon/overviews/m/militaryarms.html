    "summary": "Since the Military Arms Channel started it\u0027s been funded in part by YouTube earnings but also by money out of my pocket. The truth is, I\u0027ve funded the channel mostly from my own pocket.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started the Military Arms Channel because of my passion for collecting and shooting firearms and my love for our 2nd Amendment community. I want to bring you, my viewers, along with me to the range to see new and even some older unusual items. It\u0027s about sharing knowledge (both ways, I learn from you too!) and promoting the safe, responsible use of firearms for all lawful purposes. It\u0027s also important to note that MAC is a family safe channel and is all inclusive! We welcome people from all walks of life to join us and we \u003cstrong\u003edo not\u003c/strong\u003e engage in partisan politics. All are welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo improve and grow the channel I need to find a way to fund that growth without compromising my integrity by accepting sponsorships from firearms companies. Recent changes in YouTube\u0027s monetization has forced us, and other creators, to reach out to our fans and followers through Patreon for their support. But this isn\u0027t just about supporting MAC, there\u0027s much more to being part of our Patreon family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a bonus we\u0027ve decided to make the MAC Patreon a buyers club of sorts. We have been able to locate some INCREDIBLE deals on all sorts of goodies that we will pass along those savings to you, our Patreon supporters. Many times the prices we\u0027re able to pass along to you are below \u003cem\u003edistributor\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0pricing. We promise you won\u0027t find lower prices \u003cstrong\u003eanywhere\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0on the internet. We\u0027re negotiating with distributors and manufacturers to get special promotional pricing on for our Patreons. From time to time we\u0027ll make specials available to all Patreon members, but our \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSquad Leaders\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and above will have regular discount codes shared with them for purchases on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.coppercustom.com\"\u003eCopper Custom\u003c/a\u003e website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is one more way we would like to THANK YOU for supporting the Military Arms Channel, which is a Veteran owned and managed channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, please check out the other pro-2nd Amendment channels we support here on Patreon (scroll down on and look on the bottom right side of the page).
