Its been a huge rollercoaster journey and yet, Im ready to jump on and let Patreon take me where it wants to next!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis crazy art making life has led me through many phases; a face painter, a scrap-store owner, jewellery maker, pavement artist, sex worker, Etsy team leader, craft workshop facilitator and now in my current phase a work at home mum and artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy work resists definition \u003c/strong\u003ebut I class myself as an interdisciplinary mixed media artist.

No watermarks to protect from theft, no hiding my images to prevent them being stolen; I dream of a world I can make my art, put it out there for free, and still pay my rent! Many of my images have gone viral within the DBT community; including Ride the Wave and Wise Mind, but clicking the share button, no matter how much you love my image,doesn\u0027t help to pay my bills!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where patreon comes in.
