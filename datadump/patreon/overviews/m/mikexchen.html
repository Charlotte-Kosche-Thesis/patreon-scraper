    "summary": "Hi! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrab a drink cause this will be a long one...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Mike Chen and I have been creating videos for about 4 years now. The first channel I ever made was \u003cstrong\u003eBeyond Science\u003c/strong\u003e, which was created out of my genuine curiosity and interest in all things strange and supernatural. Turns out many others were also interested in the topics that I discussed on that channel, and that\u2019s pretty much how my YouTube \u201ccareer\u201d started out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon afterward, my absolute love for food resulted in the creation of \u003cstrong\u003eStrictly Dumpling\u003c/strong\u003e, where I was able to share my enthusiasm for all foods (especially CHINESE FOOD) as well as document my food adventures as I traveled around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, I created channels like \u003cstrong\u003eThe Chen Dynasty, Chenews and Beyond Science 2\u003c/strong\u003e to cover topics that I was passionate about but didn\u2019t quite seem to fit into the channels that I had already created. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result, the number of channels I owned grew and grew. I now have a \u003cstrong\u003edozen\u003c/strong\u003e channels (and even more in the making) that I\u0027m proud to call my own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started everything by myself, and for the first few years of my YouTube career, I was my own film crew and editing/production team. Gradually, as my workload became way too heavy to handle on my own, I hired a small team of people to help me keep all of my channels up and running. Thanks to them, I have been able to continue to create fun, informative, educational, mouthwatering videos that everyone can enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did I create a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAlthough the number of channels I have is increasing, I don\u2019t want the quality of my videos to remain static. I want to create MORE channels, MORE videos, and even BETTER content. Unfortunately, in order to make better videos, there needs to be a bigger team, better equipment, and of course a higher budget. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e What am I planning to do? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to build a better food show that allows me to travel to more locations around the world with a small film crew that will drastically increase the efficiency of my video recordings and food reviews. I want to capture higher quality footages of food in its various states of preparation and make sure that viewers can feel like they are enjoying the food WITH me as I eat. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also starting a 12-episode Beyond Science documentary series where I travel to various locations around the world to investigate unsolved mysteries and look at strange artifacts that hint at the existence of the supernatural. It would be fascinating to see and record these things in the flesh and confirm their existence. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I want to create a brand new animated Chinese cultural series on our Chen Dynasty channel that is educational, entertaining AND can be used as supplemental teaching material in classrooms. This will allow more people to learn about China\u0027s 5000 years of traditional culture. First steps have already been taken, as shown in the most recent animated videos on the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I want to do all of this though? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFirst off, you guys deserve better. I feel like both the topics I cover and the food I eat have the potential to be made into much more \u003cem\u003eintimate, engaging, and fascinating\u003c/em\u003e videos than they are right now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond of all, YouTube\u2019s monetization policy has definitely been a problem for the entire Youtube content creator community. Many of our videos have been demonetized for sometimes no reason at all, and YouTube ads have become less reliable over the years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll in all, we just want the best for our channels, and unfortunately, the only way we are able to do that is by increasing our budget for the company. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, please do not feel obligated to donate. I am already so, so thankful to have such a kind community of dedicated subscribers who don\u2019t seem to be affected by any of the toxicity that I often see on YouTube. Just watching my videos and supporting me is already something that I could NEVER have imagined before starting a channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove, \u003cbr\u003eMike Chen\u003cbr\u003e"
