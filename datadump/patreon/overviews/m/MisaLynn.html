My name is Misa~ \u003cbr\u003eI love to play video games, read comics/manga, watch anime (or just tv shows in general), going to conventions and oh, yeah..... dress up! Cosplaying is one of my favorite things to do and it has truly been life changing for me. It has given me great opportunities in life that I am always very grateful for. I like to meet new friends and bond with others over similar interests as well. The best part of conventions for me is always having a great time with everyone around me and making the most of everything. I\u0027m always working hard to improve my cosplay making skills to put out more intricate costumes. Aside from all that I love to spend time with my amazing cat Pix, cook, draw and listen to music~\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been cosplaying since Otakon in July of 2011, with my first cosplay being Yoko Littner from the anime series Gurren Lagann. My first real convention experience was at AnimeNEXT a couple months before Otakon. After attending AnimeNEXT I was super excited to start cosplaying which is why decided to start at Otakon. I am very happy with Yoko being my first choice because it helped me to be confident in what I am cosplaying and encouraged me to continue doing more. After that I never stopped, which is why I am where I am today~\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll in all cosplaying is very important to me. It has changed me as a person and my life in so many amazing ways. Before cosplaying I was usually very shy and not as outgoing. Cosplay has definitely helped me overcome any anxiety I sometimes get when socializing, and taught me how to talk to people easier. I am much more outgoing and happier than I have ever been before cosplaying and I wouldn\u0027t take it back for anything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig09.deviantart.net/84d2/f/2017/058/2/c/2ceefa7361d48a5d0c103e01f35ef1bd-db0lx5a.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI think Patreon is somewhere my followers and I can support each other. I know some of you love to see me put out new cosplays and content, but sometimes cosplay can get pretty pricey. Having this helps cushion the blow to my wallet so I can put out more content at a faster pace. With help from my supporters I will be able to do more cosplays and photo shoots as well as aiming to make everything better as time goes on. I am so fortunate to be where I am with cosplay, and I can\u0027t thank you all enough. Support comes in many ways and I appreciate it all no matter what form \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImportant Things To Know:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e****Please note that sets and prints will not be sent out until the end of the month and after your payment has cleared.
