    "summary": "When we both started out producing The Motoring Podcast News Show, we really didn\u0027t know if we\u0027d make it to Episode 10, let alone Episode 100 and we\u0027re both delighted and amazed to have reached and passed that milestone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo keep on growing and nurturing The Motoring Podcast, we\u0027re going to have to make it a bit more sustainable. So far we\u0027ve managed to self-fund all our work, but better audio, hosting, insurance, getting to events and accommodation all cost money. What we\u0027re going to do, then, is ask you to buy us a pint. Not a literal pint, but a virtual one by pledging a pint each a month via the Patreon service. The average price of a pint in the UK is \u00a33.50, or $4 so if you could see your way to donating $8, a pint each a month, that would be fantastic.  Naturally, it doesn\u2019t have to be $8/month, any amount is gratefully received.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo encourage you though, if you donate at the pint level ($8 or more a month), we promise that we\u0027ll buy you a pint (or equivalent non-alcoholic beverage) when we see you in person. You know, because that\u2019s the right thing to do...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your help and safe motoring!\u003cbr\u003e"

After much muttering from both about how they wanted to listen to a podcast talking about cars and the week\u0027s motoring news, nobody else took the hint so they decided they should stop whinging and do it themselves. The result is The Motoring Podcast News Show\u003cbr\u003eThe News Show has a\u00a0sister podcast, Rear View, a (mostly) weekly therapist\u0027s couch for interesting people in the motoring world to tell how they got to where they are today. Together these two podcasts represent over two hours of published content each week.\u003cbr\u003e",
