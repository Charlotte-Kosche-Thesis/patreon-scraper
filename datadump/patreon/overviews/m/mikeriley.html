     "about": "Michael \u201cMike\u201d Riley was born and raised in Orange County, CA. His mother was a schoolteacher from Cleveland, Ohio, who made education a number one priority in Mike\u2019s life.  She was also adamant about voting and participating in government. The language of transformation that Mike\u2019s parents carried forward from the sixties informed Mike\u2019s earliest childhood and fostered a curiosity in him that led to an active high school career in Tustin, California.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to being active in music and the arts, Mike was in several music bands, was a photographer and was also a local DJ. Naturally, he was president of his campus Black Student Union where he was involved in many of the campus organizational events concerning African American culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollowing high school, Mike attended college in Fullerton to pursue a degree in music and piano performance. While in college he received an internship at Interscope Records, which led to a job as a personal assistant to recording artists Nas and Kelis. After that, Mike worked in the marketing department for 93.5 KDAY, which is a Los Angeles based hip-hop station. In 2008, Mike became heavily involved in his local Democratic part by signing up and campaigning for Barack Obama. Mike graduated from CSUF in 2010 with an A.A. in Human Expression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010, Mike linked arms with two former music production partners and produced an EP entitled RPD20x, which featured artists such Kendrick Lamar, Nipsey Hussle, Jay Rock and Crooked before they were the successful artists they are today. The promotion of that project required Mike to learn the production skills necessary to produce music videos. His first music video production entitled \u201cHometown\u201d was released in 2010 and received four million views on WSHH.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that success in hand, Mike decided to pursue film and photography full time. In 2012, he launched Finally Free Media with several business partners. Over the next three years he directed and produced numerous music videos and short productions. In 2013, the low voter turnout for the Los Angeles mayoral election flipped Mike\u2019s activist switch, and he decided to produce his first documentary film, The Uninformed States of America. The basis of this documentary was to seek the causes, effects and solutions to political apathy and ignorance in The United States. In 2016 The Young Angels of America organization invited Mike to direct their Millennial Voters Matter project and sponsored the development of The Mike Riley Now Podcast. The organization is also incubating The Mike Riley documentary web series, \u201cThe Uninformed States of America\u201d.  Mike Riley lives in Los Angeles, California.\u003cbr\u003e",
