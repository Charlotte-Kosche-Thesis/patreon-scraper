    "summary": "Hello! This is Heather, though most of you probably know me as MakioKuta. I\u0027m the artist and writer for the small time indie game dev team, Dragonfly Studios. We\u0027ve recently put out a game called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://awaf.dragonflydev.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eApril was a Fool\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and we\u0027re shocked and pleased by the success. We\u0027re hoping to expand the game further, but a lot of the things we\u0027re looking to do are both time consuming and costly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth of us work fulltime jobs and the money we earn goes towards rent, food, and other necessities. Being able to have extra funds to put towards the game or towards life will open us up towards making it the best it can be, without falling off a cliff into a den of stress or financial struggle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny money raised through this patreon will go towards the benefit of Dragonfly Studios games. Currently that means April was a Fool, but down the road it will hopefully allow us to create even more games of a higher caliber than those we\u0027ve put out in the past.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting this patreon, you\u0027ll be able to see sneak peeks of the projects we\u0027re working on. Also, because I am an artist, I\u0027ll be able to offer my skills to patrons for different exciting things such as free commissions, wallpapers and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading!"
