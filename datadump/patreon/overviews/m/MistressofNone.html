    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMistress of None\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a series of books about a con woman who is forced out of retirement when her past comes back to haunt her...literally. Fans of Steampunk and uppity women will love following Viola Thorne and her friends\u00a0from shore to shore and back again in gaslight America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first book, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eNo Rest for the Wicked\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, finds our anti-heroine enjoying the good life. She\u0027s left behind her days of grifting and running errands for the dead, and is happy just to soak in her hot spring on the edge of 1871 Sacramento. But the dead stranger on her doorstep won\u0027t let her forget her abilities and talks her into digging up buried gold to pay his debt and save a life. Vi isn\u0027t as interested in the gold as she is in finding out who has been blabbing about her \"special talents\" and why someone seems determined to flush her out of hiding...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI describe Vi as the female love-child of Han Solo and Jack Sparrow. She doesn\u0027t always do what is \"right,\" but she always does what is right for her, and her sharp tongue can sometimes get her into trouble. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Vi wouldn\u0027t be the only one traveling! In order to meet other awesome Steampunk fans, I hope to visit a series of conventions to sell my books in person and give talks about my favorite fandom and its roots. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for stopping by my Patreon page.

Perhaps it was the quiet chirps of the\ncrickets, or the splash of stars above her head, but something about the nights\nhere at the end of the world called out to her.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSulfurous steam rose off the water and\neddied around her head and shoulders while the rest of her luxuriated in the\ngentle currents of heat under the surface. It had taken weeks of aching muscles\nto reinforce the natural pool with stones from all over the ranch, but now\nshe\u2019d carved out and built up the perfect niche for soaking. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA half-empty bottle of whiskey sat near a waxed\npaper parcel on the rim. She reached inside and pulled out a fragrant hunk of\nsoap. This was the last of what she\u2019d brought from back East, and there was no\ntelling when she\u2019d be able to get more, but she worked the bubbles through her\nhair and scalp with gusto. The smell of lilacs rose from the lather to combat\nthe reek of rotten eggs and she breathed it deep into her lungs as she closed\nher eyes against the tide of foam.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eA gentle\nsensation as light and dangerous as hornet wings fluttered on the back of her\nneck and slowed her hands. Miles away from anywhere anyone might\npossibly want to go, she should have been safe from prying eyes in the hot\nspring even in broad daylight, and yet she could feel someone watching her.\nUnwilling to let the peeping Tom know she was on to him, Vi went back to\nwashing her hair but listened for the telltale crack of a twig or the whisper\nof cloth to give her an idea of the infiltrator\u2019s approach. If it came down to\nit, she could always reach out with her \u003cem\u003eother\u003c/em\u003e\nsense, but only as a last resort.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eShe leaned her head back to rinse, the\nlather tinged a dull red from the henna she used to muddy her identity. The\nchance of being recognized way out here was remote, but she still preferred to\ndistance herself from her old life where she could, and her chestnut hair was a\nsmall sacrifice for obscurity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe frontier night stretched out quiet and\nundisturbed before her, yet the prickling awareness spreading across her\nshoulders told her the presence somehow drew nearer. Her fingers brushed\nagainst the knife she always kept strapped to her ankle for just such an\noccasion. Having a jack rabbit for a stalker was far more likely than\nencountering some poor soul wandering the prairie, but naked and alone (and if\nshe was being honest, more than a little inebriated) out in a distant corner of\nher ranch, she couldn\u2019t really take that risk. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWith a deep breath, she reached into\nherself and quested for the feelings that always tickled at the edges of her\nawareness. After spending the past four years pushing the sensations away they\nfelt dull and distant, like the embers of a fire banked and left to be\nrekindled in the morning. She let her mind reach out, washing through the\nwaiting coals of her long-repressed senses. They instantly flared to life hot\nand sharp, despite her years of denial. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHer audience stood behind her, his\ndecidedly unrabbitlike outline burning an incandescent blue inside her skull.\nIn one fluid motion, her blade flashed moon-bright and hurtled toward the place\nhe stood. A hollow thunk told her it had hit the tree behind him without\nlooking, just as she\u2019d expected from the color of his aura.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cAre you crazy? Throwing around knives\nwithout looking!\u201d the ghost cried in alarm and patted his chest where the knife\nhad passed straight through him. \u201cYou could kill someone like that!\u201d He took a\nfew noiseless steps away from the offending blade as if it was going to jump\nout of the tree and bite him.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eVi\u2019s mouth curved up in one corner.\n\u201cYou\u2019re already dead,\u201d she mocked. \u201cWhat are you so worried about?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWhat if I wasn\u2019t?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWith a shrug and a few splashes she made\nher way over to the makeshift stone bench and settled in. \u201cI knew what I was\ndoing.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThen what, pray tell, did you hope to\naccomplish with your little trick?\u201d The insubstantial form crossed his arms and\npeered at her from under the brim of his transparent bowler hat. Even in death,\nthe fine cut of his clothes marked him as an outsider the same way his accent\nmarked him as a New Englander.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eVi twisted her hair into a coil at the top\nof her head before breathing out a contented sigh and resting against a pillow\nof moss. \u201cI was \u003cem\u003ehoping\u003c/em\u003e it would make\nyou go away. So, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Her fingers fluttered in a gesture of\ndismissal and she closed her eyes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eA few silent seconds ticked by and she\ndared to hope he\u2019d leave, but his voice shattered the quiet with his curiosity.\n\u201cWhere did you even pull that knife from?\u201d He craned his neck as if he could\nsee beneath the silver ripples of the pool.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eVi\u2019s head snapped forward, face red from\nmore than the heat of the spring. \u201cIt was strapped to my leg, you degenerate!\nNow, go away. I want to finish my bath in peace.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHe removed his hat and tried his best to\nmollify her. \u201cPlease, I must speak with you.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cNo. What you \u003cem\u003emust\u003c/em\u003e do is move on and stop bothering the living. I\u2019m out of the\nbusiness of running errands for the dead, thank you very much.\u201d Her hands\ntraced shallow furrows in the water.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cBut you don\u2019t even know what I want.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cNo.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cIt\u2019s my wife, you see\u2014\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cStill no.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThere are these men and\u2014\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cDefinitely no.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWe owe them some money.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI can keep this up all night,\u201d she\nwarned.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cBut, they\u2019re going to\u2014\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cNo.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cPlease!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eShe raised her hands out of her bathwater\nand moved them like a conductor as she sang to the tune of a new song that had\nbeen making the rounds. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in helping, all the live-long day.\u201d\nHer hands dropped back into the water with a splash.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf he could breathe, the ghost\u2019s chest\nwould have been heaving in anger, but in his current state he had to settle for\npulling a face sour. \u201cWell, I had to try. My wife is\u2014was\u2014my whole life.\u201d The\nghost donned his spectral hat and turned to leave with a final mumble to\nhimself. \u201cHe warned you she wouldn\u2019t help.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYep, he was right,\u201d she called lazily,\nthen the water surged as she sat forward with sudden interest. \u201cWait. \u003cem\u003eWho\u003c/em\u003e warned you I wouldn\u2019t help?\u201d After\nthe lengths she\u2019d gone to disappear, there shouldn\u2019t be anyone for hundreds of\nmiles who knew about her \u201cspecial talent.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cWill you help me if I tell you?\u201d the\nghost asked, hope written in the lines of his gently glowing face.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eVi narrowed her eyes. \u201cI can guarantee I \u003cem\u003ewon\u2019t \u003c/em\u003ehelp you if you \u003cem\u003edon\u2019t\u003c/em\u003e tell me.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHe smiled and waved his hands in imitation\nof her earlier display. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in telling, all the live-long day.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eShe looked away in a huff. Not knowing the\nidentity of the referrer was going to eat at her, but the information alone\nwasn\u2019t worth the price of dealing with this guy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHat in hand, he tried again. \u201cAw, shucks\nma\u2019am. I promise. I\u2019ll tell you the whole sorry tale of how I found out about\nyou as soon as you agree to help me.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cNo wonder you\u2019ve gotten yourself in\ntrouble,\u201d she said with disgust. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t offer to pay someone up front,\nyou need to hold onto whatever it is for leverage.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cAlright. Then I promise to tell you after\nyou help me.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cNope. Still not interested. It would take\na lot more than that to get me out of this tub.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHis face fell for a moment before he\nbrightened. \u201cWell, there\u2019s always the gold.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eVi\u2019s half-smile returned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say\nanything about gold before.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYou didn\u2019t let me get that far!\u201d The\nghost took a few eager steps back in her direction as he began, but his\nrestlessness kept him pacing as he spoke. \u201cI owe money for my prospecting\nequipment, but I wasn\u2019t having any luck panning. When they came around to\ncollect, I told them \u003cbr\u003eI\u2019d go out again and try farther up the river. They gave\nme until noon tomorrow to pay my debt, but I don\u2019t think anyone really expected\nme to find anything.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOf course they didn\u2019t.\u201d She shrugged.\n\u201cThe big strike in these parts happened when I was a girl.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHe\nstopped walking for a moment and even in his insubstantial state, greed glinted\nin his eyes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cBut I did! I found enough to pay them back \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e make up our losses from the trail.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cAnd then you died,\u201d she stated flatly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a poor stretch of luck.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYes! I was jumped a few hours\u2019 walk from\nhere by some bandits.\u201d The ghost pointed out into the distance behind Vi and\nher hot spring. \u201cThey took my equipment and my mule, but they didn\u2019t take my\ngold.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eShe chuckled. \u201cThey must not have been\nvery \u003cem\u003egood\u003c/em\u003e bandits, then.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cNo, you see, I buried it,\u201d he said with a\nhint of satisfaction. \u201cI knew there might be people like them roaming around,\nso I dug a hole before I went to sleep and stashed it there.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cAnd we see how well \u003cem\u003ethat \u003c/em\u003eall worked out for you.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWell, yes, they were rather unhappy with\nme when they saw my equipment but I didn\u2019t give them any gold.\u201d He allowed\nhimself a small laugh, but the next memory sobered him again. \u201cThey beat on me\nfor a spell trying to get the information, but I knew if they took the gold\nthat was the end for me anyway. You see ma\u2019am, if I don\u2019t get that gold to\nSalty somehow, they said they\u2019d kill her. They\u2019re going to kill my wife!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cUgh, of course. Another man, another\nwoman caught in the crossfire.\u201d With a groan, she gave the water a final,\ncontemplative splash. \u201cThat sounds like Salty alright.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYou know him?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s some sort of businessman,\nbut I know real business and it doesn\u2019t look much like Salty\u2019s way of doing\nthings.\u201d She wrung the final drops of water out of her hair before letting it\nspill loose across her shoulders.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cSo you\u2019ll help me?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cNo.\u201d She stood abruptly, water streaming\ndown her torso. \u201cBut I\u2019ll help your wife.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe\nghost turned away in a flurry of embarrassed splutters. No surprise there\u2014the\nfrontier always ate up and spat out the honorable ones like tobacco. If he were\nan ordinary man, she\u2019d have been more self-conscious about her nudity, but as\nghosts are generally limited to looking and nothing more, she tended to treat\nthem like furniture. All the same, the air was cool after her long soak in the\nspring, and she climbed onto the bank to retrieve her clothes. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWell, if we\u2019re going to be working this\njob together, I suppose introductions are in order.\u201d The final button fastened,\nshe grabbed her whiskey and took a swig. \u201cI suppose you know I\u2019m Vi, and you\nare\u2026Oh sorry. And you \u003cem\u003ewere\u2026?\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHe whirled back, a pained expression on\nhis face. \u201cI don\u2019t see what is so funny about all this.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cSorry,\u201d she mumbled, making a show of\nshoving her foot into an oversized boot to explain her averted eyes. \u201cThis\nisn\u2019t my first time talking to a ghost, but I suppose this is the first time\nyou\u2019ve died.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cObviously,\u201d he retorted, a giggle\nbubbling up and receding into weary sigh. An uncomfortable silence followed and\nVi cleared her throat as a reminder. \u201cAh yes, my name. It\u2019s Tobias.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOkay, Toby, this \u2018buried treasure\u2019 of\nyours, it\u2019s marked with an X or something?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cNot exactly\u2026I\u2019ll have to lead you there.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eShe pulled on her second boot and\nstraightened. \u201cWhen do we leave?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a Patron to find out what happens next!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
