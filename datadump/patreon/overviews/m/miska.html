I just love to draw maps because it\u0027s a great way to inspire and evoke imagination. When I create a map, I usually have a story in my mind that I want to tell with it, but I also like to leave the maps open to interpretation and design them with multiple possible uses and approaches. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe themes can range from hard sci-fi to high fantasy, but I try to make my creations easy to adapt to a wide variety of genres.
