    "summary": "Hi there, folks. I go by MG Handler (space or not, doesn\u0027t matter), and my thing is making Quests. What are Quests? Basically\u00a0a form of interactive fiction similar to Choose Your Own Adventure stories, combined with Tabletop RPGs, in which the Quest Master creates the beginning of a story, and the people participating in said Quest vote on prompts or otherwise write in options of actions for the main character to take. Updates to the story are generally done a few paragraphs or pages at a time, and any number of players can discuss the story and vote when able. It\u0027s rather entertaining, and it\u0027s all a combination and exploration of the Quest Master\u0027s and player\u0027s creativity!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve long been interested in writing, and my history in it is fairly varied- starting from simple short form fiction to other fare. I first started writing this Quest to hone my writing skills and practice responding to unexpected input and fan suggestion- it\u0027s proven rather addicting and enjoyable!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy quest in particular is called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive.html?tags=Magical%20Girl%20For%20Hire\"\u003eMagical Girl For Hire\u003c/a\u003e, currently hosted on 4chan.org. It\u0027s basically a pastiche on typical Magical Girl fare, in that the main character is Miranda Styles, an ex-Magical Girl who is now an interdimensional mercenary under the employ of a member of an Outer God-like race who\u0027s name is Sal. He enjoys cake, food in general, and teasing people. Especially Miranda. Also likes drawing out his consonants. He\u0027s weird.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMiranda, on the other hand, has to deal with this, and doing her job- which can entail doing very not-nice things to undeserving people. After all, her continued existence is dependent on how much money she makes, and if she doesn\u0027t pay, well...death would be a kindness. So, no matter what happens, or who gets in her way...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe job comes first!\u003cbr\u003e-------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, with that out of the way, I want to mention that although I love writing this story, I\u0027m less able to spend time on it than I\u0027d like to, thanks to life (bills) and whatnot. Oftentimes I have to cancel runs entirely due to other issues taking priority, and especially lately my run schedule has become spotty due to this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt should be clear, though. I\u0027m not doing this because I\u0027m holding the quest hostage- things will still run as standard, and nothing will be paywalled. However, any help you give me will be greatly appreciated, and you all WILL be rewarded in some way- I have a couple of skills I could put forth towards expanding this universe, and should I be able to find the spare time thanks to Patreon, then I\u0027ll be sure to share them with EVERYONE. Regardless, for anyone that does donate, you should know you have my unending thanks and appreciation, and anyone who reads of course has my love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMG Handler"
