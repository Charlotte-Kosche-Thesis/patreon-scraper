Not having to eat frozen food is also in that vision, but I digress. \u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA little bit about Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e is a platform that allows fans to directly support artists and play an important role in their creation process. It\u0027s \u003cem\u003edifferent\u003c/em\u003e from other crowd-funding campaigns as I explain in the \u003cstrong\u003evideo above\u003c/strong\u003e, because it\u0027s an ongoing campaign. I often get messages from fans saying they missed the Kickstarter deadline and are wondering how they can help out with future projects; or they just want to know how they can donate. Regardless of how you choose to show your support, Patreon is the answer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ultimate goal is to increase the number of patrons, and overall funding pool. \u003cbr\u003eEach time we reach a stretch-goal, the Patreon content will be upgraded. Look to the right and you\u0027ll see that the \u003cstrong\u003efirst\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003estretch-goal \u003c/strong\u003eis the release of a song from \u003ci style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 300;\"\u003eRetro\u0027d 2\u003c/i\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eexclusively\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for Patreon supporters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s17.postimg.org/610cif3bj/retrod_II_action_crop.jpg\" style=\"width: 571px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs we reach higher goals, the quality of the content will drastically increase\u003c/strong\u003e, because as many of you know, I put almost every cent I make back into creating new content...meaning we\u0027ll grow together. Some things you should expect to see as the funding amount increases: MORE VINYL for past and future releases, more unique merchandise, more tours, more videos with better quality, more collaborations with artists you want to see me work with, and so on and so forth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon-exclusive Activity Feed\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne of the coolest features of Patreon is that there\u0027s a highly interactive activity feed that can only be seen by my patrons. \u003cstrong\u003eAll who pledge will receive access to this feed.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ll be posting new songs and videos here, as well as surveys for what kind of new content you\u0027d like to see in the future. You\u0027ll also be able to vote for what video game songs you\u0027d like to see me flip!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always wanted to have a forum where my fans and I can discuss the direction of future projects or just chop it up and build with each other. The Patreon activity feed will allow us to do just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe best part. \u003cbr\u003eLook once again to the right...now back to me...now back to the rewards, and remember that each tier is cumulative, meaning if you pledge $10 for each new piece of content released, you\u0027ll also receive the $1, $2, etc. tier rewards, all the way up to the $10 tier. \u00a0(You can set a max limit in your settings, that way you\u0027ll never go over your specified amount)\u00a0If you have ideas for future rewards, feel free to post them on the Patreon feed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m extremely excited about this, I hope you are too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all the support over the years.
