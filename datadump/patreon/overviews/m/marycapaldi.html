I love\ndesigning characters and coming up with new ideas and designs to\ndelight and inspire my audience. However, it\u0027s difficult to make a\nliving as an independent artist, and I must currently devote a\nsignificant portion of my creative energy to commissioned work to\nsupport myself. With your help, I can put more time into creating the\nunique projects so many already enjoy, from cute bug doodles to\ncomics and illustrations!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon provides you with an opportunity to support me at whatever\nlevel is comfortable while getting rewards and sneak peeks at\nupcoming projects in the process!
