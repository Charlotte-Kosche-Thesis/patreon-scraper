Whether you\u0027re an experienced mbira player or are just now discovering the beautiful complexities of this incredible music, you\u0027re in the right place.\u00a0 The weekly lessons are generally split up so that Joel offers a Nyamaropa tuned mbira lesson and a mavembe tuned mbira lesson every week.\u00a0 We also have fun teaching the theory and concepts behind the music, Shona language and singing, Zimbabwean style guitar, matepe, and sharing Joel\u0027s electronic music and DIY creations. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn Depth Teaching\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e- This community is NOT simply about showing you notes to play.  I (Joel) do my best to show you the reasons for playing certain variations and I guide you through the building of those variations from the ground up. This community is about going deep in to this music and really exploring the \"why\" for a lot of the variations around this music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContext is everything-especially in mbira music. In these videos we also look at mbira singing, Shona language, matepe, Sungura guitar, studio musings, video field recordings from Zimbabwe, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoel generally does a weekly live video (gigging schedule permitting) where he connects with this growing community, answer questions, and talk about what he will be teaching for the following week.
