I create fetishy comics and pictures using 3D\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30e0\u5c11\u5973, mostly dealing with girls expanding/inflating (breast, butt, belly, GTS) and other kinds of body transformations (shrinking, TF, TG, multibreast and other kinds of stuff) in cute/silly/sexy situations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping to use Patreon to create more fun content separate from commissions and to fund my tools (computer components, 3d modeling software and assorted art programs).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still trying to think up some good rewards for donators, probably giving requests and such on a weekly basis. If specific stretch goals are met I think it would be fun to do Patreon only series based on ideas submitted and voted on from and by members. Also everyone who supports me will be able to view my pieces prior to their posting on DA (on DA I only post 1 thing daily) in addition to getting the chance to see content a bit too risque for deviantart.\u003ca href=\"http://morphy-mcmorpherson.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
