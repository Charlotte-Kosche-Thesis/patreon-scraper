    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eTHE OBLIGATORY BIO\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMichael Bray is a horror/thriller\nauthor of several novels. Influenced from an early age by the suspense horror\nof authors such as Stephen King, Richard Laymon, Shaun Hutson, James Herbert\n\u0026amp; Brian Lumley, along with TV shows like Tales from the Crypt \u0026amp; The\nTwilight Zone, his work touches on the psychological side of horror, teasing\nthe reader\u2019s nerves and willing them to keep turning the pages. Several of his\ntitles are currently being translated into multiple languages and he recently\nsold movie rights to his novel, MEAT with production planned to take place in\n2017. When not writing he loves to read, watch TV and follows his beloved\nfootball team, Leeds United.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA WORD FROM MICHAEL\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, that\u0027s the bio out of the way, now it\u0027s time to ask why\nyou should support me?  Well, the truth is writing full time isn\u2019t always\nas easy as people think. The job comes with a lot of stresses and there is a\ndegree of uncertainty as far as maintaining a sustainable income which due to\nthe changes in the digital book market means more and more authors are turning\ntowards alternative methods to achieve a sustainable income which allows them\nto continue to provide the books their readers love to read. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCARDS ON THE TABLE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo be honest, I was unsure\nif I should even pursue this as an\noption. The last thing I wanted to do was\nto come across as if I was begging for\ncash or crossing boundaries with my fantastic group of readers. A way to\ncounteract this uncertainty was to offer some rewards for your support which I feel truly are valuable to those who follow\nand support my journey. I wanted to ensure that if I did this, then what I gave\nback for the support was vital and so I\nset up the listed rewards with that in mind and hope they are valuable enough to you, the potential supporter to consider investing in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA FINAL WORD\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI do just want to say before I stop rambling (It\u0027s a writer\nthing) that no matter the pledge or even if you decide not to pledge and buy a\nbook instead that I appreciate your continued support. Just knowing that someone out\nthere has taken a chance on my by first purchasing a book of mine then taking\nthe time to read it means so much and is the driving force behind my continued\nefforts to keep producing quality titles. No matter how you choose to support\nme just know I am massively appreciative.\nWith that said, have a look at the rewards on offer and see if you feel like\ncoming along on this journey with me. I think it\u0027s going to be a good one!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMichael\u003cbr\u003e"
