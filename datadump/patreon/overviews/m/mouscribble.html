    "summary": "Hello dear patrons, I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eSandi\u003c/strong\u003e (more commonly known as \u003cstrong\u003eMouScribble\u003c/strong\u003e) and it\u0027s my dream to make a living through my artwork by drawing for myself, others and comics. Up until recently I haven\u0027t had the time or capability to pursue my art much more than through private commissions or freelance work while maintaining a full-time job, but I\u0027m hoping to be able to change all of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to be able to stay on track both financially and keep doing what I love to do, \u003cstrong\u003eI need your help\u003c/strong\u003e. Alongside my webcomic project, I plan to try out three additional things; a \u003cstrong\u003eSketch Lottery\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eSpeed Drawings\u003c/strong\u003e,\u00a0and \u003cstrong\u003eArt Requests \u003c/strong\u003eonce the milestones have been reached.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSketch Lottery\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will take suggestions from Patrons every month and select three to four ideas for Patrons to vote on. The winning vote will be sketched out and the progress shots as well as end result will be uploaded before the month is over. Hi res versions will be available to $5+ Patrons for these just like my other artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpeed Drawings\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce this milestone is reached I\u0027ll record either a traditional drawing or a digital one and hire someone to clean up and edit them into a 10-20 minute speed drawing. I\u0027ve always wanted to capture and condense my artistic process to show others and demonstrate the techniques I\u0027ve developed over the years, but I\u0027m horribly hopeless at video editing software. Hitting this tier would make this little dream of mine come true and show you how I manage to utterly consume one pencil per drawing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonthly Art Requests\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be two additional tiers of up to three Patrons a month per (amount may change later) who will be able to request a digital drawing from me of their choice. The complexity of the request will depend on how much of the figure is requested and what they are wearing. I\u0027m going to limit these to single character requests with minimal background/props inclusion to keep it fair and simple.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/I8W24ze.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, \u003cstrong\u003ethank-you for taking the time to read my Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e. Your help and support means so much to me and I hope to be able to continue creating wonderful things with all of you.\u003cbr\u003e"
