Pledging to me means that I\u0027ll be able to post more Let\u0027s Play style videos, maybe walkthrough videos for some games, potentially lore or critique/review videos, stream on Twitch more, and get equipment to have better quality for all of it.\u003cbr\u003eIf y\u0027all are interested, it\u0027ll also allow me to make song cover videos, and get equipment to have better quality on them, since some people have said that I have a good singing voice.\u003cbr\u003ePotentially, depending on the feasibility of it and interest levels in it, I might also post some videos of my friends and I playing Tabletop games online, primarily Pathfinder. Alternatively, I might try to post campaign diary videos describing the shenanigans my players get up to.\u003cbr\u003eBasically, the more money that I get through this, the less I have to worry about getting evicted or starving to death. The less I have to worry about that, the more often I can make content, and the better content I can create."
