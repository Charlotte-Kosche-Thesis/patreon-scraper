However, I now find I have more tales to tell in the Underwood and Flinch Chronicles than I have time left on this mortal coil to write and podcast them. Like all creators here on Patreon, I\u0027d like to make enough money to be able to give up my day job and work full-time on my writing and podcasting. If enough good people chip in, I can do that, and it will enable me to keep my podcasts free for everyone to enjoy. Anything you can afford to add towards that goal would be hugely appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
