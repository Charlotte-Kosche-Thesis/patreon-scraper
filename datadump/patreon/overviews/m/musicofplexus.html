    "summary": "I have been creating electronic music for over 35 years. It\u0027s important to me to be able to write my music unfettered by commercial constraints and especially to have 100% creative control. In order to realize this I have decided to remain an amateur. I have never had any significant income from my music. I feel I have reached the ability to write and record music at a high enough quality that I could start making some money from it, independently. So I have started a Patreon campaign to provide my music to you in exchange for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I have spent many $10k\u0027s on music equipment in order to do the best job I can with my music. I am always using different creative tools, whether it be music software or studio hardware. There are new products with new capabilities coming out all the time. I endevour to acquire and work with these tools. The purpose of this Patreon campaign is to contribute toward the tools I use to create music. The more I have access to, the more interesting and better sounding music I can create. All funds will go towards Plexus music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am starting this out with simple monthly contributions. I want to incorporate rewards for higher levels of support. Some ideas are: patron credits, song title suggestions, custom songs, patron-only access to higher quality audio, access to live performance streaming, and more. I just want to start things out slowly to see how it goes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently you can access streams of my music at Soundcloud: \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/musicofplexus\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/musicofplexus\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am looking forward to your support and making music that you enjoy!"
