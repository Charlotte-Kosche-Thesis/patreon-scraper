Art crime\u2014theft, looting, trafficking, and forgery\u2014isn\u2019t just academic, it is directly relevant to the world you know and the news you hear every day. And if you have ever been inside a museum, travelled to experience another culture, or walked through a historic site, without even knowing it, you have become part of the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Val\u00e9rie Thibodaux, and I started Markham Caerus to try to understand what art crime is, how to prevent it, how to respond to it, and what we lose when a piece of human culture is destroyed. I started this Patreon project because everyone I talked to about my research\u2014people with no connection to art or archaeology\u2014was surprised and interested. They had never heard of art crime before, but as soon as they thought about it, they started to wonder, and began to ask questions. I want to answer those questions for everyone, and Patreon is an incredible platform to do just that. Getting involved starts with getting interested and getting informed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSubscribe to the Curious level\u003c/strong\u003e to get access to all written posts\u2014the core of the content\u2014and find out about a world hidden behind the headlines.

And I will always include public posts, so even if you aren\u0027t ready to become a patron you will find resources and ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page isn\u2019t just an education project for you, it is a learning platform for me, and I am excited to continually enhance and develop it, with your help.
