I believe it a brilliant idea for a helping hand. Please consider in giving one dollar (or however you much like) each month is to help you bring you value. I was a cigarettes smoker for more than 30 years and to be honest Vaping saved my life. I breath and sleep a lot better like a new born, and my voice had cleared up, it was getting very bad because of smoking. Now I can sing and hear the difference, even feel the big difference, thanks to the vape inventors. Even though! I had always been around Vapor\u0027s when I was still smoking since 2011. I also worked in a vape shop for a few year\u0027s. There I learned all about Vape products, I had to! because that was my Job. That is why I decided to make vape video\u0027s, to show the world that vaping is much better than smoking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eWere your money go\u0027s:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Producing these video\u0027s Vape products does not comes without a cost, and although it\u0027s not astronomically extremely high, its still coming straight out of my pockets.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Please don\u0027t become a patreon if you\u0027re low on money - Believe me I know exactly how that feel\u0027s like, and please don\u0027t feel like you\u0027re obligated or have to. I will continue making free YouTube vape video\u0027s and giveaways, whether you donate or not. They might be a bit better and more frequent if you do. Please do not donate anything if you are strapped for cash. and again don\u0027t feel obligated to support my work in this way. I am still able to continue making this content because of \u003cstrong\u003eYOU \u003c/strong\u003eguy\u0027s. I choose the topic because \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u003c/strong\u003e all ask for it.
