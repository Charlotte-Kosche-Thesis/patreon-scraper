I try to learn new tricks every other week, I am investing a lot of time into researching topics that I came across, not knowing what they meant.\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd I love telling about what I have learned.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis page is about supporting me in my *sharing knowledge* journey. Maybe you have seen my tutorials for various software tools, maybe you read some of my articles (or books) - maybe you just think I deserve an icecream.

This (ongoing work in progress) book is NOT about a specific language, but about the \"how do I *think* if I want to tell a computer to do the work I get paid for?\"\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHoudini \"1 Node 1 Video\"\u003c/strong\u003e - this isn\u0027t dead, it\u0027s just rotting a bit. Creating video tutorials takes (me) a lot of time and I am trying to concentrate on those that get the most feedback. Although I love this project, I was always hoping for some cooperation, which, so far, has not happened. I\u0027ll get back to this ASAP (the more feedback I get the sooner :) )\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eNew project as of Sept. 2017: \u003cstrong\u003eHoudini Cloth Simulation \u003c/strong\u003e- based on my experience with creating cloth simulations (for a movie project) using bullet physics (a common dynamics library widely used in 3d tools from low to high end), I am now working on an in-depth tutorial with some written side-docs about \"how to deal with cloth and soft body physics in Houdini\" (going to use both FEM and grains for their respective advantages).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nIf you support my works by donating some monetary fuel, you are encouraging me to invest more time and energy into getting any of those projects done. Or at least continued.\u003cbr\u003e\nBesides, some semi-anonymous \"pledge\" is way easier than saying a personal \"thanks\" on one of the streaming platforms \u0026lt;wink\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMarc Albrecht"
