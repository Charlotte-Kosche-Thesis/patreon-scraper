    "summary": "As Mr. Fix It, I create DIY, How-To and Home Improvement related project videos, and fun project builds. I pride myself on approaching every project with a willingness to learn, grow, and expand my skill set, while passing on what I\u0027ve learned to my audience. I aim to show that anyone with the right set of tools, knowledge, and willingness to push past their fears can build or fix something they never thought possible, and can do it without spending a ton of money. My goal is to continue to push myself to find new and innovative ways to create engaging, visual, and informative content for a digital audience for FREE. It\u0027s easier said than done! Each project is unique and takes time, which as you know equals money. By using Patreon, I hope to be able to generate additional funding to take the type and scope of my projects and content to the next level! In exchange for your help, I plan to give you more exclusive content, plans, designs, and build ideas, as well as advice on tackling your own projects! \u003cbr\u003e"
