    "summary": "*This is a super soft launch. I will be making a video to accompany this soon :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey folks!  Thank you for checking out this Patreon Campaign for the Minitwatch channel! Content on the minitwatch channel will \u003cstrong\u003ealways be free\u003c/strong\u003e but the reason that I have created this campaign is to continue provide the \u003cstrong\u003ebest possible content\u003c/strong\u003e that I can while \u003cstrong\u003einnovating and taking things to new heights\u003c/strong\u003e. By contributing, you will be directly affecting the future of this channel, it\u0027s content and more importantly, my life. Yes, you will be affecting my life in a big, positive way! Minitwatch is one of the things that brings me joy. Creating content for you and making you laugh while bringing relevant information is such a meaningful thing in my life right now and I humbly request your help for me to take things to the next level! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eDo you want to support the minitwatch super happy funtime watch review channel with sometimes adventures?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Here\u0027s what you should know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, I am going to call patrons \u003cstrong\u003eTime Lords\u003c/strong\u003e. I think it\u0027s cool and I will address you kind folk as such in videos. Time Lords will not support minitwatch on a monthly basis but instead, by a per-video endeavor. I will make one to three videos per month with the Time Lords in mind. Time Lords will see these videos first but they will eventually be released to the general public to keep things free for all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe kinds of videos I do will start off small but eventually turn into amazing journeys!\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ll need funding for the things that I really want to do so to begin with, we will perhaps do votes on what watch you\u0027d like to see me review. We\u0027ll have to keep the budget lower at first but as this (hopefully) grows, we can incorporate higher-priced, coveted items. I will never stop doing affordable watch reviews, though. That\u0027s why I started this channel but that does not mean I will not do high end ones as well! I will also do mods that you might want to see me do. I will do these videos with the best possible filming and editing that I can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we\u0027ve reached a certain level, I am going to go on more watch-centric adventures. My Big Monster Adventure was a study in execution and result. It was to showcase what I can do with my skill set but I do realize that for for future videos (movies) like those, I\u0027ll need to put more focus on timepieces and less adventuring (but not too much less :p).  I will try to balance it all out. \u00a0Here is an example of what I can do. This is an hour long movie so fair warning. I don\u0027t want to make something this long ever again! lol. \u00a0I will do perhaps twenty minit adventures to acquire watches!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_2YA5Y9NXo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want you to feel like you are with me\u003c/strong\u003e when I travel to investigate a watch shop or a watch company or people while doing so with the most cinematic presence possible. I will also be doing a lot these journeys on the road/trail via motorcycles because why not? It\u0027s also one of my passions. Get ready to follow me through rivers, mountains, deserts and forests to get to the city or town where I am going to pick up potentially...my first high end watch.\u003cstrong\u003e I am determined to make high-quality films\u003c/strong\u003e for you and not just every-day watch reviews like what I normally do.\u003cstrong\u003e I want to make you feel things\u003c/strong\u003e, I want you to \u003cstrong\u003esee wonderful places and amazing scenery\u003c/strong\u003e, witness the ups and downs of adventuring, crack you up with \u003cstrong\u003eUncle Jimmy and Ted\u003c/strong\u003e and maybe, just maybe,\u00a0\u003cem\u003einspire\u00a0you. \u003c/em\u003eYou\u0027ve definitely inspired me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime Lords can start helping with just $1 per film and I will not take advantage of this. Again, I will only do one to three of these per month and you will be in full control as you can limit your funding per month. Please, if you are living paycheck to paycheck like I am, save your money for your family, girlfriend/boyfriend/attack helicopter, or for your next watch instead but I do thank you tremendously for the thought!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration in helping the minitwatch channel, myself, and the puppets with our futures. We appreciate you more than you can possibly imagine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAloha!\u003cbr\u003eCurt\u003cbr\u003e"
