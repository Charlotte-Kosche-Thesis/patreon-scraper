MMA On Point is a joint project between myself - Jason Hartley and Tom Ransom. That\u0027s it. No one else. No investors, no corporate sponsors, we love the sport of MMA and we are dedicated to making quality content every week on the web through videos, articles and on social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is MMA On Point about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the simplest of terms, we are tired of seeing poor quality MMA content on the web. \u003cbr\u003eThere are some amazing journalists out there, like those at MMA Fighting, MMA Junkie, Submission Radio, etc. There are also some great technique analysts and fight breakdowns between coaches and internet personalities in the fight game, but there really isn\u2019t anything great designed \u003cstrong\u003eby the fans for the fans.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to shine light on everything from the smallest of details in the sport to its biggest controversies and add our own voice from a fan\u2019s perspective. We feel this is completely absent in mixed martial arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do we need your support? Where will the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTom and I (Jason) are running MMA On Point full-time, but for the moment we are doing this on a shoestring budget. What we would like to do is hire more video editors so that we can produce more video content on YouTube, writers for our website and the ability to travel to events for live\u00a0coverage. This is a career. It doesn\u0027t stop here. We have so much more planned down the road.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this include?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuality is the keyword. If you already like what we\u2019ve begun putting out there on a strained time schedule, you can imagine how each task will fundamentally become much more in-depth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- More lists and essay videos on YouTube\u003cbr\u003e- New videos series on YouTube (i.e. MMA Legends, Ranking Report, Live Guests, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e- Traveling and Live coverage of events\u003cbr\u003e- News and updates on our website\u003cbr\u003e- Opinion editorials on our website\u003cbr\u003e- Higher quality video gear, live streams, discussions, etc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
