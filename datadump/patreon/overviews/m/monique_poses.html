I\u0027m a Jersey Shore native with a culturally diverse heritage. I am a full time, traveling fine art model with 12 years of both modeling and acting experience. I hold degrees in philosophy and linguistics, and will soon be pursuing my phd. I am perpetually inspired by nature; both its humble subtleties and its drama. I am driven by an instinctual desire to create and express through every aspect of my being.\u00a0I currently make my living as a visual muse, but I am also a passionate writer and performer, who enjoys learning to take and make her own imagery.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ewhere: \u003c/strong\u003eAmerica.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI live everywhere and nowhere.

I am never completely satiated in this want. While I find fulfillment and success in my career as a model, this lifestyle comes with a good deal of sacrifice. Thusly, it is exceedingly difficult to expend effort on other creative endeavors without any outside funding.
