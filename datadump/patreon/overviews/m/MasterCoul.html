    "summary": "My name is Chris and I created a YouTube channel in July of 2013 because I always loved filming and thought it was a great way to express myself. Then I found ASMR and learned about the \"tingles\" which everyone was referring to and I finally understood i was not the only person experiencing this! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI had recently decided to change my whole outlook on life and realized there was so much I could accomplish if I set my mind to it. I developed new point of views and interests and I finally found something I really wanted to be doing. So I re-applied to school so I could receive a degree in Applied Psychology where I could really make the difference I wanted to. To me, helping the less fortunate and suffering is extremely important. I\u0027m dedicating all my time and thoughts to being the best person I can to others and just enjoying the simple things in life! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that being said, I plan on making videos for people to relax, learn and laugh. I have a lot of ideas and I look forward to presenting them to others. I enjoy ASMR and what it brings to people so being a part of this community is extremely important to me. Being a content creator has allowed me to make new friends in the community, not only through other creators but through the viewers as well! So I plan on making as many videos as I can and enjoying the ride as I go along. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect to receive anything in return for making videos but any support is welcome! If I do receive money from my viewers, I will only use it towards improving my content and that\u0027s a promise! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate all the people supporting me and I look forward to a wonderful new year filled with many new memories! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chris (MasterCoul ASMR)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
