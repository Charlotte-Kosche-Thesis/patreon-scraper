    "summary": "When I was 19 years old I got lucky and found my first mentor in life. His name was Glen and he would have me over to his house for one on one meetings and we talked about business, life and anything else you could think of. This went on for about 10 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years into my training with Glen he got cancer and eventually died from it. Before he died he met with me one more time at his house and he asked me to do two things for him.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e#1. Never settle for a comfort zone in life and always seek to find out what your potential is no matter how hard or how long it takes. He even mentioned that I might go broke a few times but just keep going!\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e#2. I was to go out and help at least one person in life in the way that he helped me, so bascially I needed to mentor or teach someone something that could benefit them in life or in business and have it work out for them.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have stayed true to both of those promises. To this day I still work to see what my full potential is no matter what goals I reach and I have already helped well over 100 people in the last 2 years alone with their business growth in some way through my content and lessons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen Glen died I dedicated my life to fullfilling my goals and carrying on his legacy at the same time. Glen was the only person in my life who took the time to listen to me and help when I talked about the things I wanted to accomplish in life. He gave me my chance to thrive so now I hope to do the same for others by what I present here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince Glen\u0027s death I took his advice when it came to personal development. He told me to never take a job for the money, only take a job because of something that it can teach you so that when you move on from that job you can take a new skill or some new knowledge with you and grow from that, and that\u0027s what I did for about 17 years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the time I was 19 till I was in my late 30\u0027s, thats what I did. I literally spent my life going from job to job over many years trying new things and doing personal development research all at the same time. It was one giant, long research project. People thought I was nuts and unstable because I kept going from job to job and not holding a stable income for more than a year or two. My plans were never to have a lifelong career doing just one thing so I actually dedicated my life to putting myself into a job to see and feel how that environment was and how to get out of it. When you still need to rely on a job for income and you want out, all you want is your business to start making money so you can have that option. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know first hand what its like to work all day, be dead tired and then come home and just want to crash, but I didn\u0027t do that and most guru\u0027s never show you the real work that has to be done behind the scenes in order for you to see any progress at all, they either sell systems or proven formula\u0027s that only tell you some of the details, I\u0027ll take it many steps further. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI took notes at every job I ever had. I kept notes on people I worked with, things they said to me, the relationships I had with certain people and more. I basically studied people\u0027s behavior most of my life and the only difference between me and all those people in my past is.......I did what I said I would do and I left those jobs because I created something else to allow that to happen, they were all talk and most of them are still at the same places I left over 15 years ago. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is pretty much what I did with my life up until a few years ago when I launched the \u003cstrong\u003eMeet The Mentor\u003c/strong\u003e as a program. It doesn\u0027t get any more real or detailed than that. I put in the time and worked on ways to get out of jobs because most start up business people want to see results so they can leave a job someday. My program and content will be a great guide for anyone wanting to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy background is very diverse which allows me to relate to a lot of people in life because what I talk about and teach as a business owner strategist isn\u0027t theory......I actually\u00a0lived it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink along the lines of \u003cstrong\u003eMike Rowe\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eDirty Jobs\u003c/strong\u003e. I went out and tried many things in life to get the experience of what those jobs offered and what they could possibly teach me. I\u0027m going to not only share the stories but also lessons I learned from each job I had. Many of you may work in some of these jobs right now but you are trying to make the leap into being a business owner but you have one problem......you are not making enough money yet to leave that job and all you want to do is get the kind of answers you need in order to get things moving so that you can see results and start seeing better progress\u003cstrong\u003e (Am I Right?)\u003c/strong\u003e.....well....I\u0027ve done that, a few times!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know how to make that transition from 9 to 5 jobs to creating your own income with a business. I\u0027ve done it 7 times and I still continue to add more revenue streams to my life so what I want to offer people is a real life perspective of what its like to work at jobs you don\u0027t like, but can find a way out with the type of material I will be presenting to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some of the jobs I have done in my life, see if you have done any of these....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Factory Worker, had several of these jobs, I hated them all but learned a lot.\u003cbr\u003e2. Call Center Telemarketer, I worked for MCI selling local and long distance plans..\u003cbr\u003e3. Fast Food Worker, worked at Pizza Hut for a Summer.\u003cbr\u003e4. Car Sales, Direct Sales, Odd Sales Jobs!....Details Later.\u003cbr\u003e5. Network Marketing/ Amway/Quixtar (Achieved Multiple Pin Levels \u0026amp; Made Income)\u003cbr\u003e6. Public Speaker, Lots of different platforms.\u003cbr\u003e7. Professional DJ/ Music Producer (Amazon.com) (was signed to a record label in Melbourne Australia).\u003cbr\u003e8. Professional Gaming Broadcaster, Owner of \"Competition Sports\" Gaming Channel.\u003cbr\u003e9. Published Author \"Embrace The Grind\" (Amazon.com)\u003cbr\u003e10. Real Estate Investing/Wholesaling. Bought and sold properties in multiple states.\u003cbr\u003e11. Mentoring, Personal Development Speaker. Meet The Mentor Program.\u003cbr\u003e12. Strip Club DJ, Rave DJ, College Bar DJ, Dive Bar DJ, Mobile DJ, (Radio DJ, \"Ozone Weekly Broadcast\", \"Global Icons Series\").\u003cbr\u003e13. Bartender, I don\u0027t know what\u0027s in a Jack \u0026amp; Coke.\u003cbr\u003e14. Janitor, I did this for about 1 month at a factory.\u003cbr\u003e15. Worked for the YMCA as a Maintenance Guy.....(I don\u0027t know how to fix anything).\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my personal stories will be told on Podcasts inside this program. Most of them will be centered around ideas and strategies that I can suggest based on personal experience and based on successful people who I know or have worked with. When I created\u003cstrong\u003e \"Meet The Mentor\"\u003c/strong\u003e a few years ago, it was a private group of people who took classes and that was it, since then I have expanded and decided to move to a different platform so here I am on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am going to show you detailed information that many seminars leave out when you attend them. I have attended over 100+ seminars in my life and I have also been a part of hosting them and all the behind the scenes stuff as well. I will be presenting information to the Patrons on here that I feel is the \u003cstrong\u003e\"Good Stuff\" \u003c/strong\u003eand what most seminar guru\u0027s never tell you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not someone who has a \u003cstrong\u003eSystem\u003c/strong\u003e or a \u003cstrong\u003e5 step plan\u003c/strong\u003e for you. All I have is real world experience and ways to create income from them, thats it. No Hype, no selling you \u003cstrong\u003e\"The Dream\"\u003c/strong\u003e just real world facts and real world practice when it comes to developing skills that can excel you to a new level. I am not a \u003cstrong\u003e\"Know it All\",\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eBUT\u003c/strong\u003e....I am very savvy and I have done a lot of things in my life that were very challenging. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you will be able to relate very easily to me and to my content and some of you will have to be selective based on personal interests which is ok. I will have many different types of lessons for people to enjoy on this platform and I am excited to offer my stories and experiences with you all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time, your trust, and your patronage.
