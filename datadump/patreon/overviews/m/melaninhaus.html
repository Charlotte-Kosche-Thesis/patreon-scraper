They are at the forefront and continually put their lives at risk to do the invaluable work that they do. Often times on mainstream media we are inundated with images of turmoil and grief caused by sorcery related violence and not enough images and reports of our own people within our communities and villages who are bravely working with the victims, perpetrators and law enforcement to put a stop to sorcery related violence. It is important to know that we too can make a difference and are able to be our own heroes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI kindly ask you all to continue to share and keep up the continued support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, thank you \u0026amp; much love.",
