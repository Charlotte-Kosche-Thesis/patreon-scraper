I\u0027m glad you popped in on\nmy patreon page, please do have a look and maybe you find my work\u00a0worthy\u00a0of\u00a0your\u00a0support! :D\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Billie but I go under\nthe username Missangest online.\u00a0I look something like that \u2192\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e(but with a less inflated head)\u003cbr\u003eYou mostly see me with my cat\nunless I\u0027m somewhere where he isn\u0027t allowed.\u003cbr\u003eThe username\nMissangest was chosen pretty randomly just because I needed a unique\nusername which would generate my stuff on google (Miss = well, Miss.\n\u00c5ngest = Anxiety in swedish, not that uplifting but I assure you\nthat my work is much more uplifting than that :D).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat people\ngenerally know me for are my games online. I develop character\ncreator games which I post on my website and sometimes other cool\nwebsite owners share my games on their websites as well. While I do\nprioritate the games and website maintenance, I also have about\n92759872587 other artistic interests that I spend my time on. I just\nsimply love art in many of its forms, I can\u0027t stick to just one!\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.missangestgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Patreon2_zpsrbur60ts.png\" style=\"width: 513px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs\na supporter here on patreon, you would take part of everything I do\nthough, regardless of what project I may be having at the time. It\u0027s\nall bundled up over here! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy support me on patreon? Two reasons\nI\u0027ll tell you! Two! First, it gives you some neat rewards and allows\nyou to be more involved in the work that I do. It\u0027s always nice to be\nable to give you something extra for your support! :D The other\nreason is that I\u0027m deeply passionate about what I\u0027m doing and I want\nnothing more than to be able to spend as much time possible on doing\nthis. Even though I get ad revenues, they aren\u0027t enough to support me\nfully for a good while. The more income I get, the more time I can\nspend on creating these games and artworks as I don\u0027t have to rely as\nmuch on other part time jobs (at the moment I\u0027m on part time sick\nleave, that won\u0027t last forever though)! Which would eventually also\nbenefit you because I\u0027d be able to bring you even more stuff! :D\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHere are some links to check out my\nwork so you know what I\u0027m rambling about:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://missangest.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://missangest.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.missangestgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DeviantARTLink_zpsck2d6a3x.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Missangest/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.missangestgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FacebookLink_zps8ze8btx9.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Missangest\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/missangest/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.missangestgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/InstagramLink_zpsursrymvh.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e(my instagram is both for my work and personal)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAnd then of course you can play all of my games on my website by clicking the picture below!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.missangestgames.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.missangestgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/WebsiteIcon1.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSome notes regarding the rewards:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe full version of my pictures as well as the sketches that you will get are made for you and you only.

If you however have supported me at least once (so your 5$+ pledge has gone through at least once) and you were a patron when submitting your character but then leave, your character will still be included in the game (so don\u0027t worry if you can\u0027t pay during the entire game making process which can last for 2-3 months, one month on the 5$ level is enough).
