I like to describe my style as somewhere between traditional Disney animation and Japanese Anime style with a little bit of Western Comic books thrown in for fun; a blend of bright colour and dark shading that brings characters to life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to see more of my artwork you can find me in the following places \u003cbr\u003e~\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/PhoenixFireArtAU\"\u003eFacebook \u003c/a\u003e~ \u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/groups/PhoenixFireArtNest\"\u003eThe Nest\u003c/a\u003e ~ \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/PhoenixFire_Art\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e ~ \u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/PhoenixFireArtAU\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e ~ \u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to see what artwork I have available for instant sale you can check out my Personal Art Store at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://shop.phoenixfireart.com.au\"\u003eShop.PhoenixFireArt.com.au\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have my art for sale on Shirts, Cups, Pillows, Phone Cases, Laptop Bags, Stickers, Postcards and more via \u003cbr\u003e~ \u003ca href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/people/meakitty\"\u003eRedBubble\u003c/a\u003e ~ \u0026amp; ~ \u003ca href=\"http://teepublic.com/user/PhoenixFireArtAU\"\u003eTeePublic\u003c/a\u003e ~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tOccasionally when I have the resources I do polymer clay sculptures of anything from fun little dragons, to jewellery for all ages, specialising in little crazy unicorns (called Derpicorns) of my creation that you see around the place a lot. More often though I do traditional painting using acrylic paints and mixed media on canvas too, and have multiple craft projects on the go with the intention of being able to ship them all over the world so that others may enjoy my creations as well.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHowever, I do need funding to buy supplies, and as a low income household that already needs to support 2 people and 3 cats, finding extra funds for art is tough. Often we go with minimal amounts of food, and certainly don\u0027t have the money to go anywhere or do anything fun, so Patreon is a helping hand in my efforts to provide a great artistic service at a small cost to buyers while having a minimal impact on my weekly finances.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPatreon allows a creator\u0027s fans to pledge an amount to help them carry on with their art. For a YouTube star this may be the cost of producing a video including all the props and associated costs. For a web comic artist this might cover the cost of materials and website hosting, as well as help towards the cost of producing physical copies or special prints and posters.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tFor a digital artist such as myself this covers the cost of creating merchandise and products for you to buy separately at the end of the month, as well as the cost of the monthly rewards for all my supporters each month. Anything left over goes into the cost of buying materials to produce extra artworks including jewellery, journals, original paintings and artworks, as well as clay sculptures. I really am artistic in that I love creating over many mediums, and every pledge I get goes solely towards the cost of my artistic endeavours created specifically for my fans.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe ultimate goal is to be able to quit my day job and do my art full time; to be able to spend every day making beautiful things for fabulous people such as yourself.\u00a0Patreon is helping artists towards their goals by offering a platform that ensures patrons and creators are taken care of - your money is safe and accounted for while your personal data remains private and secure.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027d like to see more of my artwork you can find me in the following places \u003cbr\u003e~\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/PhoenixFireArtAU\"\u003eFacebook \u003c/a\u003e~ \u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/groups/PhoenixFireArtNest\"\u003eThe Nest\u003c/a\u003e ~ \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/PhoenixFire_Art\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e ~ \u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/PhoenixFireArtAU\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e~ \u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to see what artwork I have available for instant sale you can check out my Personal Art Store at \u003ca href=\"http://shop.phoenixfireart.com.au/\"\u003eShop.PhoenixFireArt.com.au\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have my art for sale on Shirts, Cups, Pillows, Phone Cases,\u00a0 Laptop Bags, Stickers, Postcards and more via \u003cbr\u003e~ \u003ca href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/people/meakitty\"\u003eRedBubble\u003c/a\u003e ~ \u0026amp; ~ \u003ca href=\"http://teepublic.com/user/PhoenixFireArtAU\"\u003eTeePublic\u003c/a\u003e ~\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
