    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eThe Origin Story:\u003c/h1\u003e\nFor nearly a dozen years, I worked in science - as technical staff, graduate student, and then professional scientist. My goal was always the same: to be an effective agent of positive change. Curiously, I discovered that one of the biggest obstacles to positive change was a large and growing gap in between science and society.\nThere were just too many good ideas that were getting stuck on one side or the other of that gap, and not being put into practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a lifelong gamer and unapologetic child-at-heart, I knew that games were a great tool for both fun and learning. So, in January 2013, with grand visions of a better and more playful world, I left my nine-to-five job as a scientist, and founded\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://mindfulmammoth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMindful Mammoth\u003c/a\u003e. Here, with the help of friends and colleagues, we\u2019ve begun to build a better world through play.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhat\u0027s so special about games?\u003c/h1\u003e\nThe world that we live in is complex, unpredictable, and ever-changing. To effectively teach about a changing world, you need a changeable medium - games.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGames are virtual spaces that allow for free and playful exploration. The element of exploration allows players to act as scientists - to make choices, observe the consequences of their choices, and learn from the experience. At the same time, the element of play makes games engaging - drawing players in and offering opportunities to follow their curiosity.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhat kind of games have you made?\u003c/h1\u003eIn the last two years, we\u2019ve developed two high-quality games:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fireandflora.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFire and Flora\u003c/a\u003e: A card game about fire ecology for ages 12+, Fire and Flora weaves together ideas from Pok\u00e9mon, Monopoly, Settlers of Catan, and real life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.puzzleoflifegame.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Puzzle of Life\u003c/a\u003e: An exploratory puzzle about humans, ecosystems, and connectedness. It is a beautiful, playful, and flexible tool for learning about the structure and function of ecosystems. Being flexible, you can use the Puzzle to be as silly or as serious as you want - you can enjoy the Puzzle as just a puzzle, create new pieces based on fact or fantasy, or delve deep to explore important ecological ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve also got lots of ideas for other great games - games about weather, chemistry, botany, society, humanity, and more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhat sort of outreach do you do?\u003c/h1\u003e\nWe bring our games and activities to schools, camps, museums, and festivals throughout California. The details of the programs depend on time, location, and audience - but we generally do some sort of sandwich: short lecture, hands-on gameplay, closing discussion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDoing outreach allows us to advance our primary mission: to promote the understanding and appreciation of science, nature, and life through play. It also gives us feedback that we can use to continually improve our games and programs.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSome noteworthy accomplishments:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOver the last two years, we\u2019ve shared Fire and Flora and The Puzzle of Life with over a dozen classrooms around Southern California (photos\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.onesparkacademy.org/portfolio/seriously-fun-nature-games/gallery/7-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e).\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe\u2019ve hosted activities at the Santa Monica Mountains Science Fest (2015 photos\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mindfulmammoth.com/2015/04/28/photos-from-the-science-fest/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis summer, we\u2019ve partnered with the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://columbiaspacescience.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eColumbia Memorial Space Center\u003c/a\u003e to be a part of their \u201cLife in the Cosmos\u201d Summer Space Camp, and their\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mindfulmammoth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PoL_AT_CMSC.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYoung Explorers Academy\u003c/a\u003e (photos\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153491872809166.1073741854.325921394165\u0026amp;type=3\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e).\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe\u2019re also constantly talking with folks about future events.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhy Patreon? How does it work?\u003c/h1\u003e\nWhile our outreach programs are free to participants, they\u0027re not free for us to produce - to develop a new game costs anywhere from $10K to $40K, and bringing a game to a school costs from $50 to $200 per event. To help us continue making games, and continue sharing our work, we need your help!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019ve looked at a number of crowdfunding options, and Patreon seemed like the best fit. While we aim for a big product release every year or two, most of our work is an ongoing process with a very unpredictable schedule. Some months we focus on teaching and outreach, while in other months, we focus on development.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a good fit to this style of work as it allows us to be flexible - to adapt to the needs of teachers, schools, and development timetables. By becoming a patron and supporting us with a monthly contribution, you can join our quest and help to create a better world through play.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecifically, as a Patron, you\u2019ll be helping us with three things:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEqual-opportunity outreach: By helping to cover the everyday costs of outreach - things like gas, lunch, materials, and time - you\u2019ll help us to continue offering outreach programs on a pay-what-you-want basis.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelping others to do outreach: We\u2019re working to develop lesson plans based on our games so that teachers in other parts of the world (i.e. not-California) can use our work to help students in classrooms, camps, and museums around the world.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExpanding our portfolio: We\u2019ve got lots of great ideas for games about just about everything: weather, chemistry, society, and more. With your help, we can design new games, and grow the power of play.\n\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003ePlease become a Patron, and join us in our quest!\u003c/h1\u003e\nP.S. We\u0027re always open to new ideas. If you\u0027ve got an idea for a cool reward, you should let us know!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
