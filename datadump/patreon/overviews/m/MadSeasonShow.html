    "summary": "I\u0027m a content creator on YouTube. Since March of 2015, I have had a focus on creating guides for one of my favorite games of all time, World of Warcraft. I have totaled over 400 videos dedicated to help out and/or entertain you. I make a mix of guide related videos(gold guides, new patch info etc.) and some entertainment focused videos(\u0027Time Warp\u0027, \u0027Evolution of WoW\u0027, etc). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of it is free and will continue to be free for as long as I make videos. The amount of attention they receive and the supporting comments that go along with them is something for which I am very grateful. Video editing is my passion and being able to share that with such a broad audience is both a dream and a privilege for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my time on Youtube there have been requests here and there for ways to support the channel, and that\u0027s basically what this page is for. Why Patreon? Well, so I can at least give \u003cem\u003esomething\u003c/em\u003e back. I could simply set up a dedicated PayPal - However, I wouldn\u0027t feel comfortable just taking money from someone and offering nothing in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow you will see various perks \u0026amp; rewards for supporting the channel. \u003cstrong\u003eEvery tier gets the following perks:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe ability to vote on a monthly poll. This poll will have a selection of videos to choose from, and whichever video wins will be made first out of that batch of videos(within the month).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to rough draft scripts of upcoming videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to mp3 Voice-Overs of upcoming videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour name listed in a thank you message at the end of every video. The color of your name will follow the scheme of WoW\u0027s rarity system. Tier 1 = blue, tier 2 = purple, and tier 3 = orange.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to short writeups on what videos I\u0027ve been working on or what I plan to work on and why. Think of the \u0027channel update\u0027 series, but just in text form. These will accompany the script uploads.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll donation tiers will receive the same rewards(aside from the name colors). The reason for that is whether you give $1 or $100 I\u0027m equally grateful to everyone, and I want to give \u003cem\u003eeveryone\u003c/em\u003e access to \u003cem\u003eeverything\u003c/em\u003e. The only incentives for the higher tiers are the different shout-out colors, or if you\u0027d just like to support the channel more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s hard to put in words how much of a compliment it is that you would enjoy my content so much that you would want to spend your hard earned money to support me. So, I\u0027ll say it right here: \u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for even the thought of supporting me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
