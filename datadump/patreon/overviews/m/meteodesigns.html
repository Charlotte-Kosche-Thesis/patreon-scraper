I\u0027m a digital illustrator and graphic designer, founder and Creative Director of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.meteodesigns.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMeteoDesigns\u003c/a\u003e. I make fun art that promotes gaming and geek culture, science, and equality. I also do a few other creative and academic things; I\u0027m a man of many talents and interests. Unfortunately, I am also a man of limited means. I\u0027m asking for financial backing to keep working on all the creative projects crowding my crazy artist brain.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eMY ARTWORK\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nArt is my reason for living, I\u0027ve been drawing since before I can remember, and will likely never stop. I have a fine art background with an emphasis on the human figure; and after college I moved into digital art and design. I have a ton of experience doing various kinds of illustration and graphic design; spent three years creating assets for mobile games; especially love making fun t-shirt designs and art that promotes geek culture. I\u0027m bursting with ideas!! I just need the time and capital to see them all to fruition.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s some of my previous work:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://meteodesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/0002_erlic-detail.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://meteodesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/08.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://meteodesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/114.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tFun geek art!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://meteodesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/27.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://meteodesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/randi3.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPro-science stuff!

These include but are not limited to:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 \n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eMY FIRST GAME!!\u003c/span\u003e Yes, I want to create a video game of my own. Being primarily an artist, this means I\u0027d partner with a programmer; or take it upon myself to learn a development kit such as Unity. My game idea is a cross between Mortal Kombat and ActRaiser based on ancient mythology. Yes you read that right. I can\u0027t wait, it\u0027s going to be awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 \n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eMY SECOND GAME!!\u003c/span\u003e Yes I have another idea already! This one would be more of an 8-bit adventure game, with a customizable twist. In fact I want everything about it to be pretty much customizable. Your character, enemies, items, everything. But still with enough of a built-in framework that anybody can pick it up, design and play. Think Mario Paint crossed with Zelda.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(I\u0027ll be adding concept art and UI mockups to this page in the near future to further flesh out these proposals)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 \n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eA drama/comedy novel\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0about four roommates going through their quarter-life crises. Fictional, but very much inspired by the misadventures my friends and I have had, while we\u0027ve tried to get our footing as young professionals in this crazy modern world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 \n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eAn illustrated science fiction/fantasy nove\u003c/span\u003el (something between prose and graphic novel formats), featuring a gay protagonist. But no, not some politically correct propaganda, pandering to a niche demographic. I want my work to be able to be enjoyed by anybody. I\u0027ve always wanted to just see a hero happen to be gay, but not have that overshadow the quality of the story and other characters. I know I\u0027m not alone in this.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 \n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eA horror novel\u003c/span\u003e from a skeptics\u0027 perspective. As a horror fan, but also a skeptic myself, do I need to believe in ghosts or demons to be terrified? I don\u0027t think so. Doubt is the foundation of reason; and sometimes \"I don\u0027t know\" is the most honest way to describe a mystery. I want this to be character-driven, and explore how different types of people react to the same, frightening, seemingly supernatural, event. Like my other projects, this won\u0027t be about heavy-handed preaching, but simply approaching the subject from a different perspective; and it should be able to be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of their personal beliefs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eRESEARCH/EDUCATIONAL PROJECTS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I was in college, I supplemented my art degrees with various social science courses and social justice leadership training. I\u0027m especially interested in how social issues in geek and tech communities are addressed - and frankly, fumbled - by the media. There\u0027s a lot of drama right now, and a whole lot of misunderstanding. I\u0027ve been watching for a long time and I\u0027d like to put my personal experience, and my college social science credits, to use helping others make sense of it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have several design and research projects in mind, but they\u0027re going to require a lot of work, and genuine research. We\u0027re talking good old fashioned reading of scientific literature, verifying facts, communication with experts; not just lazy googling and wikipedia\u0027ing:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 I\u0027ve started work on an \n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eevidence-based guide to LGBT Studies\u003c/span\u003e. This will be a free, downloadable resource in pdf format, similar to the educational modules I helped design for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://meteodesigns.com/portfolio/jrefmodules/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJames Randi Foundation\u003c/a\u003e. I see far too many discussions of LGBT issues on-line that are mired in heated emotions, controversy, or politics; this guide would evade all that drama, and instead focus on facts. We\u0027ll discuss some basic issues and concepts in language that anybody should be able to understand, regardless of their personal beliefs or political persuasions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 I\u0027d like to write a\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003e fully researched book about the recent controversies surrounding feminism and video game culture\u003c/span\u003e, connect that to the rising tensions between the authoritarian left (so-called \"social justice warriors\"), and the unpredictable alliances being formed between the liberal left and anti-authoritarian conservatives and libertarians. I think this is an incredibly interesting topic, but the loudest voices discussing it right now are tabloid bloggers and e-celebs who don\u0027t have proper academic credentials to tackle it, and seem to be primarily driven by personal political agendas. I\u0027d strive for balance, fairness, and journalistic integrity; although since a great deal of the controversy takes the form of Internet drama and flame wars, some humor to add levity would be in order as well. Think Mary Roach, in terms of the tone I\u0027m going for here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY GUARANTEE TO PATRONS.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing an artist may look glamorous, but it is a tough gig! I\u0027m one of those starving artist types, and that\u0027s no exaggeration. It is \n\u003cem\u003ehard\u003c/em\u003e. And I don\u0027t come from a family of millionaires, sadly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAny money I make here will go directly to basic needs: rent, food, bills, insurance; as well as any equipment I might need to continue producing my digital art; which would essentially amount to a new computer in case my current one dies on me (it\u0027s already several years old, but let\u0027s keep our fingers crossed). I also have car payments, and my vehicle is a practical, reliable Civic, not some luxury sports car or motorcycle.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGenerally I live a pretty simple life. My guarantee to all of my backers is that donations will be put to good use, on essential life and business related expenses. I will also be very transparent about where any money I collect is going to. I\u0027m not some trust fund snowflake abusing the crowd sourcing system; I really am poor, honest, and hard-working. I will work my butt off and be grateful no matter how much I\u0027m able to raise here!"
