In the past few years of being on Youtube I\u0027ve had the pleasure of getting to meet many many people. I\u0027ve had the pleasure of working with many talented authors, creators and musicians and most importantly I\u0027ve been able to bring fear and nightmares, but also enjoyment and entertainment to well over a million people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutube has given me so much over the years. You kids, my listeners and fans have given me so much. More than I could have ever asked for and I feel that it\u0027s my job to continue to give you more. I would never want to take anything away from you nor would I want to feel like I\u0027m holding any of your entertainment hostage. In my years on Youtube I\u0027ve not only found so much enjoyment giving you all these tales of terror in audio format, but I\u0027ve found love from each and every one of you. I met my wife through my Youtube channel. I got to introduce all of you to our kitten Hercules when we rescued him and you all watched him grow as we did. \u00a0I\u0027ve also gotten to meet many of you face to face. I\u0027ve gotten to thank you personally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would be honored if you would all allow me to continue to do this for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N11Swm7zO8M\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutube\u0027s changes are making this very difficult. I put out a video about the changes to advertiser revenue and how it affects me and how it affects horror. There\u0027s been panic and knee jerk reactions from channels and it is all completely justified. It\u0027s something to be scared about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would never want to make this an issue about taking anything away from all of you and I will be willing to continue through if this Patreon is at 0 or 100.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI debated for a long while about if this should be made or not because I like to feel that I\u0027m doing this for you and I want this to always be for free. I don\u0027t want anyone to ever feel like they need to pay me to do what I love for all of you. If anything I feel that I owe all of you for what you\u0027ve given me already. However, in lieu of the current changes, doing this has become far more challenging and I do require some degree of help. None the less, even if it is a struggle I will always be here to entertain for you. Because You all truly are everything to me.\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your help and your time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnd as always.\u003cbr\u003eSweet Dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who would prefer a 1 Time Donation instead of a subscribed donation you can always support me here on Ko-fi!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/T6T7A3M6\"\u003ehttps://ko-fi.com/T6T7A3M6\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything and everything is a big help in both creating videos and helping me live.
