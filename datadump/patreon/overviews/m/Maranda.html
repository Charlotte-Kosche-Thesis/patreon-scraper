My art is an act of self \u003cstrong\u003eexpression\u003c/strong\u003e, depicting my complex emotions and reactions to my life. It is an act of \u003cstrong\u003eexploration\u003c/strong\u003e, aiming to understand and accurately portray my animal subjects.

Patreon helps me pursue my career. With your help, I\u0027m able to bring the world more and more of my unique portrayals and views of animals. I delve deep into symbolism, biology, and dreams, blending the real and imagined world to create unique and engaging animal art. If I had it my way, I\u0027d do nothing but art-- but alas, I still have bills to pay, and so I rely on a day job to stay afloat. What you will do, as a Patron, is allow me \u003cstrong\u003emore freedom\u003c/strong\u003e to cut back on my day job so that I have \u003cstrong\u003emore time\u003c/strong\u003e to sketch, study, draw, paint, make prints, research shows and fairs to attend, and record videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://marandart.com/uploads/3/4/1/7/34177051/tinybit3_orig.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You\u0027ll Get!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eEach tier gains you access to \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive \u003c/strong\u003egoodies only available to Patrons.
