Thank you so, so much my patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\nWith this, I can print my illustrations or goodies at home and quickly distribute to you or my customers without having to go to a printing shop. I would be able to experiment with a more variety of paper textures and printing techniques as well. So, more interesting things coming your way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd FYI: Even though my old printer is a bit naughty and old (over 7 years) but she\u0027s still working okay, I\u0027m going to donate it to a school in need. You help me with a new printer and I\u0027m going to help others with mine. I\u0027m forwarding your kindness.\u003cbr\u003e",
