    "summary": "Welcome to the \u003cstrong\u003eMain Street e-Zine\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon page. So what is \u003cstrong\u003eMain Street e-Zine\u003c/strong\u003e? It is a blog/website/electronic magazine (whatever you prefer to call it) dedicated to all things Disney. A little bit of everything from Disney news to Disney history to Travel Tips and much, much more. If it\u0027s Disney related, I love to talk about it. It was a project that had been running through my head for many years and just was not able to get up and running. Finally earlier this year I jumped in and started \u003cstrong\u003eMain Street e-Zine\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eMain Street e-Zine\u003c/strong\u003e has been a lot of fun in the short time I\u0027ve been doing it. It is a labor of love that requires significant amount of my time researching topics, keeping up on current news and in the future a significant investment to sustain it and get it to where I want it to go.\u00a0Currently it is just the blog with the hopes of future expansion into such things as Podcasts, YouTube and who knows what else! With the proper support the sky is the limit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith updates and articles written on a weekly basis, I am looking for monetary support on a monthly basis. I chose the Patreon website over other avenues of funding such as click through ads because it is so easy and everybody hates those ads, I know I do! By pledging your support to \u003cstrong\u003eMain Street e-Zine\u003c/strong\u003e, you\u0027ll be helping out the site via monthly donations of whatever amount you choose. Any amount helps and as a thank you, certain pledge levels will be rewarded. Of course, you can always change or cancel your pledge at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you decide to support with a donation or not I will continue to publish the \u003cstrong\u003eMain Street e-Zine\u003c/strong\u003e and it will remain free to view for everyone for as long as I have the ability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eJason Culley\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMain Street e-Zine \u003c/strong\u003e(www.mainstreetezine.wordpress.com)\u003cbr\u003e"
