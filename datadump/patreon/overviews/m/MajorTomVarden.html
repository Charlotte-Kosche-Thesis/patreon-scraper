    "summary": "I want to show people how beautiful the universe is. The more people look through telescopes, the better the world gets. Strange and beautiful things happen to those who peer at the sky.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlack Rock Observatory is a mobile astronomical observatory. I\u0027ve dedicated the past 4 years of my life to this project and it\u0027s been quite a ride. People absolutely love it and we MUST keep going. We\u0027ve shared astronomy with over 50,000 people and that\u0027s just not enough. We\u0027re going to get to EVERYONE. Inspiration is hard to come by sometimes, but we haul it by the ton. Sharing the natural world with our participants can be crazy expensive, so I\u0027m reaching out for help once again. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Burning Man community gave birth to this project, but we didn\u0027t stop there. Rather than burn our lovely observatory, we just to decided to rebuild it over and over again. We\u0027ve been all over California. We\u0027ve been to Nevada and Colorado. We\u0027ve even been to Mexico for Day of te Dead and travelled around the globe to Shehzhen, China. We\u0027ve been to festivals, museums,gem shows, national parks, state parks and schools. Once, we even sat down with a Hollywood production company about making a television show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHIS MUST CONTINUE. With your help, it can. The faces of our visitors when they\u0027re confronted with the beauty of the universe tells me that we\u0027re doing good. We deal in \"wows,\" gasps and inspiration. Help us share the sky and meteorites with the world. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have the brightest, hardest working and most dedicated science art crew there is. I\u0027m lucky enough to have some of the greatest scientists in the world on my team (mega-busy folks) who sacrifice their free time to bring the excitement of science to the people. Black Rock Observatory IS volunteer labor and donations. And sweat. We all know how hard these folks work, so let\u0027s help them. Donations we receive allow us to NOT spend all of our money on this project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy wife and I spent over $10,000 on this project last year alone. My crew gives tirelessly and I\u0027d like their costs to go away. Wouldn\u0027t it be great if, after they spent time and effort preparing, travelling and working, we could cover their gas money?! Let\u0027s do it folks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave giant telescopes, will travel. See you outside under starry skies. Thanks for the support you\u0027ve already given us. If we\u0027ve earned your support, please donate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
