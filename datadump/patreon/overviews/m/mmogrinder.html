I release these reviews in video form every 2-4 weeks, as well as provide content in smaller doses, such as beta previews with my show \"MMO Grinder: Sidequest\", recaps of changes made to previously reviewed games in my show \"MMO Grinder: Backtrack\", and quicker, short-form versions of my main show for browser-based games in \"MMO Grinder: Browser Based\".\u003cbr\u003eFor an example of MMO Grinder, watch the video above, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD247CFCA5FEB8078\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclick here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016 I began to focus more on regular live streaming at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/chaosd1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etwitch.tv/chaosd1\u003c/a\u003e, allowing me closer and more direct feedback with the community. While the focus was MMOS, we\u0027ve branched out to play all sorts of games (and occasional cooking shows if that\u0027s something you\u0027d be into.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I am planning to do:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to be able to focus on the community of my show, making sure people who view the show and play the games can be more involved. As of now, we have a Discord channel, and Patrons have helped contribute to the show in more ways that one via shared scripts. I would like to host more content, and involve those who enjoy the show to have a better hand in helping to create it through feedback. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also like to give back to those who enjoy the show, through contests, and other activities. However, using all of my time to create videos, only to have the efforts rewarded by unstable CPMs through various hosting sites makes it difficult to keep going without having to devote all my time to the series, and not the community and side content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why did I start MMO Grinder?:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel MMOs are horribly unrepresented by the gaming media, and have a severe societal stigma placed over them from people who\u0027ve only heard about the big titles, and media horror stories about how someone\u0027s life was ruined by these games. \u003cbr\u003eThe majority of MMO reviews out there really don\u0027t seem to have any structure, are intimidated by the \"endless content\" aspect of the games, and don\u0027t seem to know how to rate them among so many other genres.\u00a0In addition to that, these games can be extremely intimidating for newcomers, and even veterans on occasion.\u003cbr\u003eI want to do my best to \u003cem\u003eease\u003c/em\u003e players into a game\u0027s \"\u003cem\u003enewbie experience\u003c/em\u003e\" and let them understand that you can get a good idea on what to expect, without having to play the \"entire game\", and take away some of that fear that grips new players when they try out one of these titles. \u003cbr\u003eIf only veterans of some of these games would understand that...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the Patreon for?\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003eMaking the show, streams, and any future content the best it can be. More money means more reason to keep going. Better computer components. Better lighting and camera equipment. I\u0027ll be able to delve deeper into the games, and perhaps, branch away from the free-to-play titles to allow reviews of games that require some form of payment to play, like buy-to-play and subscription games. It will allow me to focus more time between episodes in order to provide deeper analysis and more side content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is a monthly charge, and all shows like MMO Grinder, Sidequest, Browser-Based and Backtrack will be linked to the Patreon, visible to anyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I really owe you anything?:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbsolutely not. Support for my show is easiest done simply by visiting my site, or viewing my videos on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mmogrinder.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMMOGrinder.net\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/chaosd1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e with the ads in place or your Ad-blocker \"whitelisting\" the site and videos. This is simply for those who wish to further support the show, and/or are unable to do so through that means, for whatever reason. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eRemember you can cancel at any time, and set the amount you wish to donate without specific reward tiers.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

I created MMO Grinder in 2011, after years of planning, and wanting to bring the knowledge of MMOs to the forefront, showcasing there\u0027s a lot more out there than just the big names.
