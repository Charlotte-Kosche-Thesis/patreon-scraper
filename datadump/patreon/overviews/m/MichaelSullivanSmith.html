     "description": "The first goal is to place all the website sidebar\u0027s 40+ knots with old and new patrons and have a minimum $400 a month moving development forward. Tapping the expertise of patrons along the way would bring added momentum toward the real goal of successful beta tests for all the functions detailed in the \u003ca href=\"http://members.tripod.com/mssmith44/proposal/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eweb site\u003c/a\u003e. As patrons participate in these tests more knots enter into circulation, bringing in more patrons. Though there is a knot for every patron, the real reward comes when the whole system is eventually launched in its autonomous Dapp state and \"Genesis sequence\" knots have become the rarest of the exponentially large number that follow.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eThis concept places an emphasis on vectors as analogous to the digital in cryptology, for functions to be object oriented and human scaled through this graphic relationship to knots.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMany years ago I established the concept that knots are the only\n graphic trope having infinitely identifiable diversity of form. Over \ntime I\u0027d developed ways to illustrate this with a system that could \nperpetuate the process of creation, and I made hundreds of knots to show\n that an infinite number was conceivable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believed this would \nremain just a commentary on the properties of knots until in late 2017 I\n discovered that the Internet had operative forms of distributive \ncreativity and verification applications for cryptocurrency transactions\n that implied that a design of an autonomous system to carry on my idea \nof a progression of knots sequentially added to, infinitely, forever, \nhad entered the realm of the possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis set me back onto my \nknot quest and into thinking that the knot\u0027s relationship to identities \nin a blockchain registry with vector codes made them digital artworks \nbased on their unique geometric properties. That, in turn, presented me \nwith an ideal scenario for creating a uniquely valued cryptocurrency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis\n concept was published in the first days of 2018 as an illustrated White\n Paper styled as an interpretive web site. It explains how producing \ncurrency tokens and the knots in a well organized system translates the \nknot\u0027s identity into the value of the currency by having the knot as an \naccessible reference to an immutability locked into a blockchain \nregistry as an asset with liquidity in an art market. The competitive \nadvantage of this strategy lies in the collectibles base for value in \nthis market. The usefulness of the token as an exchange currency is not \ndiverted into investment because the knot is positioned for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis\n practicality echoes precisely the original purpose of the quest to \ncreate an infinite number of knots, and in this it has conceived of a \nmethodology that goes beyond lasting forever to solve a need of the here\n and now.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
