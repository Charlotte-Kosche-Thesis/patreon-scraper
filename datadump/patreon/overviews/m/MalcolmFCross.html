    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Malcolm F. Cross, a writer, and you probably know about my writing if you\u0027re here. If not, you can \u003ca href=\"http://www.sinisbeautiful.com/\"\u003echeck out my webpage here\u003c/a\u003e, and on the sidebar on the right there\u0027s a list of my publications. The major one is \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DJYMQQO\"\u003eDog Country, my debut novel.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, here\u0027s \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3VF1oeL66o\"\u003ea video explaining a little about the platform\u003c/a\u003e. The short version is, this isn\u0027t about me selling you stuff. This is about me finding a way to share what I\u0027m already trying to do with you, and for you to help keep me going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo. What\u0027s the deal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think it\u0027s kind of obvious that the written material I put out there, especially free stuff, kind of dried up a couple of years ago. The truth is I\u0027ve been going through a lot of personal struggles with mental health issues, and I think it\u0027s time for me to get back on my feet. I need to get back into writing day to day, I need to find some structure for my work, and, quite honestly, I need support from fans and friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027ve been introducing myself to new acquaintances over the last few years I\u0027ve had this somewhat unfortunate line I\u0027ve used when folks ask me what I do. \u0027I\u0027m a writer, which, really, is a fancy way of saying I\u0027m unemployed.\u0027 (Never fails to get a laugh, though!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo where does Patreon come in? Obviously, it helps to support me financially, which helps to take financial pressure off me so I can focus on the art of writing, not the business. It gives me an opportunity to connect with my supporters on a regular schedule, which hopefully helps keep me where I want to be -- behind a keyboard. And, given the way Patreon is put together, it gives me a way to structure some goals, both short term and long term, and get the support I need while pursuing them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, my plan is to re-evaluate what I\u0027m trying to achieve through Patreon once every few months, and restructure things a little to match that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first and most important goal right now is to get me out of my slump and working on writing projects again, reliably and regularly. Maybe you\u0027d like to join in on that journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for what you get out of it, beyond supporting one of your favourite writers? Take a look at the tiers and rewards over to the right, though be aware these are liable to change and shift each time I re-evaluate what I\u0027m doing with Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Right now, as we start out, the reward tiers are themed around my last major work, Dog Country.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
