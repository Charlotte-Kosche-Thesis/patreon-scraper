I have completed twenty books altogether, although for the life of me I still can\u0027t earn enough to live off my writing. But I refuse to give up, because I love writing and many of my readers enjoy my work, asking for more. Which is why I\u0027ve come to Patreon. Patreon will help me get more books and short stories out to my readers, and at a much faster rate. In return, people who pledge to my page will have access to multiple things, such as short stories, my thoughts on characters and future projects (both in posts and recorded messages), my art work, photos of my settings, videos, and other creative things that will not be readily available outside of Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eA $2 pledge will give you access to ALL of this, as well as allowing me to continue giving you more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSerial style novels and novellas will also be made available on Patreon, some weekly, others fortnightly, until they\u0027re complete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere are some of the books coming to Patreon soon...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrying Out Silent \u003c/strong\u003e- the much awaited sequel/companion novel to Graffiti Heaven.\u003cbr\u003ePoint of views: Llewellyn Davies (L), Ash Rata, and Jenna Hamilton.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHungover \u003c/strong\u003e- Overwhelmed\u0027s sequel, which is Tom\u0027s book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI really appreciate you being here!

I also did unarmed combat and played in a touch rugby team (my gym teacher made me do the last one!) As an adult, I\u0027ve couched soccer and have completed two marathons, numerous half-marathons and one 30K run. Though, I have been slack of late, so I\u0027m dedicating 2018 to getting back into shape!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCAREER PATH: I started off as a Graphic Designer, then went to Auckland University, where I got a BA degree in Art History and Italian Studies and a post-graduate Honours degree in Art History. I worked in the Art History field, then became a full-time artist, doing commissions. I eventually lost all of my senses and gave it up to be a writer :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFAVOURITE FOODS: I\u0027m vegan, just not the type to tell you what to eat. That\u0027s your business, not mine. I love Japanese and Croatian cuisine, as well a golden queen peaches. Not all peaches are equal ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBAD HABITS: I\u0027m a major procrastinator, I stay up way too late writing, and I get distracted far too easily unless it\u0027s doing something I love. My mind never stops running, can\u0027t turn the ADHD off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSTATUS: Married to my high school sweetheart (which he hates me calling him). We have two kids.\u003cbr\u003e",
