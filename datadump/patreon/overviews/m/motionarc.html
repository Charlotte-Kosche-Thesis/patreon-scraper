    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, people! We are Motion Arc, creators of the \"Motion Arc - Cinematics\" YouTube channel. We\u0027ve always had a passion for game and video production. The internet is full of gaming videos, be it let\u0027s play\u0027s, or funny montages. But we\u0027ve discovered, there\u0027s not really many videos dedicated to games as experiences. Videos that aim to take the viewer for a ride deeper in the game\u0027s world, beyond the world of news and funny moments. And that is exactly what we do. We strive to create top notch game cinematics, where quality is the focus and an emotional experience is the goal. This means everything from custom game trailers, music videos, montages and possibly even machinimas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is Patreon? How does it work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst and foremost, the fact that we have a Patreon campaign does not mean that our content will not be free anymore. Content will still be published at our YouTube channel, just as usual. This is simply an opportunity for those who enjoy what we do and wish to contribute.\u003cbr\u003eSo, how does it work? Basically, as a patron you pledge any amount of money for each of our \"monthly/bi-monthly\" main videos, for however long as you feel like it. There are no minimum payment period, subscriptions can be changed or cancelled at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote that you only pay for our MAIN videos. Which means that while there could be additional smaller videos every so often, you\u0027ll only pay maximum once a month for what\u0027s to come. You can also set a monthly maximum for extra insurance, so you\u0027ll be sure not to go over budget.\u00a0In some ways this looks like a kind of monthly/bi-monthly subscription. And it sort of is, except for the very important fact that you actually pay PER content release. So if there one month, for any reason, should NOT be a video released, you don\u0027t pay anything. Pretty neat, right?\u003cbr\u003eAnd last, but not least, becoming a patron does not only benefit us, it\u0027ll also include bonuses for you as well. We\u0027ll come back to that further down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do we need support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt is important to note that this is a mere hobby for us. This is not something we\u0027re making a living out of, and our days are therefore filled with other activities. The truth is that as much as we love doing this stuff, it takes a tremendous amount of time to create high quality videos. Which means it can go quite long between releases. Too long, if you ask us. And that\u0027s where you come in. Your pledge, no matter how small or large, directly help us creating more and better content. Help us spend less time earning money in other ways, and spend more time creating awesome videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get from it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile your support is mainly to help us producing more and better content, there are of course also other reasons for you to contribute. Check out the rewards and see if there is anything that floats your boat. And if not, feel free to suggest future rewards. We\u0027re still in the early days of the campaign, so we\u0027re very much open to new ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp us take our content to the next level! And regardless if you pledge or not, thank you for stopping by. It means a lot :)"
