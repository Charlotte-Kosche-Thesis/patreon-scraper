With as little as $2 being chipped in, you will\nalready be eligible to suggest which models are worked on!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cfont\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow\ndoes it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPretty\nsimple!\n\u003c/font\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\tWhen\n\twe reach the goal for a model, all patrons with Tier 2 and above\n\twill get a link to a form, where they can suggest which model should\n\tbe worked on next.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\t3\n\tdays after that form is published, a poll will be made available for\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eall\n\t\u003c/strong\u003epatrons\n\tfrom Tier 2 above. This poll will be available for another 3 days.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\n\tAfter\n\tthe 3 days for the poll pass, the model with the most votes will be\n\twhat is worked on next.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eOnce\na model is finished, will you automatically begin work on the\nrunner-up of the poll?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNo.\nIt would be unfair for new Patrons not having the right to submit nor\ncast their vote. So every time we reach a goal, a new selection round\nis going to start (first the form for suggesting models, then the\npoll to vote on which gets made next).\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cfont\u003e\u003cfont\u003e\u003cfont\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\nsupport The Model Corner? What is a \u201cComplete Model\u201d?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA\nComplete Model is a model with a new nude body, eye-posing, flexes,\nbodygroups and jigglebones. The cost of commissioning a model like\nthis can be pretty high and needs to be paid by a single person. The\nidea behind the Model Corner is a sort of \u201ccrowd-funded commission\u201d\n\u2013 rather than one person paying the full price for a model, a lot\nof people only pay a small fraction of that same price! That way,\neveryone wins through having a new model be made, but no one person\nhas to pay a large amount to commission it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cfont\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut\nI don\u2019t even use SFM! Why would I want to support The Model Corner?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEven\nif you don\u0027t use SFM, chances are that you enjoy the work of others\nthat do. And chances are, there is at least one special character who\nyou\u0027d love to see people use, but you never see anyone do any work\nwith. Maybe that one character doesn\u0027t have a model made. Maybe their\nmodel is only private, or maybe their model is old or hard to use.\nWhatever the case, by supporting The Model Corner, you can help get a\nmodel for that character made, so that all your favorite SFM artists\ncan finally make the work with them you\u0027ve always wanted them to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf\na model goal is not met, what will happen to the extra money of the\nprevious month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt\nthe end of every month, any amount pledged that doesn\u0027t fully cover a\nmodel will be counted toward the first model of the next month.
