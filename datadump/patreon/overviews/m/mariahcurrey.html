    "summary": "Hi there! I\u0027m Mariah, a graphic designer by day and a comic creator the rest of the time. I create stories about monsters, humans, and the blurry line where the two meet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy current main project is \u003cstrong\u003eRainy Day Dreams\u003c/strong\u003e, a free online comic about a human girl named Tristin who finds herself stuck in a world of monsters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRead Rainy Day Dreams here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.vermillionworks.com/daniel/\"\u003ehttp://rainydaydreams.mariahcurrey.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Story\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eTristin finds herself trapped in a parallel dimension after a \ntreasure hunt gone wrong. On top of that, this new world is populated \nwith monsters. Together with her new companions, Mara, the reclusive, \nex-knight psychic, and Michael, a vampire trying to sort out his undead \nlife, the three uncover the mysteries of this Nameless World and their \nown hearts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis comic deals with some more mature \nthemes, such as romance, violence, and intolerance. This is a story \ndriven by interpersonal relationships which aren\u2019t always pretty. There \nis also coarse language at times. Therefore this comic is rated Older \nTeen+.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther Projects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBesides RDD, I have several other side projects. One of which is the Forest, which you can read the first chapter of here: \u003ca href=\"http://theforest.mariahcurrey.com\"\u003ehttp://theforest.mariahcurrey.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to more chapters of the Forest, I also have a few chapters of a Sky Pirate story in the works about triplet, Robin Hood-esq sisters, a short re-imagining of part of the Koschei the Deathless folktale, a project currently titled \"Gothic Nutcracker,\" a retelling of Tatterhood (one of my favorite fairytales from childhood), and a slew of rejected anthology pitches I\u0027d still like to draw at some point. Not to mention bonus comics and side stories within the Rainy Day Dreams universe.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Your Donations Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs you can see, I have a lot a things I want to draw. Having to work a full time day job only leaves me so much time to work on these things. In the long term, with your collective support I would be able to make working on all of these projects my full time job. In the short term, your donations will go towards self-promotion. Webcomics might seem like a free business, but reaching an audience, unless you win the lottery of \"going viral,\" costs money. Reaching new readers mean getting closer to my long term goal, in addition to being able to do things like print books and create other fun merchandise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Current Goals\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBesides the obvious money-based goals, I also just want to be able to share more of my process with my readers. While I don\u0027t always have a lot of time to work on non-RDD projects right now, the small amount I do manage I\u0027d like to be able to share with you! And there is also plenty of doodles and process work I do for RDD that is to spoilery to post to general social media. So come play with me in this space!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
