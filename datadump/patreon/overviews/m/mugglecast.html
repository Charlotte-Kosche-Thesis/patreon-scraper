    "summary": "MuggleCast is the original Harry Potter podcast. The show launched in 2005 and has always been a place for fans to get the latest Wizarding World news, theories, and analysis from their fellow Harry Potter fans. News, theories, fandom - these three elements have always been the bread and butter of our show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past year, support and collaboration with our listeners via Patreon has allowed us to begin releasing episodes of MuggleCast weekly -- just like the old days! We\u2019ve enjoyed meeting patrons in person at the Fantastic Beasts premiere in New York City and at our online Hangouts throughout the year. In 2016, we mailed over 600 pieces of album art, shipped over 200 tee shirts, recorded a dozen bonus MuggleCast segments and completed our re-read of \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone\u003c/em\u003e, all for patrons only. And, in 2017 we\u0027re doing even more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy adding an additional level of support this year, we can now provide the very best level of interactivity you desire. We racked our brains and gathered feedback to improve our existing rewards and develop new ones. Should you choose to support us, you can do so knowing that your support will go a long way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe thank you for pledging to MuggleCast! With the recent releases of \u003cem\u003eThe Cursed Child\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eFantastic Beasts\u003c/em\u003e, both Harry Potter and critical discussion are in an exciting new era, and your friends at MuggleCast are ready to continue pouring over every new detail. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo theory is safe!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMuggleCast Voicemail Line: \u003c/strong\u003e1 (920) 3-MUGGLE (USA)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMailing Address: \u003c/strong\u003eMuggleCast. 4044 N.
