Some gaming groups send the journals and synopsis of their adventures to us to add to the experience. \u00a0We keep track of characters from all over the real world USA and a couple outside the country as they form storylines and tell their stories - and are part of the stories of everyone else who might come into contact with them. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo create all of this our team commissions the services of freelance artists and programmers. \u00a0We are a non-profit organization, as such we do not have the funds to pay the proper value to the community of freelancers that help us. \u00a0But that is where you can join our team and help out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe would like for you to join by supporting us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Meleeworld is a growing and diverse sandbox where every player may become part of the continuing storyline and help shape the future of the games themselves. \u00a0Your support will allow us to grow by producing games faster, help the freelance community by hiring more artists and programmers to work on projects and help supply our educational materials to schools and libraries in need. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Patreon member designed city\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatrons who support us will be able to take part in an exclusive on-going event. \u00a0Somewhere, within the Kingdom of Praelia wherein our games take place, there is a city waiting to be built. Each month patrons will get to vote on various subjects, each leading to the development and improvement of this city. \u00a0Starting from the location and name through the layout and what is built where. \u00a0Ultimately this city will be a shining beacon for travelers, or it may be a citadel of horrors.
