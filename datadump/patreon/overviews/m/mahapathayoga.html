    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m Douglas Johnson, yogi, meditator, kirtan-wallah, writer, and founder of Mah\u0101patha Yoga. Mah\u0101pahta Yoga is not really a style of yoga or even a set of practices, but rather a \u003cem\u003emindset\u003c/em\u003e. It is about human beings seeking more out of life by awakening to their full potential. A potential for more joy, more peace, and more wisdom through spiritual awakening. The word I use to refer\u00a0to the practices we use, regardless of origin, is \u003cem\u003eYoga.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Yoga is a Sanskrit word borrowed from the ancient\u00a0\u003cem\u003eVedic\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eBrahmanic\u003c/em\u003e culture that lives on in what we today call India. True Yoga, however, transcends time, place, and culture as it is ultimately about \u003cem\u003etruth\u003c/em\u003e. Mah\u0101patha Yoga therefore drawn on the wisdom found in esoteric traditions found around the world as well as modern science and medicine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this page, you can gain access to exclusive digital-content that is updated regularly, much of which is free.\u00a0My idea is to turn this into our virtual online yoga studio where you can gain access to recordings and videos of classes, Yoga Nidra, and lectures that are updated at \u003cem\u003eleast\u003c/em\u003e once a month. Additionally, I post and write articles that are of interest to anyone who would like to live a happy and healthy life in today\u0027s\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also know there are those who may not be interested in digital content but simply want ways to support Mah\u0101patha Yoga. The Mah\u0101patha Yoga Patreon page makes this possible while providing you with exclusive access to polls, meetings, and even one-on-one sessions online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support does not need to be large to make a difference. The beautiful thing about Patreon is it allows you to support something you are \u003cem\u003epassionate\u003c/em\u003e about at whatever level you are \u003cem\u003ecomfortable\u003c/em\u003e or able to. If everyone who feels the way you do contributes, it can have a huge impact.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, if you are reading this even that is a form of support as are coming to classes, retreats, trainings, and workshops. So, I want to thank you for your support and to let you know that every little bit helps.\u00a0As Lao Tsu once said, \"the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJai Bhagwan,\u003cbr\u003eDouglas\u003cbr\u003e"
