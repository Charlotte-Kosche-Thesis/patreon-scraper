    "summary": "I\u0027ve been writing for more of my life than I haven\u0027t, and that feels like the last mandatory hurdle before I can officially refer to myself as \"a writer.\" So, as a writer, I\u0027m making a move toward becoming ONLY a writer, instead of someone who works a low paying retail job, raises a child, does her chores, and, sometimes late at night gets a few stolen minutes to scribble words into a notebook. To do this, however, I need a few things, like a website, a few more hours a week to follow a dream that has long been just out of reach, and the money to do so without losing my apartment. Here comes the part where I sell myself, or at least small but important parts of myself, to you:\u003cbr\u003eI am a published, produced, and award-winning poet and playwright. It\u0027s true. My poem \"A Prepared Explanation For Change of Address\" was published in the Spring 2017 volume of 13th Floor Literary Magazine. My play \"Sissy And The War: A Feminist Adaptation of Lysistrata\" was staged during the Spring season of 2015 and nominated for a Motif Theatre Award in the Best Production and Best New Script categories. And, once upon a time, I was a New Yorker Young Poet To Watch. \u003cbr\u003eI work in a creatively autobiographical voice that is honest and austere while, at times, can be brutal and visceral in its visual components. To quote a friend, if I may, my creations deal \"with the human body and how we negotiate desire.\" Currently, I am working on a play titled \"The Many Deaths of Jeff Goldblum\" and an illustrated chapbook of confessional poetry that I\u0027m hopeful will still be called \"They Do Their Laundry In Public Places\" when it is done.\u003cbr\u003eAs it says above, I am also working on a graphic novel. It is an idea that I\u0027ve spent the better part of six years developing and am finally in a position to begin actual progress on. Think feminism meets fantasy and environmental politics. Plus monsters and concubines. Cool, right?\u003cbr\u003eThe real and only reason that none of these things is already done is because I do not have the time. With your support I could work a few hours less a week, cover that lost income, and pay for a private domain. I\u0027d be able to make real progress and bring you along for the ride. \u003cbr\u003eSince I\u0027m only just getting started, the perks will begin small, but I can promise that the perks will get better and better as I have the ability to get more and more ideas developed. I can promise that you will have access before anyone else to what I\u0027m working on and any headway made. And I can promise you will have my eternal gratitude and an acknowledgement credit in anything published from here on out.\u003cbr\u003e"
