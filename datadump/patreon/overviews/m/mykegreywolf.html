However, I would like for my creations to reach as many people as possible, as to be able to spread far and wide the excitement and positive messages and feelings that they were created to inspire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img04.deviantart.net/6d56/i/2017/118/1/d/i_was_born_to_love_you_by_mykegreywolf-db7h623.png\" style=\"width: 263px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eIllustration is my life now. I have nothing else but my family. Luckily, I am not at want for anything essential, and I have the moral support from my wonderful wife in making this occupation my goal in life. However, it would be amazing to know that the things that I create do have a correspondence in the value of the things I use and need in everyday life, and that I am not simply wasting my life away doodling worthless frivolities while leeching on society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t yet discovered my work , you can find it in my gallery sites:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mykegreywolf.deviantart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMyke\u0027s gallery on DeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mykecandraw.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMyke\u0027s art blog on Tumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour financial support would be precious for me to know that my work has actual value in the eyes of others. It would allow me to become independent of my wife\u0027s financial support, and to be able to contribute positively to our household budget, while at the same time still being able to create things that will make you smile, move you or excite you, all of this with an unburdened conscience. In the long run, it will allow me to acquire better tools with which to improve the quality of my output, and in a best case scenario, help my family start a new life in an environment that is more conductive to creating the things you love to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are willing to help me reach my dreams in such a way, I thank you from the bottom of my heart."
