    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m a composer, and I\u0027ve come to particularly enjoy writing for voice. The last few years I\u0027ve written quite a few art songs, in addition to three operas (two for Houston Grand Opera, one for the Houston Girls Chorus) and an oratorio, and I\u0027ve received lots of great feedback from singers. The world of singers is an inspiring place: lots of energy, and a willingness to think outside the box. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne recurring theme I began to notice was that singers wanted to commission and perform new music, but found the commissioning process daunting -- not to mention expensive. So I\u0027ve set up this page to address that: it\u0027s a way singers can obliquely contribute to the commissioning of new music while not breaking the bank.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how it works: for $5 per month, singers will receive a brand-new art song via e-mail (by the 15th of the month, beginning March 15) -- or more than one, if they\u0027re shorter. All will be for voice and piano and will be sent in high, medium and low versions. If you like the song, great! Members have performance exclusives for four months from the date it\u0027s sent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome across a poem you\u0027d like to be set? Send it along! I can\u0027t promise anything -- sometimes copyright is a bear, or the poem just may not strike me -- but I\u0027ll see what I can do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you do end up performing one of the songs, let me know, and I\u0027ll give you a shout-out on my website or social media channels. You may even get the world premiere -- or at least a regional premiere! (Whoever schedules the earliest performance has the premiere.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more info on me, visit my site at www.MarkBullerComposer.com. \u00a0If you\u0027d like to see a few work samples, don\u0027t hesitate to contact me (easiest to do via my website) and I\u0027ll send a few things along!\u003cbr\u003e"
