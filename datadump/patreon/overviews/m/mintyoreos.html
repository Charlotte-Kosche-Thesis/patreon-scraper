I thought creating this page could be helpful for those who would love me to share some of my experience and create options for new experience (I would love to fund cosplay, write books etc). With doing so however it takes time and money of course. I have to make a living somehow. I can use all the help I can get getting off the ground. Then this makes it 100% possible to create better production quality of well put together tutorials, paying for equipment etc and create jobs for other people.That is how much passion I have in these areas I had vaguely presented to you throughout my life online. Yes vaguely, that isn\u0027t even a sample of what I am actually capable of and I would love to entertain and surprise you with more for years to come."
