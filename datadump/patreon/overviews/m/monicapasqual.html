We released eight albums in 13 years.  From 2008-2013 we were lucky enough to be under contract with a company that supported us as we wrote, recorded and toured the US and Europe extensively.  That extraordinary circumstance allowed us to be full-time musicians for the first time in our lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014 I formed an indie-folk band called \u003cstrong\u003eMonica Pasqual \u0026amp; the Handsome Brunettes. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWith the help of a successful\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eIndiegogo\u003c/strong\u003e campaign we funded and released the album \"Is Fortune a Wheel\" in 2016 which was a finalist for the Independent Music Awards.  We perform regularly in the Bay Area and the West Coast and cellist J\u003cstrong\u003eosh McClain\u003c/strong\u003e and I spent three weeks touring Germany this spring. We are currently booking our spring 2018 return.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eStill others of you have met me as a songwriting coach and teacher, or you have heard one of the albums I have produced for other artists.  Not many of you know that I\u0027ve composed lots of documentary soundtracks and music for film and television with my good friend and co-Emmy award winner, \u003cstrong\u003eBZ Lewis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, there are those of you who met me first because of my online memoir - \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"The Story of Tom and Monica: A San Francisco Memoir\".\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e  I released 15 chapters online as I wrote them.  Both the writing of it and then the response it received took me totally by surprise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mention all these different projects and passions that I\u0027ve been involved in for the last 25 years because they very much define the creative life I live - not very linear, not very \"contained\" but rather something fluid and expansive. From an artistic point of view I think it makes sense to push boundaries, follow my passion, explore, dig, suffer, run out to the very edge of the cliff and create out of a kind of turmoil. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCheck out the rewards column and take part at whatever level feels right and doable for you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e And thank you.
