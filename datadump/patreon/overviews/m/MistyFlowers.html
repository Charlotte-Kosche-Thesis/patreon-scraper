I\u0027ve been singing since I can remember and using my voice to stir up mischief every chance I get. I\u0027m honored to share my music, my voice with you in a way that inspires your own creative connection to source. Patreon will allow me to be able to connect with you in an easier way and to share the more personal side of making videos and being a musical artist.\u003cbr\u003eI am so thankful to all of you who have encouraged me and supported me for the last 14 years.\u00a0 It\u0027s been such a blessing to share such an intimate side of myself through music and to find a way to speak up about things that matter to me. By giving a dollar per video (set whatever limit you want) you support better music videos by me and get to hear more songs. It makes me a better musician. \u00a0Thank you for listening and for becoming a Patron, I look forward to connecting through my music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"We\u0027re all doing the best we can, so give a hug and lend a hand.

Living in the Pacific Northwest of WA, I\u0027ve found a way to express myself and connect with others through music. I guess my music can be labeled as acoustic folk but I like sharing obscure songs and styles from other artists too! I have 4 albums under my belt with several dream albums in the ethers waiting to be hatched. I\u0027m here on Patreon to connect with my audience in a more personal way, to share my inspirations and feed my music career with a little support from those who can show up in a financial way. I\u0027m super excited to see what musical dreams come true!\u003cbr\u003e",
