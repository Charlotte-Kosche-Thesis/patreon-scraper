That could mean that this transforms into something bigger (with your help of course).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support for this comic will help me make ends meet and in return I\u0027ll keep making awesome stuff for you. Money raised through Patreon will pay for site hosting (which I need to upgrade desperately), paper and pens, and hopefully a little pad to help fund merchandise to take to cons. I\u0027ll also be able to funnel money back into other creator\u0027s Patreons to help support them. Basically, I\u0027m trying to make the comic itself, self-sufficient. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t usually discuss this, but as it stands right now I\u0027m unemployed. The comic doesn\u0027t pay for itself and running the site is coming out of my limited resources. I\u0027d rather have a lot of $1 supporters rather than a few large supporters. Your support helps me move forward and helps shape the project as it goes on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are no ads on mythdirection.com and I want to keep it that way. By supporting me on Patreon, you give a little to keep things going and I get to create more fun stuff for you.
