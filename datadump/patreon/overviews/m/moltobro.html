     "about": "Hello to any and all visitors who have chosen to read this \"thing\". (I suppose I can call this thing a thing, right? Great! So \"thing\" it shall be called!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m molto.bro and it truly is a pleasure to make your virtual acquaintance! I\u0027m 19 years old, I\u0027m currently away at school, and I\u0027m a fledgling poet of sorts. I say fledgling because I feel that no matter how much you know, or how much you may think you know, there is always more to be learned. Writing poetry has gotten me through just about all of my troubles. I like to think of it as a way for me to escape into a world of my own design. This otherworldly plain is a sacred place, a place of purity, a place where nothing else matters but the emotions that you feel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe name molto.bro does have a meaning behind it, in fact multiple meanings. The word \"molto\" is an adverb, meaning \"very\" in Italian. So by translation alone my chosen name means \"very bro\" as in: \u003cem\u003eThat\u0027s very bro of you to say\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0(I suppose one could say something like that if they so choose, right?) However, I came up with the term \"molto\" as an acronym for \"Motivation Or Lack There-Of\". That\u0027s my attempt at being clever, you see. This name was chosen because I think that it describes the general attitude that I have kept throughout my life. Which is basically to say that sometimes you get things done and sometimes you don\u0027t. It\u0027s my version of Hakuna Matata, I guess.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this page I will be writing poetry and and making poetry videos. While I do have certain goals for my writing, I probably will not make that a focul point of my content. Which is basically to say that I am going to put out content that I like making while experimenting and tweaking my style behind the scenes. Hopefully, over time, I will be able to look back at this platform and be able to see the changes and strides that I have made to become the best poet that I can be. I hope that you will join me on this journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess I\u0027ll see you around!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
