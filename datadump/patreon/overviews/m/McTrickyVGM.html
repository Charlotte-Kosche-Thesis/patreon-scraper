Online, I also go by the handle \"McTricky\", or \"3LancePro\" or some other variants, but mainly the former. I\u0027m from London, UK and I compose video game music! Well, I suppose I do other things as well such as writing from time to time...oh and I voice act, too!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s this here, then?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eSo, as I mentioned before, I create video game music. It\u0027s a medium that I very much enjoy composing for. Like most people, I\u0027ve always enjoyed video games from a young age, and when I got my first keyboard when I was about 10, I would try to imitate or learn the melodies I would hear in the likes of Crash Bandicoot and Final Fantasy and such. That being said, these days I\u0027ve recently been doing \"orchestral battle arrangements\" of songs from particular video games, TV shows and anime. Usually, this involves a non-orchestral song that may or may not function as a battle theme already, and re-imagine it in a way where it would fit in an RPG battle setting. Prior examples of my work include\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0p-aDabbc0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Do It For Her\"\u003c/a\u003e from \u003cem\u003eSteven Universe\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4J0qljuJCc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Mirror Mirror\"\u003c/a\u003e from \u003cem\u003eRWBY\u003c/em\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfZqTqQ8OJE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Heartache\"\u003c/a\u003e from \u003cem\u003eUndertale\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReally?

Think of it as a \u003cstrong\u003etip jar\u003c/strong\u003e, if you will! So every time, I release new covers, whatever amount you decide to tip goes to help towards future content! Obviously, there are benefits and rewards in it for you as well, which are detailed in the Rewards section!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait a minute?

It all depends on other obligations, such as client work and commissions. That being said, you ARE able to put a monthly cap on your tips, so you don\u0027t ever have to worry about exceeding your budget, if you can\u0027t afford it. You might pledge $10 per cover/arrangement release, but you can only afford $15 for the month, then you can go right ahead in your Patreon account settings and set $10 as the maximum limit! \u003cstrong\u003eThe money comes out on the 1st of each month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo where will all this money be going?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThe money raised on Patreon will go towards the cost of living to help me consistently put out arrangements/covers, saving up for more music gear and software, and upgrade the quality and aesthetic of future videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo we get to talk to you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eDuh, of course! What kind of person would I be if I didn\u0027t talk to my supporters/fans?
