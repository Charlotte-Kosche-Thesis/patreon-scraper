    "summary": "As is tradition with us, we are always looking for ways to take things to the next level and are never satisfied with just \u0027boring\u0027 gun videos. Whether it be crazy 100 yard shots, or creating a functioning Star Wars blaster from scratch, we have always wanted to think outside the box and combine education with the genuine fun that can be associated with guns! Our 4K 60P cameras, Phantom High Speed Camera, and professional level equipment have made this a possibility. Little do most people know, the channel is a very small operation run entirely by Jerry \u0026amp; his son-in-Law Brock Afentul (with additional help provided by Jerry\u0027s daughter, and Brock\u0027s wife, Lena); and we can sometimes overextend ourselves both physically and financially cramming to get our next video out in between competitions. The channel has been entirely run out of pocket for the couple of years that it has existed and is completely family owned. The only sponsor we have had was 2 years ago when Cheaper Than Dirt helped us in providing $5,000 towards our high speed camera which we exchanged for a few plugs in some of our videos. Everything else, however, has been paid for by the Miculek \u0026amp; Afentul families (Brock \u0026amp; Lena). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe say this so that our fans and viewers know that we have actively avoided sponsorship\u0027s for the channel and have mostly been self sufficient. However, as we are growing, we have made attempts to add an even higher production value to our videos which costs us even more time \u0026amp; money. We want to continue to keep the channel as unbiased as possible, which is why would like to extend our viewers the opportunity to fund the channel themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis does not affect the regular weekly videos that appear on the channel and is completely optional. All this does is help take a little of the weight off of us so that we can refocus our time and increase video production in order to provide even more content than usual. Right now, we\u0027re gone almost 200 days out of the year shooting various matches and attending different shows- But we would like to eventually offset that time with production so we can spend even more time with you! Your donations would help cover our equipment costs as well as the time we spend on our videos. We would also like to hire a second person to help with production in the future, so the contribution would go towards that as well. Thanks again for being some of the best fans in the world!"
