First off, I wanted to thank you all for taking the time to stop off at my Patreon page! \u00a0In case you aren\u0027t already familiar with me, I\u0027m a YouTuber: cover artist, vlogger, and voice actress. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.gyazo.com/368e41f58eb1bb7ebaad67a76b95fc1d.png\" style=\"width: 659px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood question! \u00a0Patreon is a sort of tip jar. \u00a0Basically, it gives you the ability to give money to your favorite gamers, artists, YouTubers, vloggers, singers, etcetcetc. \u00a0Patreon, unlike Kickstarter and other websites, funds my projects as long as you guys are willing to donate! So instead of ending after a certain amount of time, it\u0027s always up and running! \u00a0I encourage you to use it, as there\u0027s a lot of cool prizes you can get from becoming a Patreon to someone, such as myself! \u00a0Aside from that, it also lets your favorite content creators create higher quality content. \u00a0I\u0027d have mine set up per month, so the amount you\u0027d pledge would only be charged once a month. \u00a0If this were to change in the future, fear not! \u00a0Patreon has a \"cap\" limit, where you can limit the amount you want to donate. \u00a0So say I switched it to per upload instead of per month, you\u0027d only have to give the amount you\u0027re able to give. \u00a0Any donation is welcome and very much appreciated, so don\u0027t feel pressured to give more then you can afford!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.gyazo.com/6c70b1b67eaf8a520e2af46a1dae532d.png\" style=\"width: 653px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood question! \u00a0Basically, I\u0027m highly considering taking on a full career as a singer/voice actress. \u00a0I\u0027ve received so much support and love that I\u0027d never even fathomed, so naturally, I want to be able to make higher quality content for you, my fans! \u00a0As my fans, or even if you\u0027re just a kind passerby, I feel like you deserve the highest quality content. \u00a0Right now, I currently do my best to upload at least one video a week; whether it be a song cover, comic dub, or vlog.\u00a0 Despite my setup, it can be really hard to get high quality recordings due to lack of sound proofing. \u00a0If I\u0027m able to make enough money, basically, I\u0027d be able to fix my recording space, start hiring professional mixers, animators, and more to make the best quality contact for you, the viewer! \u00a0Right now, it\u0027s my top priority to raise enough money to start getting my room sound proofed and basically transformed into a high quality recording studio.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, any amount helps! \u00a0Whether it be one dollar or fifty dollars, it makes a huge difference in my life, as well as the quality of my content. \u00a0If you choose to donate, I genuinely thank you from the bottom of my heart for your generosity and dedication, as well as for helping me realize my dream and strive to create the highest quality content! \u00a0Even if you aren\u0027t able to donate, don\u0027t feel bad! \u00a0It still means a lot if you just took the time to read through this. \u00a0Thank you so much!~\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
