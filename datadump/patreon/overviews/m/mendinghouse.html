    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eMindfulness-based therapy and education for Wichita.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI want Wichita to have access to the best therapies to address addictions, self-harm and suicidality, especially those without insurance or funding to afford professional therapy. And I want you to help me to get all of this out to our beloved city and surrounding communities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Mending House?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMending House is a heart-centered, mindfulness-based counseling and education service reaching out to our Wichita community to offer holistic help to our community in reducing emotional suffering with compassion and evidence-based practices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelping the Uninsured and Unfunded Get Access to Gold-standard Therapy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA major push of Mending House is to make gold-standard and scientifically-supported counseling services available to uninsured and underinsured Wichitans. Your support helps me to provide these services to the underserved in our community, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, mindfulness-based relapse prevention for substance abuse and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for teens and adults.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOrigins of Mending House.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMending House has been bubbling about in my brain for a few years without a clear vision of what it would be, should be. \u00a0A few recent catalyzing events occurred that brought clarity vision and motivation to act on the vision. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, my work among patients in Methadone Assisted Treatment at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ctcwichita.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWichita Comprehensive Treatment Center\u003c/a\u003e these last two years showed me a new level of devastating addiction and complex needs of many people who are the subject of stigma and derision by a culture and system that has promoted their addictions. Many of these patients with great emotional suffering have been extraordinarily welcoming of DBT skills training and mindfulness-based services at the treatment center. Their kind welcome and their complexities have nourished my compassion, my clinical skills, my mindfulness and prayer practices and my growth as a person. And showed me that DBT and mindfulness are sorely needed approaches to dealing with emotional suffering. Secondly, the Wise Mind and the Good Life mindfulness meditation group I facilitate for the public weekly at Wichita\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CommonsGroundsCoffeeHouse/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCommon Grounds Coffee House\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e managed to get me talking about Mending House, and then encouraged me by rallying behind the project. \u00a0They have offered various services from web development to marketing, from volunteering to giving me gentle chidings to move forward. \u00a0Third, the suicide of a friend earlier this Summer brought emotional clarity, that Wichita needs more specialized therapies, such as a DBT and mindfulness, which are literally life-saving therapies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the summer progressed I\u0027ve been blessed with the convergence, the confluence, of various people including community activists, yogis, pastors, blue and white collar professionals, peer mentors, probation officers, single parents, educators, counselors and holistic medicine specialists whom share overlapping goals and desires for their own healing and to share healing with Wichita. And most recently, I\u0027ve been afforded professional office space at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://hausofclarity.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHaus of Clarity\u003c/a\u003e where I will office with professionals who specialize in trauma. This gives Mending House a headquarters for beginning it\u0027s/my.our mission. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Background: I\u0027m Scott Spradlin\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI earned my Master of Arts in Counseling at Covenant Theological Seminary, St. Louis, MO. \u00a0I\u0027m currently a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) and a Licensed Addictions Counselor (LAC) in the State of Kansas. I have twenty years of experience in counseling and mindfulness-based therapy, primarily treating suicidality, self-harm and addictions. \u00a0More recently I\u0027m working with persons struggling with addictions to methamphetamines, alcohol and opioids/opiates in Methadone Assisted Treatment. I had the honor and blessing of being intensively trained in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://behavioraltech.org/resources/faqs/dialectical-behavior-therapy-dbt/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)\u003c/a\u003e, developed by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_M._Linehan\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMarsha Linehan, PhD\u003c/a\u003e, at the University of Washington. And I want to bring this training and experience to Wichita, full-force, to the people of our community the benefit of this cutting edge therapy. \u00a0I also want to spread this therapy through training the hard working healing professionals in our community already doing good work for our hurting, to be a resource and ally for my colleagues. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also the author of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Let-Your-Emotions-Life/dp/1572243090/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Don\u0027t Let Your Emotions Run Your Life: How Dialectical Behavior Therapy Can Put You in Control\" (New Harbinger, 2003)\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0I had the privilege of being a guest lecturer at George Fox University in Newberg, OR, Portland State University and Friend\u0027s University, Wichita, KS, and served for two years as an adjunct professor for Wichita State University College of Education lecturing on Dialectical Behavior Therapy, The Assessment and Treatment of Suicidality and Self-Harm, Anger Management and the Ethical Integration of Religion and Spirituality in Psychotherapy. And finally, I have been a trainer for PESI, Inc. providing continuing education seminars for professionals in the area of DBT, the Assessment and Treatment of Suicidality and Self-Harm and Working With Difficult-to-Treat Patients in Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Traverse City and Lansing in MI, Upstate New York, Hartford, Providence and other cities across the United States. \u00a0Blah,blah, so on and so forth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Your Support Helps Mending House.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour support frees me up to develop counseling curriculum, groups, individual and family counseling to those in great need and who face life-threatening behaviors, especially those who lack insurance or funding for professional counseling services.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMending House seeks to collaborate with Wichita-area educators, clergy, mental health providers, holistic and traditional physicians and yoga instructors in the dissemination and practice of mindfulness-based services to the people they serve in Wichita.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe invite the Wichita public and whomever would like to work toward reducing suicide and emotional suffering among those who are trapped in addictions and suicidal thinking and behaviors. We are moving toward becoming a non-profit organization as Mending House evolves. Mending House has been afforded office space at Haus of Clarity, located at Carriage Parkway (\u003ca href=\"http://hausofclarity.com/)\"\u003ehttp://hausofclarity.com/)\u003c/a\u003e. I will be officing with a small army of skilled, compassionate therapists.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMending House, works ecumenically for the well-being of our community, while emerging from an Orthodox heart that seeks to help \"the least of these,\" by partnering with friends and allies to continuously raise funds to be set aside for the uninsured and underfunded to receive gold standard counseling and education services, as well as referrals for functional medicine checkups and treatment, and assistance for recovery-related yoga.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRome Wasn\u0027t Built in a Day: Mid- and Long-term Goals for Therapy Offerings:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNon-pharmacological treatment for pain management;\u003cbr\u003eStandard DBT;\u003cbr\u003eDBT-S and Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention for substance abuse problems;\u003cbr\u003eMindfulness Based Stress Reduction;\u003cbr\u003eClergy-counselor collaboration;\u003cbr\u003ePhysician-counselor collaboration;\u003cbr\u003eMeditation groups and instruction for the community at large;\u003cbr\u003eTrauma and Recovery-informed yoga;\u003cbr\u003eYoga Referral/collaborations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering Mending House for your contribution, whether one time, or recurring support. \u00a0Premiums are coming, too, to reward you for your donations.
