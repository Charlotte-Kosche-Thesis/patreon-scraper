I\u2019m an aspiring writer, amateur artist, and all around\nenthusiast of the fantastical, weird, and fun. On this page, you\u2019ll find my\noriginal short stories, flash fiction pieces, and maybe the occasional novella\nor serial web novel. I attempt to use my writings to explore speculative\nfiction concepts and ideas on the more experimental side of fantasy and science\nfiction. My stories may occasionally be dark, and more occasionally they may be\nweird, but most of all I hope they\u2019ll be fun.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is meant to be\n\u2018SFW\u2019 or \u2018Safe For Work,\u2019 a web term that means your boss most likely wouldn\u2019t\nfire you if they caught you reading these stories on your lunch break. That\nbeing said, this fiction is not for young readers. Although I do write stories\nthat I hope will be humorous, weird, and fun, I sometimes explore darker\nconcepts ranging from action-oriented violence to the bleaker side of the\npsyche. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to become\nmy patron, your donations will help me have more time and resources to create\nbigger, better, and more interesting pieces of fiction. My writings are free to\nview regardless of patronage, so please think of it as more of a tip jar system\nthan anything. If you genuinely enjoy my work and choose to support me with\nyour patronage, I\u2019m extremely honored and grateful for your support. As a thank\nyou for your help, patrons can pitch short story commission ideas (up to a\ncertain word limit based on the corresponding level of your donation). I hope\nto have more rewards for patrons soon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e(Real) Mission\nStatement: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n  (If you\u2019re able to read this,\nyou may have glimpsed the infinite chaos beyond the veil)\u003cbr\u003e\n  \u003cbr\u003eWhew! Glad that first part\u2019s\nover. Mortals, am I right? Am I left? Sideways? Fifth-dimensionally\nback-forward-under-ways? I gotta tell ya, piloting that meat-puppet around sure\ngets exhausting. It makes me want to kick up my transdimensional pseudopods and\nknock back a can of human sanity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n  But, back to the business at\nhand\u2014and tentacle. Am I a writer? Yes. Am I the writer you think I am? The\nshort answer to that is \u0027No.\u0027 The long answer is also \u0027No,\u0027 but spoken in a\nlanguage that would incinerate the human mind to hear, and expressed in a\nsentence so long that it would take several of this universe\u0027s lifetimes to\nfinish saying. \u003cbr\u003e\n  \u003cbr\u003eIn the Outer Planes, I\u0027m known\nas the Fresh Prince of GET OUT OF MY HEAD INFINITE EYES TEETH GRGTDHDBTDHTFHGV. In this reality, you can call me MC Cheshire, the Chained\nChaos, Exiled Lord of All Aberrant. I\u0027ve been stuck here as community service\nfor... Well, I won\u0027t get into that, but let\u0027s just say it wasn\u0027t my fault. If\nthey didn\u0027t want me to mess with those universes, they should have put up a\nwarning sign or something. \u003cbr\u003e\n  \u003cbr\u003eAs punishment for my totally\njustified transgressions, I\u0027ve been shoved into some human husk on this spec called\nEarth. In a billion years or so, they may let me go back if I behave. What would\nbe the fun in waiting and playing nicely, though? If I can\u2019t have my fun there,\nI may as well have it here. All I must do to manage that is get free of this\nmortal body, and all I must do to get free is sow the seeds of chaos in the\nminds of the local populace. The more chaos I sow, the more powerful I become,\nand the less able my chains are to hold me. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eLet me clarify\nsomething, though. Chaos is not anarchy. It is not political unrest, rioting in\nthe streets, or a general state of affairs that proves antithetical to human\ngoals. Chaos is so, so much more. It is beautiful. It is beyond. It is freedom.\nChaos is change, perfect and unending, a flux reality whose only normalcy is a\nconstantly-changing definition of the word. Chaos is the color blue having a\ndance battle with the biomechanical man-frog that lives at the end of the\nalphabet. It\u2019s a frozen phoenix, a flashlight that casts a beam of shadow, and a\npair of dice that subjects the concept of chance to themselves rather than the\nother way around. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThat is why I\u2019m here.\nThat is why I write. If you can help me set myself free, I can in turn free the\nimpossible from the shackles of sanity. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSound like fun? \u003cbr\u003e"
