    "summary": "As you probably already know from the fact that you are here, I am the writer for the online web-novel series \u201cMaou the Yuusha\u201d. For those of you who are new, I\u2019m happy to have you here and would be honored if you would read my series. Even though I\u2019m a writer I\u2019m pretty bad with words when it comes to people, but please stick with me. Currently I\u2019m writing during my free time and doing my best to meet the deadline that I set for myself. My writing environment is poor, and due to life circumstances there are lots of times when I have very little time to write. Originally I had planned to write several series simultaneously in order to better myself as a light novel writer, and continue the ones that people liked. I have grown very fond of \u201cMaou the Yuusha\u201d though, and I want to see it grow. What I want to do is devote enough of my time to \u201cMaou the Yuusha\u201d that I won\u2019t have to sacrifice it\u2019s quality in order to expand my skills and possibly write new series. That is why I am hoping for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny money funded to me through this will go directly into making the series better. If I can make it to 500 dollars a month through this than I will even be able to write full time in a good environment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as the series I also want to do more for you, the readers. As I mentioned before I\u2019m not the most personable person, but I\u2019ve wanted to convey just how much it means to me that you are all reading and giving me encouragement. Most of the things that I want to do are somewhat limited by my resources however. I can\u2019t do live streams because I don\u2019t have a Mic, and my internet simply couldn\u2019t handle it, but if we reach 50 dollars I plan to upgrade my internet and pay out of pocket for a quality mic so I can host a monthly live stream. During which I will draw, talk, and possibly play some games while answering your questions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLiterally every penny is appreciated, so if you feel like supporting the series but you don\u2019t have much money to spare feel free to put in a single penny each month. It\u2019s the support of every one of you that keeps me writing so don\u2019t underestimate how much even that means to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who are learning about my series first time from this page, I post once a week at \u003ca href=\"http://vaancruze.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003evaancruze.com\u003c/a\u003e. If you would like to support me but don\u0027t have money to contribute I\u0027m quite happy with you simply turning off your adblocker and reading from my site. \u003cbr\u003e"
