    "summary": "MDXpods is a brand new\npodcasts network specializing in movie podcasts. Remake Rewind is currently in\npre-production. MDXpods has three more projects ready to be produced as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMDXpods was founded by Mike Acevedo in 2017 and\nwill feature shows hosted by Mike, Dustin Cantrell, and Xavier Coelho-Kostolny.\nMDXpods will be engineered by Katrina Sherwood.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMDXpods was not born from boredom or on a whim\nbut was born from months of research and preparation. We want to be different\nfrom other podcasts and have set ourselves up as a network with every intention\nof growing and adding more and more shows. We want to hit the ground running\nwith professional level production values. This is why we decided to build a\nsocial media following on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter before launching our\npodcast. It is important to us to interact with our listeners, so it was a\npriority to have a social media presence early and find out what people want to\nhear. Having a social media presence allows us to share our podcast with more\npeople right off the bat. We have built a website that will also host our\npodcast; meaning our fans only have to go to one place! This is something that\nwe are doing because we genuinely have a passion for talking about movies and\nwe believe people will get a kick at listening to us. With your help, we can do\nthis right!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy becoming patrons you will not only help us\nwill help us fund the day to day operations of hosting a podcast but help us\nexpand and grow. By patronizing this endeavor, you can help us upgrade our\nequipment as we dream of going analog to bring the best possible quality to\nyou. In addition to upgrading our gear, we can start producing our next two\npodcasts. We designed MDXpods to be a network from day one, so with your help\nwe can also find new content creators and help fund their shows. If there is a demand,\nwe can even produce live shows but we need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are able to spare a few dollars a month it\nwould help us live our dream of sharing our opinions and laughs with the world.\nWe aren\u0027t asking for $10, $15 , or $20 commitments but whatever you can spare. As\na suggestion, what you wouldn\u0027t notice if it fell out your pocket. We are\nasking for the amount of change you\u0027d would drop and not bend down and pick it\nup. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you in advance for those who support us.\nFor those who can\u0027t, please feel free to enjoy the podcasts and share with your\nfriends and family.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks,\u003cbr\u003e\nMike Acevedo\u003cbr\u003e\nFounder, Producer, Host for MDXpods\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow us:\u003cbr\u003eMDXpods.com\u003cbr\u003eInstagram.com/MDXpods\u003cbr\u003eFacebook.com/MDXpods\u003cbr\u003etwitter.com/MDXpods\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
