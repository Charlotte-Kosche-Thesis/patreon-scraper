    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page! I am a Juilliard-trained musician based in New York and have been transcribing music since I was a kid. Thank you for showing interest in joining this community of Jazz lovers! As a patron, your support will go a long way towards allowing me to continue this work at the highest level possible and will provide you with a huge educational resource. You won\u2019t find these transcriptions anywhere else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGetting inside music and finding out how and why it sounds the way it does has always been very compelling to me, and is vital to learning to play Jazz. Because Jazz is an improvised art form, most of it is not written down. In order to learn how to play Jazz you must transcribe the Masters and learn from them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver 15 years ago I started an ambitious project - transcribing the piano and bass parts to Brad Mehldau\u2019s entire Art Of The Trio, Vol. 4 album. I worked on it for about two years, meticulously going through the album note-by-note over and over again. It was quite an undertaking, but the knowledge I gained was invaluable. Since that time, I\u2019ve transcribed several other works of his from various albums and have many more in progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the transcriptions that are on my YouTube channel are currently available. The reward tiers will give you credits that you can use to get PDFs of these transcriptions. The $5 tier gives you 5 credits, the $10 tier gives you 10 credits and so on. Some transcriptions will be worth 5 credits, and some will be worth 10 (See this\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/18284264\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epost\u003c/a\u003e for more info). Credits can be saved up from month to month. You can always message me if you\u0027d like more credits without changing reward tiers and we can work something out (although it is easy to change tiers). At the beginning of each month, after the pledges have gone through, I will send messages to everyone telling them how many credits they have and asking which transcription(s) they would like that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u2019m sure you can imagine, these transcriptions are very difficult and time consuming. I would love to continue doing more of Brad\u2019s works and even branch out to other musicians as well (Keith Jarrett!). Thank you again for taking the time to consider supporting my work!\u003cbr\u003e"
