We would love for you to join us on this journey. It will take a community to make it possible and every investment goes to promoting and supporting the great artists that come through the show each week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur small and mighty team consists of Claudia (Super Hero), Ben Levy (Producer and Sound Engineer Extraordinaire), Brett Winning (bassist for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.faircityfire.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFair City Fire\u003c/a\u003e!) BeckiJo Neill (Comedian Season 1), Melody Shifflet (Comedian Season 2), Mario Ramirez (The Master-of-All intern), Kris (Everything else no one wants to do), and Macha (Chief of Security). This great team donates their time and skills each week for the love of live music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show is filmed from the Potrafka\u0027s home studio in downtown East Austin. All of the equipment to make the show possible was made by a personal investment of the Potrafkas. In addition to showcasing the artists to help their exposure, we feed them too! Every Tuesday is Taco Tuesday for the artists and team. This is our way of building community and showing our appreciation for the artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started as a personal passion has really started to gain momentum. Soon after the 12th show we actually started getting requests from folks to sit in as a member of the live studio audience AND we had a few requests from local businesses to host it from their location. As of early February we\u0027ve completed over 27 shows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think we have something unique and special so we\u0027re building a community of patrons to be a part of the journey. As a member, there are a lot of ways to get involved from as simple as contributing $3/month and being showcased in our credits to getting full VIP access to all our shows for just $50/month - that comes to over 40 private shows for the year including, dinner and drinks, a T-shirt, and meeting all the artists!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your contribution we can keep the show going and reach a broader audience that gives these great artists more exposure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money contributed by our patrons will go towards covering our basic costs of operation, upgrades to our equipment, promoting the show, and paying the staff (they all volunteer their time/skills today).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out our video to learn more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
