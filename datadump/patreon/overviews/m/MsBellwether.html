    "summary": "When popular literature was still young, it was typically published piecemeal in newspapers and other periodicals. Many of the novels we call classics today were written in this manner, chapter by chapter over months and even years. Nowadays, of course, novels typically arrive in one unitary package, either in the form of a block of dead trees or as a series of ones and zeroes on your display hardware of choice. Breaking into that market, however, is not as easy as it might seem, which brings us to this campaign. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to write fiction \u2014 weird, diverse, and explicitly queer speculative fiction, in the main, with perhaps the occasional diversion into fantasy or another genre. I\u2019d love for you to read it! I\u0027m a writer by trade, with most of my work being done freelance-style. If you know the business at all, you know it\u0027s not exactly a significant or regular source of income! This campaign is here to help offset the stop-start nature of my freelance paychecks, and I\u0027d be thrilled to have your help. Let me tell you about the story I\u2019m working on at the moment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eProper Procedures\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore often than not\u2014in fact, almost to exclusion\u2014zombie media is the haven of violent, right-wing survivalist worldviews, of justification for mass murder. Zombies are the perfect faceless enemy, already dead and thus free of any moral onus against killing. \u003cem\u003eProper Procedures\u003c/em\u003e is a contradiction and a repudiation of that kind of zombie story, a tale of post-apocalyptic compassion. When disasters happen, some people take advantage of it, certainly, but more of us come together. The spirit of cooperation thrives in adversity, and compassion for our fellow humans is the norm, not the exception. We evolved to be social animals for a reason\u2014survival is much more likely when you\u2019re not blindly aggressive to everyone you run across. This is a story about surviving, yes, but also about rebuilding, growing, and changing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first two chapters are available for free, in [\u003ca href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50983593/PPsample.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePDF\u003c/a\u003e], [\u003ca href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50983593/PPsample.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHTML\u003c/a\u003e], and [\u003ca href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50983593/PPsample.epub\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEPUB\u003c/a\u003e] format. Please read them! If you like what you see and want more of it, pitch in! I aim for each chapter to be around 3000 words, give or take, so by the end of the novel a single measly dollar per chapter won\u0027t cost you any more than a hardcover book would. If you want to be really generous, though, there\u0027s a little extra in it for you\u2014details below!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note: \u003cem\u003eProper Procedures, \u003c/em\u003ewhile not glorifying violence, does contain it, so if you\u0027re sensitive to such imagery, please exercise caution.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
