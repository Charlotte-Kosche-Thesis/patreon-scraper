We are the \u003cstrong\u003eMADiSON \u003c/strong\u003edevelopment team.\u003cbr\u003e We have been working full time in the game for several months, driven by our passion for videogames and horror.\u003cbr\u003eOur devotion for game dev and all the hard work and hours invested (friends\u0027 and family\u0027s too), led us to create a demo we are proud of unveiling to all of you.\u003cbr\u003eThe demo is an experience of a few minutes where we show the mechanics and the potential of the game. For us, letting you play with what we have come up is key to building trust between you and us.\u003cbr\u003eThe plans are to finish the game by mid-2018 and publish it on steam. We still have months of development ahead but we are confident that everything will be more than fine.\u003cbr\u003e Our main goal today is to be able to deliver a full game experience. We\u0027d love to have your support in this awesome journey.\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of each one of you, we seek to improve the character modeling, voice acting, to pay software licenses, localisations, sound fx and also collaborate with us and our small studio to continue working more effectively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT US\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlexis Di Stefano:\u003c/strong\u003e I have been passionate about horror genre since I was a child, a huge horror videogames and films lover. I am the guy in charge of the game design and all the visuals of the game. I also make the sound fx. \u003cbr\u003e This project started off as an assignment while studying video game design. After I graduated last year I understood that MADiSON needed to become real, so I have worked tirelessly on developing the game since then. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaximiliano Rasiun: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I am the guy who brings all the game events and mechanics to life.\u003cbr\u003eWe co-worked\u00a0together in the game while we were in college. After graduating we knew this poject had the potential that a horror game needs. Coding is my life. I have been working as a programmer in little mobile games but now I am fully focused on MADiSON.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
