    "summary": "Hello! ^.^\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Brooke, and I am an oboist/instrumentalist and I make video game covers on YouTube! Currently, I am studying as a full-time college student to be a music teacher. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThrough this platform, fans can support content creators by pledging a certain amount of money to support their content. In return, fans can get various rewards for pledging! I think this is a really wonderful way for us content creators to earn money for our content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI started making video game covers actively in February of 2017. I have always been very passionate about both music and video games, and this channel combines these two interests! Countless hours of time is spent creating a single video: arranging, notating, recording, and editing both the audio and film. I have had to learn to do this completely by myself\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e and I have a lot more experience to gain through this process. With your help, I can continue to improve my content through \u003cstrong\u003ebetter equipment\u003c/strong\u003e for audio production (VSTs, plugins, better DAWs) and video production (camera, lenses, lighting, and video editing software). I don\u0027t run ads on my videos and don\u0027t sell my covers, so I think this would be a great way to improve this channel through financial help. Every single cent earned through this Patreon campaign will be spent back into this channel so I can continue to grow as a creator!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I only want to pledge once, or donate more/less?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyone who pledges has \u003cem\u003ecomplete control\u003c/em\u003e over what they donate. You can always cancel at any time, and can set a specific amount if you do not want to follow the rewards. Patreon is \u003cem\u003eextremely flexible\u003c/em\u003e, so don\u0027t sweat it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is absolutely \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ezero obligation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e to pledge, and I will continue to make videos no matter how many people support! Even just watching my videos means the absolute world to me! I am so grateful for anyone who supports me in an way, pledging or not :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Brooke \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
