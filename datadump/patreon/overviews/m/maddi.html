In which you require me to call upon what little ego I have to simply explain my plight to those who might have big enough hearts to support me so selflessly. Surely, by the end of my long-winded plea, it will have exhausted all I possess. \u00a0It is not in my nature to highlight my own merits, and honestly I find it hard to admit to them on my own -- though, logically I am aware they must exist. \u003cem\u003eOh, they must! For, in what scenario would my presence be tolerated among my peers if I did not at least have some small something to offer?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee, I have a weakness for words in all form. I am enthralled -- intoxicated, even! \u00a0I am enchanted by things that leap off of the page (or perhaps screen, as I hear the age of print is a waning one, and I cry to mourn the loss of the new-book smell I found comfort in as a child and young adult) and enable me to paint vibrant pictures in my mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of us have been inspired by words on a page. I count myself among them, and even more, it inspired me to feverishly pursue the passion in another form. I\u0027m convinced a good portion of the blood in my veins is actually the ebony gold of HP Cartridge #61. It\u0027s a devil of a curse; my mind is always drawn to story after story, but I never have the ability to really sit down and truly give chase to my imaginary creations. It is my hope that people who support me here will allow me to realize a dream I have had for over half of my short life. Help me sustain this journey, and you have my eternal thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile writing is certainly the highest among my passions, I do also do the occasional artsy thing. I also enjoy streaming on Twitch! :)"
