Even though we aren\u0027t the Red Cross or even the Salvation Army we have a huge heart for the downtrodden who\u0027s lives have been badly effected by disasters like hurricanes.\u00a0We keep this in mind when choosing destinations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, Hurricane Harvey ravished the Texas coast. We immediately started fundraising for purified water and food rations. A week later, we packed our bags and traveled to areas that were hit hard like Houston and Bowmont Texas. We hoped that we might alleviate some of the pain from the fresh wound people had just be dealt by Harvey. We were so happy to do our part that we decided to incorporate it into our lifestyle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is Patreon and how can I support?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePatreon is incredibly cool, it\u0027s a place where you can support independent artists like us.  If you like what we do, you can join us in our adventures, and along the way help us create more videos! So we, together, make publishing Mission Fleet content a reality! And thankfully it\u2019s very simple, you pledge an amount that you feel comfortable with per video we create, and every time we post one on here, Patreon does the heavy lifting! You can also set a monthly maximum in case we go on a video posting frenzy :). Much like the wind carrying us to new frontiers, our supporters carry us as well! With your support we can make repairs to our boat, buy new filming equipment to produce better videos and feed ourselves when we can\u0027t catch a fish.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t feel obligated but do feel free, a little from you means a lot to us! We look forward to bringing you along with us in our travels. Have a blessed day! We are sending you our warm smiles!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
