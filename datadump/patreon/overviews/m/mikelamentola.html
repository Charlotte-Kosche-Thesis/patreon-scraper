Passionate about my work and the potential impact it could have I\u0027ve done the majority of this work at no cost. While this is the perfect price for small businesses and organizations it has kept me from producing content at the consistency I feel is needed to really have an impact.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter developing several business models to fund my work and solve this problem I have realized that business development and sales are not my strong points and distract me from the work I love and feel I should be doing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0This is why I have come to Patreon to ask you (the members of my community) \u00a0to support my work directly and help me to make Grass Lake a more connected community. Not only will your monthly donation support my work but you will also get access to a private group which I will rely on for feedback and direction. In addition this will also include fun bonus content and invites to private events!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA FOCUS ON ASSETS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u201cTo create a more positive and connected future for our communities, we must be willing to trade their problems for their possibilities.
