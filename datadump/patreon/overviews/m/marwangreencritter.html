That means removing empty promises I\u0027m unable to fulfill, reworking the pledge tiers, and basically trying to be more active on Patreon as hard as I can be. I will also try to spread the word about my Patreon page more. Thank you for your understanding.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig09.deviantart.net/05a0/f/2016/155/b/1/marwan_choose5_by_marwangreencritter-da4xs7n.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, guys! =3 I am Marwan, that cute green little critter from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://marwangreencritter.deviantart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantART\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/marwan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFur Affinity\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.weasyl.com/~Marwan\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWeasyl\u003c/a\u003e. After several months of thinking about it, I finally decided to start a Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore specifically, I draw cartoons and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://marwangreencritter.bandcamp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewrite music\u003c/a\u003e as a hobby. Sometimes, I even do\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-qa1CRgArMMFatdLukSAMwokRnmOI3MJ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSource Filmmaker videos\u003c/a\u003e just for fun. I\u0027m currently unemployed, and since I realized that I probably won\u0027t be making that much money from commissions and ad revenues generated from my SFM videos posted on YouTube, I decided to try my luck with Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating art is not that cheap. My parents repeatedly tell me to, as long as I\u0027m still unemployed and doing freelancing work, try to make a living with my hobbies. Gain as much money as I can so I can support the family. With more money, I can buy better software, better tools to produce more artwork and music, and at the same time, support my family. And besides, my father retired from work since 2013, so the burden and responsibility of supporting the the family\u0027s income falls onto me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not sure if my Patreon campaign would eventually be successful, but it doesn\u0027t hurt to try. I know that I\u0027m probably not a popular artist, so I probably don\u0027t get much attention as those other artists out there... But, if you decided to support me, then I will greatly appreciate it. ^_^ Thank you for your help. And I\u0027m sorry if my introduction seemed rushed or unclear."
