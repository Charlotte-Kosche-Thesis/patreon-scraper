I love how the best ones make me feel and how the worst ones give me hours of complaining to do \u2013 much fun! In writing my own stories, I hope to capture some of the magic that my favourite books cast over me (\u003cem\u003eMistborn, Game of Thrones, The Winter King, Assassin\u2019s Apprentice\u003c/em\u003e, to name but a few).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s why I\u2019m writing. If you\u2019d like me to write more books, faster, then supporting me here on Patreon is the best way to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9); font-weight: normal;\"\u003eRewards\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eHopefully, you are here because you\u2019ve read my books, enjoyed them and want to support me. With that in mind, I want to keep it simple, so there are only two tiers here. The only difference is whether you want to splash out for signed paperbacks or are happy with just ebooks. Other than that, all Patreons will get the same early previews of new cover art, early access to chapters, artwork, other short stories, and most importantly, you\u2019ll receive copies of future books I write \ud83d\ude0a \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9); font-weight: normal;\"\u003eWhat am I working on next?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eWith the \u003cem\u003eDragon\u2019s Blade Trilogy\u003c/em\u003e completed, I\u2019ve moved onto my fourth book. It will be my first LitRPG novel (these books are a bit like Ready Player One where the character plays in a VR world). It will have a fantasy setting so I\u0027m sticking to what I hope my readers will love. I\u0027m EXTREMELY excited to write it and can\u0027t wait to share it with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for subscribing. Your support means the world to me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS - My middle initial really is R! Not just copying Tolkien, Martin or Rowling but I\u0027m not complaining. Bonus points if you can guess what it stands for...\u003cbr\u003e"
