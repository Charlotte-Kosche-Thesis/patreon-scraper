    "summary": "Hello and Welcome to my Patreon page, I am so happy to have you here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Joshua Minor but I am known, through Youtube, as MusicalWonder. I am just a simple, goofy, and gifted fellow that always loves to share and teach music to those that are willing to learn. And to teach it in a simple manner so that anyone can understand it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(149, 179, 215);\"\u003eWhat kind of content will you be releasing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am happy to answer that for you. I will be releasing all kinds of content based around gospel and soul based music. These videos will have full instrumentals of the chosen song in the style that fits my fancy during the time of the video. All kind of songs will be chosen from old school, contemporary, praise and worship, praise break, and even some old school soul songs that are just wonderful to listen to. Also there will be the occasional tip/lesson videos that will have many types of musician tips or production tips for those out there learning. These will be more in depth than the ones I have posted on youtube. The skill level of these tip/lesson videos will be from beginner all the way to advanced.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(149, 179, 215);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229, 185, 183);\"\u003eSounds good, but why pledge?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you pledge, you are basically giving me a pat on the back, saying good job, and helping to allow me to continue to make great content but to also build and create even better content. Every pledge, no matter how small or big, helps me in a great way. Being that I am self employed with my music and designing, I am not always able to post and do what I want to do for those of you out there all across the land. But with your pledge, I can continue to take care of my family, myself, and really build on content that will be just plain awesome.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003eHere are just a few things your pledge could help me with:\u003cbr\u003eBetter Camera(s) for right hand, left hand, bass pedal close ups\u003cbr\u003eUpdated Audio Equipment which will give you the best sounding videos, mp3s, etc\u003cbr\u003eNew instruments including a compact organ to be able to do a bunch more organ videos without having to take the time to drive on the other side of town to my church to try and do it quickly\u003cbr\u003eand much more....\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(250, 192, 143);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you do this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do it because I love music and I love the impact it can have on a person\u0027s life. There are so many people out there that want to learn but don\u0027t have the funds, the loans for college, or they get discouraged because the people they ask to teach them look down on them. I do this because I want to share the gifts God has blessed me with. And not only teach it but be involved with those that learn from it, and to show it to them in a way that isn\u0027t too complex. Everybody isn\u0027t made to be a music scholar, but that doesn\u0027t mean a average joe or sue can\u0027t learn. They can learn just as much as the scholar with the right direction. So give it a shot, I\u00a0guarantee you will enjoy and get something out of it, whether it is from the lessons or just listening to good music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really do thank you for checking out my Patreon page, and appreciate you taking the time as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe Blessed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
