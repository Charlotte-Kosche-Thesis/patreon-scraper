I wanted to offer a good space for moderated, educated debate around some of the more difficult topics: Video Game Addiction (is it real or not?); Ties of Gun Violence\u00a0to Mental Health (Are there some or not enough evidence to connect them). When I am not doing that,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI interview people to learn about the many faces of mental illness. \u003c/strong\u003eYou can trust that I am always doing research to get back-up from people much smarter than I.
