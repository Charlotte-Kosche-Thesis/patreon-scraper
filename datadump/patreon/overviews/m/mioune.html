I did so and I thus took a part time job; which\nallowed me to spend more time on recording and posting covers for you\nguys. The idea and the feeling were great, but after several months, I\nrealised that doing so was not helping me earning my life decently at\nall and that soon being 30, I had to be reasonable.\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s the reason why I created a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.tipeee.com/mioune-1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTipeee\u003c/a\u003e page in January 2016. It was one last chance for me to\nmaybe be able to keep things this way. I already knew that some\nof my French followers wanted to financially support me but didn\u0027t know where and how\nto. I honestly didn\u0027t think it could work, but I wanted to give it a\ntry. I didn\u0027t want to give up on my dream like this without even\ntrying.\u003cbr\u003e\nHow surprised have I been! 2016 has been an incredible year! I needed\n500 euros a month to keep my life like this and I reached this goal\neasily every month. I still can\u0027t believe it and I\u0027m so grateful to\neveryone who supports me on Tipeee.\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY DO I OPEN A PATREON PAGE, THEN?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI sometimes receive messages from some of you guys who may not\nunderstand and speak French well but who enjoy listening to my covers\nand would like to support me too anyway! You\u0027re so sweet and I thank you so\nmuch for this! Tipeee being exclusively developed in French though, I wanted to\ncreate a page on a website you would be more familiar with. That\u0027s why\nI\u0027m also on Patreon, now! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW MUCH DO I NEED?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, my financial needs from 2017 on will be a bit different because\nmy life is about to change A LOT! Indeed, at the end of March, I\u0027m\ngoing to be a mom! :) I then decided to stop working and stay at home\nto take care of my son until he\u0027s 3 years old (when he will go to\nschool). Haha, no worries though! I will never need your financial support to help\nme raise my kid! My boyfriend earns enough to make us three live\ncorrectly (I would\u0027ve purely stopped YouTube and taken a full time job\nagain, otherwise). I didn\u0027t want my boyfriend to support me before\nbecause I had \u201cno excuse\u201d for taking a part time job. Now I\u0027m\nbecoming to stay home to raise our kid, that\u0027s different. It\u0027s a\nfull time and hard job on its own! Therefore, \u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t have any financial objective on Patreon or Tipeee to reach so I can keep on posting regularly anymore\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e. :) Your donations will be for example used to improve my recording and stage equipment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCOUNTERPARTS? THE PROBLEM\u2026 MY DECISION!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSome creators say that counterparts rank people and that it\u0027s not\nsuch a good idea to offer exclusive gifts according to the amount of\nmoney given. Instead of considering an equivalent moral support (but\nfinancially different depending on what people can actually do), you\nonly reward people who can give the most.\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a result to this system, there are some people who would want a\ncertain counterpart but who clearly cannot afford it. They thus may\nfeel bad, think it\u0027s unfair or even worse: give the corresponding\nmoney anyway when they logically can\u0027t. On the other side, there are\npeople to whom money is not a problem but who don\u0027t want any\ncounterpart.\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, I really want to thank all of you who support me with\nsomething! What can I do?\u003cbr\u003e\nMy decision is then really simple: if you decide to support me, you\nwill get a little counterpart but it will be the same for everyone\nand most of all, \u003cu\u003enot exclusive\u003c/u\u003e: you will just get an early access to\nmy future videos (24 hours before they become public). :) I hope you\u0027re not disappointed by this decision; that\u0027s what I thought was the most fair for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA thousand thank you to anyone who will support my passion! \u0026lt;3 Please know that each dollar truly means the world to me! Much love!\u003c/div\u003e"
