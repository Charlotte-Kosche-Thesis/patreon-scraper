     "about": "My\n name is Michele Filippelli and I live in Calabria (Italy) at Cropalati \nCS, I have been present on you tube for 10 years with a channel called \nMicheleExpert which enjoys a good popularity. My\n project is to create DIY tutorials of any kind from gardening, \nmechanics, masonry and many recipes of traditional Calabrian cuisine \nthat I make using natural organic products grown directly from me. I like teaching my things and especially many cooking recipes. My\n project is to open an online store of products made in an organic way \nand sell them all over the world knowing to offer an excellent product, \norganic and at a lower cost of competition. I\n have a great passion to make a great book of traditional Italian and \nCalabrian cuisine to be known all over the world and especially in \nAmerica where I lived for a month in Florida in Naples by friends known \nby chance through you tube thanks to my recipes that I\n published with my mother who left me for 5 months because she died and \nmy dream is to continue our project that has kept us connected for many \nyears regarding the kitchen with organic products. I\n hope you can follow me and help me in this project that will make you \nknow a lot about me and if you want you can already view me on my \nchannel of you tube at this link: https: \n//www.youtube.com/c/MicheleExpertCropalati. I hope I can give you an important reason to be able to follow me and concretely help me with any offer you want to give me. No, I just have to greet you and invite you to view my first published video. To all of you, thanks for your attention!\u003cbr\u003e",

For years I\u0027ve been on you tube on this URL: http: //www.youtube.com/c/MicheleExpertCropalati where you count millions of visits and thousands of subscribers, however you tube does not support me adequately to create a very nice project and fascinating of a cookbook with natural and organic products that I would like to publish and make known all over the world. Those who will support me after the publication of the book will receive it all in pdf format and for a number of supporters to be established you will be given a printed copy with a personal dedication. Then if you have questions to ask me about the kitchen and the products I use I will be happy and to gratify you with every advice and suggestion. But to make sure that all this can be achieved, we need your cooperation, committing you to offer 5 dollars a month less than a breakfast and in return you will have a myriad of recipes that you can prepare for your home. There will be many videos of cooking made by me where I explain step by step each step to create tasty, unique and especially healthy dishes. I just have to thank you and I wish you all a lot of passion in what you love to do",
