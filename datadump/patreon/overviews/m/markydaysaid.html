By NIGHT . . . he is exactly that same person, but with what little free time he has he draws silly pictures and write stupid stories. He is a self taught artist (obviously) who started out with a secondhand graphics tablet and a pirated version of Photoshop. If you help him by making monthly donations the world will not become a better place, but it will be a slightly weirder and more perverse one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy \u003c/strong\u003esupport him?\u003cbr\u003e\nGreat question, especially with all the starving, homeless, uneducated children in the world. Frankly, Markydaysaid likes drawing and spends some of that time drawing silly pornographic pictures which are the only things that got him any sort of following online. If you like seeing these things, even a dollar a week helps him take less hours at his job so he can spend more of it at home, eating ramen and cheap fruit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat \u003c/strong\u003eyou get?\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom most pitiful pauper to most prestigious prince, I want every rank of nobility in my kingdom to feel included in my \"art\" and life. My sketches, my comics, my doodles all revolve around this site. The soul is willing, that graphics tablet is plugged in, and only time constrains me. Time . . . yes time . . \u00a0. the folly of all men. If you are at least a Duke ($20 per month) you can ask for simple sketches one a month. If you\u0027re an Prince ($100) you get something a bit meatier. If you\u0027re the Fool ($300) than I\u0027ll try my best to keep up with your every request, usually about 3 a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHINGS THAT I HATE DRAWING!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are not hard-passes, these are just the things I don\u0027t enjoy drawing, and if they relate to what you want, we\u0027d both be better off with you going somewhere else to get them. \u003cstrong\u003eFuta\u003c/strong\u003e, I just don\u0027t like drawing it, and once I\u0027ve drawn it I won\u0027t want to draw it again for a while. \u003cstrong\u003eScat and gross stuff\u003c/strong\u003e. Just no. \u003cstrong\u003eOrnately detailed outfits, armor, or anything\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m here to draw boobs and dicks, so fuck off with your particulars. \u003cstrong\u003eMeaningless crossovers\u003c/strong\u003e. Some people really want to see multiple incarnations of Princess Zelda doing stuff, but I don\u0027t want to draw it. \u003cstrong\u003eSafe-for-Work\u003c/strong\u003e stuff. Fuck off. What are you even dong here?\u003cstrong\u003e Real people, alive or dead\u003c/strong\u003e. Noooooooope.\u003cbr\u003e"
