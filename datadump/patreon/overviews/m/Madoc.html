As many of you \nare aware, I have enjoyed creating (slightly to explicitly) erotic \"art\"\n for many a year now, with an emphasis on characters from (less or more obscure anime, cartoons and Franco-Belgian comics from the 70s, 80s and 90s. Those have always been created for my own enjoyment and for those of you\n who have followed me on diverse sites and forums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been on Patreon for over two years now, and over that time you guys have given me more financial and moral support than I dared hope for, to the point that, for the first time, I\u0027m actually setting goals. Goals which are still unattainable at the moment, but they provide me with an ideal to strife for. I thank you for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have enjoyed my work over \nthe years, my simple request remains: Brother/Sister, can you \nspare a dime? Each contribution you make increases my output marginally.\n Small increments in the end will lead to something bigger. And if you \nare unable or feel uninclined to support me at this time, no hard \nfeelings. Continue to enjoy my art as you\u0027ve done before, and please \noffer me the occassional kind comment. Because in the end, those are my \nbiggest motivation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: Also, the only thing exclusive to this Patreon page are the monthly reward pictures. \u003cstrong\u003eAll other pictures are freely available on open forums and galleries. I do not intend to create a paysite for my entire back catalogue.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
