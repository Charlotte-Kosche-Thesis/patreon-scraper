    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to thank you for getting to this point and taking the time to read what I have to say! For years now, I have done my best to return the favor and give back to the Jeep community that had once so openly taken me in. I spend every bit of free time that I have not only creating new content, but searching forums, Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms for ways I can contribute, assist, and share. As a mechanical engineering major at Clarkson University, I also look to create and work with companies to bring new life and parts to Jeep platforms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m beyond excited to see where My Jeep Story will take viewers like yourself and myself in the future. As mentioned, I am a student and accumulating debt from loans makes it hard to invest my time and money into future projects, but it won\u0027t stop me! Both earning a degree in a demanding field of study and creating content worth not only my time to create, but the time to enjoy by viewers takes time and I\u0027m willing to work late nights and early mornings to do it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this page for those who are just as excited to see Jeep platforms and communities grow as I am. I\u0027m looking for people who also get excited when a Jeep wave is returned, people who need to stop and look back at what they built after parking, and those who just in general feel some type of way whenever the greatest four letter word is mentioned. By gaining access to this community, you\u0027ll be a part of the productions; the production of videos, cinematic films, but also the production of new and revolutionary parts that I plan to fill in gaps that larger manufactures just won\u0027t. I work hand in hand with companies that stand behind their work and that I personally know and trust. As a middle man, I will be involved in research and development, but also hear the community and your needs translating that information straight to the company.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you want to be a part of this exclusive slice of My Jeep Story and joint the team, I\u0027d love to have ya and I promise 100% of money earned will be put back into the channel. If not, that\u0027s more than fine too. Don\u0027t be afraid to say hello, ask for help, or reach out in any other way anywhere else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you on the trails,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Casey\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
