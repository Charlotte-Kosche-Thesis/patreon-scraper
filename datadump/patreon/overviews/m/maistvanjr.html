My poetry, fiction, and essays have appeared in close to 150 journals\nand magazines. It is time for me to start pitching book ideas to publishers.\nSeveral full-length collections, both poetry and prose, are in the works. A few\nare complete, with forewords by established authors. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlthough I have earned numerous accolades for my work, teaching\nand writing do not pay well. As an underpaid single-father with underclass\norigins, any monetary support will help me continue to reach my survival goals (buying food, paying to keep the lights on, buying gas), my creative goals (writing\ndaily, submitting regularly, publishing collections), and my teaching goals\n(teaching fewer classes in order to be more available to my students, improving\nmy curriculum, attending teaching seminars). Other support is appreciated as\nwell: critical feedback, encouragement, or just sharing my work. But, for real\u2014the precarious adjunct life is full of degradation: \u003ca href=\"http://ow.ly/YWEB30fJlmF.\"\u003ehttp://ow.ly/YWEB30fJlmF\u003c/a\u003e; http://ow.ly/XFUN30gAWuq.\u00a0Money\u2014money is the best way to keep me from working truck stop glory holes and the like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPlease note that in addition to the more classical scenarios of\npatronage-for-favors (me tutoring your budding Alexander the Great or me taking\ngood care of a spouse under your watchful eye), I offer copyediting and\nproofreading services for academic and creative writers. My main goal is to clarify\nyour ideas and arguments while preserving the authenticity of your voice. However, I\ncan also point you to places for publication as well as to relevant experts.\nAlthough philosophy and poetry are my specialties, I have collaborated with\nauthors in a variety of domains (sociology, physics, law, economics, memoir, fantasy)\nand on a variety of projects (articles, reviews, books, bibliographies, indexes, grants, proposals,\nperformance pieces).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour patronage is appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my Academia page for links to published\nwork: \u003ca href=\"https://txstate.academia.edu/MichaelIstvanJr\"\u003ehttps://txstate.academia.edu/MichaelIstvanJr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCheck out my Poets\u0026amp;Writers page for biographical info: \u003ca href=\"https://www.pw.org/content/m_a_istvan_jr_phd\"\u003ehttps://www.pw.org/content/m_a_istvan_jr_phd\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCheck out my Twitter page for daily micro-poetry (of the sort that you see at the top of this page): \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/maistvanjr\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/maistvanjr\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAlso check out these fun articles that highlight the degradation involved in the precarious life of an adjunct:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ow.ly/YWEB30fJlmF\"\u003ehttp://ow.ly/YWEB30fJlmF\u003c/a\u003e;\u00a0http://ow.ly/XFUN30gAWuq\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWondering about my video?--I am a skratch musician also.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "M. A. ISTVAN JR., PhD worked as a janitor at his high school during high school. Interventions from scarved liberals with gluten allergies sent him on a trajectory that, despite failed attempts to snuff out his pimp-drag step and his New York Ebonics, culminated in his earning a PhD. But with the bleak academic job-market, together with a family too ravaged by illiteracy and homelessness to provide any sort of safety net, it looks like he might come full circle. There are signs that he is well on his way. While he has not yet gone back to McDonald\u2019s dumpsters, he steals whatever he can from supermarkets and more and more of his daily calories are coming from sugar packets and those mini jelly trays.",
