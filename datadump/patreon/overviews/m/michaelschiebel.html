    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI entered the computer security profession after a 12 year military career.  As anyone who\u0027s served knows, duty and service to others is deeply instilled into what we do.  Over my career I\u2019ve seen first hand the pain and suffering when people\u0027s digital lives are impacted by hacking and computer criminals, and I made it my calling to help improve our digital lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2007 I started mentoring others in the security profession and volunteering my time at community events. I didn\u2019t think this would grow into a passion that I now care so much about, but it did. I knew if we were to improve all our digital lives, the tools and techniques needed to be made available to all - not just those with large budgets for $7500 annual training and security software with $1 million licensing costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat used to be a few hours every year volunteering has now grown into a passion that I want to devote more time and effort doing. What I\u2019m looking to do is economically, well, stupid. I\u2019ve grown beyond using up my limited vacation time, nights, and weekends to a point where I need to change how I live and work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream would be to do this full time. That is what this Patreon is for. By supporting me here you are not only making my career my passion, you actually help us all improve our digital lives by making these tools and techniques available to all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I\u2019m doing and consider buying a stranger over the internet the equivalent of a coffee, I would very much appreciate it. If 10% of people in the security industry would do this, I could focus on volunteering full time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is about supporting causes you believe in. The more you support, the more I\u2019m able to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I will do with your money: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Currently I have two jobs: Ikoloki - where I am developing the equivalent of a $10 million dollar 24/7 security operations center and making the service available for a low monthly fee a family can afford - and my volunteer work. By supporting me on Patreon you give me the opportunity to offer the same knowledge on a less consulting basis and instead offer the material for free instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo put simply, your support allows me to focus less on commercial focused activities to feed my family and more focused on providing a service affordable to all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I can invest more time in creating freely available educational materials that large consulting companies charge 5 and 6 figures on a \u201cconsulting basis\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I can take some time off to work on other educational projects. For example, attending and speaking at more conferences each year that I can\u2019t currently afford to volunteer at. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for all your support! I appreciate it more than you can imagine and it really helps out!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
