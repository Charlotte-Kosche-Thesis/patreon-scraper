I\u0027m a cosplayer born and raised in the bay of California. I love video games and have loved them throughout my whole entire existence. The moment I was able to get my hands on a keyboard and mouse I was already playing World of Warcraft every minute of the day with my brothers. Now I\u0027m currently a hardcore League of Legends gamer (xD) who plays almost every day in hopes of being challenger lmfao. I am indeed still a student \u0026amp; also a dancer, therefore, leaving me barely any time to do what I love. I picked up cosplaying when I was about 12 or 13 years old when I couldn\u0027t find costumes at Party City for the Percy Jackson characters or Lola Bunny. My entire life was influenced heavily by Superheroes, Comics, and all things Disney, thus making all my cosplays and future cosplays related to those things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a kid I\u0027ve always been fond of the arts, never really caring about regular school subjects like math and English. Whenever there were art projects involved though, everything would be hand-made. From actually sewing and binding my own personal yearbook in 7th grade to molding historic Roman aqueducts out of clay, I\u0027ve always considered myself to be a decent crafter. And now through cosplay, I\u0027m able to actually harness those skills and better them through the intricate cosplays.\u00a0Cosplay has really changed me as a person. I\u0027ve always been shy and scared of social interaction, and I still do hate talking to guests while working, but now cosplay has basically made me break out of that shell and has allowed me to interact easily with other people that have the same interests.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lvM2nbN.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating this Patreon page was a way for me to pursue cosplaying for a longer period. Cosplaying is an expensive hobby and surely everyone knows that. Materials and time and effort all combined could cost up to $200-$1000. My Spiderwoman costume was $300 and took me about 3 weeks to make and prepare, PLUS on top of all of that was the stress, the time, and the constant yearning to give up because of the feeling that I wasn\u0027t getting anywhere. When I finished though, I surely did not imagine all of the positive feedback I had received from strangers across the internet. Therefore, this Patreon isn\u0027t just a benefit to me but also to all of you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplaying is my hobby and with that being said, I still need to focus on school, food, and all of the other life necessities. Being as expensive as it is to live in California, that means that I\u0027m not able to push out as many cosplays as I\u0027d like due to the fact that all the money I earn from my job goes to food, school supplies (calculators are really expensive ngl), Disney trips (a Princess gotta go back home sometimes man) and well the list could go on. Currently, my limit is about 1 or 2 high-quality cosplays a YEAR (excluding things like Mary Jane or stuff you can just get clothes from your closet and call that cosplay). With the help I can receive from you guys on Patreon, I would be able to turn that into a cosplay a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DZLaKDK.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging, you\u0027ll be granted rewards ranging from access to all my cosplays to gift bundles that include prints and other goodies. Not only that, but you will also be helpinh non-Patrons by allowing me to create more cosplays for others to see. Every pledge counts whether it\u0027d be $1 or $50. You will get the reward and thanks you deserve for helping me grow as a cosplayer(: \u2665\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIMPORTANT: \u003cem\u003eRewards obtained through messages such as my Snapchat or IGNs or digital downloads \u0026amp; posts will occur after I have received payment of your pledge solely because it has happened many times to me that people would pledge just to get the benefit or update on my content and then cancel their pledge right away without being charged for it. Also, prints and gift bundles or anything phsyical won\u0027t be sent until the end of the month or again until I have received the payment. I trust that you won\u0027t share and distribute any content or things I give to YOU. It would be unfair to both other patrons as well as to me. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you for your support x\u00a0Molizabeth\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEXTRA FUN FACTS ABOUT ME!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e- I am Cambodian and Chinese (mainly)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- I speak more German than I do any of those above languages lol\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- I am currently Platinum 4 on League of Legends (ADC/Jungle main)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- It\u0027s my dream to work at Disneyland as a face-character\u003cbr\u003e- I have 5 brothers and 4 sisters and a Siberian husky named Luna and a pupper named after Rocket from GotG\u003cbr\u003e- My birthday is January 11th.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- I LOVE PHYSICS even though I barely passed AP Physics with a C\u003cbr\u003e- My favorite Disney Princess is Aurora/Briar Rose\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- I love DC more than Marvel because of Nightwing and Zatanna\u003cbr\u003e- I love Star Wars hence the name Molibe Amidala.
