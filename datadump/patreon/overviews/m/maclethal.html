For almost 20 years now, I\u0027ve made creative rap music and video content, and released it without the help of a record label. Over the past few years, I\u0027ve began peaking in terms of people who know I am, and have decided that now is time to strike with my best, most creative, and most finely produced content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I created this page:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have a lot of content I want to share with you (behind the scenes footages, vlogs, podcasts, exclusive music, daily writings about how to optimizing your independent music career, lessons in creativity etc.) and think this is an amazing way for you to have direct access to it all. All I ask in return, is a small donation to help with production costs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I will be doing with your donation:\u003c/strong\u003e 100% of the money generated through your donations will be spent on creating even better content, (hiring designers for constantly brand new merchandise, getting new podcast equipment for the podcast, paying beat makers like Danny Grooves, Seven and Tha Xtraordinair$ for their top notch production so my videos and songs have incredible beats, getting new Sony A7s-II cameras, new lights, hiring an animator eventually etc.). This money will not be spent on personal \u003cbr\u003e",
