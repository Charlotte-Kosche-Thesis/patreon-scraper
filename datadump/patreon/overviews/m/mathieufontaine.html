I am a professional miniature painter based in the province of Qu\u00e9bec in Canada.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been painting miniatures since my teenage years. This hobby rapidly became a passion which propelled me in the fascinating world of fine arts. Always avid to learn more, I have attended several classes in my early years, have perused the art galleries in the path of my traveling, filled my library with art books from the classical painters to comic book artists passing by street art. Art has taken a permanent place in my life because of miniature painting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have attended competitions across North America and Europe winning several Golden Demons and other prestigious awards.This deep rooted passion which led me to success always pushed me to share my knowledge. I have given my Masterclass for several years, across the globe. I have taught countless classes and given demonstrations in various conventions and events. This rich experience molded my teaching by being able to adapt its content to a format that works and has been proven.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566253f6e4b0d8f09483c8be/566261aae4b055b21a308e7e/566261c4e4b055b21a308f33/1449288134728/juggernaut+1000+01.jpg?format=500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last 4 years, I have had the chance of working as a full-time miniature painter. My passion became my full-time job. Having learned a great deal from others in my formative years, I feel a strong duty to give back in the same way. Unfortunately, with the budgetary realities of making ends meet, it is not always easy to find spare time to dedicate to tutorials. Here comes Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis platform offers the best of both worlds. For a minimal fee, you obtain on a regular basis, an ever expanding base of knowledge. On the other hand, I receive a fair compensation allowing me to take the proper time to give well explained and detailed information to make you a better painter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour reward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will gain access to exclusive WIP pictures. You will receive detailed information on color choice and the thought process which brought me to that stage. Step-by-Step and/or tutorial will be regularly added.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor higher pledges, and in limited numbers, private mentoring are available. So whether you want to see me paint a specific subject live, need constructive criticism on your model or want me to comment your technique, time will be dedicated to you on a monthly basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566253f6e4b0d8f09483c8be/56625836e4b00229eb332460/5662586de4b0d8f09483eb60/1449285744360/Saint+George+1000+01.jpg?format=500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFigurines only?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFigurines and bust are my main area of work so they will get the bulk of the content. But vehicles, dioramas and gunpla will also receive their fair share of attention. Some content will also be of \"tabletop\" quality because sometimes, we just want a few tips on how to make the models on our gaming tables pop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566253f6e4b0d8f09483c8be/5803c686ff7c5021efd8dec7/5803c6aef5e231804132af30/1476642480408/warlord+duo+1500.jpg?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, whether you will be pledging or not, I want to take a few seconds to thank all of you. Your constant support of my work is what inspires me on a daily basis. I am simply happy to be finally able to give back in a proper way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn these words, let\u0027s keep painting together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
