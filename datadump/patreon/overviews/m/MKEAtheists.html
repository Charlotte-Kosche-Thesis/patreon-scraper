    "summary": "Hi, my name is Lorence Yufa and I am the founder of the Milwaukee Atheists. We try to give the atheist and skeptic community a new set of tools that are seldom used in discussions with theists. We concentrate primarily on in depth looks at the history of the bible and religion in general. We have many series and videos on comparative mythology and textual history. We also feature videos on esoteric topics that we find interesting in studies of religion.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeries:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eForged Fiction- \u003c/strong\u003eThis video series is a book by book analysis of the texts of the New Testament. We discuss the authors of each of these books, why they wrote them, and when they wrote them. How did they construct their narrative and what is the textual history they won\u0027t tell you in sunday school. Out of the 13 canonical letters attributed to Paul, 6 of them were written by somebody else just claiming to be him. Textual criticism is a fascinating field and we here at Milwaukee Atheists believe the best way to disprove the bible is by simply studying it. This is a series you won\u0027t want to miss!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArmchair Philosophy- \u003c/strong\u003eThis series is for those of you that want a quick introduction to the world of philosophy. Our first episode showed the pros and cons of philosophy and science, and discussed the difference. We have covered topics like Daoism and solipsism. This series is growing and gets you thinking. If you want to learn the basics on philosophical ideas, this series is for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAtheist Sunday School-\u003c/strong\u003e Many have set forth to read the whole bible within their time on YouTube. But this task is seldom accomplished. Atheist Sunday School is an after Sunday school special which will definitely get to the end of the book. There has been a lot of biblical scholarship throughout the ages and we set out to make sure you understand the text as well as the scholars do. We will go from Genesis to Revelation and give you a verse by verse commentary. We read the bible so you don\u0027t have too! Join us every Sunday at 1PM CST for our live episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterviews-\u003c/strong\u003e This isn\u0027t really a series, but once in a while, we have interviews with prominent people in the secular community. We have had people like Richard Carrier, Aron Ra, David Fitzgerald, and atheist youtuber, Logicked. These episodes are for those that like to learn more about the lives and ideas of scholars and activists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn conclusion, thank you for visiting our Patreon and consider donating if you like what we\u0027re doing and want us to keep doing it. Any contribution is much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
