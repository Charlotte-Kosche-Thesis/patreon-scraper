    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m Matt, and welcome to our Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the ukulele. The only thing I enjoy more than playing it, is helping other people learn to play things they thought they never could.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since my gameboy ran out of batteries on my grandpa\u2019s boat, I\u2019ve been totally obsessed with the ukulele. It is small enough to carry anywhere, but can play anything with the right mindset and approach! The instrument didn\u2019t make sense to me at first, and that was the appeal. It was a challenge to overcome \u2013 each and every technique, chord, and song. When I was in college, I studied music and I brought my ukulele to every class I had with the intent of cracking the code and learning how it all worked. The internet also proved to be an incredible resource with sites such as Ukulele Underground being my best teachers! The \u2018aha\u2019 moments were my absolute favorite part of learning. I started as a performer, but I was never very comfortable as one. Playing in front of people was nerve-wracking! Teaching on the other hand, is something I\u2019m absolutely passionate for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2010, I\u2019ve been teaching the ukulele online through programs such as Skype and it has been the best job and career I could have ever hoped for. Helping people break through challenges and find those \u2018aha\u2019 moments, just like I did when I was learning, is what I live for! Building lesson plans for each person has taught me so much about people and that everyone learns in their own unique way. The best part about one-on-one lessons is adapting to each individual\u2019s way of learning. I\u2019m fortunate enough to have taught thousands of lessons and even been featured in the NY Times for my online teaching.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m incredibly excited about this Patreon page. I\u0027ll be creating completely free lesson videos each week, and your contribution will allow me to continue creating high quality content. Each month I\u0027ll create six new videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- Monthly Video Releases -\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e4x Webcam Sessions\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLive Q\u0026amp;A\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSong Lesson\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope this page can grow and evolve based on the input of the Patrons.
