    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eWelcome to my Patreon! My name is Kevin Rohan and I will be teaching you how to paint your miniatures, whether you\u0027re doing a complete paint job on a fresh miniature or if you\u0027re just adding a little character to an existing miniature\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhat kind of miniatures do you paint?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eRight now, I am painting miniatures for Warhammer 40,000 and repainting my ships for the X-wing Miniatures game. I also like to tinker and customize my minis as much as I can get away with and still have them be game-functional. However, I am open to anything, and as the Patreon page grows, I\u0027ll be more than happy to do fan requests! See the support levels and the pledge plan for more details!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eCan we see these minis? Are you actually \u003cem\u003egood\u003c/em\u003e at this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eAs the account here matures, there will be public pictures posted, as well as pictures in the Miniature Effects Facebook Page and our Instagram (the links are up above to your left). You will see completed minis, works in progress, and other still shots. As for me being good? That seems like a loaded question. If I say that I am, it sounds like I\u0027m bragging, doesn\u0027t it? But if I say that I\u0027m new to all of this, then it\u0027s false humility, and then what\u0027s the point of supporting someone who\u0027s bad and will keep being bad?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am good at this (Bragging). Other people tell me I\u0027m good at this (Confident). I still have a long way to go to be the best. (Humility).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s all this then? What\u0027s the point?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point here is to create a channel for people that want to learn how to paint. You\u0027ll watch me grow my talents, watch how I do things, get to ask questions and make suggestions, and we can all get better together. That\u0027s what this is: interactive painting instructions that will cover a large number of miniatures, techniques, and other information pertaining to miniatures in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s in it for me? I give you money every month for...what...specifically?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, probably because you\u0027re an awesome person, and because you want me to be able to grow as an artist and provide awesome content to supporters and non-supporters. It\u0027s like a community sponsored painting class, just with fewer happy little trees. Supporters will get custom content, they will get interaction with me, and they will get all the information that I have and learn as we go. You\u0027ll see me get better at video production, you\u0027ll see me share things about the minis we work with. You\u0027ll learn how to do what I do and maybe even how to do it better. The money you give goes to providing materials, gear, and tools to create these videos, plus it helps me as well. Help me, help you...and help a ton of other people as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, fine. I\u0027m still reading, so I\u0027m still interested. How can I help you, Kevin?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, all the ways you can help me are over to the right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eAnd this \"Content\" you speak of?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDown below for both public and supporter consumption!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
