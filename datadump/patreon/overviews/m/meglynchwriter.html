    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Meg Lynch, a writer, editor, and artist based right outside of Atlanta, Georgia. Right now, I\u0027m working on my third volume of poetry, a children\u0027s book, and new covers for my poetry books!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy heart beats for artists of all shapes and sizes, and my goal is to become a coach for writers and artists everywhere, as well as create more of my own writing and art. For the past few years, I have been on a journey to reclaim the creativity that was stomped out of me from a young age. The world has told us our art is not valid or good enough, but I know that is not true. I believe all artists have potential; we just don\u0027t always see it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI adore writing in every aspect: fiction, non-fiction, technical writing\u2026 Writing is my passion! As an independently-published writer, I am free to create as I see fit, which is a lot more than people who have to lobby for agents and publishing houses with no promise of a bonus. However, there are other items independent writers have to pay for themselves, such as copyright registration, ISBN numbers for books, cover art, and more. That is all on me to pay for if I want to give you guys quality work, which I want to do more than anything!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLaunching a brick-and-mortar art shop that includes a publishing house and music studio has been another huge dream in my heart, and it is going to be 100% for artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn the shop, I will be exclusively selling artwork by artists located in the Northern Greater Atlanta area, and 10% of our proceeds will be going toward directly benefiting local artists in multiple ways.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn the publishing house, I will be working alongside writers from point A to point Z; I want to help them from the moment the idea is merely a concept in their mind to the unimaginable joy of holding the book in their hands, and then continue forward to create marketing plans and help them share their stories with the world.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn the studio, we will have top-of-the-line equipment artists can utilize for an affordable price; I am not out to make millions of dollars off the suffering of others.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThis shop is going to be revolutionary in several industries, and if you subscribe to this Patreon, you will get to be a part of building this company from the ground up. How cool is that!?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I want to give a huge thank you to everyone who decides to subscribe to my Patreon. Every cent makes a huge difference to me! From one person to another, thank you for helping me achieve my dreams to inspire others to create authentic art with their hearts and imaginations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who chose tiers with rewards offered in my online shop, you can find that \u003ca href=\"https://meglynch203.wixsite.com/meglynchwritershop\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
