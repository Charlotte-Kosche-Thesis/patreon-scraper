I am represented by Nic Knight Management, London.\u003cbr\u003eI started my journey in the Arts as an a Bharathanatyam (Indian classical) dancer, which took me travelling and performing as a soloist extensively across India, China, USA, UK, Bhutan; which also brought in reviews and special features in The Deccan, Indian Express, Alva Review (USA), Your Story, The Dance Bible, Business Central Asia among others;\u00a0as well as a National award in India for exceptional performance. My most recent performances include a show at the UK House of Lords, World travel Market London, and Ashford festival.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e(have a look at \u003ca href=\"http://www.iamanvi.com)\"\u003ewww.iamanvi.com)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the path I gained a BA (Chitrakala Parishat, Bangalore, India) and subsequently an MA in Fine Arts from Chelsea college (London,UK). This passion for visual articulation through paintings and mixed media installations gave me an opportunity to attend numerous artist residencies and exhibit my work at several galleries and Universities at UK and USA including Northwestern Oklahoma State University, Art Students\u2019 League of New York, and INCA (International Network for Culture and Arts) at Somerset, England.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e(My art works - \u003ca href=\"http://www.artbyanvi.wordpress.com)\"\u003ewww.artbyanvi.wordpress.com)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for writing, I\u2019ve been obsessed with the syncopation of words since I can remember, and I have so far published two collections of poetry and experimental narratives (\u2018Snatches of Sunshine\u2019 and Mid Light - the Prologue\u2019 as well as numerous online articles, and read my work at several poetry events in London. My forthcoming book \u2018Unsupervised\u2019 will be out on Amazon worldwide on March 30th, 2018.\u003cbr\u003e(Read my blogs \u003ca href=\"http://www.anviwords.blogspot.com\"\u003ewww.anviwords.blogspot.com\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.saltofmymind.blogspt.com\"\u003ewww.anviwords.blogspot.com\u003c/a\u003e )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up in an artist\u2019s family as the daughter of a veteran theater/film actor - director and a poetess, I had no dearth of opportunities to explore the fields of television and film (in Bangalore, India) and I also acted in several of them as a child artist and a teen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY ARTISTIC VISION\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I continued (and will continue) my journey as a dancer, a painter, an actress and a writer; along the process somewhere, I felt that I needed to synthesize my passions and bring them under one coherent roof.\u00a0And what better medium to bring in the magic of movement, visual, and words together than in film. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd thus my baby \u003cem\u003e\u2018MID LIGHT Productions - Soul Stories\u0027\u003c/em\u003e was born, partly inspired through my research \u00a0Through this company I wish to extend the boundaries of each art form and the possibilities of bringing them together in various narrative styles and idioms. \u003cbr\u003eAnd as the tagline suggests, I want this to be a springboard for stories that strike a global emotional chord - not just showcasing the human condition in its various emotional and psychological states but also the possibilities of their outlet, endurance, articulation, and acceptance. My themes include and expand upon the discussions of philosophical deliberations, visual linguistics, racial/religious landscapes, LGBT experiences, and the seemingly simple but overwhelming concepts of \u0027home\u0027 and the \u0027human body\u0027 - the goal is to achieve a perfect blend of the \u003cem\u003epoetic\u003c/em\u003e and the \u003cem\u003epolitical\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eI am super proud to share that the company has just wrapped up the very first short \u003cem\u003e\u2018Night Wave\u2019\u003c/em\u003e (written and directed by me) with a powerful all women team and I can\u2019t wait to share the trailer with the world.\u003cbr\u003eRight now, the creative process is running at an intoxicating momentum and I need the practical means to keep up with it and do it justice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAND THAT IS WHERE YOU COME IN\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn artistic company needs a strong support to become bigger and better, and you can support me in bringing the best talents together for creating superlative productions. There are several exciting projects just brimming with possibility - theater adaptations into screen formats, choreography and poetry combinations, and full features with exotic, bold characters told exclusively through dance. \u003cbr\u003eI am convinced that art is the most powerful tool one can use to inspire and impact large scale changes in today\u2019s world; and armed with the medium of film I cannot wait to contribute my share.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2018Mid Light\u003c/em\u003e\u2019 seeks your support for the various stages of the film making - right from finding and forming a fabulous permanent team to brainstorming sessions, choreography sessions, commissioning other artists in cases of collaborations to the actual shooting that involves a plethora of cast and crew, and finally - the process of bringing that art out into the world.\u003cbr\u003eYou will not just be supporting my artistic vision but be enhancing the career of several other artists along the way who will come on board for various projects.\u003cbr\u003eI will be lucky to have you by my side in this exhilarating journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo support is too small and I am thankful in advance for every little bit. Even the coffee that your patronage could afford at a creative session might inspire an euphoric idea that could lead to an Oscar; you never know! \ud83d\ude09\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
