I now have a Master of Arts degree in English, but my dream remains the same: I want to tell the stories that endlessly fill my head and keep my imagination in overdrive. I want to entertain others. I want to entertain \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am primarily a writer. Mostly, I create novels, novellas, and short story collections, all currently self-published or free online. I also write academically and do extensive research about werewolves and other monsters, as well as folklore in general. However, I am also an amateur artist working on improving my craft (however, the banner art was drawn by my brother, not me). I host roleplaying campaigns online, create custom LEGO minifigures, write reviews, and make the occasional video game mod, among other things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0972734139/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;camp=1789\u0026amp;creative=9325\u0026amp;creativeASIN=0972734139\u0026amp;linkCode=as2\u0026amp;tag=saberscorpios-20\u0026amp;linkId=F37ADUPGZ7VSTLWM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://maverickwerewolf.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/knightfall_extrasmall.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m Here\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am hoping to find a supportive audience for my creations and to reach a point at which I can make my \nliving off my creative work, or at least make enough to justify the time I would like to dedicate to it. My situation and job as of late has left me with very little time and less inspiration, and I have fallen far behind in my personal goals and have lost a sense of accomplishment. If nothing changes, I fear I will lose myself and remain trapped in a void, unable to pursue my personal creative works. I do not want to sacrifice my happiness and personal accomplishment again. It\u0027s a tall order.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://maverickwerewolf.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lye_kye.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am planning to use this Patreon as, first and foremost, a way to connect with (and reward) my supporters. I would love to have a platform through which I can directly communicate with those interested in my work. I\u0027ll post exclusive previews of my upcoming projects and discuss writing tips, struggles, my research, and more. Every week, I will also post whatever artwork I have created, even if it is yet unfinished. In the future, I hope to do livestreams to show how I color my artwork and perhaps even stream some video games while also talking to my supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping to be able to expand the rewards of almost every tier very soon as I get my feet wet with Patreon and figure out what people might like to receive from me.
