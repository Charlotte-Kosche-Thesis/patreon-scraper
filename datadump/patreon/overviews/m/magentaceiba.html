    "summary": "Hi! My name is Magenta Ceiba. I\u0027m an artist, musician and healer who has dedicated my life to helping humanity find a balanced, equitable way of living on this planet. I use my skills to illustrate inspiring futures and document current realities. I also help people share resources where they have common goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work as the executive director of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bloomnetwork.org\"\u003e Bloom Network\u003c/a\u003e , an international social network and incubator for regenerative culture. \"Regenerative\" generally means when you\u0027re living in a way that fertilizes the grounds for more life. It involves closing the loop on our production cycles so we don\u0027t create waste or damage ecosystems. It involves creating equitable social and economic systems that are healthy for people and planet. Examples of regenerative culture include: \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u00a0worker-owned cooperatives\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u0026gt;\u0026gt; community forestry (where instead of clear-cutting forest to graze cattle, people replenish forest habitats and earn money from crops that sustainably grow there)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u0026gt;\u0026gt; restorative justice (instead of putting people in jail, the criminal and affected parties go through a mediation process to decide what reparations need to be made)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get the idea. Bloom is still bootstrapping, and at the moment I receive no income from it. Your support on Patreon helps me continue to set up Bloom\u0027s IRL and online platform for everyone\u0027s benefit. Your support also helps me to continue coordinating capacity building workshops such as\u003ca href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/impact-frameworks-for-community-resilience-organizations-tickets-44351000035\"\u003e\u00a0this one\u003c/a\u003e I put together for another community resilience network, to give organization leaders frameworks for maximizing their impact and fundraising efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first and second goals with this Patreon are to create media pieces about regenerative solutions I\u0027ve come across, featuring people and projects so more people can learn about the inspiring actions that are happening right now that they can participate in to make their lives and communities healthier. I hope that these media pieces will also help to network existing projects together so they can share resources and partner with each other. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn one sense regenerative initiatives are already massively scaled and interconnected, it\u0027s just invisible unless you\u0027re already tapped into it. There often tend to be subculture pockets where people are only circulating their wisdom in a small niche audience or political affiliate group, whereas in aggregate it\u0027s a huge ecosystem that has more solidarity than most people realize.\u00a0 I believe that people realizing how much solidarity there is across the planet for this will help us collectively shift out of things like extreme inequality and ecosystem degradation.\u00a0There are literally millions, if not billions of people worldwide working on these sorts of initiatives, and I work to help them be more findable and well-resourced, because they\u0027re awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of my motivation and strategy for the media side of my work, is related to the fact that the business model of mainstream media continues to be driven by an investment model that maximizes shareholder profit and hence has an inherent interest in unequal distribution of resources, and keeping people trapped in closed cycles of consumerism. Because of the way media technology has been developed based in psychology, more violence equals more ratings, which equals more money. This was developed as and is used as a political weapon, and it\u0027s being gamed with the advent of social media on monopoly-ish platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBloom Network is a hybrid IRL and online social network that is designed to help people create decentralized, collaborative value chains and support each other in healing our relationships with each other and the natural world. I designed its business model and to some extent its technological backend. This year is our first operational year and we will be slowly activating our core programs and media channels. I will continue to help see it through by creating and curating media, and producing in-person events to bring people together across the different facets of regenerative culture. We are producing a conference in San Francisco in September, please do come :).\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.bloomnetwork.org/summit.html\"\u003e http://www.bloomnetwork.org/summit.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBloom has an innovative decentralized governance model that we\u0027re putting into action this year, where the local chapters and stakeholders participating in and affected by the network make the decisions about where organizational resources are directed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work on all this has been guided by my experiences with psychedelics, especially mushrooms and Ayahuasca.\u00a0I grew up on a farm in Montana, largely without TV, radio or newspapers, and before the internet, and the plants have been guiding me to use that perspective to help create an alternative distribution network that can share the kinds of practices and tools that will help humanity make it through this risky time of systems transition and danger of ecological collapse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of that medicine journey is that I ended up living nearly entirely on gift economy from 2011-2015. Sharing that experience is my 3rd goal with this Patreon, when I reach $600/mo in patron support.\u00a0My intention during that time was \"to find right livelihood for myself and my Earth family.\" My plant medicine journeys were teaching me about the imbalanced state of Earth\u0027s ecosystems, as well as the types of trauma and fears that people have around their survival being tied to money. I had many difficult trips of being shown the influence of media on people\u0027s behavior, and how the technology that has developed to distribute media reinforces a power dynamic based on suffering and consumerism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn regular life during this time,\u00a0I was watching many brilliant, talented activist artist friends working jobs that made them sad, when if they were encouraged to do exactly what they\u0027re good at and what feeds their soul, the world would be a very different place. I couldn\u0027t stand seeing my friends, people I cared about, living this way, nor the social inequalities and environmental degradation of the dominant global economic paradigm. During my walkabout, stepping into what my heart was crying out for,\u00a0I was gifted housing, tools to do my work, beautiful musical instruments, and a wealth of deep experiences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gift economy adventure continues today, with many inspiring anecdotes to share. The vlog will feature guest appearances by other women who give to their communities in inspiring ways. The Gift Economy Vlog is\u00a0intended to give people courage, tools and inspiration to live their dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m now actualizing the business model for Bloom along with a global network of creative activists and healers working in service to civil society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile part of my role with Bloom is to fundraise for the organization, I realize I have a community of incredible people who follow my work and believe in me as a creative leader. I want to give folks an opportunity to contribute directly to the specific pieces I want to create. (If you would like to learn more about Bloom Network or contribute to the global collective there, visit our website at \u003ca href=\"http://bloomnetwork.org/\"\u003ehttp://bloomnetwork.org\u003c/a\u003e ).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this, and I look forward to creating nourishing, inspiring events and media pieces to share with you.\u003cbr\u003e"

The drawings will comprise a narrative showing how people live, teach their kids, tend to land and innovate. I have been researching these practices for the past 7 years down to nitty gritty details like what kinds of plants can be used to dye fabrics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs part of this, I will resume populating my \"Permaculture Village\" tumblr: \u003ca href=\"http://permaculturevillage.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehttp://permaculturevillage.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e. The visionary art tumblr I curate, Art \u0026amp; Spirituality, currently has about 100,000 followers. I think I can scale up the permaculture tumblr quickly so it can be an outreach tool for advocating for permaculture and regenerative agriculture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have 4 different villages in mind, each of which has a different focus. For example, one is a forest ecosystem, and one is in a desert and features more \"spacey\" design elements and a more electronic-oriented culture. One will also be closer to today\u0027s urban centers, and suggest ways a micro village could be built out within a modern city but offer similar benefits as today\u0027s ecovillages demonstrate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will release at least one finished section of drawing per month, along with sketches, concept work,\u00a0and storytelling elements.\u003cbr\u003e",
