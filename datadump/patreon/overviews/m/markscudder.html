    "summary": "I am an independent songwriter and multi-instrumentalist living in rural upstate New York.\u00a0I took a few years off recently after losing my mom to ovarian cancer, because it was the right thing to do for my family, especially my dad, who is now alone except for me and my wife. I\u0027d like to take this opportunity to announce that I am back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on an all-acoustic re-imagining of my 2012 album \u003cem\u003eThe Solution is the Problem\u003c/em\u003e called \u003cem\u003ereSolution\u003c/em\u003e. I love big, powerful arrangements, but I also love the acoustic guitar. Most of these songs were originally written on acoustic guitar, and I want to pay tribute to their roots by exploring them in that context.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll parts are performed and recorded by me in my home studio. For feedback and support, I live-stream recording sessions to friends and fans. As recordings for each song are completed, I make a basic mix of them and share them with footage from the live streams on YouTube. A sort of music video, if you will, that you can share with your friends to help explain what I\u0027m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, acoustic guitars are being recorded. To help friends and fans watching the live streams understand what I\u0027m doing, and for my own reference, I first record a temporary \"scratch\" vocal track, and then record acoustic guitars to that track. When all acoustic guitars for all songs have been recorded, I will record vocals for real and throw away those scratch tracks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have the \"right\" friends in the \"right\" places. I don\u0027t have any industry contacts (and I\u0027m not sure I want any, either). I don\u0027t have a mentor. I live in an artistically-depressed area where the few other local musicians have full-time jobs, families, their own projects, conflicting musical interests, or in some cases, tragically enormous egos. I create all the parts for everything I do. I film and re-assemble the recording sessions with additional angles so you can see what I do and how I do it. This is a slow, time-intensive process. I don\u0027t write and record a brand new song every week, or try to fool you with other sorts of novelties. Nor are the obstacles or setbacks amplified for a reality-TV effect. This is all real, all the music is written from scratch, and refined over time. I will always be honest and realistic with you. Even if I dedicate all my free time to it, there are limitations to what one person can do, so\u00a0any project on which I embark will be \"done when it\u0027s done.\" It\u0027s irresponsible of me to promise anything more until it pays the bills. All of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that\u0027s all okay with you. If it is, I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting what I do. I have a track record of polished, professional-quality work. I have a lot of experience working in isolation and I don\u0027t get into situations where I am physically unable to finish projects because I can\u0027t do something. In fact, most of my production experience comes from being the person others come to when \u003cem\u003ethey\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0were physically unable to do everything by themselves. When I apply that knowledge to my own work, I feel I can accomplish anything, given the time and the resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t need $15,000 worth of microphones. I don\u0027t need $600/hour studio time. I don\u0027t need a Hollywood film crew. All I need is the artistic and financial freedom to keep the equipment I have functioning, upgrade the occasional piece of gear, weather the occasional hardware failure, and keep the lights on. In return I will keep working, writing, recording, innovating, and giving all of us something the world sorely needs more of - real, original, emotional, excellent music that provides a richer, more fulfilling experience than the cookie-cutter (or, more accurately these days, place-and-bake) stuff that\u0027s coming out of the industry. I\u0027m also new to crowdfunding, being sort of a stubborn individualist who doesn\u0027t like to admit he needs help, so I look to you for suggestions of what I can do to reward those of you who support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn today\u0027s media, your support is the only thing that keeps people like me going. The cream doesn\u0027t rise to the top by itself anymore. Please consider helping me show the world there\u0027s a better way.\u003cbr\u003e"
