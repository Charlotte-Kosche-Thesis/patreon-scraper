Y\u0027all are my tribe!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s exactly why I\u0027ve started my very first Patreon account: I want to connect with you on a deeper level and give you the chance to be a part of this journey I\u0027m on. You guys have supported me in funding over 2 albums, putting on nationwide tours, and sharing my music alongside major acts like Snoop Dogg, the Gospel Gangstaz and Melanie. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI couldn\u0027t have made it this far without you and so\u00a0I have been looking for a way to connect even deeper with my you, my tribe. Recently, it hit me -- the answer is PATREON!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is your inside connection to (and participation with) me, my music, and all that\u0027s happening on this journey I\u0027m on. When you become my Patron, you\u0027ll be helping me make things happen on the frontlines by funding the music I\u0027m producing, the marketing it takes to reach people, videos and the shows I\u0027m often traveling to. This is exactly what I believe God has called me to do: reach people of all walks of life right where they are with His message of love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is so much bigger than just me and music. It\u0027s about changing the lives of others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether I\u0027m playing a venue with my band, making another YouTube video, doing a solo show at a coffee shop or leading a worship session somewhere: my heart is to reach out to those who need a reminder that they are loved and made with a purpose.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want YOU to be a part of this with me.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me uplift and inspire people. Help me change the lives of many. For your partnership and support, I\u0027m giving YOU some pretty cool rewards. Check them out on the right side of this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether it\u0027s $1 or $1 million dollars, IT ALL COUNTS.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me. Let\u0027s change lives together. Will you become my patron?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

My name is Martay.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m 28 years old, a true California-girl and have always dreamt of creating music and media that will change the lives of others. You know, music and videos that will provoke people to follow their dreams, pursue their passions and find true LOVE right where they are. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a creator for over 10 years now and am just getting started. In fact, I have ideas floating out of my brain at what seems to be 100 miles-per-hour a minute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, one thing keeps me from producing many of them: the resources and financial means. Money is usually TIGHT when you\u0027re an independent artist without a label or consistent financial support system.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027m taking it upon myself to put myself out there and start building one!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout a label. Without a million followers. Just with you and me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to be afraid to ask people to join me on my creative and inspiration-filled journey, but the more I create my songs, music videos and TayTalks (my video \u0026amp; written blogs that talk about everyday subjects most people wouldn\u0027t touch with a 40 foot pole), I realize that this journey I\u0027m on is not just made for me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s made for YOU too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether, we can truly change the lives of others and help our world, through inspiration, media, music and LOVE, become a better place! One person and set of eyes/ears at a time!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, will you join me on my journey?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at all of the collaboration options I have listed, and then choose the one that\u0027s best for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcited to do this together!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exO - Martay\u003cbr\u003e",
