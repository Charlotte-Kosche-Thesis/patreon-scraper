    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we even here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s a common enough question. Mike Makes Stuff is on Patreon because there are more projects, more passion and more to do than ever before. I want to share that with the people who have supported me so far, and I want to share even more about the process and struggles that go into it with those who are interested. I have more than half a dozen projects in development, and dozens more in concept waiting to see the light of day. If you like what I\u0027ve done, and you want to see more of it, becoming a patron is one of the most direct ways to do that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell, what\u0027s here now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis Patreon is an ongoing project. As of launch, it includes access to the digital versions of The Kickass Coloring Book for Adults pages, allowing you to color them digitally if that\u0027s your jam, or print them on your own paper if you\u0027re into more ambitious techniques like watercolor or gouache. It will also be the launching pad and proving grounds for every future project, including, but not limited to Con*Artists (a YouTube series about life as an exhibiting artist) and The Tempest (a sci-fi reboot of William Shakespeare\u0027s famous play.) You\u0027ll get access to any streams, sketches, blog posts, and works-in-progress before the rest of the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen you become a patron, you become a part of each project. You get access to a more intimate, honest and genuine version of what\u0027s going on behind the scenes, from scrapped projects and concept sketches, to extended cuts of YouTube episodes, private streams, and more. I\u0027m constantly looking for things to add to and build onto this to enhance this experience, and 2017 is going to see a lot of that. Specifically, you\u0027ll get the first episodes of Con*Artists before the rest of the world, and be able to watch The Tempest come together, as well as be in on all the twists and turns for the rest of the 2017 docket, including The Birth Of An Idea, Dr. Mask \u0026amp; Associates #1, Homebound #1 and The Chronicles of Cornelius Cross Vol. 2. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
