You will get to see behind the scenes projects, exclusive things that no one else gets to see and even private live streamed events.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I asking for patronage?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my life\u0027s work and it takes time money and a lot of effort to run the websites, pay for software, instruments, strings, electricity, etc. Any bit of help allows me to do that much more for all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am publishing all my work under the free/open source or collaborative commons licenses. I want to give it right back to the world for free in exchange for your support.

Sessions is a collaboration experiment \u00a0in music art and technology that I intend to push forward as we experience the rapid shift to a crowdfunded fair market for creators. I have started using Patreon because the ideals behind crowdfunding are truly the future of music and art and in line with where we are all headed as creators. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also looking to utilize new emerging peer to peer technology as we move forward into what I like to think of as the \"renaissance of creativity\" or as i like to call it \u0027\u003ca href=\"https://sessions.media/2016/03/11/the-creators-economy/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Creator\u0027s Economy\u003c/a\u003e\u0027.
