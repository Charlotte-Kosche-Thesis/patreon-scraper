Since that fall, it has evolved from moms in the neighborhood, to ladies she\u0027s met in the PTA, to fellow soccer moms, chicks who she does charity work with, and local business owners. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the number of guests in her home climbed and her kitchen counter grew more and more crowed, she realized that she needed to do something different. She still wanted an excuse for coffee cake, but she actually wanted to get a chance to eat a little of it rather than spending all her time introducing everyone and answering so many questions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that is how the group was formed, and now what started in a big-mouth chick\u0027s kitchen is now a local radio program on \u003ca href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.MyBayAreaRadio.com%2F\u0026amp;h=VAQEQjt35\u0026amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.MyBayAreaRadio.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I be a member?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause that big mouth is now in a position where she can talk about you to a bigger audience! \u00a0She is now a regular voice on MyBayArea Radio and wants to give back to all those kind business and charity friends that she has watched support each other over the past few years here in the area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is more than she ever planned, more than she expected, and really more than she deserves. As much as it wears her out or as much as it takes up her time, it makes her happy (very happy) to see people in the community that she respects and cares about connecting with other wonderful local people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe closed facebook group, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/MoreThanJustCoffeeonMyBayAreaRadio/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/groups/MoreThanJustCoffeeonMyBayAreaRadio/\u003c/a\u003e is totally about networking, making positive connections, learning more about each other (and ourselves in the process), and inspiring Bay Area people. As much as it is about each and every person in there being happy and successful in whatever he/she is focused on, it is also about that woman who poured the mimosas and cleaned up coffee cake crumbs off her kitchen counter....so please remember, it is important to her. Now she gets a chance to talk about all these great people on MyBayArea Radio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not because it is \"cliquey\" or exclusive, in any way. It is because it\u0027s very a special place for some members, and we all have clear expectations ....be here, be positive, be supportive, and try and follow the \"rules\".....because this can really be MUCH More Than Just Coffee. Soooo much more...and the journey continues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s this \"Patreon\"??\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an established online platform that allows fans to provide regular financial support to creators.  Patreon was created by a musician who needed a easy way for fans to support his band. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow a lot of are \"networking\" events are simply about passing out your cards or clicking on some facebook stuff, and that will happen also in this group. \u00a0But, if you join More Than Just Coffee here on Patreon, it will give you some other \"perks\" to help your business. \u00a0Radio exposure, insider information, VIP front of the line access, and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve kept the costs pretty nominal as this is about helping local business and charity, and not about making money off our MTJC members. Money collected via Patreon will go to pay for advertising and support staff to create and promote the radio hour/podcast and to fund some bigger MTJC events to honor our members (like, someone is going to need to buy the\u00a0champagne for the mimosas).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you need?\u003cbr\u003ePlease support More Than Just Coffee financially by becoming a Patron.  Patrons agree to a regular monthly contribution, starting at $5 per month (\u003cem\u003ewhich is around $2.50 per episode\u003c/em\u003e). There is a small processing fee, and we will be paying tax, but most of your money goes directly towards supporting the More Than Just Coffee show. You can change or stop your payments at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think that\u0027s a good model.  More Than Just Coffee stays available to everyone in the Bay Area and beyond, and those who want to provide financial support and be given some extra love and attention can do so - easily, fairly, safely and efficiently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat about ...?\u003cbr\u003eWe have looked into other options. Membership fees....well, those can get out of line and complicate things. \u00a0Also, this makes it more open and inviting to people at all levels in the Bay Area. \u00a0A stay-at-home doing direct sales is just as important as a CEO of a local multi-million dollar company. \u00a0You don\u0027t need to pay big dollars to get involved or to prove anything. \u00a0You just need to be supportive, encourage others, and throw a couple of bucks at the person running all of this to pay for some basics. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeeping it free on facebook alone. \u00a0It\u0027s worked for a while, but as the original group has grown to over 150 people, it has gotten a little harder to just have a coffee in someone\u0027s kitchen on a whim. We also don\u0027t want it to turn into one of thos \"ad only fests\" where people just come around to post what they have for sale or an event, and then contribute nothing more. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of you will be familiar with YouTube advertising.  The normal return from YouTube ads is between $2 and $5 per thousand views, and the producer only earns anything if their viewers choose to click away from their video and watch the ad.  Most viewers won\u0027t do that, but everyone has to put up with the ad.  We think that would be awful, and with our view numbers it wouldn\u0027t bring in nearly enough funding anyway.  Direct sponsoring is perhaps slightly less intrusive, but again depends on much higher view numbers than we get. \u00a0And then there is always that we have to put someone on camera for that....and featuring a business on the radio is sooooo much easier, and no makeup is required!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we\u0027re asking you to become a Patron.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003eWe have worked out some \"rewards\" to show our gratitude for your support.  We hope you enjoy these, but most importantly, as a Patron, you know that you are keeping the More Than Just Coffee, and our guests, on air. As we get more member and evolve there will be more perks, and we are VERY LOYAL and we always honor our \"OGs\" who started with us back in 2015 and continue on with us here (and beyond).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat if I just can\u0027t do that?\u003cbr\u003eAnd if, for whatever reason, financial support is not something that you can do right now, please know that our current MTJC friends are still that....friends. And money isn\u0027t important when it comes to friends....except we do want to help our friends make some cash. \u00a0Keep sharing, come to the events/meetups, get your inspiration and, where you can, support our guests and the efforts of the organizer. \u00a0And you can always go to \u003ca href=\"http://www.MyBayAreaRadio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.MyBayAreaRadio.com\u003c/a\u003e and listen or #GrabThatApp on iTunes or Google Play, and leave a review (and a good one, please). \u00a0That helps. \u00a0A lot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you mean...\u003cbr\u003eMore Than Just Coffee is still kind of the same, but there was talk of making it \"more\"...and here is some of that \"more.\" \u00a0.  But at this stage, we are depending on your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you value the More Than Just Coffee, and you want it to continue and grow, and you are able to make a financial contribution, then please choose the level of your contribution and become a Patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve made it to the bottom.  Thank you for giving us your time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eKelli - The Big Mouth Chick who started MTJC in her kitchen\u003cbr\u003eand her friends at MyBayArea Radio\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS- \u00a0Nosh means eat. \u00a0We like to eat, too.\u003c/em\u003e"
