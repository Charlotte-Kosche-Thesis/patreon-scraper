     "description": "My initial goal is to cross a threshold of credibility with you whereby we can later on more confidently explore together several topics I suspect might be of mutual interest, such as the development of personality; human intelligence; Artificial Intelligence; and Complex Loops (the process by which systems with discrete rules reach equilibrium). To that end, I offer you first my working hypothesis for a unified theory of mental illness - which I\u0027ve termed \u003cstrong\u003eSix-Factor Syndrome\u003c/strong\u003e (6FS).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6FS\u00a0posits that Psychopathy (1), Schizophrenia (2), Autism (3), and Bi-Polar Disorder (4):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFall along a single spectrum in the shape of a loop that runs parallel to Narcissistic Personality Disorder (5), within a Dissociative Disorder (6) framework\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAre environmentally-dependent, discretely expressed,\u00a0co-morbid, and co-reinforcing cyclical mental states of varying intensity\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen apparent: Are the product of environmental stressors; spawned primarily through child rearing strategies that \u003cem\u003eunwittingly emulate narcissistic parenting styles\u003c/em\u003e, or which are in fact narcissistic in nature\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAre universal, complementary, adaptive modes of thinking; whose timing and intensity of expression are responses to percieved environmental pressures; but which may become arrhythmic to changes in the environments in which they occur, and thus become more apparent\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn their problematic forms: Are preventable, highly treatable, and likely \"curable\" (persistently remaining outside visible range of spectrum) through \u0027anchoring\u0027 and \u0027traction\u0027-gaining strategies\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the coming weeks, as time permits, I\u0027ll be deconstructing these six mental states and their modifiers - along with ADHD and OCD - and describing their underpinnings and functions, and the myriad ways in which they relate to and interact with one another. We\u0027ll explore the reasons why they\u0027re currently so difficult to properly diagnose, let alone treat when they become overexpressed; and clear up many of the common misconceptions that exist around them (in particular\u00a0narcissism and psychopathy).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst on the list will be Autism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether we\u0027re going to examine its cause and progression from infancy into adulthood; the role that empathy plays in its development; its dozens of symptoms, how they come about, and their expression; and the perceptual existence of the persons behind the Autism curtain, so to speak. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll also discuss a variety of practical methods and means by which a person so inclined could overcome the worst aspects of Autism, while retaining its many positive attributes.\u003cbr\u003e",
