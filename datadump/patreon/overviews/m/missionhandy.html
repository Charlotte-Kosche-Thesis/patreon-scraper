There is 19 babys and they use 7 diapers per baby, per day, thats 133 diapers a day thats needed.\u00a0 also they need extra help with all those babies. They have\u00a0 hired 2 women to take care of 19 babies, we could use more volunteers, to help with the babies who are still drinking milk, and need love and nurturing. But\u00a0 right now the orphanage only has these two girls helping, and last time I was there I got to see for my self how hard it is to attend to 19 baby\u0027s crying at once. Milk is another issue there please help and support our hard work.",

Your donations will help with\u00a0 travel so we can\u00a0 reach farther places in more remote areas of the world,\u00a0 that are not easy to get to. We will help take care of souls in need,\u00a0 and get the medecine needed for the sick, food, for the hungry, school supplies for children, and clothing\u00a0 for the people in need of this area. Please help us to grow this ministry by donating and supporting our hard work. Thank You and God Bless you all with the hearts to move on this.",
