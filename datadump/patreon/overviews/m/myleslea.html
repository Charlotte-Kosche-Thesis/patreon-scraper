    "summary": "I\u0027ve been a professional artist for the last 26 years.\u00a0Since 1991 I\u0027ve\u00a0focused mainly on\u00a0painting landscapes and portraits of homes and gardens in oils.\u00a0My former clients have\u00a0included\u00a0Prince Charles and The National Trust of Great Britain. Country Life Magazine kindly awarded me the title; \u0027Living National Treasure\u0027, which\u00a0was rather wonderful, and The Bodleian Library at Oxford University has asked me to donate my archive to them.\u00a0To date,\u00a0I\u0027ve created over\u00a080 major works in\u00a012 countries. You can see some of my work on my website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.myles-lea.com\"\u003ewww.myles-lea.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile working on\u00a0these projects\u00a0I\u0027ve\u00a0been able to\u00a0do\u00a0a\u00a0huge amount of\u00a0independent research in the fields\u00a0the fine and applied arts. I\u0027ve\u00a0extensively studied the contents of hundreds of museums and galleries in Europe and the U.S.\u00a0I\u0027ve\u00a0been\u00a0sharing my stunning photography, and\u00a0providing well-informed information on-line, which I present in\u00a0my uniquely energetic and passionate style through my Instagram profile. This has become an entertaining and informative resource for many thousands of people. (17,000\u00a0and rising). I interact warmly with my followers and provide advice\u00a0concerning\u00a0where to stay, where to see the greatest art and where to eat while they\u0027re travelling.\u00a0I\u0027ve effectively\u00a0become a friendly,\u00a0personal tour guide. It\u0027s incredibly rewarding to share my knowledge with so many uniquely\u00a0interesting people. But, of course, it\u0027s also quite time-consuming... which is why I\u0027ve started up this Patreon account. I\u0027m hoping\u00a0that some of the lovely people who enjoy reading my posts on my\u00a0Instagram profile\u00a0might feel the information that they see there is worth rewarding with a small monthly\u00a0donation. I feel as though I\u0027m helping so many people to avoid some of the expensive pitfalls when they travel, and saving them a lot of time by leading them to the sites they really can\u0027t miss.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m in the process of transitioning from a career in which I worked exclusively to commission, creating the\u00a0large landscape paintings I mentioned earlier -\u00a0to creating paintings in a more personal and emotional style. I\u0027ve made this decision because\u00a0in April 2016, at the age of 47, I was diagnosed with\u00a0Collecting Duct Carcinoma - a very aggressive form of kidney\u00a0cancer. Unfortunately this was discovered late and had spread to\u00a0areas around my major heart vessels.\u00a0I underwent\u00a0major\u00a0surgery and,\u00a018 months later\u00a0my scans\u00a0have been pristine.\u00a0Since surgery I\u0027ve travelled to\u00a0Rome, Greece, Boston and NYC. I\u0027m full of energy and my passion for\u00a0art is\u00a0greater than ever.\u00a0I\u0027ve currently in Boston\u00a0because I\u0027m about to deliver a\u00a0lecture on Friday at Harvard Business School\u00a0with the title; \u0027The Power of Beauty and the Inflection Point\u0027. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\u00a0ideas I present are so strong that I want to develop the lecture into a book. I also plan to make lectures available online which I hope will transform the lives of millions of people. I have a dynamic and engaging way of communicating and I\u0027m confident that when I promote these videos through my Instagram profile I\u0027ll be able to generate a large\u00a0following in a relatively short time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I say about\u00a0art and beauty has transformed many\u00a0people\u0027s lives.\u00a0Through my paintings and the way\u00a0I live my life I demonstrate a way of \u0027Being\u0027 which inspires others. I receive hundreds of messages from people who tell me that due to my posts on Instagram they have started painting again. Many people have told me that they have decided to visit places they\u0027ve seen my visit on Instagram and they have \"walked in my footsteps\" revisiting the museums, galleries and restaurants I recommend.\u00a0If some of the people who feel that have benefited from my inspiring words and photography on Instagram\u00a0make the very\u00a0generous and much appreciated\u00a0decision to\u00a0contribute a small monthly\u00a0amount of perhaps only one or two pounds, euros or dollars per month,\u00a0I\u0027ll feel I can\u00a0continue to set aside time to creating more content. My main, (and only)\u00a0income is still derived from the sale of my paintings. But having being introduced to\u00a0the idea of seeking support from enlightened\u00a0patrons via\u00a0Patreon by some of my followers on Instagram - I decided to go ahead.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you\u0027ll feel that\u00a0my output means something to you and you believe that I should continue\u00a0to change lives, uplift spirits and feed\u00a0souls!\u00a0 Thank you!"
