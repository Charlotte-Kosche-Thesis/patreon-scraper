    "summary": "Independent music. It\u2019s the life blood of the worldwide culture of music making. No matter the genre, the indie underground is the only place new magic comes from. Every artist you love was once riding around in an old van, taking the show on the road, selling albums from the stage, and keeping the flame of original music burning. Many of them still are. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMike O\u2019Cull here, professional music enthusiast, songwriter, music blogger, and the new host of The Sounds of Chicago Podcast. The podcast, originally launched by \u003ca href=\"http://www.ChicagoMusicGuide.com,\"\u003ewww.ChicagoMusicGuide.com,\u003c/a\u003e is now a shared effort between the fine folks at CMG and myself to bring more attention to the amazing indie music  coming out of Chicago right now. Blues, rock, hip hop, funk, metal, jazz, folk, shred, you name it and we do it here. Well. My goal as host of the show and an indie musician, myself, is to bring worldwide attention to the outstanding bands and artists who call our fair city home and discuss the issues that affect them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWHAT WILL YOU BE FUNDING WITH YOUR PLEDGE? \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe expansion to a weekly show on iTunes from a monthly show on SoundCloud, for one. Putting this together requires professional help in some areas and that costs money, even with connections. We need a website, graphic design, and all the other startup stuff. I\u2019m the one who has to make this happen and I need your help to do it. CMG has given me freedom to do the show I want to do, a lot of promotion, and somewhere around 25,000 social media followers. The rest is up to you and me. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYou\u2019ll also be helping me be able to dedicate my time to the growth of this project. I have plans for a brand new YouTube channel just for Sounds of Chicago that will feature live music, in-studio performances, interviews, and more. I also want to create original content for Patrons, as well as for social media. You will also be helping out with Facebook and Twitter ads that will get the word out about the show. As a disabled indie artist, I can\u2019t achieve all this on my own. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eA pledge of even a dollar or two a month is much more help than you probably realize. It will help me spread Chicago\u2019s homegrown music around the world, allow me to stay in the podcast hosting business, and continue to create my own original music. Larger gifts will allow larger efforts. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe have a ton of cool rewards at all levels of support that range from our heartfelt thanks to live music experiences to appearances on the podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
