We hope we can fuel your initial spark of curiosity and inspire you to become a patron or even just give us a shout out by sharing this with your friends, family and social networks. We live for spreading joy in the world (#PartyThePlanet) and your support makes that possible.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSo, with that...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re \u003cstrong\u003eMF Ruckus\u003c/strong\u003e. We play Rock n Roll and we want to create something truly rad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring this uncertain and catalytic era in human history, the world needs heroes. Heroes to protect us from our own fears. Heroes who make us laugh. Heroes who play rippin\u0027 guitar solos and melt our faces. We would like to be those heroes\u2026.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ein comic form anyway...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Front Lines of Good Times\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/em\u003eis a serialized concept album and graphic novel set in the not-so-distant pre-apocalyptic future. The year is 2040. A near-extinction event known as \"The great dying\" has wiped out two-thirds of the Earth\u0027s population through a long, drawn out series of seemingly unrelated causes. Organized governments and religions around the world have dissolved giving way to new systems of rule and worship, some of which are quite dark and destructive. Such is the case in the United States where a military Junta has felled the democratic republic in place of a harsh and brutal fascist regime known as the \u003cstrong\u003eNew Order of Fundamentalist Utilitarian Nationalists \u003c/strong\u003e(\u003cstrong\u003eNOFUN \u003c/strong\u003efor short). All forms of art, entertainment and philosophy have been strictly regulated under the Ministry of Entertainment. Any and all forms of communication deemed to be subversive are considered treason are punishable by exile, even death. Only analog forms of communication (Television and Radio) are available and all programming is strictly regulated, producing only stiff, boring, NOFUN propaganda. This content is pumped into every home in the crowded, impoverished mega-cities 24 hours a day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside of the cities, in the lawless and sparsely populated outlands live every kind of dissident and desperado imaginable. Traders, scrappers, nomads, bandits, marauders, musicians, journalists, comedians, writers and artists. Among these exiled refugees is \u003cstrong\u003eMF Ruckus\u003c/strong\u003e. Formed together as teenagers out of a need for survival, the members of MF Ruckus have spent 20 years roaming the outlands, trading, scavenging, entertaining at speak-easies and documenting the process for possible future generations. They are hunted by all sides. NOFUN wants them hanged as traitors. Doomsday cults predict them as bringers of destruction. Criminal ne\u0027er-do-wells wish to use them as proxies in fiendish plots. An emerging resistance seeks them as agents of revolution. This, is of course, all unknown to our heroes who simply seek to survive in this harsh world with the hope of one day, finding peace and salvation either at the end of NOFUN\u0027s tyrannical rule, or in their own death.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis story and the Adventures of MF Ruckus unfold one chapter at a time through the illustrations of Joshua Finley and the writing of MF Ruckus\u0027s members Aaron Howell, Ty Blosser, Logan O\u0027Connor, Parker Meehan and Tony Lee. Each chapter of the story is brought to life through narration voiced by the band members themselves as well as a new song each issue providing the soundtrack for this epic journey. It is a fun, darkly funny, exciting and eerily prophetic adventure for Rock n Roll and Sci-Fi Fantasy fans in the tradition of Heavy Metal Comics, The Walking Dead, Prophet, The Last of Us and The Mad Max films.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunds generated through your subscription will go towards studio time at Evergroove Studio in Evergreen, CO; paying our very busy and highly skilled illustrator Joshua Finley; hiring guest musicians; building and distributing guerrilla art components; creating video content; touring expenses (flights, equipment, vehicle rental, lodging, food) plus any other miscellaneous expenses. Our record label RodeoStar Records in Hamburg, Germany will be handling the costs of printing, distributing and marketing the first vinyl release (Front Lines of Good Times Part 1), but everything else is all on us. We are VERY excited about this project and while we will do the best we can with what we have and make it happen no matter what, the more resources we have, the better we can make it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons contributing to this project can expect early access to issues of the comic, free downloads, access to exclusive content and much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAaron, Tony, Parker, Ty and Logan\u003cbr\u003eMF Ruckus\u003cbr\u003e"

MF Ruckus is a turbocharged Rock n Roll supergroup comprised from salvaged and Frenkensteined pieces of Denver and Chicago\u0027s most legendary unknown bands. Following the concurrent demises of Forth Yeer (AKA Forth Yeer Freshman), The STD\u0027s, Road Crew and Home of the Brave, the surviving members joined together over a number of years to create a 6 headed rockstrosity which is known as \"The Motherfucking Ruckus\" or MF RUCKUS for use in polite company. Parker Clark Whitton, Tony Lee, Aaron Howell, Logan O\u0027Connor and Tyrell Blosser write songs in the key of fuckin\u0027 A and throw shows that will blow your mind into a million tiny pieces.
