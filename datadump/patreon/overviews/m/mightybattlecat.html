    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to the chaos! My name is Kitty Chandler, I\u0027ll be your tour guide this day, please keep your hands and arms inside the coach and don\u0027t feed that, you\u0027ll only encourage it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a little over a decade of trying to become a traditionally published writer I realized I cared more about getting the best story out there that I could manage rather than being published by a major publishing house (although having a staff of designers and publicists really sounds nice). Several years ago I began self-publishing, awkwardly and with some mistakes, starting with an anthology or \"braided novel\" of urban fantasy fiction and continuing with an alt-history fantasy novel, both now available on Amazon. I\u0027ve also written mystery, science fiction, and dipped a toe in a few other genres, and am currently working through my backlog of over half a dozen novel drafts as well as drafting all new material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my ideal world, I would be self-supporting purely as a writer. But to be honest even if I were making my current pay level by writing I wouldn\u0027t quit my day job entirely. I work at my family business, I love it, I would never leave them in the lurch by up and quitting. What I am looking for with Patreon and from you guys is to supplement my income such that I can, on a slow day, take the last couple hours off and go and write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other objective for Patreon is considerably more nebulous, so we\u0027ll call this the if I make it above and beyond goal. A few years ago my partner and I bought a house that, while very solid and likely to last another 170 years (yes it\u0027s that old), needs some serious cosmetic work. Every room needs to be repainted, I want to put some more floor-ceiling bookshelves in the office, we have paneling in major need of refinishing, several trees need to be trimmed back, etc. No individual thing is very expensive but over time it will add up. Also, we\u0027ve been very lucky so far but our oldest cats are 9 years old and aging, and as we have six of them I expect there will be vet trips in our future. So there\u0027s that too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom time to time there may be bonus rewards, such as autographed hard copies of my books or or copies of my research texts or notes, should there be an interest for such. There will also, as I understand it\u0027s a tradition, be cat pictures. Oh so many cat pictures will there be."
