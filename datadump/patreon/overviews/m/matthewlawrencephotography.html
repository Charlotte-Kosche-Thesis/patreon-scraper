    "summary": "Hi Everyone,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting my Patreon feed, I decided to create this page to share my experiences and knowledge about photography. Most of the content will be mostly aimed at learning the craft of wedding photography and also the business side which you don\u0027t always hear about. Including solid tips about website SEO, Social media, client management and much more. However a lot of the content you will be able to transfer to areas of photography. It is also aimed at all levels, wether you have just started out or if you are seasoned professional. Please see further down for examples of what is offered to my Patreon supporters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to set the page up after using Patreon and seeing a great group of photographers also using the platform to share their knowledge and experiences. I plan to share with you some of my top tips and help that have gained me success from starting out as a wedding photographer back in 2013 to where I am now in 2017. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy previous job was in IT management and education, supporting, offering advice and educating others is something I love doing! Sadly I don\u0027t have the time to run workshops currently. Hence the reason for this page, Why pay ? Running a business isn\u0027t cheap and investing in myself and others is something I strongly believe in. I usually spend a significant amount of time offering help and advice to others, sadly time is money and I am hoping this page will encourage you to invest in good advice, your business and yourselves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has become more popular in the creative circles and a platform I have been watching for a while. Deciding if I should come onboard and grow it for 2018 has been a big decision. If you have any questions regarding my page, please don\u0027t hesitate to drop me an email - \u003cstrong\u003ematt@matthewlawrencephotography.co.uk\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few examples of what I offer to my supporters. Each week I will be posting new guides, reviews and advice as well as some one to one mentoring.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.matthewlawrencephotography.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GardenPartyWeddingInspirationHertfordshireMatthewLawrencePhotography50.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotography Mentoring.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI must get countless weekly emails/messages asking if I offer photography lessons, advice, portfolio reviews etc. So here it all is in one place! This one to one mentoring scheme is a great way to get my help and advice on every aspect of your business. Including Photography, Editing, Website reviews, SEO, Client management. Marketing etc.\u003cbr\u003eThe mentoring Scheme can be done in person should distance allow it or over Skype or even over the phone.\u00a0 The scheme will last as long as you buy in to it, but will involve two meetings per month as standard.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.matthewlawrencephotography.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/LowWoodBayHotelWeddingPhotographyWindermereWedding50-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProcessing and Workflow Mentoring.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eProcessing is something I get asked about way to much, I keep things simple and use Adobe\u0027s Lightroom to process all of my images including culling. The way I process my images is with a preset I built myself after years of experience using Lightroom to get the effect I want across my images. I am offering one off mentoring sessions to teach my process within Lightroom, wether you are a beginner or more of an advanced user.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.matthewlawrencephotography.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Thalassines-Beach-Villas-Wedding-Cyprus-Wedding-Photographer-74.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
