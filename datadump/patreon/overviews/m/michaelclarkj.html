Wait, no, that\u0027s not quite right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy parents named me Michael Joseph.\u003cbr\u003eMy father\u0027s father\u0027s surname is Clark, and thus, by the tradition so is my own.\u003cbr\u003eI conceal my maternal surname mostly because I\u0027m not sure if you would understand. \u00a0But anyway, it\u0027s Klimowski.\u003cbr\u003eI selected the name Maximilian after Maximilian Kolbe for the sacrament of Confirmation in the Catholic Church.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have many other names, as well.  You met two of my other names above. \u00a0Many more are to the left in the side-bar biography space.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI shall share more later (about my names and other things) whether you support me or not, but I can\u0027t tell you how much I would love your support. \u00a0You can\u0027t tell anyone anything really, but you can point to the thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may consider this, right Here, right Now, me pointing to that truth: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e** I need support **\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in particular, I am requesting that you, Dear Reader, support me in whatever way is joyful for you, and I request that you only do it if it is joyful to you. \u00a0I request that if you can, you only give any of your life energy to me if it would bring you the joy of a small child feeding a hungry duckling. \u00a0Only if you are as happy to do so as the child is to feed the duck and as happy as the duck is to be fed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsider me the child and the duck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpiritually, your support is recognized just if you pay attention to that I exist.  I know I exist.  I might not consciously know that you exist, but I know consciously that I care about you and all the rest.  I care.  And I matter.  And you matter. \u00a0And I can even appreciate if you are paying me zero attention. \u00a0I can celebrate that you\u0027re choosing to do other important things with your life. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[You: \u00a0Is he serious?]\u003cbr\u003e[[Me: \u00a0I am.]]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway: \u00a0On the subject of \"support.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis support could and does take on infinite forms:  strategies of support I\u0027m excited about include (but are not limited to:) collaborators for projects (especially in person but also virtually), feedback on what I do, encouragement towards doing things, money, donations of used ukuleles, tasty clean food (for those in my area), places to stay, payment for attending events and for bus / train-fare, help fixing up my bike, mentors, teachers, collaborators, money, invitations to have me come work for you.  And so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* * *\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYesterday, whilst displaying my mother\u0027s art at the Coffee Pot Cafe, I asked David DiDomenico if busking [street-performing with asking for donations] is allowed in downtown Akron.  The scene went something like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe:  Is busking allowed in Akron?\u003cbr\u003eDavid DiDomenico:  Absolutely.\u003cbr\u003eMe:  Do you need a permit?\u003cbr\u003eDD:  Not at all.  You can do whatever you want.\u003cbr\u003eMe:  But what about panhandling?\u003cbr\u003eDD:  You need a permit for that.\u003cbr\u003eMe:  But what\u0027s the difference!?\u003cbr\u003eDD:  Oh, there\u0027s a huge difference between panhandling and busking!\u003cbr\u003eMe:  Yeah, panhandlers are actually producing something of value in this world! \u00a0So thus, it should be more restricted? \u00a0:-P  Telling someone you need assistance and asking for it is hugely important! \u00a0Street performers are still mostly perceived as selling themselves as having \"instrumental value\" and thus \"deserving\" of money. \u00a0But simply asking for money. \u00a0\"No no, none of that.\" \u00a0:-P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t rant quite that much, but that was the gist, and I think I said it more eloquently the first time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway.  You can consider me a digital panhandler AND a digital street performer.  I am going to live the way that I am going to live (--\u0026gt; Tautology Man), whether you give me any of your support or not.  But I would love it.  AND, a lot of what I do, incidentally, has instrumental value.  But I want to live in a world where we support each other not ONLY because things have instrumental value*, but ALSO because things have instrumental value.  I matter.  I am worth caring for.  I know this and do this.  You matter.  You are worth caring for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can I serve you?  How can I be of assistance?  Please.  Share.  I truly want to know, and I want others to know as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-----\u003cbr\u003e*Briefly, a list of things I do that have instrumental value:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOrganize. \u00a0Clean. \u00a0Care for others\u0027 well being. \u00a0Offer empathy. \u00a0Offer presence. \u00a0Teach juggling. \u00a0Teach chess. \u00a0Teach graphic art. \u00a0Talk with people. \u00a0Freely share ideas. \u00a0Celebrate people. \u00a0Celebrate life. \u00a0Teach about the \"art of life.\" \u00a0Walk around. \u00a0I uplift \"trash\". \u00a0I share challenging ideas and perspectives. \u00a0I tell stories. \u00a0I bonk people\u0027s reality. \u00a0I bike (instead of drive). \u00a0I walk. \u00a0I walked to D.C. with the Great March for Climate Action. \u00a0I got arrested (thrice!) to assist in raising awareness about issues of climate, environmental health, safety, economics, culture, love. \u00a0I served 8 days in jail for same. \u00a0I\u0027m contemplating serving at least 18 more. \u00a0I dance! \u00a0I love love. \u00a0I carry around knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know (and know about):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eimportant people\u003cbr\u003epalindromes\u003cbr\u003escience\u003cbr\u003eart\u003cbr\u003ereligion\u003cbr\u003eatheism\u003cbr\u003ejuggling\u003cbr\u003edancing\u003cbr\u003eNonviolent Communication\u003cbr\u003ewords\u003cbr\u003eemotions\u003cbr\u003eneeds\u003cbr\u003erequests\u003cbr\u003easking\u003cbr\u003elearning\u003cbr\u003eteaching\u003cbr\u003emotivation\u003cbr\u003eleadership\u003cbr\u003eembodied intimacy\u003cbr\u003ereligion\u003cbr\u003etheology\u003cbr\u003epain\u003cbr\u003edepression\u003cbr\u003efear\u003cbr\u003eignorance\u003cbr\u003elove\u003cbr\u003elife\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u0027m just getting started! \u00a0So if it would be a gift to you, please share with me your gifts, in whatever form delights you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike the child and the duck."
