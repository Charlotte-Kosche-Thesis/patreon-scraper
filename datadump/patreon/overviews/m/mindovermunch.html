    "summary": "Welcome! I\u2019m Alyssia Sheikh, and I\u2019m founder of Mind Over Munch- a brand dedicated to making a healthy lifestyle easier and more fun! Motivated by my love for food and passion for fitness, I find a balance by creating healthier remakes of my favorite meals. A fitness instructor and and graphic designer by trade, I try to incorporate my passions for design and education through my YouTube channel, where I share weekly videos encouraging people to make better, more informed decisions about health and food in a quirky and entertaining manner. I try to encourage people to find the lifestyle that works for them, and recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all answer. It\u2019s a journey, and anyone and everyone is welcome to our community, regardless of where you are on your path.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe brand began as nothing more than a personal Instagram account, but the loyal following inspired me to grow beyond the platform and deliver more quality content in an effort to help people more efficiently and effectively. Starting a YouTube channel in a 500 square foot apartment in New York City was no easy task, but my passion continues to drive me (and Mind Over Munch) forward. I now live in Los Angeles and I feel so blessed that my job allows me to help inspire, motivate and educate so many people every single day!
