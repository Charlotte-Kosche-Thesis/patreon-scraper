A process that started a decade ago with a dream (a literal dream, not a goal) and has been fermenting ever since. Silver is a performance and/or film (both?) and a self made mythology involving Wolves, Whales, The Traveler, Shape-Shifting, Strings, Bedrooms, Forests, Cliffs, Oceans, Gender Fluidity, and Healing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking patrons to support my work at a level of $1 - $5 per month. I will be posting rehearsal footage and improvisational dance videos exclusively to my Patreon page which your patronage will gain you access to. I will also periodically send artwork to my patrons. The more patrons I have the better the rewards will be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank my patrons from the bottom of my heart for helping to make my work possible. This is what I am meant to be doing and I wouldn\u0027t be able to do it without you."
