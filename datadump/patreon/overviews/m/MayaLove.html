    "summary": "Hello.Thank\nyou for being here :). I will tell you a bit of myself.\u003cbr\u003eNot long\nago i found out that i am allowed and able to love myself. Why nobody\nis teaching us that we could really love ourselves and we don\u0027t need\nnobody else to love us so we can feel happy i don\u0027t know,but is how\nit works here,in this society.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  After\nhaving a really big depression that lasted from my 16 to 22 years old\ni realised that life is more then just drama,i somehow woke up to\nthis reality and after my depression i started to look for other\nmeanings beside the material things in this world. Questions as who i\nam,why i am here,why all that drama happen to me, were always in my\nmind and i finally understood that i can love myself.\u00a0 As you see ,even\nif you have a good day there are always bad days.I am here for you\nfor those bad days,they don\u0027t need to be that bad and you will gonna\nsee that you will never have bad days at all,there will be just days\nthat are amazing and you will appreciate life more as i do now. Do you\nrealise that you are alive in this moment and you are free to create\nwhatever you desire?\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  My project is called\n\u003cstrong\u003eREPROGRAMMING THE FIRST PROGRAM\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eNow i will explain you why,is a\nweird name no?\u00a0 It will make sense in a moment.\u003cbr\u003eYou are born here in\nthis society and as a baby you don\u0027t know anything ,you start to\nlearn from you\u0027re surroundings,starting to play the role of you\u0027re\nlife ,this is you\u0027re first program. You already know we all had our\ndramas in our past and that affected us a lot.We all had a parent or\na boss or a husband,boyfriend that somehow made us feel bad about\nourselves.And like that we started to feel that we hate ourselves,we\nare nothing,we don\u0027t deserve nothing.\u00a0 I\u0027 m not saying that you feel\nlike that every day but lets be honest as everyone is saying..is\nnormal to feel depressed.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I will tell you that is not\nnormal\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  My project will have a\nserie of videos with my voice telling you different key words that\nwill help you\u0027re brain change,as the first program will change,from\nfeeling like you don\u0027t deserve nothing to i deserve everything.\u00a0 Those\nvideos will be free for everyone.You will understand the way that\nyou\u0027re mind is an amazing tool for you to create whatever you desire\nand you will never feel depressed again,it has no point for drama in\nthis world. You are here to be happy and live you\u0027re life the way you\ndesire not as a slave for this society. You will attract just good\ntings to you\u0027re life.Is not hard,is the easiest thing ever. All\nstarted to me by saying this simple words that are everything I LOVE\nMYSELF.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I would love you\u0027re help as i\nwant to focus just to this project . I think that in 1 month i will\nhave all the videos that you can listen too every day so you can\nchange you\u0027re life.Why you need to listen to it every day?\u00a0 Hearing and\nrepeating for yourself things like \u0027i am rich in every way possible\u0027\nor \u0027i am beautiful\u0027 helps you change the way you see yourself and\nthis world and never forget.When you forget you listen again and\nagain till they stay there for good.It does not take long. For me it\ntook 4 months,for you is possible faster because you will have the\nkey words,the process that will change the way you perceive yourself\nright now.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  As i need to start my project\nsomewhere i said that this will be where my first ever video will\nappear. This video was made some months ago,if you get inspired by the\nway i feel talking there and if you would love to help me start my\nproject with more videos like that and of course the ones that will\nhelp you change you\u0027re way of seeing the world(from bad place to\namazing place) i would really appreciate you\u0027re help.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nI want to thank you for listening to me and as i helped myself i can\nhelp you and together we can help so many others .Is all about our\nmind and the way we perceive ourselves and this reality. You will see\nthat words like i am beautiful,i love myself are working like magic\nto you,even if you don\u0027t believe it,repeating them will make you see\nyourself as you choose to be,an amazing human being.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You are and\nyou always were amazing,this society made you feel like you don\u0027t\ndeserve nothing but this will change.I love you , you are truly\namazing.\u003cbr\u003e  You can watch my first 3 videos\non youtube. They were made some months ago. They are raw as i felt a\nreally deep peace when i made them,i just took my camera and recorded\nwhat i felt in that moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This project is new so my facebook\npage is new too,you can be my first friend on there:) same on\nyoutube.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lots of love to you all!!"
