We\u0027re two friends (and professional journalists) who love discussing pop music in our weekly podcast, and we love discussing it with YOU. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur listeners rock our worlds, especially because you love the same type of music we do. Let other podcasts talk about the same six \"rock gods.\" We\u0027re here for Top 40 women, rapping drag queens, country balladeers, New Jack swingers, and heartbreaking dudes. The fact that you\u0027re ALSO here for this music inspires us to keep going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now you can \u003cem\u003edirectly\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ehelp us keep going by donating to our Patreon account!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt takes a lot of effort to put MASTAS together, from scheduling to recording to editing to promoting. Add in our monthly operating costs, and our labor of love ain\u0027t cheap.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why we\u0027re inviting you to join our Patreon producing team. If you make a donation, then you not only guarantee MASTAS keeps going, but also make it possible for us to explore new ways of delivering our music-addled brains to you. If we reach our monthly goals, then you\u0027ll have a direct hand - as well as a vote! -- in cool new content we\u0027re excited to create. Plus, reaching these goals will mean we can stop running ads and closing out each episode with a request for sponsorship. So join us! And THANK YOU SO MUCH for listening!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOTE: Our monthly \"members only\" episodes are called MASTAS Singles, and you can find them all by clicking on the button on the lefthand side of this page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
