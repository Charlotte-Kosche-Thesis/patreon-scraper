I want to entice you and get you excited about the people I\u0027m working with, the projects I\u0027m working on, and the places they will reach. Even as I\u0027m typing this, I am excited! Patreon gives us the chance to take this journey together.\u00a0 It is a great time to be creative and be around creative projects, and that puts a great big smile on my face.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProjects I\u0027m Building:\u003cbr\u003eBlack as Hell - 3 comic miniseries, (potential video game).\u003cbr\u003eThe Rusty Sunset Band - Comic miniseries about small people creating significant change.\u003cbr\u003eThe New Gods - Ongoing Comic Series about a changing world and lost cultures.\u003cbr\u003eYoung At Heart, Wise in Thought, Eternal in Soul - Children\u0027s story collection.\u003cbr\u003ePath of a Hero - (Keeping this one close to the chest for now).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeems like a lot? Well, everything is at different stages. Right now, Black as Hell is my focus. It is my first publication and holds \"first born\" status.\u00a0 But that doesn\u0027t mean you don\u0027t plan for more kids if you want a big family. I\u0027m creating the foundation and laying the ground work. I\u0027m bringing people around me that are exceptional talents and will feature them on here from time to time as well. It takes a village to raise a family, it takes a team to make a project succeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo awesome things about all this work.\u00a0 First, I will always have something to update you with. Some cool bit of information, art, or way of involvement for you. Second, if you like one project, almost certainly, I will have at least one other you enjoy as well.\u00a0 I am here to write for your entertainment and mine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will post a new update, every Monday. Those days are already Black as Hell anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
