    "summary": "MindShift podcast (formerly \"The Preacher\u0027s Forum podcast\") is all about one aim: helping people from all walks of faith and life to\u003cstrong\u003e think critically about God, the church, and spirituality\u003c/strong\u003e. In this day and age of \"supermarket religion,\" where people are free to pick and choose what they want to believe from a wide variety of competing faiths and belief systems, how should Christians, and churches alike, respond?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt seems clear from existing polling data, that the church--at least in the West--is in serious decline. People are leaving the church, but not necessarily giving up their faith in God. One major problem is that the church is seemingly incapable of having any sort of nuanced discussion about theology, beliefs, doctrines, or the Bible. We need to be able to think critically and potentially shift our points of view!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMindShift\u00a0will help you to do just that--have a mindshift. Listening to the podcast, and interacting with other supporters, will enable you to begin to think through issues critically, and to reflect theologically on a wide variety of topics. By engaging in the content, you\u0027ll learn how to move forward in pro-active ways, rather than simply in reactionary ways--as unfortunately has been the case so often in the past--especially in the case of both churches, and church leadership.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a teacher and former pastor of a church for nearly 12 years, I combine both my passion for teaching and critical thinking together with my years of experience in full-time ministry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, as a transplanted American living in the United Kingdom for the last 12 years, I am able to bring a unique perspective on life, culture and religion from outside of the mainstream, North American point of view that so often dominates the media, the church, and theology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting MindShift, you\u0027ll be helping me continue to do just that: to cover such expenses as travel costs for more podcast interviews, monthly podcast hosting, offsetting the cost of equipment upgrades, and so on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting the ongoing work of MindShift!"
