    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, and welcome to the\u00a0\u003cem\u003eMission to Zyxx\u003c/em\u003e Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo those of you who already listen to and love our show, \u003cstrong\u003ethank you, from the bottom of whatever weird organs circulate our bodily fluids, for listening\u003c/strong\u003e - your\u00a0feedback, emails, questions, fan art, tweets, reviews, encouragement and excitement have meant the quadrant to us, and the response we\u2019ve gotten has been bigger and better than we could have imagined. One of the reasons we started this show was to build a big, crazy sci-fi world, from scratch, with our listeners, and we hope you\u2019ve enjoyed seeing it take shape as much as we have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the uninitiated, welcome, and thank you for stopping by! \u003cem\u003eMission to Zyxx\u003c/em\u003e is\u00a0a science fiction podcast which follows three brave(ish)\u00a0heroes, aboard their sentient spaceship, as they explore the crappiest corner of the galaxy in search of adventure. Each episode - and therefore the entire canon of our show - is completely improvised, then lovingly edited and lushly sound designed to create half-hour episodes that are immersive, surprising, and hilarious. All six core members of the cast are veteran improvisers at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in NYC, and each episode features an incredible guest comedian who creates a character for our crew to meet on their journey. Past guests\u00a0include Paul F. Tompkins, Sasheer Zamata, Jon Gabrus, Lauren Adams and many more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe launched this Patreon on the completion of our first season, 18 episodes full of exotic planets, ridiculous species, hilarious special guests and an unhealthy amount of flap/chute talk. With your incredible support these past few months,\u003cstrong\u003e we have successfully funded Season Two, which launches May 30th. We couldn\u0027t have done it without you!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things we\u2019re proudest of about \u003cem\u003eMission to Zyxx\u003c/em\u003e is how much work we put in to make sure every episode sounds amazing, tells a great story, and makes your coworkers stare at you for cry-laughing at your desk. This means doing a lot of things that other podcasts don\u2019t have to do: we record in a studio that allows us to track every actor separately (for the purposes of discrete vocal effects), we edit our performances to make episodes lean and linear, and of course we fill it with the crazy sound effects, ambiance and vocal filters you all know and love. It might sound crazy, but post production alone on \u003cem\u003eMission to Zyxx\u003c/em\u003e takes literally dozens of hours per episode, split between our editors, Seth and Alden, and our incredible genius sound designer Shane, who creates and places every robot servo, blaster shot and ship bleep by himself. It\u2019s a small but dedicated operation, and it\u2019s important to all of us that every episode is as great as we can make it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to be transparent with you, especially if you\u0027re considering supporting our show, so we\u0027ll let you in on this: our top priority in Season One was making the show as amazing as possible. A significantly lower priority was getting paid to make it, which suffice to say we didn\u0027t. The ad revenue we received in Season One, while incredibly helpful, covered hard costs like studio rental, legal fees, art and music commission, and paying a small honorarium to our guest talent. That\u0027s completely cool with all of us - we LOVED making Season One. And we want to be able to keep making it, without making the terrible choice between doing it less often, doing it for free, or putting less work into it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, this is where you, and the continued adventures of our intrepid crew, come in. We\u2019ve set up a number of, if we may say, \u003cem\u003eexcellent\u003c/em\u003e tiers for your subscribing pleasure, offering incredible perks like live episodes (WHICH ARE CANON, BY THE WAY), exclusive merch, behind the scenes audio and video, ring and text tones, and early access to the season two premiere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the real reason we\u2019ve asked you to help is not just so you can get perks, but because it has literally been the difference between us being able to keep making the show at (and above!) the quality level of Season One and, well, \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e being able to. Your support has made this show possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur subscriber rewards are on top of the main season episodes, and all Season Two episodes will be released weekly wherever you get your podcasts, just like Season One.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow that Season Two is officially happening, you may be asking yourself, \"What\u0027s my support going toward now that the second season is being made?\" \u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s an excellent question! Your support is still very much necessary to finish out Season Two - the ball is rolling, but your patronage helps us make Season Two\u0027s episodes bigger and better than Season One, with more, new music and SFX, bigger guests and more time and resources to record and edit than ever before. In addition, we\u0027ll use our Patreon funds for:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eStudio time, \u003c/strong\u003eincluding studio time\u00a0in LA for our west-coast guests to record remotely\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eTravel budget\u003c/strong\u003e for doing shows outside of NYC, which also means:\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eContinued production and release of live episodes\u003c/strong\u003e, throughout and after the second season \u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eMore patron rewards\u003c/strong\u003e, like merch, ringtones, behind the scenes content and mailbag episodes\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eMore episodes\u003c/strong\u003e in our second season\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eSeason 3?!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, from all of us, thank you so much for listening to \u003cem\u003eMission to Zyxx\u003c/em\u003e. There\u0027s a whole lot of galaxy left to explore. Toot toot toot!"
