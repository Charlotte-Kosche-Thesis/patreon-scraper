    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a place where you can support artists, thinkers, and makers who create content you love, so they can make \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e content. It\u0027s sort of like Kickstarter, only you get rewards for each month you support, whether that is just once or ongoing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi Everyone! My name is Marco David. I want to give you a little back-story on myself. When I was 19, I dropped out of college after two weeks. My dream was to become a photographer. I figured the next step, now that college was \"over\" for me, was to move to the biggest city I had the quickest access to. I moved to LA and was introduced to some pretty amazing people, and was fortunate to have some doors opened up for me. To my surprise, I began to work on movie sets at Paramount Pictures, then moved on to BET and various other television and movie productions. The lifestyle was a complete change for me, a dream of mine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to focus again on my photography. I started shooting a lot and began to see some amazing things happen. I have seen my images run on national tv-campaigns, on book covers, published internationally, and even on a cruise ship. The feeling is indescribable and I am so eternally grateful for everything that has happened to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I was living out my fantasies in LA, I felt like I still had so much to learn. I went back to college to focus on art and right now, I feel like the next step is writing. I want to share the things that drive me: first impressions, travel adventures, anecdotes, dialogue, thoughts, critical analysis, poems and everything in between. It would mean the world to me if you would contribute and help make this next adventure, the most successful yet :)"
