I am just an ordinary guy, but what makes me different is the fact that I am a full-blooded motorcycle enthusiast, full of passion for adventure, open to new experiences, exciting challenges and in quest of conquering new horizons. Yes, I am your average guy who wants to change his routine existence by setting out and pursuing a dream, entering a new world, a world so different, so unknown and waiting to be explored.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n About ten years ago I decided that I had to see the world and I had no intention\u003cbr\u003e\n of delaying any longer. How? By riding a motorcycle. Why by motorcycle you ask? Because we all have our preferences. Some like to travel luxury  - flying only first class, others think that buses are the most rational and practical choice. A few cycle like mad and find it of great enjoyment! I owned a motorcycle and I found riding it so relaxing that, I literally used it as an antidepressant drug. Some people said that I get crazy... maybe, but please tell me, what you did in last 10 years? Did you enjoyed as I did?",
