This patreon page is a way to help support me and my creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe hardest part of writing fanfiction for me is making time to do it as a busy teacher. I love to connect with my fans, and I am eternally grateful for the outpouring of support and thanks people have given to me. However, I wanted to give my fans an opportunity to provide me with a little bit extra carrot should they so desire.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the creation of a Patreon account though, comes responsibilities. If I\u0027m going to get paid to post, then I need to do a better job of writing and a better job of providing consistent updates. So here\u0027s a short list of what this account means:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. No more long periods without an update. Updates will be posted, at the very least, bi-weekly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. A dedicated beta. I\u0027ve already got volunteers for this, but I will be more consistent about utilizing them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Chapter length: at least 3k words. That\u0027s a minimum, not a maximum.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd remember, even if you don\u0027t pledge, I am commited to continuing the story. This is a tip jar, not a cash grab.\u00a0"
