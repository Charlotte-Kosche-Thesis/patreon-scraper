I believe there is a huge opportunity to reach the demographic of girls who play sports (approx 30 million in the U.S.) and create compelling content that these girls can engage in, with the added benefit of keeping them encouraged to play sports. The website will have video content, blog posts from athletes, as well as a community page for fellow girl athletes to connect with each other to build a support group. Think \u003cem\u003ePlayer\u0027s Tribune\u003c/em\u003e style but with a youthful twist to it. MLG\u0027s mission is to be more than just a media brand, but a full on lifestyle website that forge partnerships with brands with a vested interest in empowering girls. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMLG will donate 5% of its proceeds to the Women\u0027s Sports Foundation\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
