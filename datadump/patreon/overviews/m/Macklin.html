    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eHello everyone! To all who are reading this I\u0027d like to thank you for at least coming this far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess the big question is; what am I creating? Well to be honest I am walking a couple of different avenues of content creation with my passion for writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more common avenue is fan fiction which I believe is a great way to increase the joy someone can find in a thing they love as well as allow a writer to take risks, experiment and try new things within the soft confines of some predetermined parameters. I should warn you in advance though that I don\u0027t write fictions based simply on the hottest properties; I write in the universes that inspire me whether they are in the current zeitgeist or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more ambitious avenue is my original fiction; and though I don\u0027t always stay within one genre my primary wheelhouse I guess you could say is horror. To be honest I am a bit of an oddity when it comes to horror; I don\u0027t believe that the road to horror is an unending river of blood and gore with jump scare speed bumps along the way. I think there are more interesting ideas that can be explored, and tropes that can be re-evaluated. I have written stories where readers cry for the slasher, cheer that the heroes don\u0027t make it, and fall in love with the idea that sometimes choosing evil is the right thing to do. Horror is a tool to help tell some stories that can\u0027t be told any other way, not a simple end result you try to drag yourself and the audience to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow then the next big question is how often will I produce it? The answer is a pretty straight forward one, as often as I can. Not very definitive is it? There is a reason for that. Honesty.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a condition I have to battle that sometimes causes me too much pain to think straight, prevents me from sleeping, even prevents me from using my hands properly for days at a time. So there are medical issues working against me but there is also another issue that can pop up. The same issue that affects every creative person, an artistic block. While I have a plan to prevent such a thing from impeding content (mainly, writing a ton at once and releasing slow) it can come up. Some forms of art and media creation can produce content despite a block others, like writing, can not. All I can answer if a block impedes things is that I apologize and I will do everything I can to work past it as fast as I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo it looks like I am here asking for money for fan created work that I may or may not deliver on and I won\u0027t lie that sounds pretty terrible. Thankfully that is not what I am asking you to do; I\u0027m asking you to help support a writer trying to do what he loves and encourage him; who will do everything he can to give you the stories he hopes you will love. My main goal is publication for my original works; the fan fiction is born out of my love for a world and those within it that I want to embrace and share.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what you decide to do or not do I\u0027d like to thank you for at least reading this far and I hope that if you found this page as a result of finding some of my writing that you enjoyed what you read.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
