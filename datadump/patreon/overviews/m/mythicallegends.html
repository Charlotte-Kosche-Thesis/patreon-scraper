    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\t\t\t\t\tGreetings all who visit us. We are delighted you are here. Mythical Legends Publishing ( \t \t\u003ca href=\"http://mythicallegends.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://mythicallegends.com\u003c/a\u003e ) started out producing 3D Digital Content for Renderosity and Content Paradise in 2005. In 2012 we published our first book, GRID Traveler: Distant Reality. Since then, we\u0027ve published over a dozen books from five different authors. This new year looks to be exciting. We have several more books lined up to print, several tabletop board games in the works, a revised re-release of Tachyon Node, and plans to record all the books and short stories into Audiobooks and podcasts.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\t\u003cimg src=\"http://interchange.mythicallegends.com/download/issue_1_cover_international_008062017_front_cover_200x320.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eThis new year we would like to pay all our Tachyon Node artists and writers up front. At the moment, they are paid on a royalty basis. We would also like to pay them a more fair share. Without their efforts and talents, Tachyon Node and our books would be nowhere near the caliber they are now. We are very proud of what we\u0027ve produced. \t\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\t\t\tThis my friends is where Patreon comes in. With a stable and reliable source of income, Mythical Legends Publishing would be able to move forward in producing ever better books, magazines, and games. We would be able to hire more editors and pay them better, as more stories come in. Every patron would be providing us with the much-needed resources in making this happen.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\t\t\t\tFrom Mythical Legends Publishing, myself (J Carrell Jones), our writers, our artists, and our editors, we thank you very much.
