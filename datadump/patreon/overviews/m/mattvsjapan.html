    "summary": "In Japanese,\n\"perapera\" means \"fluent\", and \"gaijin\" means\n\"non-Japanese person\" or \"foreigner\". The sad reality is that a large majority of people who set\nout to learn Japanese never reach a high level, and I want to change that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy\nname is Matt, and I started learning Japanese around the\nmiddle of 2011. I used the \"all Japanese all the time\" (AJATT)\nmethod, as presented by Khatzumoto on the \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/ugrOTjzLTYk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAJATT website\u003c/a\u003e. I did literally\neverything in my life in Japanese; my computer and phone were set to Japanese,\nI constantly kept headphones in and listened to Japanese podcasts all day,\nI watched tons of raw anime, J-drama, and J-movies and read tons of manga and\nJapanese novels. I combined this with James Heisig\u0027s \"Remembering the Kanji\", and the spaced repetition\nsoftware \"Anki\". Around 3 years and 10,000 flashcards later, I was\u003cstrong\u003e\nfluent \u003c/strong\u003ein Japanese, by anyone\u0027s definition of the word. I did spend six months in Japan in the middle of 2012,\nbut honestly, I don\u0027t think that made a big difference in my Japanese ability. I spent\nmost of my time in Japan doing exactly what I would have been doing back home:\ncooped up in the library making flashcards and trying to decipher novels. Besides those six months, I was in the United States the entire time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut, I found that\nbeing \"fluent\" just didn\u0027t really cut it. The gap between\n\"fluency\" and \"native level\" was much larger than I ever could\nhave anticipated, and I simply wasn\u0027t satisfied with being a \"second\nclass citizen\" linguistically. But because the original \"AJATT\nmethod\" is mainly geared towards getting people from \"zero\" to\n\"fluent\", it doesn\u0027t really talk about how to get from\n\"fluent\" to \"native-like proficiency\". Unfortunately,\nreaching native-like proficiency in a foreign language is something extremely\nrare, and so the best way to go about doing so is still mostly unclear. But through my own\ntrial and error, combined with many hours of studying and philosophizing\nabout language acquisition theory, I\nhave uncovered a lot. I have discovered many innovations and additions to the\noriginal AJATT method that have allowed me to move past many plateaus. I don\u0027t claim\nto have all of the answers, but personally, I believe that I am on to\nsomething. My goal is to share that with you and help you follow in my\nfootsteps. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs of this writing,\nI have been studying Japanese for 6.5 years. Besides those 6 months in 2012, I\nhave been in the United States the entire time. I am by no means at a native\nlevel, but I can get confused for a native speaker on the phone, and have a larger\nJapanese vocabulary than most natives my age. If you really want to know how\ngood I am, I suggest showing \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/vrAyDf7jzdw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea video of me speaking Japanese\u003c/a\u003e to a native speaker and asking for their opinion.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my YouTube channel, \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/MATTvsJapan\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMatt VS Japan\u003c/a\u003e\", I create videos\ndetailing everything from the technical details of how to create your\nflashcards, to how to deal with losing motivation mid-journey. I cover\nthe nitty-gritty details of how to actually put the original AJATT method into action, as well as how to continue to improve after reaching the outer limits of the AJATT method\u0027s\noriginal philosophy. Personally, I think my YouTube channel is an invaluable\nresource for anyone aspiring to reach a native-like level of proficiency in Japanese.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, thanks to all of your support, I am able to create multiple videos\neach month (you guys are amazingly awesome!). But the more support I get, the more of my life I will be able to\ndedicate to creating content! For all of those who would like to be part of the\nenterprise and support me, I have various rewards, including bonus content and\na discord server (see the right side of this page). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCome join the army\nand become part of the movement to reinvent what it means to be a\n\"gaijin\"!"
