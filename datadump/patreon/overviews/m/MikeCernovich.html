You are fed up with our hoaxing media, sick of reading the headlines, and tired of cowards who won\u0027t stand up and fight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this level you want to fund news stories that no one else will cover. You know I will make this happen, because you\u0027ve seen me do it every day out of my own pocket.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will meet once a month in a private, elite call to discuss recent developments and media and how we can have a greater impact.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will also have a private, in-person event every six months. This is as much of a \"brain trust\" or \"mastermind group\" as it is a way of getting the truth out to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also make a one-time donation of $10,000 to have access to this benefit for 12 months.",
