Okay... here goes nothing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Maddie and I am the sole independent creator of the popular and growing webcomics \"The Maple Effect\", \"ARCO\" and \"Periwinkle Blue\". I started this journey back in February (of 2015) with no knowledge or success of creating a comic ever before. I was young (still am) and testing the waters with something that I had always wanted to try, only to find that hey!-- I am actually kind of good at it! You see, I have always wanted to tell stories that reach out to people, and I have always loved art in every way. Creating a webcomic seemed like the best way possible for me to reach out to people, and lucky enough for me it seems to have worked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had a wonderful start to my first comic and as the story grows so do my fans. It would be a pleasure, and an honor to be able to launch this story to the next level by getting some donations. I am looking forward to printing the book within the next year and showing up at some of the conventions with merchandise for you lovely fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon and your guy\u0027s help I intend to share more of this story with you and use the money to fund printing and more merchandise in the future. As I said, its an honor to have this chance as an independent author, and I certainly wont let it slip away.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/cebe1273cdcc4d82d672dd9552746468/tumblr_oim8k4sPV01tghfvto1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
