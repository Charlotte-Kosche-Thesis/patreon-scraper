    "summary": "I am Meliorince, an Arizona cosplayer since November of 2014. Over my years of cosplaying, I have found many cosplayers who I now call my inspirations use Patreon to fund their cosplay career or at least some of it. While my followers are \u003cstrong\u003enot obligated\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to become a Patron, it helps me out a LOT. With the pledges I receive, these funds will go towards new equipment to record videos, fabric and materials for new cosplays, photographer fees, and a lot more! I love cosplaying, and I want to further my hobby. But, as I\u0027m sure we all know, it\u0027s an expensive hobby. Since 2016 I have started making my own cosplays, and between time needed to just sew the base of one cosplay let alone do details to making armor, it is very costly. I also plan to attend out of state conventions depending on if I can afford it. Some of my dream cons are Anime Expo, DragonCon, MetroCon, KatsuCon, Anime Boston and a few more. So if you\u0027d like to see me at a convention you\u0027ll be attending, message me on my social media and I\u0027ll put it on a list!"
