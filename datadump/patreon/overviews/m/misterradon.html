    "summary": "Hello, it\u0027s a rebranding! (Or if it\u0027s your first time here, you can skip the first paragraph)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor older patrons or those who may have been here before, I am transitioning away from this being a writing-related Patreon campaign. It was a project that over time I really fell out of love with, which in terms of story-telling and committing to a long-term project is a problem that I suffer from: the longer I have to analyze an idea, the more I realize the failings of it and lose my drive to work on it. Maybe that\u0027s not the best way to start a sales pitch, but I believe in being honest and explaining the decision that I\u0027ve made to change the focus of this campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I try new things and figure out what works best for me, I\u0027ve really fallen in love with streaming as a full-time endeavor. It combines my desire to entertain, my desire to socialize, and my passion for video games. I\u0027ve put a lot of time and energy into streaming as of late, and it has been extremely rewarding almost entirely across the board. I\u0027ve made so many new friends, my audience has steadily grown over the past year or so, and the results speak for themselves. It\u0027s truly both humbling and exciting. Excumbling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, there are definitely shortcomings of focusing on being a streamer, the most apparent being revenue during the early stages prior to earning a Twitch partnership (and even then, a smaller partnered streamer can still have some income fluctuations). While the channel has grown immensely and hopefully continues to do so, it is definitely still in that phase, and so it becomes necessary to find ways to make it as lucrative as it is entertaining and fulfilling to do. The stream donation system is in place whereby people can request games for me to play, and this is not designed to replace that. Rather, this is designed as a supplement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy big thing that I can still give away is my skill with the written word, but now I am choosing to combine that with my knowledge and passion for games as well. If you check out the new reward tiers, the primary focus is my ability to recommend games based on a person\u0027s tastes and experience with gaming, and I am excited for the opportunity to share my knowledge with others and hopefully provide them with an experience that they will be entertained and ultimately happy with. If you are also a streamer, hopefully this gives you a steady flow of ideas for games to broadcast yourself. If you just like to play for fun, hopefully this keeps your gaming diet as varied as you like and gives you new and exciting experiences to try. If you don\u0027t have a background in video games, hopefully this gives you a confident, curated introduction to the medium from someone who truly cares about its history and its future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I\u0027ve set goals to enhance and expand the content I already provide through my Twitch stream based on levels of support. These goals will advance and evolve as support grows. The idea is to provide something exciting and consistent for everyone while still staying true to my personal brand and style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs to what this money goes towards, it\u0027s all being used as practically as possible to pay my monthly bills, maintain and add equipment to the stream itself, and create a source of income that will hopefully free up more of my time, enabling me to stream and broadcast as much as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnderstand that not every streamer has the same goals. Some approach it as a hobby, others as a social activity, or a way to enhance an existing leisure activity. For me, streaming is each of those things and more. I\u0027m a big-dream kind of guy, and so my goal is definitely to reach partnership, to become a \"big\" streamer with all the benefits and the viewership and the following, but it\u0027s both a process and not something I can point to and make a plan with a definite timetable around. All I can do and all I am doing is giving it my all and tackling it with a full heart and a mountain of passion and enthusiasm. Any help along the way no matter how small or large is a step closer to me accomplishing that goal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this, and thank you for support: monetary or otherwise!"
