So... \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a creative person working in Portsmouth (UK), creating paintings, drawings, toys, accessories and running events to help local creatives meet, network, collaborate, learn and socialise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChances are that you\u0027re only\nreading this because you\u0027ve been to one of the events that I run. I\u2019m extremely\npassionate about the value of providing local opportunities for people to\nexplore and share creative skills, and meet like-minded people. I\u2019ve been so\nproud to see so many collaborations, friendships, businesses and relationships\nbud and grow from the events that I run, and I really want to continue to be\nable to provide opportunities for our local creative scene to grow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, as austerity\ncontinues to bite, and the creative infrastructure in our city continues to\nwither, with fewer accessible galleries, increasingly out-of-reach funding\nstreams and other pressures, it\u2019s becoming more difficult to be a torch-bearer\nfor culture in our area \u2013 I put together most of my events off my own back, and\nI have to work in a supermarket to support myself\u2026 So, I\u0027m writing cap-in-hand,\nasking for whatever you can spare each month to help support the work that I do\nin my local area. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAny donations, of any size,\nwill help me to keep developing my work, and providing the inclusive\nopportunities for networking in Portsmouth that I\u2019ve become known for. If you\nenjoy seeing the work that I produce, or you\u2019ve ever attended one of my events,\nor been inspired by one of the projects I\u2019ve been involved in, I\u2019d really\nappreciate your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlthough supporting the\ncreative arts is a really worthy cause, it\u2019s not a charitable one, so you\u2019ll be\ngetting good bang for your buck \u2013 look at the different levels of patronage available\nto see what you\u2019ll be getting back from your investment in our local culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ethank you, thank you, THANK YOU.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
