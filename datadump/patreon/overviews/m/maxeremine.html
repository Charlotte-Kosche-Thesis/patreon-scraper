    "summary": "My name is Max Eremine and I am a traveling portrait photographer and educator. Basically I travel the world, photograph people, and teach photography in between the shoots.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see myself as a sort of an underground-indie-anti-mainstream-guerilla photographer :) Mostly because it sounds really cool :) But also\u00a0because I am 100% independent, because I am entirely self-taught (which means I have predominantly learned from practice, although I did also learn a great deal from books, podcasts, tutorials, etc.), because I do not affiliate myself with any brands or artistic movements, because I strongly belong to the equipment-doesn\u0027t-matter camp of photography educators, and finally because I simply like going against the grain a little. I like finding \"wrong\" ways to do something and making it work, or making high end looking images with DIY filters/light modifiers. I\u0027ve shot nationally distributed magazine covers with no team, zero prep work, one cheap tungsten light, and old plastic blinds from the recycle bin for light modifier. That\u0027s the style of work I enjoy doing the most, and that\u0027s the style work that I teach here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNowadays, virtually all of my shoots are paid client shoots. Which means that I usually have a very, very limited amount of time to deliver a (hopefully) stellar image, or two, or ten. Through this experience I developed a particular work style, that is based on improvisation and going with the flow. I believe improvisational approach to photography really opens up its creative possibilities and makes photography simply more enjoyable. I believe a beautiful portrait image can be made in any light, with any equipment, and with any model. The lighting, props, wardrobe, location, and the subject can make it easier or harder, but it is always there. For me it\u0027s similar to a Judo match - I do not resist the circumstances, and instead try to use them to my advantage. It\u0027s really all there for the taking, if one learns how to recognize it, see it, and execute it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon started as more of a Photo Tutorial blog, but nowadays it developed into something more. In addition to old style tutorials, technical details, lighting diagrams, post-processing techniques, and photography business tips, I am now predominantly concentrating on screen capture videos where I discuss in depth how I made some of my images, what is the logic behind my creative and technical decisions, the before and after comparisons, how I retouched the images, etc. It\u0027s basically a window into my creative process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos do not have minute long intros with catchy music or high production value. I am more about the content than the fluff. I am also not sponsored by any fancy equipment manufacturers, so I won\u0027t be pushing the latest something or other on you. Hell, half the time I personally work with cheap speedlights and household flashlights. Photography is not about equipment or lighting diagrams, it\u0027s about vision, and meaning, and experimentation, and creative insight... and having a jolly good time while doing it :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/q2wgtcikuj8gzro/ME.jpg?raw=1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.maxeremine.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MaxEreminePhotography\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/max_eremine/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram - Portfolio\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/max.photo.trek/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram - Visual Diary\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/maxeremine\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "My name is Max Eremine. I am a travelling portrait photographer. I was born in Moscow, live in Atlanta, but travel VERY often. You could say I live on the airplane. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotography has been a late discovery for me. You could say that it was a midlife crisis career change. Before I discovered it in my 30s, I got two degrees that have nothing to do with it (Spanish for International business and World History,) I have worked as a garbage man, radio DJ, retail manager, and corporate executive for a national retail chain. It all began when at the age of 31 I purchased my first film SLR camera at a yard sale. I got the photography \"bug\" almost immediately. For the first few years it was just a casual hobby, then it became an obsession, then a part-time job, and finally in 2013 it became my actual full-time career. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then I have been published in dozens of print and online magazines, have been a part of multiple art exhibits, and have been selected as one of the Best Photographers of 2014 by American Society of Media Photographers. But I believe my main achievement is simply becoming a full time professional photographer without the benefits of the formal art education, photography business connections, or significant financial investments. I of course had to invest in a decent camera, but doing a major career change as a middle-class adult with a family to support means that every penny was counted and not a single dollar was spent without bringing two dollars return on investment. For the past several years I have worked an average of 80 hours a week without any vacations and had to abandon every other hobby or interest that I had. Of course I could take it a little easier, and sleep a little more, and work a little less, but once the jump was made and the career was chosen, I had to move quickly to start making enough money to support the family. Bridges were burnt and all the bets were placed - I had no choice but to learn photography and photography business very, very quickly or go bust. Sink or swim.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been teaching photography in workshops and private lessons for a few years now and answer photography questions on a daily basis, so I figured I could make it a little more organized and official. Thank you for taking time to read this!",
