    "summary": "And finally, my dark gaze settles upon Patreon. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Christopher, but everyone and their brother calls me \"Turco\" so often, I do a double take when I hear my first name. \u00a0I started writing when I was 14, but the truth is that I always knew I wanted to write. \u00a0Before I even learned to read, I was stapling post-its together, scribbling squiggly lines inside it, and giving it to my parents, bragging, \"Look! I wrote a book!\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere wasn\u0027t much wiggle room in figuring out what I wanted to do with my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, the writing industry has changed drastically. \u00a0I\u0027ve been on the self-published road since 2001, figuring it offered me the creative freedom to present my artistic tastes without being focus grouped, editing-for-niche-marketed, cloned-to-sound-like-the-most-popular-writers-of-the-timed out of having anything useful to say. \u00a0I knew getting into it that the self-published route would be difficult, but it seemed an even trade for keeping my stories true to form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong comes Patreon! I have several friends on Patreon who are doing well enough that I agonized over joining it over most of the last year. \u00a0Frankly, the starving writer thing is too real. \u00a0If I can bring in even a few more bucks a month, life gets measurably easier. \u00a0Taking a stab at the Patreon jungle seems to be exactly what the doctor asked for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround here you\u0027ll get advanced or even alternative chapters to works in progress. You\u0027ll get behind the scenes notes about books in print and projects to come. \u00a0I\u0027ll feature character sketches, exclusive short stories and/or novel serials before they hit print. \u00a0You can qualify for a free pdf of a printed work each month (from those available as they release), and I have an open floor for questions and answers all the way through. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, at my higher tiers, you\u0027ll have access to my dream journal. \u00a0I\u0027m keeping it locked at the top for a reason. \u00a0I\u0027ve been a lucid dreamer for 30 years and I have a -lot- to say about it. \u00a0I\u0027ve even been on a local radio show talking about it, but I\u0027ve always had mixed results about opening up about it to people. \u00a0At that tier, frankly, you\u0027ve earned the right to look over my shoulder. \u00a0The dream journal will revealed dreams I\u0027ve had, past and present as they occur, as well as observations about lucid dreaming and things that have worked for me as far as refining my experience with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI welcome you here and hope you find this humble desert writer to your liking. \u00a0My works will be across several genres, but expect scifi, fantasy and horror on the outset. \u00a0So much to do, so much to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome and join me along the way."
