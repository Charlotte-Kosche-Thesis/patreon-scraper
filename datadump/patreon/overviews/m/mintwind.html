    "summary": "Hello! My name is Oksana, I\u0027m 25 years old! I was born and grew up in Ukraine. From the very childhood I was addicted to drawing. I drew a little at my leisure. But I never thought about drawing can be my profession. I also played a lot in the computers of the game. I always loved animals very much and decided very early that I wanted to become a veterinarian. I entered the veterinary department after school and studied for 4 years. At the 4th year of study (2014), before the final exams, I had an opportunity to go on an internship on a pig farm in Denmark. After 1.5 years of internship, I had the opportunity to stay in Denmark already with a working contract. This is hard work, but the prospect of returning to Ukraine after the events of 2014 was even tighter. And all this time I continued to draw and play games at leisure. I took courses in watercolor painting online. About a year ago (autumn of 2016) I saw a recording of a stream in which Tatyana Vetrova (Senior concept artist of the studio Spirosoft) told that it is realistic to become an artist in the gaming industry, and for this it is not necessary to finish the university or draw a lifetime from childhood. And then it dawned on me that I can combine all my hobbies in one profession. And from that moment on I began to learn how to draw in computer graphics. I bought iPad, because I thought it would be more convenient to draw when you see that you are drawing directly on the screen. But things went very slowly. Efter the hard work I did not have the strength to engage drawing in the evenings. I drew unregularly and unsystematically. But in October this year, I realized that this can not continue any longer, because I almost lost a year of time. I took myself in hand and enrolled in digital art courses by Roman Guro. It was very hard, classes three times a week in the evenings. I barely had time to do my homework. But I finished the course and felt that I could continue! Immediately after the completion of the course (mid-November 2017) I signed up for the Environmental Concept-Art courses at Smirnov School. And so, on December 16, I worked my last day on a pig farm and completely retook myself to drawing! The courses on the environment are still going on and you can see my results! I have yet earned anything with my artworks, but I am full of hope and faith in myself. I\u0027m sure that each of you will be able to translate your dreams into reality, if you make an effort. Mainly do not give up and after a while everything will necessarily happen. We decide who we should be in this life and everything depends only on ourselves. I am very glad that you have looked to my page and I hope you will like it here. And I\u0027ll try to please you with my painted stories as often as possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I hope that soon I will have orders for drawings and I will be able to earn money. First of all, I dream of purchasing Mac because of their 5k IPS monitor. And so I can prove to my family and everyone around me that perseverance and self-belief can lead to the fact that your hobby can become your true profession!"
