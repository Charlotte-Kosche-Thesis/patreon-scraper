    "summary": "Hi Guys, you probably got here at a result of watching my Harley-Davidson Videos on YouTube. Thank you for watching and thank you for taking the next step to support me in delivering the best H-D content available online.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal has been to give my viewers the best information about the greatest motorcycle brand in the world - Harley-Davidson.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I have done this, I have had an overwhelming response of people telling me all about their personal bikes and stories of riding them. I have loved it! It\u0027s been great communicating with people from all over the world. I\u0027ve gotten thousands of comments on my videos and direct e-mails to my place of business - Laidlaw\u0027s Harley-Davidson. Many of these comments are questions about various subjects about H-D. I\u0027ve gotten questions on everything from motorcycle recommendations to technical mechanical trouble-shooting questions.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my goals has been to be very generous with sharing all the information I have in a transparent, non-bias way to my viewers. If someone has taken the time to leave me a comment then I feel obligated to try and respond to them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my channel has grown and the volume of comments has increased I have come to the reality that I just can\u0027t get to everyone. I feel bad when someone types out a huge question or entrusts me with an issue they are facing and I don\u0027t have the time to respond to everyone. Or when someone leaves me a voicemail at work that is from another state and I can\u0027t spend the time to call them back because it is outside the boundaries of productivity at my place of business.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I love what I do and I love the community that subscribes to and views my videos. So I felt like this was the best answer. For those of you that want to support me here on Patreon I will be answering and communicating with 100% of the people that leave comments on this page. I will still continue to communicate with people through other channels when I have time but this will be my first stop that I will always get back to everyone within 24-48 hours.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be posting additional content to my Patreon supporters here. I have some other ideas in the works as well. Thank you !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Matt was born into a family where riding Motorcycles is a way of life. At a very young age his father had him riding motorcycles out in the deserts of Southern California. His Grandfather, Bob Laidlaw, is the notorious founder of Laidlaw\u0027s Harley-Davidson (1958) located in the Greater Los Angeles area. Laidlaw\u0027s H-D is now one of the oldest and largest Harley-Davidson Dealers in California. After being brought up around motorcycles and working at the dealership off-and-on his whole life, Matt has settled into selling Harley-Davidson motorcycles full time for the last 11 years.\u003cbr\u003eAside from working in the motorcycle industry, \"riding\" has been a favorite hobby and pastime for Matt. Whether it be riding off-road or on-road, he enjoys \"throwing a leg over\" anything with two wheels.\u003cbr\u003eAfter years of riding and selling motorcycles, Matt found himself constantly giving out riding advice to friends and customers. He discovered that there are thousands of people that wish they could ride but just don\u0027t know where to start and learn. Since then, he has become involved in developing instructional videos to teach students \"How to Ride!\"\u003cbr\u003eAside from selling motorcycles, Matt has been Licensed in the state of CA as a Personal-Lines insurance broker for the past 8 years. During this time he has sold and managed hundreds of motorcycle insurance polices. He is also a certified Notary Public in CA.\u003cbr\u003eMatt has done work has a stunt rider in a public service announcement, TV ad, sponsored by the California Highway Patrol. The ad promotes safe riding between cars, motorcycles, and trucks.\u003cbr\u003eWhen he\u0027s not riding or working Matt is an advocate and student of heath \u0026amp; fitness with an emphasis in weight training. His other interests include WakeBoarding, Snowboarding, and YouTube content creation.\u003cbr\u003e",
