    "summary": "Hi all! My name is Majorshepard and I make Youtube Video Game playthroughs, usually of the RPG genre but I do play others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made this patreon so people have something that can directly contribute to the channel, and not have to turn off ad blocker to help support. Getting support from here will be a MAJOR boon to the channel as it will fund it a lot better than Youtube Ad revenue does currently, especially with the recent changes. As the support from here grows I will be able to do more for the channel, such as better editing, more games and possible giveaways in the future. I could also get custom artwork for the channel page and many more things that I hope you\u0027ll all enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be able to work on my channel full time, without worrying about having to reduce the amount of content I create, or stopping Livestreams completely. I do enjoy making youtube content that people actually watch and enjoy watching but I need to be able to support myself too. If you do decide to support me here you\u0027ll be greatly appreciated and I will do everything I can to show that in my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for visiting and I hope to see some of you around on here! See ya in the next video!\u003cbr\u003e"
