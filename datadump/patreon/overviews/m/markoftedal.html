I\u0027m making a comic book with my longtime friends at the \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WildlifeFriendsFoundation/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWildlife Friends Foundation of Thailand\u003c/a\u003e. The WFFT is home to 17 elephants, all rescued from the tourist trade. Together we\u0027re making a funny book about the serious issues elephants face in Thailand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"323\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4753/28238440099_b9ace25709.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic is called \u201cElephants: Wild Again!\u201d. It\u2019s is a story about a young elephant named Maek who is torn from the jungle by poachers and fights against greed and apathy to find his way back home.\u00a0You can read it as a weekly webcomic here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.elephantscomic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.elephantscomic.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been drawing it as fast as I can, but I need some help to finish it. That\u2019s where Patreon comes in. Patreon is a way for people to support projects they like on a monthly basis. With your support I can pay other artists to help color the book and get it done faster. If you want to chip in, you can pledge a small amount that will be billed at the end of each month. In return you\u2019ll get some little perks from me, not to mention the satisfaction that comes with raising awareness of the problems elephants face in the modern world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"240\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4698/39119513735_5af529039e_o.jpg\" width=\"668\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy raise awareness for elephants? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElephants are loved and revered in Thailand, where people pay to ride or take photos with them in trekking camps. But the high cost of breeding domesticated elephants fuels trade in wild caught babies. Usually the mother and sometimes her aunties are shot before the baby is captured.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"365\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4662/39986046912_50919d1564.jpg\" width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make a wild elephant controllable it must undergo a brutal training session called \u201cphajaan\u201d, which separates the elephant from their wild spirit. The elephant is bound and beaten for several days, until it loses its will to fight. Once the baby is tamed this way, it can be put to work for the rest of its life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"500\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4613/26144786268_bef3eaf041.jpg\" width=\"491\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes the elephant owner can\u2019t find work in an elephant camp, so they turn to begging on the city streets, where passersby pay to touch and feed the elephant.
