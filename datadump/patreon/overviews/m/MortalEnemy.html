    "summary": "What is MORTAL ENEMY?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWelcome, all! My name is Jon Malin, I\u0027m a comic book artist, better known for my art on comic book series including YOUNGBLOOD(IMAGE), THUNDERBOLTS(MARVEL), CABLE(MARVEL) in late January 2018 while coming in on 2 years at Marvel I became a major \"controversial figure\" within my industry when I began to speak out about ideologues within our industry, creatives and editorial that were contributing to bringing the comic book industry to it\u0027s knees, using political intimidation against artists and being aggressive towards our fans calling them Nazi\u0027s and calling for Nazis to be \"punched\" all because of political differences, they pushed the ideology into the comics and when fans asked them to chill they told fans to not buy \"their\" books, to lick certain orifices, or to f*\u0026amp;# off, openly on social media feeds.... the comics press and companies largely turned a blind eye for fear of reprisals, skeletons in their own closets or they shared the ideology. Well these aren\u0027t \"their\" books when they work for Marvel, DC or smaller press(that isn\u0027t creator owned) and so many came to my support including the founding PATRONS found here as a group most commonly referred to as Social Justice Warriors(SJWs) rallied for my head, demanded I be fired, tried to paint me as ALT-RIGHT even though I support some Democrat and Republican views, I am a moderate that leans Libertarian that tries to warn people regularly of the dangers of the far left and the far right because they are ideologues-- and I also voted for Obama but to them, clearly a racist, Nazi, bigot(all documented in my Twitter feed).\u00a0 I launched MORTAL ENEMY in an attempt to free myself from an industry that had begun to silence and devour it\u0027s own editorial, talent and fandom.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Think of MORTAL ENEMY as a fan club, not a fan of me but comics and the usual related things like movies, video games, cartoons, board games, card games like MAGIC or whatever you want in what is considered \"geek culture\" and what I hope to one day be a FANTASTIC fan club that covers a bit of all these things! I\u0027m not here to police you, we act as adults here, I only ask that we do our best to be respectful to one another as we interact.\u00a0 Here Patrons get 1st look behind the scene views of my projects(and eventually others) be they personal projects or freelance for other companies. I created a Rewards Tier that will give you a monthly HIGH RES image that you can have printed for yourself, well worth the $10 in an of itself. In addition I\u0027ll be making YouTube content as well including live chat where we can all gather in real time. Ultimately after I have raised enough to support myself and my art/video production I will expand by purchasing more and more content to give to you from other content creators, they may be you! My goal is that people ultimately not need to pay more than a dollar after we build a strong community and that you get the ultimate bang for your buck, like building a full time YouTube station with tons of content for you to choose from including Patreon exclusives and publishing a line of comic books and even prose-- but this is further down the road, right now the goal is simple, survive and produce. SO if you haven\u0027t pledged yet please do, a buck is all I ask, though if you can afford it, larger pledges are appreciated in these early days until we safely pass the Autonomy goal, this will, after taxes allow me to work full time building MORTAL ENEMY into a place you want and need to visit daily as we pull more and more content providers in to give you cool and fun stuff. Ultimately for just one buck a month you will have more content than you can handle. Thank you and I hope you\u0027ll offer your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Jon\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

You have the abilities of all below you. Emperors also will help make certain creative decisions including picking the next months HIGH RES D/L topic and video ideas for the month. They will also receive copies of any physical products made through Mortal Enemy including a full figure commission of their favorite comic character of their choice every 6 months which is worth the value you pay alone. The more members MORTAL ENEMY gains allows us to become a more serious publisher of physical content and because of that the more product Emperors receive, so we hope you will be an advocate for promoting MORTAL ENEMY whenever possible but not required.",
