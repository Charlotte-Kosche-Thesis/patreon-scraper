    "summary": "Hi, friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay,\u00a0so I\u2019m an author living in the Western Mass area. I got my undergrad in Creative Writing and\nhave been working at my MA on a part-time basis for the past few years. Almost\nthere. Almost.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, I\u0027ve published a handful of \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Epi-Arias/e/B005DTIQT0\"\u003ebooks\u003c/a\u003e so far, mostly poetry collections, one book of short\nfiction, and one hodge-podge compilation of aphorisms.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve also been writing op-eds sporadically for Disinfo.com\nand generally trying to stay busy with a host of other \u003ca href=\"http://epiarias.wixsite.com/citizenzero\"\u003eprojects\nand miscellaneous hobbies\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhich brings me to the graphic novel! Okay, so you know that\nannoying feeling where you suddenly find yourself in college, and you have\nabsolutely NO effing clue what the hell to focus on?!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, that kind of happened to me, mostly because I never\nthought that I could make a living off of writing. So I tried this and that,\nfocusing on the things that I loved the most. And then it hit me, MOOOOOVIES!\nIt was then that I decided to go for a Filmmaking major, which I stuck with for\nabout a year before switching over to Creative Writing, for a more expansive exploration of my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the interim, I learned all I could, made a couple shorts,\nand got deep into screenwriting. After some practice runs, I wrote a script\nentitled \u003cem\u003e3 Things About Marta La Paz\u003c/em\u003e, which I promptly entered into\nthe \"American Screenwriting Competition\" by Flatshoe.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI waited for a few excruciating weeks for the results and\nthen they were in! \u003ca href=\"http://www.flatshoe.com/quarterfinals.html\"\u003eQuarter-finalist\nposition!\u003c/a\u003e Not bad, right? Granted, I was bummed that I didn\u0027t win\nfirst place, but still! It was my first full-length script and here I was, a\nquarter-finalist in a national screenplay competition presumably competing\nagainst professional screenwriters and other serious film aficionados! Boom!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNeedless to say, it was super validating, so I kept working\non the script over the next few years, working and reworking it until it was\nshinier then ever. But the central question still loomed: what was I going to do with this thing? I\ndidn\u0027t want to option it, because I wanted to retain full control over it. After\nall, it was \"my baby\", and you don\u2019t just give away, or sell,\u00a0your baby! I\u0027m\nno monster! :P\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyway, the question still remained, what to do with it? It\nwasn\u0027t until after I decided to have some artists draw-up storyboards for a\ncertain scene that it occurred to me how perfectly the script lent itself to\nthe graphic novel medium, a medium that I very much LOVE and respect! Plus, I still\nhadn\u0027t completely forgotten that vague little whisper, that tiny dream in the\nback of my head of writing comics one day. The dream!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo here I am, with a great colorful story and access to a\ntop level illustrating talent but, alas, next to no funds with which to pay them. This is why I\u0027m here, to find a way to focus all my attention on the project and compensate my small team. I intend on adapting my script to graphic novel format (and who knows, maybe with the attention garnered by its publication, I\u2019ll already have a script ready for a film adaptation).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what\u0027s it about? Here\u0027s a brief story pitch:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\"Marta LaPaz is quirky. Marta LaPaz is funny. Marta\nLaPaz is\u2026suicidal. 3 things about Marta LaPaz is the story of a suicidal\nhotline operator whose every attempt at offing herself is botched by fateful\nintervention, at least until she falls head first into a love triangle that\nturns everything upside down. Has death finally caught up with Marta? Or will\nlove find her first?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe following are a few storyboard stills from one of the sequences in the project. The sketches constitute a brief narrative sequence and are not renderings\nof the graphic novel illustrations themselves; they are simply conceptual in nature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to give you all an idea\nof what angled me in the direction of going with this medium. In the following sequence, the main character, Marta, comes home to her lonely apartment. As we get a glimpse at her kitchen, we also get a look at the seemingly mundane paraphernalia that she has previously used to attempt suicide, to no avail, of course.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://adjustingperiod.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/mlpanimatic_0_17-5.jpg?crop\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg
