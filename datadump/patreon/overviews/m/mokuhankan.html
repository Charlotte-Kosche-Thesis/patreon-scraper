I have been making woodblock prints here since the mid-1980s, but you probably might know me best as the leader of the team that makes the \u003cstrong\u003eUkiyoe Heroes\u003c/strong\u003e series of woodblock prints - you know, the ones that feature\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://mokuhankan.com/heroes/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eparodies of video game characters\u003c/a\u003e in the traditional Japanese \u003cem\u003eukiyo-e\u003c/em\u003e style. These are designed by Jed Henry, and carved and printed here in our Tokyo workshop.\u003cbr\u003e\nOur print business is fairly successful, so why am I here on Patreon, asking for support?\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe long story is told in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdRcaZtXRDk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea video presentation\u003c/a\u003e I have prepared, but the short story is easy: although our printmaking venture is indeed doing quite well, we are chronically short of funds due to the intensive hand-made nature of our work and the very high costs involved with producing our prints. Because of this, we have great difficulty getting new projects started - projects that are very important for our future development and stability.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo we are asking our community of fans and supporters to back us here on Patreon. We are asking for a monthly pledge, of whatever amount you can afford, and in return, we will keep you updated on exactly how your funds are helping us, and of course we promise to keep producing our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/seseragistudio/videos\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esteady stream of YouTube videos\u003c/a\u003e that let people see how our prints are made. (All of our videos will remain open for everybody to view, not just the Patreon backers.) Details on how we are getting started with this - on the initial projects that your money will be used for - are outlined on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/why-patreon-8792885\"\u003ethis post\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for considering support of our work.
