    "summary": "My name is Max Adara. I enjoy capturing moments in time and the world around me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe beautiful, the ugly, the inspiring. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0A few ideas in my notebook that I\u0027m looking forward to working on include a self portrait project embodying powerful women throughout history as they would be in this day and age, I want to photograph the birds and plants around me and learn as much about them as possible, and I want to document the landfills and the immense amount of trash that humans create.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 My favorite thing about photography is how it allows you to see the way others see the world, and for you to share your view of the world with others. I love the tangible recollection of a moment in time holding a photograph in your hand gives you. And how it has the power to transport you to that very moment, whether you were there or not.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0I have grown up in a digital age where photos live on computers and smartphones, but they just do not have the effect as the photograph prints my grandmas have boxes of from my childhood, or the albums from my parents childhoods, or the treasured envelope of photographs of my grandparents and great grandparents lives and portraits of the ancestors that came before them. I spent two years in a photography class in high school hoping to learn how to develop my own film. We had the room and the equipment but were just never able to get ahold of the chemicals, and after not being able to find a film class at Columbus state that dream has sadly gotten away from me. I have compensated for the quality film photographs possess by finding a way to use old manual lenses that just seem to capture more of the light and soul and history of things. To me at least. But I would absolutely love to learn the process and to set up my own black room and experiment with the rolls of film I have shot over the years. I dream of one day standing in a room surrounded by prints of my own work in frames that I build with my own hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0I do not yet know what I want to do with photography. If I want it to remain a hobby or if I want to turn it into a profession. But I know I want to continue shooting photos for the rest of my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0If you would like to plant a seed and support my dreams please take a look at the tiers and rewards I have set up. I will be shooting daily no matter what but any and all support will just give me more motivation to do more and make more with my work."
