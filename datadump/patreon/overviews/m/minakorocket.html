    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started back in high school when there were so many people who had the same name as me. I was your unpopular quiet girl who spent most of her time buried in game guides or manga. A friend of mine in a crowd was calling for me but I was pretty used to hearing my name and it never being referred to me. After several attempts to get my attention I heard \"MINA!\" My head snapped up and I looked over my shoulder. Thusly my internet handle became the name I responded to better than my birth name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that doesn\u0027t explain who I am really! I am your friendly YouTuber who is fanatical about games and anime in general. I have a deep passion for entertaining people through my gaming. I am definitely not the most skilled nor am I a comedian but I do try to put my thoughts out on display for everyone. My goal as a YouTuber and as a person in general is to try to create a positive force in the gaming community at large. I believe that gaming is one of the most beautiful mediums out there. If I even inspire one person to think better of gamers in general or get one person to enjoy my content then I will feel that this is all worth the effort!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Are You Funding?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently, I do not receive any money for my streams from Twitch, nor my videos on YouTube. While this is a hobby of mine, I would like to ideally make this a full time job. Unfortunately, with 0 revenue coming in from said hobby, I can\u0027t reasonably pour additional effort into what I am doing than what I currently have set in place. I have tried to consistently upload high quality videos and content in the past, but it takes an incredible amount of time to record/edit/polish/upload everything. Said time takes away from a \"real job\" and also cuts into free time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have mostly bought everything I need currently to keep my project afloat. I have a capture card, new3ds capture system, mic and stand, I don\u0027t have a mixer but I think we\u0027ll be fine for now. But what I don\u0027t have is time/money for living expenses to completely ignore getting a job and focus on this as a real job and no longer a hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from living expenses (which are, just getting food in my mouth, my dog\u0027s mouth, my 2 cat\u0027s mouth, and paying rent) the rest of the money will go towards buying more equipment, games \u0026amp; consoles, improvements to the let\u0027s play format, more professional setup.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Fund Me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI hope that it is because you like my Let\u0027s Plays or my streams! Secondly because you know that I will keep my promises. I desperately want to make quality videos which is why I\u0027ve spent thousands of dollars on the equipment that I own. If we can raise enough money I would like to upload a 20-30 minute Let\u0027s Play episode every single day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will \u003cstrong\u003eNEVER\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0put my content behind a paywall. \u003cstrong\u003eThe patreon for my channel exists only to improve what I have set up in place and to only add more for my fans in the future. \u003c/strong\u003eYou should never feel pressured into giving me any dollar amount under any circumstance. I will find a way to keep content rolling on my site even without a dollar coming in. If you want to support me but cannot afford to do so the best way to support me for free is by just hitting the Like button and staying subscribed or sharing videos with friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut for those of you who support me at higher tiers, I will definitely give you rewards, shout-outs, and even be a part of the channel.\u003cbr\u003e"
