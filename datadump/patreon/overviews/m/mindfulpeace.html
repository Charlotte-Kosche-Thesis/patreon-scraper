    "summary": "Why do people meditate? I think there are a lot of reasons. Some are seeking answers about their place in the world. Some want to reduce anxiety. Others want to calm their mind, find spiritual fulfillment, or simply relax. I think that all of us, in some way, are searching for inner peace; for a means to navigate a pathway through our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy goal is to create the most effective and highest quality meditation sessions available on the internet. Each video places focus on a carefully selected subject matter and features an original studio-quality narration, composed soundtrack, and HD visuals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HT_ZvD94_kE\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started creating meditation videos because of my own struggle with anxiety. It got me asking the question of what kind of meditation sessions would be most beneficial to me. After posting several of them, and subsequently receiving tens of thousands of views, it became clear to me that there are many like myself who are seeking a similar sense of calm and inner stillness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe wonderful part about meditation is that it requires absolutely nothing except your time, mental focus, and a comfortable space. As meditation is becoming increasingly popular, however, people are also seeking guided sessions to assist in learning the practice and understanding it\u0027s benefit.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2014/06/12/what-does-mindfulness-meditation-do-to-your-brain/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRecent scientific studies\u003c/a\u003e have even shown proven mental benefits to regular meditation practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI love to help people, and plan to always keep my meditation videos available for free. But, these videos do take time and effort, and even a small monthly donation will go a long way toward helping me devote the time to create more beneficial videos based on the numerous topic requests that I have received. Although there may sometimes be time in between creations, I will do my best to create videos as often as I can! Also, you can set a \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247,150,70);\"\u003emaximum monthly limit\u003c/span\u003e, so you will only donate to the maximum that you choose. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
