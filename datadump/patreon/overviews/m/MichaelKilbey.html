Drawing inspiration from a magnetism towards the night-time hours, and a romantic yet, at times, desperate sense of alienation from Earth as we know it, forthcoming debut album \u2018Return To Ours\u2019 marks a bold and adventurous musical journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis melodic writing has been likened to artists spanning David Bowie, Pink Floyd, The Smiths, Radiohead and Jeff Buckley whilst the modern-day music fan might place him somewhere among Coldplay, Bastille and Elbow. Meanwhile, his honest, soulful and distinctly English tone of voice has drawn comparison with the late Nick Drake.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA self-taught guitarist and pianist, arrangements range from scintillating, full-borne epic rock, to more stripped away, intimate, vulnerability-exposing singer-songwriter fair. \u0027I believe each song creates its own world\u0027, he writes. \u0027Each piece should be an adventure in its own right\u0027. \u003cbr\u003eKilbey explores the themes of time, betrayal, romance, fantasy, anxiety and de-reality. But at the heart of his writing is something more poignant still: a sense of self-conflict, of spiritual wandering and dissatisfaction - a reflective dialogue with the self. \u2018My songs are mirrors. I go looking for myself in each one\u2019, he writes in his blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDemos of the album released online have been quick to draw a large online fan-base, attracting a fascinated following of over 50,000 followers on Twitter in just over 9 months, and earning a guest appearance \u0026amp; live acoustic set on BBC 3 Counties Radio. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith BBC Radio 6 also quick to endorse his distinct sound, and his newly assembled 5-piece band cutting its teeth at such esteemed London venues as The Water Rats \u0026amp; The Barfly to the fervent satisfaction of live promoters, Kilbey is poised to very aptly embody the yearning voice of the so frequently dubbed \u2018lost generation\u2019.\u003cbr\u003e",
