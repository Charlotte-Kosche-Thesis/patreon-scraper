My project is\u00a0\u003cem\u003eFINALLY\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0about to go full steam ahead.\u003cbr\u003eBefore I begin I need to say how incredibly important your contributions over the past has been. While the amount of CITY OF SIN content is pretty low right now, I would have never gotten this far without you guys. If you are a long time supporter keep reading because there\u0027s a surprise I\u0027m getting to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut first.\u003cbr\u003eALL PATRONS!\u003cbr\u003eAll of you folk who follow along with my project also obtain access to ALL of my early content INCLUDING \u003cem\u003eSpider-Dubs\u003c/em\u003e and all the other bullshit I put out on my youtube. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eCITY OF SIN\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eSo if you\u0027re new or haven\u0027t figured it out yet. CITY OF SIN is a interconnected anthology series. Stories told over various forms of diverse content, including an animated series, short films, audio plays and even interactive digital and physical forms. With your help I\u0027ve already put content out like \"The Archeologist\" (Art by\u00a0@KylerRamos) and the first episode of an animated series \"Lifes Of Lisa\" (Art by\u00a0@AnnWard91) this is just a TINY TINY taste of what I intend CITY OF SIN to produce at a pretty consistent rate one day soon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE GOALZ\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon page is to fund the wide variety of content for CITY OF SIN.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI plan on hiring artists, writers and other content creators. They will be encouraged to create with as much free reign as possible. My intention is for this content to have a huge range of different tones and styles. Allowing each of these creators to bring in their own unique vision and insight. All running concurrent with each other. As this patreon grows so will the quality and speed of this project. Right now CITY OF SIN may seem scattered and directionless but I\u0027ve always had pretty long term goal/idea for this series, I wouldn\u0027t be asking for help if I didn\u0027t know where I want the story to eventually go.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREWARDS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to involve\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003efans/donors in the story of CITY OF SIN. \u003cbr\u003eWith an exclusive access to interactive content that adds to the story and mystery of the series.

I really wished I could have put this project into gear much much earlier but there were things in my life that needed sorting before I could hop back on the content train. I want CITY OF SIN to be the best it can be and if I had put out content while sorting, I feared the quality of the project would suffer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeeping track of you goons can be a little tricky but I\u0027ve comprised a list of the patrons eligible for the first physical evidence pack for your long dedication to my stuff. \u003cbr\u003eOR you just forgot to remove this patreon from your credit card, WHATEVS BRUH.\u003cbr\u003ePLEASE confirm yourself if you are on this list so I don\u0027t send a wacky pack of hoohaw to some dopey rando!
