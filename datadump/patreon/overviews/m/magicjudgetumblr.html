    "summary": "Hi everyone!\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by my new Patreon page. With your support, I\u0027ll be able to keep answering all of your MtG rules questions over at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://magicjudge.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e magicjudge.tumblr.com\u003c/a\u003e for years to come! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"But don\u0027t you do that already? Why should I support something you\u0027re already doing?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eSure, but in the past year or so, I\u0027ve had less time and energy to devote to my work on the blog. Turning what has been a hobby thus far into even a minor income stream will give me more time to focus on the blog. That means that I can be more responsive and more active like I used to be. I don\u0027t like that I\u0027ve been only answering questions once or twice a week lately.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"That sounds good, but will you do anything else? More of the same is just more of the same...\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI definitely want to! If I get enough support here, I plan on expanding my efforts to include more long-form content and maybe even branch out beyond writing to other media such as podcasts or video. (No promises on that, though.) I\u0027ll also do more writing on my personal blog (\u003ca href=\"http://jqlgirl.tumblr.com\"\u003ejqlgirl.tumblr.com\u003c/a\u003e) about my other involvement with Magic, such as deck techs and tournament reports for the decks and events I\u0027m playing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"What if I can\u0027t support you here on Patreon?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThen you can support me the same way you always have, but sending me great questions on tumblr and liking and reblogging my content there. None of my educational content will ever be locked away behind a paywall here or anywhere else. I\u0027m still here to help everyone in the Magic community, like I always have been.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"So I don\u0027t get anything special for supporting you?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI didn\u0027t say that. You don\u0027t get exclusive educational content, but I\u0027ll still do stuff to make y\u0027all feel special. The specific details of what that will be are still to be determined. If you\u0027re going to support me here, I want to hear what sort of perks you want!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you again for taking the time to look at this page, for being a supporter of my blog, and for maybe even supporting me financially. I appreciate all of your support so so much! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Charlotte"
