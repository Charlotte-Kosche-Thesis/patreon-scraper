We\u0027ve been \nproducing shows on a regular basis since March of 2012, and love it.\u003cbr\u003eWhile\n we have no intention of changing the show\u0027s free format, there are \nalways gear and software upgrades that would make things easier, cons \nwe\u0027d love to attend, and prize items we\u0027d love to buy. Donations are how\n this gets accomplished. \u003cbr\u003eWhile we have some pre-set amounts on \nthe side, you set the level to whatever you wish at the top. If you can \nonly donate \u00a2.25 a month, we\u0027re grateful to receive it.\u003cbr\u003eYou can cancel at any time here on this site, as well as modify your pledge to whatever level you like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eTopic Backers- \u003cem\u003eThe Fine Print\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\n cannot guarantee when a topic will be featured in a \nspecific episode. So choosing a Sponsor level will not guarantee that \nthe next recorded episode will feature your selection. It may well take \ntime to have the topic researched if it is something we\u0027re not already \nfamiliar with.\u003cbr\u003eWe also reserve the right to decline a topic. If we do, then we\u0027ll simply ask for another suggestion.\u003cbr\u003eChoosing topics isn\u0027t required. This is an option for our supporters as a thank you in keeping us going.\u003c/p\u003e"
