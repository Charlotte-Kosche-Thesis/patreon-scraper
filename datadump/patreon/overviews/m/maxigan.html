Chances are, unless you have come across this page by accident, you have already decided that you would like to help out financially and you already know why you\u0027re here. This Patreon account has been setup due to reasons I\u0027ve already explained to my viewers - ie: it has become quite difficult for people to send me any financial support via any other means. The only method that has worked so far, has been via direct bank account transfer that when done internationally, isn\u0027t always an easy thing to do. Because Patreon appears to use direct bank transfers, it seems like it provides a very useful interface that I can use to resolve my dilemma. So for those of you who already know why you are here, my thanks goes out to you for your continued support. For those who stumbled upon this by synchronicity and you\u0027re not really sure what all of this is about - I would like to encourage you to check out my YouTube videos and decide for yourself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo whomever may be reading this right now, if you are a listener of Surviving the Matrix or regular visitor to \u003ca href=\"http://thecrowhouse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Crowhouse\u003c/a\u003e, I ask you to please consider that it is only your contribution that keeps me on air, keeps the Crowhouse website going and allows me to continue to produce informative \nmaterial. I have managed to do the last 8 years mostly with my own funding but now, as much as it pains me to have to do so, the time come has come for me to ask for assistance in order to continue. Without listener support I will soon be unable to do so but the more support I can gather, then the more material I can produce and the more people we can reach. If you have been a long time listener of Surviving the Matrix and have gotten something from the weekly shows and from my films and you would like to see the broadcasts continue and more films produced, I ask you to please consider supporting and sharing this campaign. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for stopping by and I wish you all things good on your lifes journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love to all\u003cbr\u003eMax Igan\u003cbr\u003e"
