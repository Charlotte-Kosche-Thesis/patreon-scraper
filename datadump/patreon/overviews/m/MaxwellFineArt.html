    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.imgur.com/a/KOuha\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Maxwell\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eand I make things, lots of things -\u00a0props, costumes, masks, puppets, sculptures, paintings, you name it. This is my full time job and its the most fulfilling thing I could be doing. I\u0027m lucky enough to have a wife who loves me and supports all of my endeavors no matter how ridiculous and a family who loves my artwork and wants to see me succeed. With the support of my friends and family I have finally decided to pursue my dream and make it a career. Now, I\u0027d like to share my passion for art and creativity with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve loved to draw and paint since I was a kid, I\u0027ve been building things with legos or k\u0027nex since before I can remember, and one of the big tragedies of my childhood was losing a bunch of Capsela sets in a car fire. Sometimes when I think back on that day I can still smell the foul smoke and hear those poor Capselas screaming to me as the flames clawed at their fragile plastic bodies, \"Why Max?! Why didn\u0027t you save us?!\" Sometimes you just have to live with regret. I mean the whole \u0027now we don\u0027t have a car\u0027 thing was a bummer too but I was like 5 so I was just upset about my toys. Anyway, I\u0027ve always liked to build stuff and draw things and have flashbacks, and now I\u0027m good at all three! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the years I have done as much as I can to further my skills in both fine art and craftsmanship, taking classes, painting commissions, and designing sets and props for theaters and other organizations in the area until now, I think my work speaks for itself. The only problem with that is it doesn\u0027t really let you stretch those creative muscles and just make what you want. So, I\u0027ve started a YouTube channel and this Patreon page where I can continue to be creative and artistic on my own terms. The goal of this page is to make something new every week along with build videos, progress updates, tutorials, interviews with other artists, Q\u0026amp;As, and as much artistic content as I can manage. In order to do this though I need the support of people dedicated to furthering the arts which makes Patreon the perfect community. Plus, it gives me a platform to give back to my supporters. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be posting new projects every week on Monday with behind the scenes videos, progress updates, and tutorials trough out the week. Plus some cool extras every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease consider becoming a patron and helping me create more in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can see more of my work by visiting:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.MaxwellGMiller.com\"\u003ewww.MaxwellGMiller.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMaxwellMakeIt on Etsy\u003cbr\u003e\n@MaxwellFineArt on all social media\u003cbr\u003e"
