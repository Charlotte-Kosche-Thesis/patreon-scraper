    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is\nMaja Stabel and I\u2019m a Norwegian fashion designer, teacher and illustrator. I would be thrilled if you want to join me on this journey of drawing, designing, making and crafting. I get a rush from making things - it\u0027s a pretty special feeling to be in this flow of creating and I would love to show you how I work and inspire you to start crafting and creating yourself! I draw and make clothes and would like to share both worlds with you. I draw with my left hand even though I\u0027m right handed and I make clothes with as little waste as possible - a practice called zero waste fashion design. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCould you say a\nlittle about what zero waste design is and your fascination for it?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nZero waste design within the fashion industry is about\npattern construction - about designing waste out of the production of\nclothes. I have\nfigured a way to do this by only putting different sized rectangles together as\na jigsaw puzzle.\u003cbr\u003eThe idea is\nthat this pattern should fit the fabric roll and not waste anything, but this\nis not always easy to attain as different fabrics has different width. That\u2019s\nwhy I want to underline that it\u2019s the principal that is important here where we\ntry to waste as little as possible and if there are any scraps left it\u2019s\nusually rectangled and you can use it to make shoppingbags or maybe you can add\nanother detail to your item! If the pattern doesn\u2019t fit your fabric \u2013 either\nbecause the fabric width is too small or you have added centimeters to make the\nitem bigger I would recommend to just puzzle the pattern pieces together as\nbest as you can on the fabric \u2013 as they\u2019re all rectangles it should be quite\neasy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause\nthis is another thing I need to pinpoint; I\u2019m not a perfectionist \u2013 far from\nit! I love to work spontanously and intuitively and add fabric pieces as I go.\nActually this way of designing is a reversed process where you start with the\npattern and figure out a way to make it work with the fabric you got instead of\ndesigning a finished item on a piece of paper. And this\nis what I love about it; that you are challenged to find new solutions and that\nyou have to be creative with what you got. So jump in there and use my patterns\nas a base, but by all means; be creative with it if you feel like it! Find your own solutions and twists and try\nto make use of all the fabric you got. The focus is not on the technical side of sewing, but on the creative side ;) \u00a0When you distance yourself from the\nconventional way of constructing patterns, zero waste design can be a tool for\ninnovation. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53fb160ee4b0f4016594ca71/t/56d2c55e859fd06681854245/1456653669657/?format=750w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSizes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI work with\none size only and this would probably fit an European size 38-40 . With that\nsaid I make clothes that are meant to be loose so it would probably fit a 42\nand be perfectly oversized for a size 36. I would recommend that you make your\nmeasurements (around the breast, the waist and the hips) and either add or cut\ncentimeters to make it fit you. Try a bit and see what works for you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was your motivation for bringing zero waste\nfashion design to the home sewing market?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI really wanted to have a\nsustainable business model that was different from the conventional one where\nyou produce new collections all the time that encourage consumerism and\ncontribute to a growing waste problem.  I wanted to cut the production\nface - at least the one where I produce a bunch of clothes in India or China\nand would be forced to sell a huge quantity of clothes to make it go around.\nProbably I would have to sell a lot on sale as well because it\u0027s impossible to\nestimate how much you are going to sell.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThen I thought that the way I make\nmy zero waste patterns are very easy to learn and understand, so why not make\npeople produce their own clothes? Last year I studies pedagogics and discovered\nhow much I enjoyed teaching. I ran a zero waste assignment in a class and it\nwas so much fun so that\u0027s when I figured I could run my own zero waste\nworkshops as well. And now I had two successful workshops! Then a friend of\nmine tipped me about this amazing page where I could put out my patterns and\npeople could subscribe and I couldn\u2019t be more excited about it! Hopefully this\ncan help me explore zero waste design even more and at the same time I get to\nshare it with the world in the most sustainable way (no wrong productions, big\nstorages, shipping\u2019s around the world, poor working conditions etc etc.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLove to see your finished zero waste clothes on Instagram - tag me @majastabel ;)\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m truly grateful that you support my work and for those of you that want to use my patterns; I wish you the best of luck with the sewing and don\u0027t hesitate to ask questions :) Enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e//Maja\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
