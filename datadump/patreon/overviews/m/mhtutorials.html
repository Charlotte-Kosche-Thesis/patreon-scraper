    "summary": "Hey there ! It\u0027s so cool to see you here.\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Mike and I am a freelance 3D / CG / Photo / Film and FX tutorial creator on YouTube, but there is a chance you already know what I do and who I am if you ran into one of my YouTube channels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter many years of wearing a suit and tie and spending my days in a corporate office I decided it was time to do the other thing. The thing that I have been dreaming about all these years. So as a result a few years ago I decided to start a YouTube channel dedicated to tutorials on 3D modeling, texturing, lighting, rigging and animation. And recently I added to that by starting MH Tutorials 2, dedicated to Photo, Film and FX tutorials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow everything I publish on YouTube and my website is free for everyone to watch and enjoy. You don\u0027t \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eto\u003c/em\u003e become a Patreon to view my website or videos. Contributing on Patreon is a choice, not a requirement. Which is one of many reasons I like it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main goal is to provide free lessons for anyone who made need them, free of charge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why am I on Patreon ?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are all kinds of expenses that go into my website, my video productions, but also into software and hardware .  From camera\u0027s, editing equipment to website hosting and email services, everything adds up. Yes, I do make a small amount from ads on my YouTube channel and I am lucky to have a channel sponsor that covers some of the costs but its not nearly enough to cover the expense of keeping it all up. \u00a0Just to put things into perspective, you would have to watch one on my videos 1,000 times and then watch the ad completly every time for me to make USD 1,-.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate dream would be to do this fulltime. So spend all my time helping you guys on your path into the 3D, Photo or Film world. But like I said, software and hardware ( specially in the 3D world ) is very, very expensive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you decide to support me through Patreon you will enable me to move closer to my goal and at the same time help a lot of young people get started in their 3D or Movie career.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnd for that I say Thank You !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is Patreon ?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully this video will explain :\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/wH-IDF809fQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/wH-IDF809fQ\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
