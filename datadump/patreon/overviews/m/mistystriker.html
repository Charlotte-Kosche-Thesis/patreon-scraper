I\u0027m currently a tech student in my final year, but when I\u0027m not studying I\u0027m usually playing video games with my friends or drawing some kind of furry smut. I began drawing as a child and moved into furry art about 16 years ago. As much as I love it, art has never been more than a hobby for me. When Patreon came along, it gave me an opportunity to commit myself to something more concrete, and I have been offering up a steady stream of artwork consistently for two years with no sign of stopping now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this doesn\u0027t happen without your support. Your pledges allow me to spend more time drawing things that I want to draw. You help me have fun and test out my skills while developing new techniques and trying something I may not have tried before. Best of all, I get to interact with you, my audience. I -love- hearing your feedback and suggestions, and establishing new friendships with long-time supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e===== INFO =====\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ\u003c/strong\u003e. What kind of content do you produce?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA\u003c/strong\u003e. First and foremost, furry artwork. Within that niche, my interests are broad and varied. I like a nice tasteful pin-up, with or without clothes, but I can also happily go for some dirtier things. There are kinks within the spectrum but I don\u0027t go too extreme with anything I produce on Patreon. I try to aim for a broader appeal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ\u003c/strong\u003e. Do you livestream?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA\u003c/strong\u003e. This one is sadly a bit complicated. Due to my timezone and the limitations of a terrible telecommunications infrastructure, I do not currently stream on a regular basis. It is something I would like to do, but right now I have no set schedule and stream irregularly when the mood strikes me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ\u003c/strong\u003e. Why don\u0027t you offer PSD files like a lot of other artists?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA\u003c/strong\u003e. The short answer here is: I don\u0027t think anyone would really benefit from them. The other artists who offer PSDs have a much higher talent level - there\u0027s a market for it. If enough people approached me wanting unflattened PSDs, it\u0027s something I would consider, but as it stands, the demand isn\u0027t there right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ\u003c/strong\u003e. Do I miss out on any of your art if I don\u0027t pledge?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA\u003c/strong\u003e. No. The artwork I produce ends up on all my online galleries. However, if a pin-up has multiple versions such as different stages of undress, I will generally only post two of the versions publicly. This is basically to save spamming my galleries with too many copies of a similar picture.\u003cbr\u003e"
