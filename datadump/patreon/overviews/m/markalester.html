I make up stories. I draw stuff. I\u2019m nicer than I look. I can eat standing up. I\u2019m pretty smart. I\u2019m not as tall as I think. I write stuff. I can count to ten. I don\u2019t like math. I don\u2019t believe what others believe. I am obsessed with things most people don\u2019t think about. I don\u2019t care what people think. I don\u2019t smile much. That\u2019s not true. I like to laugh. Usually at you. I have a terrible memory. I prefer old movies. I prefer books over people. No one is honest. Not even with themselves. I think I\u2019m normal. I think I\u2019m the only one. People are strange. I\u2019m nicer than you think. Someone is reading this. I don\u2019t care if anyone cares. That\u2019s a good thing. No one cares. Nothing matters. I know how to lie. Life is fake. I like dreaming. I can sleep laying down. I\u2019m not funny. I think I am. I don\u2019t know anyone like me. I creep people out. I don\u2019t play well with others. I don\u2019t eat fast food. I like fast food. I like being around people who are passionate about something. I prefer being alone. There are a lot of artists better than me. I don\u2019t really care. I don\u2019t wish on stars. I love old radio dramas. I don\u2019t listen to much music. I think Sean Connery made the best 007. I don\u2019t care for phones. I like to sleep. I am a very spiritual person. I don\u2019t agree with anyone about anything. I think I\u2019m right. I never yell. I hate drama. I can\u2019t cook. I like pulp magazines. I like science fiction. I think it\u2019s more true than \u201creal life\u201d. I don\u2019t care for material things. That\u2019s good. I have nothing. I never leave. I\u2019ve been left before. I didn\u2019t like it. I won\u2019t tell you what I don\u2019t want you to know. I have a sarcastic sense of humor. I think I\u2019m funny. I\u2019m a romantic. I\u2019m usually alone. I want to live forever. I think I will. I live the life I choose. I make no apologies. Most people think I\u2019m strange. They\u2019re right. And it really doesn\u2019t matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked as an artist/writer and designer for over two decades. My work has appeared in comic books, comic strips, magazines, newspapers, trade publications, on numerous websites and and various advertising campaigns.\u003cbr\u003e"
