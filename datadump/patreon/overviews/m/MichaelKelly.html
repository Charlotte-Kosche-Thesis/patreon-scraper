    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for making your way to my Patreon page\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst, a little about myself:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a genuine pleasure to welcome you here. My name is Michael, and I\u0027m a singer / songwriter and medieval reenactor, with a special love of the Celtic style of singing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cover a wide range of folk music.. from sad but beautiful laments and period medieval ballads, to raucous drinking tunes and Irish rebel songs, to more contemporary fare, to random geekery like Firefly and Tolkien. Most of my original music sets elements of myth and fiction into a somewhat Celtic style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a Youtube artist, where I post recordings of many of the songs that I often sing in person at events and fairs. In the past, making videos has been a casual hobby, but with the help of my patrons here, I hope to pursue it in earnest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is this Patreon thing, anyways?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a kind of crowd-funding that encourages artists (particularly ones who create and release content that\u0027s free to view, such as Youtube videos) to create more, by rewarding them for what they create. It gives artists a way to survive on their art, and gives fans a way to offer meaningful help and encouragement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to become a patron, you agree to pledge a small amount of money every time your artist creates and releases a new work. In my case, every time I record and post a new song on Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will you be posting? What if you post too many things all at once? Won\u0027t that be expensive?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan on eventually releasing a new music video every week, but no more than that. Of course, Patreon allows you to put a limit on how many songs your pledge can be applied to in a single month. That way you can never be surprised by donating more than you expect to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much should I pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s entirely up to you. Every dollar makes a huge difference, with enough patrons pitching in. However, I would strongly encourage you to choose a pledge amount that\u0027s \u003cem\u003elow\u003c/em\u003e enough to comfortably support up to 4 songs per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would much rather receive $1.25 for each song that I release,\u00a0 than a single $5 pledge for the first song and nothing for the work that I do over the rest of the month. Consistency is the best way to keep me motivated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWouldn\u0027t it be easier to just to donate by the month, rather than by the song?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, but this way you can be sure that your pledge is making a visible difference. I only receive anything if I\u0027m actually \u003cem\u003emaking\u003c/em\u003e more videos, so it\u0027s a better structure to keep me consistently creating new content for you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen is my account charged for all of my pledges?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the first of every month. Regardless of whether I\u0027m posting new content twice a month or once a week, Patreon settles all accounts as a single charge on the 1st of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIsn\u0027t your content on Youtube free to watch? What\u0027s the point of pledging and paying for something that\u0027s already free?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are several benefits to becoming a patron. Among other rewards, you get access to patron-only newsfeeds to be kept in the loop on current and upcoming releases, and you get to hear the new songs up to several weeks before they\u0027re available to everyone else on Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the \u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e reason to become a patron is simply because you love and support the music, and want to see more of it. Your patronage allows me to do things like pay rent and buy food, as well as get to more events and keep my instruments and recording equipment in working order. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt allows me to share my music with the world and still live like a real person, instead of the sterotypical \u0027starving artist\u0027. It also encourages me to set up my equipment to record regularly every week, rather than just occasionally when the mood strikes and time permits. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps just as importantly, it reminds me that there are people out there listening who are as passionate as I am about the music that I am making.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat all sounds great, but is there any other way I can help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in supporting my music outside of becoming a patron, I have CD\u0027s available for sale through Kunaki.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://kunaki.com/MSales.asp?PublisherId=141858\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://kunaki.com/MSales.asp?PublisherId=141858\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI also have MP3 downloads available through BandCamp\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://michaelkellymusic.bandcamp.com/releases\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://michaelkellymusic.bandcamp.com/releases\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, one of the most important ways that you can help is through word of mouth. If you enjoy what I do, please consider telling a friend about my music and my channel, and help me to share my videos with a wider audience.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo sum up:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt means the world to me that you have taken the time to come here and take an interest in who I am, the music that I make, and what Patreon is all about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you choose to become my patron or not, I\u0027d like to invite and encourage you to check out my channel on Youtube and share it with your friends. My music there will always be free to enjoy. Thank you for listening, and thank you for your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/BardMichaelKelly\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/BardMichaelKelly\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
