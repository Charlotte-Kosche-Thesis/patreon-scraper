Poetry is my life and love, and I\u0027ve been in this world for the past 10 years. I have 2 books out, present on BBC Radio 4, contribute to the NY Times, and teach creative writing at Cardiff University.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, these are all p/t / freelance jobs, I don\u0027t do them all the time and, as a result, I currently live in a caravan in West Wales, rather than in a mansion! I am very happy in my life but my writing sometimes falls by the wayside - poetry in and of itself is not really a paying art form, in the current climes, and I am motivated by creativity, rather than coin. Poets of the past, from Virgil to Shakespeare to Dylan Thomas, all had patrons, so I thought I would give Patreon a go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very grateful for any and all support. Every penny you give will go towards time I need for my writing and creating. I am currently working on a children\u0027s novel that has grown to a trilogy, plus a short fiction e-book (comic erotica!) which I would like to release soon. I also have another poetry collection I am putting together. You will gift me precious time to work on these. I want to buy paper and tools to create beautiful, bespoke pamphlets for my press, Black Rabbit, too. I\u0027ve always been keen to engage people in literature not just as readers but as writers, so I\u0027m massively grateful for your support in enabling me to do this - you will help poetry and writing thrive through all my many endeavours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much indeed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.\" - Hebrews 13:2"
