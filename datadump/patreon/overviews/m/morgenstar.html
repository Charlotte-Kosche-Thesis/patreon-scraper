If you haven\u0027t heard my songs before, stop reading this and go listen to one. Now that you\u0027re back presumably you never left, or you liked my music and came back for more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this and how does it work? \u003c/strong\u003eThis is my Patreon page.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eIn sum, how this works is patrons (that\u0027s you) give a small amount of money on a monthly subscription. There are patron tiers, starting at $1 and going as high as $20.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy would you want to subscribe to me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The more subscribers I have, the more income I get from making music, and the more music I can make for you. You can also think of my patreon page as a secret club for my biggest supporters. Meaning, you get access to all sorts of behind-the-scenes content, as well as final versions of things before I publish them, and much more. The perks vary based on how much you can give, but as far as I\u0027m concerned, no matter how much or how little you give, you will all be part of the same exclusive little family, so welcome friends!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere will your money go? \u003c/strong\u003eWell your money will go to two categories: one, my basic living expenses. No not lavish stuff, just like, groceries...and rent when I need to start paying that which will be soon. And two, my music production: new equipment, recording sessions, etc. Don\u0027t worry you aren\u0027t just giving me money for anything, you\u0027re directly supporting me making music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eP.S. \u003c/strong\u003eThe fact that anyone at all likes what I do and wants more makes my heart burst!! I just want to thank all of you a million times over from the bottom of my heart, for being part of this and making my dreams into a reality!!!\u00a0\u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003exoxo Morgen Star\u003cbr\u003e"
