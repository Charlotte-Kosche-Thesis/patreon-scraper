    "summary": "We have started a weekly show on youtube called \"Knitter Be Damned,\" which explores the lives, in a very humorous way, of two men that knit and crochet. With a beer and a good laugh we\u0027ve been called the \"bad boys of knitting.\" We\u0027re the \"Absolutely Fabulous\" of knitting, the \"Car Talk\" of crocheting. We have already completed three episodes, uploaded every Friday night. With your help we can expand our little operation, purchase a better camera, have the ability to invite people on our show, and some \"roving\" knitter reporting. The show is only approximately 30 minutes, but we film so much time that we cut most of it. Those deleted scenes, which are sometimes hilarious, and sometimes informative, will be uploaded here for your exclusive enjoyment. So, enjoy the show! And thanks for being our patrons! If you haven\u0027t seen one of our episodes, here is our first episode (caution! My husband Phillip gets vulgar for about 2 seconds at the beginning....he apologized in the next episode, but don\u0027t let his initial statement jar you :) )\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eGregory Patrick\u003cbr\u003e"
