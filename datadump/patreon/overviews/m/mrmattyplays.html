    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSalutations, everyone! It is Matty here and welcome to my Patreon page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been creating YouTube videos ever since I was 13 years old. At the age of 21, I am finally able to chase my dream alongside all of you! Together, we have grown closely as a community of 280,000+ subscribers through reporting on games, bringing optimism to this wonderful industry, and analyzing every nook and cranny of whatever we can get our hands on. With your help, we can take that style of game coverage to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"The Retrospective\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e is the video series I have dreamed about. A mixture of going in-depth on everything that makes certain games so special with a pinch of video game documentary sprinkled in. Digging deep into its world, art style, sound design, and other elements that combine to make our favorite games so appealing; mixing in developer interviews as well as studio tours all into one large creation!\u003cem\u003e\u00a0 \u003c/em\u003eOn the other side of the spectrum, these documentary styled videos can also help answer some of gaming\u0027s biggest mysteries. What went wrong with certain titles? Gamers deserve answers and I want to bring them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMore. That is the goal. More higher quality content for your viewing pleasure.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI want to create more of what you love from me. These are videos such as my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccNSB5FLaHA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ein-depth analysis\u003c/a\u003e, or my intriguing discussions on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TRlbBewdgE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour favorite game\u0027s biggest secrets\u003c/a\u003e. Plus,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TRlbBewdgE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003egame reviews\u003c/a\u003e that are jam packed with information and created solely for the consumer, as per usual. No sponsorships, no promotions. Just us and video games. On top of all that, let\u0027s bring back the infamous Matty streams on Twitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube ad revenue is remarkably inconsistent. One month\u0027s pay will be good, but then the next will be not so good. On top of that, YouTube has been paying creators less and less as the years go by. This is where Patreon comes in. With your support, this can become a sustainable full-time job for myself heading into the foreseeable future. If you have the means to do so, a small donation can go a long way, but you are not obligated. For perspective\u0027s sake, allow me to offer you some insight on how much of an impact your contribution can be.\u00a0I average between 10,000 to 30,000 viewers a video. If 10% of you, which is 1,000 - 3,000 viewers, skipped out on coffee once a month, and donated $1; I would have more than enough to accomplish what I set out to do here. Naturally, it would also help me pay for new equipment, bills, food, and other things humans need to live.\u00a0Patrons will receive access to my Discord chat for updates on future projects and exclusive information on upcoming episode of \"The Retrospective\" as well as my weekly Q \u0026amp; A series, and much more rewards that you will find on this page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to give me a chance. I hope you\u0027ll join me on the next chapter of this adventure and make the game\u0027s industry an even better place where we can create content that informs and excites the gamer.\u003cbr\u003e"
