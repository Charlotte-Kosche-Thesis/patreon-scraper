    "summary": "Hey, folks. My name is Ari Marmell, or \"Mouseferatu\" if you know me from any number of gaming forums. I\u0027m an author, working mostly in fantasy with occasional forays into horror and sci-fi. You may already be familiar with, for example, my \u003cstrong\u003eMick Oberon\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0fantasy-noir series, my \u003cstrong\u003eWiddershins \u003c/strong\u003eYA fantasy, or my tie-in work for properties such as \u003cstrong\u003eMagic: the Gathering\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0or \u003cstrong\u003eDarksiders\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ve also published a number of short stories. If you\u0027re only familiar with my work in role-playing games, well, welcome to the fiction side of things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://mouseferatu.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Mouse_divide.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why am I doing a Patreon, and what do you get out of it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, for one, I get to write, and you get to read, more--and more varied--fiction. Just for starters, with a successful Patreon, I\u0027ll need fewer small freelance jobs on the side, leading to more time for novels and short stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not just about more writing, though, but also about having more freedom in \u003cem\u003ewhat\u003c/em\u003e I write. If I\u0027m relying primarily on large publishers, I have to tailor most of my writing to what I think will interest a large publisher. If my Patreon is successful enough, I can spend some time on more experimental, less mainstream stuff. When I know there\u0027s already some money coming in, I can afford to do more work that I know might end up with smaller publishers or self-published.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I want to share not just the results with you, but the process. I\u0027ve got a variety of backer rewards that I think will interest a great many of you, and quite a few involve peeks behind the curtain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s make this happen. And thank you so much for your support--not just here on Patreon, but in general. There are no professional authors without readers like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://mouseferatu.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Mouse_divide.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhere to find me online:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mouseferatu.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emouseferatu.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/-/e/B001JSDH98\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Amazon author\u0027s page\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arimarmell.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Tumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mouseferatu\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Twitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mouseferatu/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Facebook writer\u0027s page\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
