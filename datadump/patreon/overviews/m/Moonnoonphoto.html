    "summary": "Moon Noon is a one woman show powered by a whirlwind of art and exploration that I finally decided to share with the world. Over ten years ago when I first started creating photographs I did it for myself. I did it plainly for my own self satisfaction and making trees into memories of something much larger. Out of sheer panic and desperation when I was nineteen I enrolled into a photography program in San Francisco, California. I uprooted myself from my humble East Bay beginnings and traveled to this world I vaguely knew existed. San Francisco is this stunningly beautiful, artistic, prideful landscape and I was thrown downtown into a renovated hotel with three people I didn\u0027t know (and two across the hall that basically lived with us). To say I found out who I am that year on Sutter Street is an understatement. \u003cbr\u003eBack to reality, it\u0027s five years later, I have a Fine Art degree and I\u0027m living three hours away from my second birthplace. It\u0027s been an odd year since graduation, sometimes you get lost and you have to find yourself again and Moon Noon is that for me. This time I don\u0027t want to do it alone. So if you\u0027re in need of inspiration, a heated political rant, that picture of that tree that reminds you of better days, or just someone that understands, I believe Moon Noon can be that for you."
