I\u0027m suffering from PTSD after an assault, and I also have brain damage and social anxiety disorder. I don\u0027t like sharing these details, and am seeking help with these afflictions and conditions, however I don\u0027t make enough money to keep afloat, fix my car, keep the lights on, pay the rent and internet. I\u0027m very close, and I don\u0027t require much in the way of donations. I do not want to be rich. I wish merely to survive. Even a total of a couple hundred a month would be a huge relief to me. This patreon is for those who want to support me and what I do. I can\u0027t focus entirely on youtube, what with the adpocalypse, and the fact I have under 300 subscribers. I need help, and am willing to give back. If there is enough pledges, I can focus entirely on my channel and provide you daily content. Please consider giving me a hand with life."
