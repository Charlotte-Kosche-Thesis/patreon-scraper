    "summary": "I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery day for 10 years I would wake up, clock in at the giant corporation I relied on to pay the bills, and lose a small piece of my soul. Then one day, I started animating. Something I had always dreamed of doing since I was in the 4th grade. I would draw and animate when I got home, and on my days off. I would stay up until 3am animating and wake up at 7am to go to the office. It was hard work but seriously rewarding once my characters began coming to life. I realized this was how I wanted to spend my life.\u003cbr\u003eSo, I took the plunge. I quit my soul sucking, corporate job and started a YouTube channel where I could present my animations to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI needed to pursue my dreams of being a YouTuber and prove that I could do it. It\u0027s been going well. I\u0027ve been making videos every day and everyone in my life has been super supportive (Except my father, who\u0027s set on a safe, grinding job. But even he\u0027s coming around).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnimations make pennies on the hour for all of that hard work. It\u0027s a shame but, animation really isn\u0027t profitable on YouTube. Currently I use Patreon to fund the animations, as well as spend money out of pocket from other views to keep them going. The more Patreon funds we have, the more we can invest in animators and the longer Mastar Media will survive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a baby on the way and I am going to need any help I can get!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat to Expect\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnimations take time. A LOT of time. Typically a 5-10 minute animation will take me anywhere from 200-400 hours. That means many 12-16 hour days grinding away at the tablet. I usually can produce one every month or two. But, in the meantime, I will produce YouTube videos on a daily basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money you contribute mainly helps pay for additional artists and landscape art that I pay for to increase the speed and quality of the animations. Your contributions go a long way in helping bring more support on board.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRewards and Prizes\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor all of my Patrons, I will include your names in the credits of my animations! You guys are contributing towards my dream and making it a reality, so you deserve at least that. Additionally Patrons get early access to footage from the animations, as well as anything else I create including HD Wallpapers and drawings, information, and more.\u00a0Your pledge will go a long way increasing the quality and speed of the production, as well as keeping the artists motivated."
