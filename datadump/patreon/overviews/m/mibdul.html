TWO is a story of a young boy dealing with a sudden family tragedy by delving into a fantasy world that feels as familiar as it is alien, and so in some ways is thematically similar to what\u2019s in store for Mibdul. But it\u2019s also thanks to Mibdul that Teodor is delving into his first love: a love for comic books, which he struggled to cultivate against all odds in late-90s Malta, joining a rag-tag but labour-of-love-enabled \u2018comic book club\u2019 which plied us with comics before he had access to a credit card\u2026 to say nothing of Amazon and other such providers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/teodor.reljic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/teodor.reljic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s20.postimg.org/vgi34763h/social_1_logo_instagram.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://teodoreljic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s20.postimg.org/ugrs8hqxp/social_1_logo_wordpress.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://s20.postimg.org/nino2jst9/profile_inez_circle.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eInez Kristina\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a Maltese-Norwegian illustrator and likes to keep her text short and straight to the point.

Less than half a million inhabitants, most of whom wouldn\u2019t \u2013 for a set of complex historical reasons \u2013 be caught dead with a book actually written and published here in Malta. So when Teodor first contacted me about a comic, serialised no less, with layers of weird piled onto layers of pulp, let\u2019s just say it wasn\u2019t the safest of bets. We\u2019re talking a few hundreds of copies of each issue, with a very low selling price if we\u2019re to have a fighting chance of selling them. But what\u2019s publishing without some uber-exciting projects to be working on? So I took it on \u2013 Teodor then brought in Inez, and her fresh, vibrant illustrations sealed the deal. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cSadly if we were going to make this kamikaze-project work, we were going to have to be realistic about costings. I\u2019m adamant about artists being paid their fair share on each project, but the fair share of tiny is tiny, so a concern from day one was that the royalties on Mibdul were never going to pay for Teodor and Inez\u2019s Caribbean vacation.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cWhich is why I\u2019m really excited about Teodor and Inez\u2019s decision to pitch their Mibdul work-in-progress on Patreon.

So we\u2019re asking you to give us a helping hand while we do our utmost to deliver a product that you\u2019ll love, and look forward to having in your hands each month. Things is, we all love to bitch about how stale and homogenous contemporary pop culture is becoming\u2026 and rightly so.
