But I need help supporting this \u003cem\u003eonslaught of art\u003c/em\u003e that feeds me so and brings joy to those around me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe thing most folks know me for is my \u003cstrong\u003emusic\u003c/strong\u003e; I\u0027ve been \u003cstrong\u003ewriting and performing songs\u003c/strong\u003e since as long as anyone in my life can remember, and over the last little while I\u0027ve picked up a...dare I say...modest?...following (\u003cem\u003ewe have fun together right guys?\u003c/em\u003e). For the most part my music is about empowerment and independence advocating for strength in individuals with a vein of melodrama meloncholica mixed in for good measure. I do love to write about sex and sexuality and power to exercise freedom with those things. And I put most of my music content on \u003cstrong\u003eYoutube, and Bandcamp,\u003c/strong\u003e for free download (or rather: \u003cstrong\u003ePay What You Want\u003c/strong\u003e). Once in a while I\u0027m gifted by some generous soul (usually family, occasionally my supportive partner), an instrument to \u003cem\u003efeed \u003c/em\u003emy \u003cem\u003eburning \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003ehunger \u003c/em\u003efor \u003cem\u003elearning \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003emaking sounds \u003c/em\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003edance\u003c/i\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also been known to write \u003cstrong\u003epoetry in my lil\u0027 brown book\u003c/strong\u003e, or \u003cstrong\u003eprinted\u003c/strong\u003e out, and more often than not colored and edited aesthetically for the internet because \u003cem\u003egood gracious\u003c/em\u003e ain\u0027t it so much fun all those shiny \u003cem\u003esliders \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ecolors\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cem\u003efilters\u003cstrong\u003e,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOH MY!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0You can pretty much count on them being on a subject \u003cstrong\u003eincluding but not limited to: Sex, menstruation, lovers, observations of every day life, and children.\u003c/strong\u003e Though I don\u0027t anticipate posting other people\u0027s poetry I am very fond of Charles Baudelaire and fancy myself some Ginsburg with my coffee.
