You may even have been a fan of my award-winning \"Cooking With Linux\" column that ran in the Linux Journal for more than 10 years. Since I stopped doing that column, I\u0027ve been asked many times to consider bringing it back in some way. Apparently, many of you miss sitting in my (virtual) restaurant, sipping wine and learning about cool free software. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, it\u0027s January 2018 as I write this and YouTube is a thing now. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve noticed. I have and that\u0027s why I\u0027ve decided to make YouTube videos as my way to continue \"Cooking With Linux\". All this takes time and effort and, as you\u0027ve all heard, time is money. So here I am on Patreon, asking for your support as I take Cooking With Linux into the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho knows? If I can make enough money here, I may even be able to re-hire Fran\u00e7ois, my long suffering waiter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat? You want to know what I mean by \"and more\"? Sure . . . your support here assists me in creating \"Cooking With Linux\" videos, but I will also share articles I write, gaming videos I release (yes, I play games), articles, blogs, and at some point, a podcast. I like to do and explore lots of things; I hope you enjoy the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks for your support."
