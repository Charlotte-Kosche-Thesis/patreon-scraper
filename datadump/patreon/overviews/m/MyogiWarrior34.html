    "summary": "He-hey guys, how\u0027s it goin\u0027? It\u0027s me, Myogi. Thanks so much for checking out my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor formalities sake, I\u0027m MyogiWarrior34, or \"Myogi\" as how my followers call me. I do lots of stuff actually: from lets plays, to mixed media machinima, to making an animated original racing story for everyone\u0027s viewing pleasure entitled \"Supido no Densetsu\" or \"Speed Legend\" in English. I\u0027m slowly expanding my repertoire to digital artworks as well of both cars and characters from my series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI primarily work with Youtube with respects to most of these mentioned above but they could only cater just as much; well not much but decent enough to keep me motivated. Not to mention living in a country where materials are priced high for the likes of me and my environment; it\u0027s a hard and challenging society I am dealing with at the quarter of my life\u0027s age (I\u0027m 25). With your help, we could actually see the goal in sight of what I want to achieve and what I want you all to witness and see. For the past 4 years, I\u0027ve been what you call a one-man-staff in production for the lets plays and the series combined. I\u0027m beginning to understand the purpose and efficiency of completing this as a team with less time wasted. I want to make lots of stuff and showcase it here; and get paid of course, but alas, I\u0027m but one man and thinking of material, creating it, editing it, and uploading it takes up a lot of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become my patreon, not only would you make the dream a reality, but you will definitely be duly credited for your generosity to the cause. Your contribution would greatly, and by greatly I mean A WHOLE LOT, increase the content QUALITY when I make these videos and make the series for you guys. It could be in the form of better equipment or getting someone to help out in production and have their talents duly paid for too, through your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to mention, I would even go out of my way to create something special for you upon your request - be it a requested battle (WMMT), draw you digitally in my series\u0027 art style, to making a cameo of you in my upcoming series episodes. I love you guys and I love to entertain you guys as well; I\u0027d want to keep doing this and continuously see you guys help increase the support you\u0027ve given me to even greater heights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeatured above, by the way, is the upcoming project I\u0027ll be undertaking which will totally get you guys excited for - Fujin: Tsuchiya Chronicles. More details to come and I hope you all support this~!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Myogi"
