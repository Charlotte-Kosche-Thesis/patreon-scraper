I love my job because I get to help people overcome their injuries and impairments and, ultimately improve their function - what could be better?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout a year ago, I decided to start a website, Michael Curtis PT, where I write weekly articles that take complex Physical Therapy-related topics, break down the evidence-based research, and create simple, digestible articles for everyone to benefit from.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt first this was scary - I had no idea what I was doing and also had no idea how people would receive it.\u00a0 I\u0027m happy to say, though, that Michael Curtis PT has developed an enthusiastic readership!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough it hasn\u0027t been easy, after writing over 50 articles and counting, one every single week since inception, filming videos, taking photos, writing a couple of ebooks, and helping create a Patient Education App for PhysioU, Michael Curtis PT has far exceeded my expectations of what it could become.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it\u0027s fun!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all the fun, though, comes a lot of time, sacrifice, and money.\u00a0 I regularly pour in 10-20+ hours per week, on top of my full-time job.\u00a0 Not to mention the personal cost of creating and sustaining a professional website.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI Now Know 2 things\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eMichael Curtis PT is giving thousands of people top quality information and I regularly receive glowing feedback - which lets me know \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m doing something right\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor Michael Curtis PT to be sustainable moving forward, it needs some funding\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0 I\u0027m asking you to help contribute to my efforts in helping a growing number of people every month overcome injury and impairments by improving their function.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eI don\u0027t really want to put a bunch of cheesy advertising on my website to earn a few bucks, because in my opinion, that takes away from the experience and might steer some visitors away.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in.\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eThe way Patreon works is a visitor can donate any amount per month - from $1 up - so even $1 contributed by a few awesome people can be hugely helpful over time.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027ll Use the Money For\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy initial goal is $100/month.\u00a0 That money will be enough to keep Michael Curtis PT going indefinitely.\u00a0 Here is what my costs are right now and moving forward:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting\u003c/strong\u003e: To host my own website that supports hundreds, even thousands of people visiting at any given time, requires a robust hosting plan.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMailchimp\u003c/strong\u003e: this is the service I use to email posts and announcements to my email list, which is getting large enough for them to start charging me monthly - and it\u0027s not cheap!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduct Development\u003c/strong\u003e: I do have some product ideas for the very near future.\u00a0 My hope is to get started on writing and publishing a full length book, which is going to take hundreds of hours and cost a lot of money to produce, edit, and design.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo Production\u003c/strong\u003e: I\u0027ve been lucky enough to work with PhysioU to help film some professional videos for the upcoming app we\u0027re developing, but once the app is out, I\u0027m back on my own.\u00a0 To continue with the pro look, I\u0027ll need some pro tools: lighting, sound, etc.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAs you can see, none of these costs place any money in my pocket.\u00a0 Right now, I plan on investing every penny right back into the business - for the sake of benefiting the greater community.\u00a0 Like I said before, I have a full time job that pays the bills, I\u0027m not looking to get rich from this.\u00a0 This is fun for me.\u00a0 If anything I\u0027d just like to cover my current costs.\u00a0 That\u0027s not unreasonable, is it?\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStretch Goal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stretch goal will allow me \u003cstrong\u003eto create even more products in the future and maybe even stick a few dollars into a college fund for my 2 kids\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0 This would be amazing, but honestly, I\u0027m happy with any support I can get.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for any support you can offer.\u00a0 I appreciate you being a reader and for sharing my content with your friends and family!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMike\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
