    "summary": "I\u2019m\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mauricebroaddus.com/biography/\"\u003eMaurice Broaddus\u003c/a\u003e. You might know me from my short\nstory work, nearly 100 stories having appeared in such places as  \u003cem\u003eLightspeed\nMagazine, Weird Tales, Apex Magazine, Asimov\u2019s, Cemetery Dance, Black Static,\u003c/em\u003e and\nmany more (some of the stories collected in The Voices of Martyrs). You might\nknow me from my urban fantasy trilogy, \u003cem\u003eThe\nKnights of Breton Court\u003c/em\u003e or the (upcoming) middle grade\ndetective novel series, \u003cem\u003eThe\nUsual Suspects\u003c/em\u003e. I\u2019ve also written novellas, such as \u003cem\u003eBuffalo Soldier, I Can Transform You, \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e Orgy of Souls\u003c/em\u003e. I have co-edited\nthe anthologies \u003cem\u003eDark Faith, Dark Faith:\nInvocations, \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e Streets of Shadows\u003c/em\u003e, as well as\nNightmare Magazine\u2019s special issue \u003cem\u003ePeople\nof Colo(u)r Destroy Horror\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also co-authored the play \u003cem\u003eFinding Home: Indiana at 200\u003c/em\u003e.\nDipping into the gaming world, my work includes writing for the \u003cem\u003eMarvel Super-Heroes, Leverage\u003c/em\u003e,\nand \u003cem\u003eFirefly\u003c/em\u003e role-playing\ngames as well as working as a consultant on \u003cem\u003eWatch Dogs 2\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo I write. A lot. I am also quite active in the\ncommunity. My passions have always included social justice, economic equity,\nand racial reconciliation, which is why I work part-time at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theoaksacademy.org\"\u003eThe Oaks Academy\u003c/a\u003e as\na middle grade Logic teacher, do work for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kheprw.org\"\u003eKheprw Institute\u003c/a\u003e, and work\nalongside\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thelearningtrees.com\"\u003eThe Learning Tree\u003c/a\u003e. Most of my work centers around the 46208 zip code (one of the \u201cworst\u201d zip codes in the country). We\nspecialize in Asset Based Community Development, finding the gifts and talents\nwithin the community and networking them to improve the quality of the\ncommunity. We celebrate the abundance in our neighborhoods. I am like an\n\u201cinvited outsider,\u201d but using art to do community organizing and mentoring has\nalways been close to my heart. Income-wise however, it\u2019s like my life is that\nof a freelance community organizer. I love my life and my work. I recently told\nsomeone that if I hit the lottery, my schedule/life wouldn\u2019t look much\ndifferent than it is now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: I need help to be community-supported.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe big issue for me, as essentially a freelancer, is\nhealth insurance. For a family of four it\u2019s an issue. Piecing together annual\nincome from grassroots organizations is often \u2026 tricky. But the work is\nimportant and close to my heart. A base support of consistent supplemental\nincome would allow me the breathing room to continue to serve the community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI love the idea of patronage, community support\nof art creation. I think of it like being a missionary, being sponsored by the community so that I am free to work alongside these groups without tapping their resources. So what you are going to get from supporting this Patreon is stories.\nYou will be allowing me to create more stories, about and within the\nneighborhood. Backers will receive digital copies of all of the work made\npossible by this Patreon and if I stay above my goal, there will be an\nadditional monthly Q\u0026amp;A thing (nothing big, 3-5 minute videos). Writing is\nwhat I do. Writing is what I will keep doing. And if I can use writing to bless\na community, I want to (and will!) do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for supporting me on this journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
