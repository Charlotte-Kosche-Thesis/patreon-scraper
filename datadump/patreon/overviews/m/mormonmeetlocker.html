    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFinally, a podcast by LDS singles for LDS singles, by hosts Caroline Kingsley and Cable Jakins, discussing\neverything from how brain chemistry affects dating decisions, to learning new\nskills and hobbies, to depression and suicide.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cAs an LDS single, particularly in a church so focused on eternal\nmarriage, it\u2019s easy to feel alone, alienated and discouraged at times,\u201d Kingsley said. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t alone. So many of us\nare going through the same or similar challenges and triumphs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cBut until you open up the conversation, it can feel like a journey of\none. Our goal is to create a sense of community, support and awareness. It\u2019s easy\nto see this time as a segue, but it\u2019s so much more than that. LDS singles are\nproving to be a powerful force in our homes, families, friendships, workplaces\nand our communities.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe podcast is called The Mormon Meet Locker, a tongue-in-cheek name\npoking fun at how some reduce the singles scene to a \u201cmeat market,\u201d but in\nreality the LDS singles scene provides a forum for developing meaningful connections,\nwhether romantic, platonic or business. It also provides opportunities to live\nlives of meaning, adventure, learning, fun and service.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMoreover, The Mormon Meet Locker itself is structured to introduce\ncompelling people and ideas to the LDS singles audience. Running about 20 to 25\nminutes, the podcast is aimed to provoke thought and begin conversations that can\nthen be proliferated throughout the LDS singles community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThe LDS singles community is a\ngreat resource for people who struggle with their singleness or those who have\nbeen thrown back into it after many years away,\u201d Jakins said.\n\u201cOur goal with the podcast is to help singles navigate those waters and learn\nof opportunities for events and activities to meet other people who are going\nthrough the same thing.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast began in Oct. 2015. Every week, typically Thursday at 6\np.m., they invite a different guest onto a live recording on Google Plus\nHangout On Air to discuss topics related to LDS single life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGuest Sariah Simmons spoke about love addiction and brain chemistry in\nwhat has been the most widely watched MML podcast to date. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cWith a catchy name like\nthe Mormon Meet Locker you may be surprised to find more meeting of the minds\nthan superficial banter,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cFrom the perspective of our own peers\nit\u2019s a real and informal view of the unique issues we are facing as LDS\nsingles, offering a community and support for a rapidly growing demographic. I\nappreciate the candor with which somewhat otherwise sensitive or taboo topics\ncan be approached to start a dialogue.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPaul Conover has closely followed the podcast\nsince its inception.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThe Mormon Meet Locker is\nraw and real, which is just one of many reasons I watch,\u201d Conover said. \u201cThe\nshow covers topics that are relevant to me personally, tackling issues and also\njust having fun. But most importantly, it relays the deeper message that we are\nnot alone, we all struggle, and we matter; building on the fact we can all help\neach other realize our greater potential to love.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs a MeetHead Patron, you will help bring this podcast to the next level and it\u0027s messages to a wider audience.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
