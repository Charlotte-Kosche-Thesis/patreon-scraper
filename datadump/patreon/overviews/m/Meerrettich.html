    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhen I was small, I started drawing.\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t stop since then.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...Basically, that\u0027s all you need to know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYet, to give you an idea of whose words you are actually reading:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a girl from Germany who likes to draw. \u003cbr\u003eLike, a lot. A whole lot. \u003cbr\u003eI love it. \u003cbr\u003eTo death. \u003cbr\u003ePassion isn\u0027t a word for that. \u003cbr\u003eIf I could marry pens, I\u0027d live happily with my pencil husband and two cute, little rubbers in my paper house since fourth grade. Perhaps, some of you know that feeling.\u003cbr\u003eHonestly - I cannot describe how much I just want to draw, every moment of my life. Everything from Manga, over Realism to dumb sketches I regularly lose my self respect over. All of it.\u003cbr\u003eI just... \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, here\u0027s where the drama begins.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI turned 18 last year, and now I want to study Communication Design. The past three years I\u0027ve gone to a school that gave me the basics to do this. But, honestly, If you want the definition of an anticlimax you just have to go to that school. I wanted to learn things, finally, I wanted to \u003cem\u003eDO\u003c/em\u003e this. Then everything just turned... bad. Everything. Really bad. So bad, I couldn\u0027t live out creativity at all anymore. I hope, yet don\u0027t believe, nobody reading this ever had to experience such a thing themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you know what? I don\u0027t want to do this anymore. \u003cbr\u003eI want to draw. I want to be creative. I want to visit a school that doesn\u0027t suck every ounce of motivation out of my body. I want to make people laugh, feel, be happy. I want to inspire, if I\u0027m capable of that. I want to make this my life. I want it, with all my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd to bring this wish to life, I need you guys.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, it\u0027s always about money. In order to reach my goals, I need to get out of this place I currently live in, physically and mentally - and as a barely even adult girl, that never \u003cem\u003ehad\u003c/em\u003e to be an adult yet, I seriously do not know how. I\u0027m currently looking for a small job, and also doing the things I actually need and want to do. Still, I need to start somewhere, and so I\u0027m reaching out to you people. \u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know how much people want to see my work, I don\u0027t know how good I am and how good I can be. I just know - \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to draw.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor whoever decides to help me, with whatever they do, even if it\u0027s just a friendly word - I thank you with all of my heart. I cannot reach this without your help. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo. That\u0027s a lot of text.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYet, every word has my passion in it.\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll hear of me soon.\u003cbr\u003eHave a wonderful day."
