Our \npedagogical practice is influenced by Waldorf, Reggio Emilia, Anti~Bias,\n Coyote Mentoring, Unschooling and Forest schooling principles. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur magical practice is rooted in the Reclaiming and Faery Traditions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eTo begin, I\u0027d like to take a moment to \nthank all the amazing families I work with for their willingness to \nsupport my practice, and for their trust in me and my way of \nbeing in the world. I find it magical that I\u0027ve been offered this opportunity to invest in and influence the development of these beings. Sing them my songs, tell them my stories, teach them my spells. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love my work, I love my hearth, and know that I \nam deeply blessed and appreciated to be able to spend my days the way I \ndo. I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to know my families as friends and to be \nin a position to be able to choose the families I work for. The intimate play and learning community we are creating together for our children is truly the most inspiring work I\u0027ve ever engaged in. There are so many special moments every day, and these kiddos are my guides just as much as I am theirs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0In addition to our programming, I also maintain our \u003ca href=\"http://shoutout.wix.com/so/5MB_mSGz/click?w=LS0tDQpjZWI5ODUxYS1mZjVlLTQzYzMtNTBkMy1lNTFmM2NhNGM0ZTkNCmh0dHA6Ly9lbG1pcm9kcmlnLndpeHNpdGUuY29tL21vb25zbmVzdHBsYXlzY2hvb2wvYmxvZw0KLS0t\"\u003edaily adventure stories\u003c/a\u003e as part of our playschool blog. There I am documenting and archiving what an early childhood full of play, adventure, magic, and connection looks like in imagery and video. The labor that goes into that work is beyond measure, and beyond compensation. Rather, these are stories and maps that will lead these kiddos and others to practices and ways of being that are in direct resistence to industrial education and colonial ways of knowing and being. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nProviding\n access to a nurturing early childhood development community is a \ncore component of my practice and pedagogy, and I refuse to abandon this value or the families who are supported by my work. Being born into poverty shouldn\u0027t be a social determinant, and I am committed to doing my part to smash this paradigm. I believe that to change the culture we\u0027ve all been wounded by, we need to offer every child a nurturing environment in which their needs for play, adventure, and connection can be met. An environment in which relationships with each other, the land, the sacred, and the wild can be nurtured. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, capitalism hits working poor families the hardest, and so many parents are forced to send their children to state schools, which may be free, but have a very high cost to their children\u0027s development. Or, parents opt out of public schools and raise their children in isolation, eventually hitting walls and burning out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo offer an alternative paradigm, I\u0027ve created a tuition model that is income based and sliding scale. Our playschool families have access to a \u0027pay-what-you-can-within-the sliding-scale\u0027 type of system, and all of my enrolled families depend on this system. Most of the families in our playschool community occupy working poor identities, are queer or queer allied, and are active in some variety of organizing or community building projects. These are families who are just scraping by, doing their best to keep the bills paid, and can\u0027t afford to pay the $1000 or more a month in tuition that most programs require for enrollment. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here is where I invite you to support our playschool community, and the work of ensuring access to working poor families. Because even with the sliding scale, there are families in our community who have to choose between keeping their kiddos enrolled, or paying the rent. \u003cbr\u003eJust like me, maybe just like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to be able to offer scholarships for families,\u003cbr\u003eso that I can keep in good balance with my labor\u003cbr\u003eso that all of our playschool friends have access to their friend circle\u003cbr\u003eso that life can be just a little less stressful for their parents\u003cbr\u003eso that I can reach out to allied communities and offer scholarship \u003cbr\u003eso that I can hire and fairly compensate queer teaching partners\u003cbr\u003eSo that our magic can be real. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, please do consider joining me in the creation of this scholarship fund. Your monthly pledge will go directly towards providing scholarships for families who need it to be able to access our playschool community, covering operating costs, and fairly compensating queer teaching partners. Even just $5 bucks a month adds up, and awesome if you have enough abundance to share more, but your contribution to this scholarship fund is needed if I am to be able to sustain my practice under the current model. Every day I choose to invest in our descendants and in creating the maps they will need to change the fucking world. And, I hope you will too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my thanks and gratitude, \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://elmirodrig.wixsite.com/flowwithwater\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFlow Withwater\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp; the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://elmirodrig.wixsite.com/moonsnestplayschool\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMoon\u0027s Nest Playschool Community\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
