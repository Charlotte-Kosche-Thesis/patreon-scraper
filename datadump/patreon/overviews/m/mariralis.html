My name is Mari (or inemurin, which I am using at the moment as a net handle) ! I have an art portfolio at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://inemur.in\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003einemur.in !\u003c/a\u003e Check it out please~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create digital and traditional art with a strange mix of influences. I was born and raised in Mexico, but currently live in the USA and have previously lived in Tokyo, Japan. My art draws influences from these main three cultures as they are what makes up me as a person!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a lot of thought I have decided to create a Patreon page as a way to hopefully support my dream of becoming a freelance artist. 2016 is a year of huge growth and improvement for me, and I feel like big things will definitely come my way this year, but I need your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently moved to a completely new place and while I do have a job, full-time positions in my company are very competitive and based on seniority. As as result, I live off a part-time wage. That doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m horribly struggling with money, but a majority of my paychecks go to rent, food, and bills, leaving me with not much to really kick off my dream. It would be amazing to receive any bit of support from those who enjoy my art so that I can continue to create more and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the time I am currently drawing in my spare time and occasionally working with mostly musicians to create art for them. Some artists I\u0027ve worked with include Omniboi, Mitomoro, Bansheebeat, and more. I would love to focus more and more time to creating art and working with more people!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mostly use Paint Tool SAI for digital art, and paper plus found materials for traditional art. Lately I love nature themes, as well as bright colors. My art has usually a happy feel to it, mixed with a slight dreamy feeling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreons will receive rewards after payment has processed."
