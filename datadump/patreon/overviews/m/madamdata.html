    "summary": "hi! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m madam data [they/them]. I am an experimental musician, teacher, programmer and writer. I\u0027ve been making music for over a decade - in that time I\u0027ve written an \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-f_8gOcAAs\"\u003espace opera about ducks\u003c/a\u003e, performed live in countless venues including that one time with Moor Mother that I\u0027m quite pleased with, taught dozens of students the finer points of building audio instruments in SuperCollider, Pure Data, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSCevtXgniW/?taken-by=madamdata\"\u003ehandmade circuits\u003c/a\u003e, and produced \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/madamdata\"\u003ehours of recordings\u003c/a\u003e. In the daytime I work as an educator and entertainer for very very young people, and I usually find I have a lot in common with them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides my performance and teaching work, I\u0027ve been involved for several years now in developing free and open source software instruments that I hope anyone can use. In 2016 I designed and programmed \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1AE7CLQq78\"\u003eANAS\u003c/a\u003e, a modular synthesizer environment for the free audio programming environment SuperCollider, and I\u0027m currently working on its spiritual successor, \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/madamdata/ecl\"\u003eECL\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 I\u0027m deeply invested in the idea that powerful music software should be easily accessible and I\u0027ve been working hard to make that a reality. Unfortunately, my time is becoming more and more limited and I haven\u0027t been able to really get these programs out to people who might use them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m having a difficult time right now. I\u0027ve been barely making ends meet for a few months and it\u0027s basically unsustainable - so I need your help. If I can get a steady(er) income, I\u0027ll have more time to make music, create software, write blogs, plan events, and generally provide healing for the people I\u0027m around. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat there is to gain from this: (besides the satisfaction of literally making my survival possible)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. better, and better documented software that you can use! I am currently working on ECL, a free modular synthesizer for Pure Data, another free audio programming environment. It is currently freely available on my github, but it has a ways to go before it\u0027s easy to install, easy to use and has all the extremely necessary documentation required for a complete beginner to get started. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGiven enough support, I will also have the time to teach myself to code better, and write better software. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. More writing about music. I have a lot of thoughts on music and hope to one day have the time to write them out for posterity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. More music! I believe that music can be a healing force and I want to bring that to the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. More teaching. If possible I would like to begin a video and maybe real-life series about making creative music with open source tools. Open source, for all its rhetoric about freedom, has often failed in its implementation stages and I\u0027d like to give a shot at closing the gap between programmers and users, especially among marginalized people in Philadelphia. It won\u0027t be a solution to the many problems open source has, but it\u0027ll be a start and it\u0027ll mean getting good software to people who need it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
