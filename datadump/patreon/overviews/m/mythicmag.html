Our aim is to offer broader looks at both categories of short fiction and we are interested in diverse and unique stories that plumb the rich possibilities in the genres that are often overlooked by the status quo. We want great stories. Stories that challenge us. Stories that excite us. Stories that entertain us.\u00a0Since December 2016, we have been publishing new issues every three months and \u003cstrong\u003eincluding ten or more short stories, book reviews, and essays \u003c/strong\u003ein each one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT MYTHIC?\u003c/h3\u003eYou should support us because like us you believe that the more outlets for creative fiction, especially speculative fiction, the richer and more diverse the fields of imagination will become. The more we allow new voices to be heard and to stir the pot of tired old cliches and worn tropes the more robust the genres will be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou also believe that the authors who shape those visions are the most valuable resource in all of this and you want believe they should paid well for their work. That\u0027s certainly a priority with MYTHIC. We\u0027re grateful to those who\u0027ve appeared in each issue that the modest flat rate we started with but we want to give and do more to make MYTHIC a thriving market for science fiction and fantasy--and place where the authors thrive as well. Our goal is to pay professional rates of \u003cstrong\u003eat least 6 CENTS A WORD\u003c/strong\u003e for short fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also have costs for producing this magazine. Design costs. Art costs. Editing Costs. There are other contents and features that we hope to add as we gain Patron support. It all comes down to you, dear readers.\u00a0Review the rewards we are offering here at \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e for regular patrons. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eJoin our Team!\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eBe a part of what we\u0027re building: a great new genre magazine for lovers of science fiction and fantasy literature.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe need your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW WE USE THE FUNDS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePrimarily, we are using funds given by patrons to pay the authors.
