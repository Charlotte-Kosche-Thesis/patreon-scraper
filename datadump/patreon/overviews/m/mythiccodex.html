    "summary": "I\u0027m an Animator and Visual FX artist. I\u0027ve been working in Film/TV for nearly 20 years creating all manner of experimental Animation and Visual Effects. In addition to that I\u0027ve also had a life-long passion for Mythology and Folklore. Now I\u0027m bringing these two passions together to create an ongoing series of short films about the fairies and creatures of world folklore and mythology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start us off I\u0027ll be revisiting a documentary which I produced back in 2002 entitled \u003cstrong\u003eFairy Folio: A Field Guide to the Faerie\u003c/strong\u003e. This documentary was narrated by Canadian actor Gordon Pincent and features the animation of many of Nova Scotia\u0027s most talented animators. The show features 14 stories about the Fairies of folklore; \u003cstrong\u003eBrownie, Redcap, Leanan Sidhe, Pooka\u003c/strong\u003e, to name a few. Over the next few months I will be refreshing the animation and digital FX and re-releasing these 14 stories. For every $200 of NEW patronage I\u0027ll release the next installment of the series [no more than 2 in a month]. Once all 14 episodes are released I will begin creating \u003cstrong\u003eall new episodes\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew creatures, new stories...
