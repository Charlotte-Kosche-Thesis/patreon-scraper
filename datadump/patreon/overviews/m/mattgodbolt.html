    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://xania.org/\"\u003eMatt Godbolt\u003c/a\u003e, creator of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://godbolt.org/\"\u003eCompiler Explorer\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCompiler Explorer is an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/mattgodbolt/compiler-explorer\"\u003eopen source\u003c/a\u003e website letting you explore how your C++, D, Go, Rust, Ispc, Haskell, Swift and Pascal\u00a0code is compiled into the machine code your computer actually runs. It\u0027s a great way to learn assembly code, to understand how compilers work, see what optimizations are possible, and to prove and disprove myths about what constitutes efficient code.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCompiler Explorer is my labour of love: it\u0027s been running since May 2012 and I\u0027ve funded the Amazon EC2 compute resources it needed myself until January 2017, when I set up this Patreon. Any amounts you pledge here go to helping foot the bill, and to incentivise more development.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m committed to keeping Compiler Explorer free for the good of the development community, but if you find it useful and want to contribute to its development and running, I\u0027d love your support. Because I want it to be free to all, there\u0027s no fancy extra patron-only features, but you get plenty of coder karma. Depending on the level of patronage you select I might put some stickers in the post for you (cost permitting), or maybe something more, but the site is the same for both Patreon supporters and all others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou can support Compiler Explorer by becoming a patron here, or by visiting the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://shop.spreadshirt.com/compiler-explorer/\"\u003eonline shop\u003c/a\u003e and buying some merchandise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCosts breakdown\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCompiler Explorer runs on a single reserved t2.medium EC2 instance. This costs $300/year. It also has the ability to scale up to a total of 6 instances to handle occasional load spikes (like\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11671730\"\u003eHacker News mentions\u003c/a\u003e). I also run 2-3 c4.large instances with spot pricing - this is like an auction of Amazon\u0027s spare CPU capacity. I run as many as makes sense based on load and the budget.\u00a0I run a nano instance for administration purposes and to orchestrate building new compilers, which costs another $10/month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn order to support this scalability, and to allow for rolling site updates, there\u0027s a load balancer in front of the site. That costs around $20/month. Cloudfront caching adds another $20. New compilers are built regularly using spot instances, which cost another few dollars a month. Data transfers are thankfully minimal, around $5 a month. Online storage for all the compiler binaries comes in at another $40/month. I use\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://papertrailapp.com\"\u003ePapertrail\u003c/a\u003e to store and process logs, and to send me alerts when things are broken. This another $7 a month. I use sentry.io to track client bugs, which costs $26/month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn total, the site costs me around $300 a month (including the amortized cost of the reserved instance, the extra spot instances and the admin node)."
