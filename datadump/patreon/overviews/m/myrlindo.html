Your patronage will help cushion the investment that is required to create quality art that is meaningful and impactful. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhats next\u003c/strong\u003e: This new album \"Everyone Whispers\" has been a work in progress for three years and it is deeply personal. I\u0027ve taught myself how to direct and edit music videos, as well as how to produce music and speak/rap/sing poignantly, rhythmically, and critically about matters of the heart: my successes and shortcomings as well as the hard truths and shortcomings of our culture in regards to race, class, and gender.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) \u003c/strong\u003eTo continue to work with young people across the country, but in more strategic, creative, and impactful ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enote:\u003c/strong\u003e Typically I am flown out to a community to work at a school to perform music and poetry and/or teach writing and performance. Because the majority of my income is funneled back into the creation of my art, it is imperative that the most financially sound gigs take immediate precedence, as a result struggling organizations, non-profits, and school districts who would benefit greatly from my work, but have smaller budgets are not reached. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan you imagine if I had enough financial backing to choose where and who I worked with. Imagine doing a week long inter-disciplinary (hip hop, poetry, dance) programming on reservations in Northern Arizona or at Schools on the southside of Phoenix? Can you imagine if I had the ability to hire a videographer to document this experience? Or having the ability to hire someone who can read through and publish the best literary works of students in workshops? I can thats why we are here. Thats why this is so exciting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I want to be creative and strategic and impact more people.
