More than anything, I believe in the creativity of my fellow gamers, and I want to help you unlock your own works by showing you the techniques I use to write my own material, and I want to show you what the rest of the gaming community is doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your continued support, I\u0027ll be able to justify my hectic writing pace, I\u0027ll be able to pick up more books with which I can feed the creativity machine, and most importantly, I can afford to commission artwork with which I can bring my material alive. \u00a0Patrons will ensure that the whole world gains access to this material (I currently have no plans for Patron-exclusive material), but Patrons will get earlier access (often very early, as I write ahead) and top priority when it comes to requests, playtests and questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of all, I want to thank you, patron. \u00a0Your support shows you believe in what I\u0027m doing, and that warms my heart. \u00a0Thank you."
