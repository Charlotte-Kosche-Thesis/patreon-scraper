    "summary": "Alright, so here is the long and short about me. \u00a0The meat and potatoes. \u00a0The lowdown. \u00a0Dig:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Mike Vitale and I am a singer and songwriter and nothing makes me happier than the experience of creating music.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very much a lover of art and community. \u00a0I have been for as long as I can remember. \u00a0It is an absolute joy watching the growth of an artist. \u00a0I actively support as much local/regional/world art as I can, because nothing makes me happier than seeing people realize their dreams, especially when they are talented and they can reduce me to tears, make me laugh hysterically, or feel joy with the beauty of what they create. \u00a0Good art speaks truth and that is what I feel when I find it.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am creator myself, and I sympathize and empathize a great deal with how difficult it is to find and connect with an audience who appreciates what is being made. \u00a0That connection is paramount. \u00a0I have been very very fortunate in my life to make this connection with many people, and even more importantly, to be friends with you. \u00a0It means everything to me.  You lift me up when I feel low and remind me that I have something to offer this world.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood art, whether it is comedy, music, visual, etc., is truth. \u00a0It cuts through the fog of hate, fear, and anger, and allows us all the opportunity to see peace, joy, friendship, and unity.  It breaks down the barriers of prejudice. \u00a0It speaks to our soul. \u00a0We feel it when it speaks the truth to us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI humbly offer you my soul in the form of songs that I write and the music that I play. \u00a0It is the reason I am alive. \u00a0I\u2019ve known this every since junior college, taking a two year music theory course with Dr. Timothy Lynch at College of the Sequoias. \u00a0That was my wakeup call. \u00a0I thought I wanted to be an architect, until I took his course. \u00a0Thank you Dr. Lynch.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I plan to do the following:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ea.)  Pay all of the musicians, videographers, photographers, sound engineers, visual artists, and specialists in their craft, who have worked very hard on their skill set, so that we may create beautiful things, together, and share them with you. \u00a0We can all make a living on what we love doing, with your help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eb.)  Create audio and video content for both Youtube, as well as for Spotify, Apple Music, and the like. \u00a0Live recordings as well as studio recordings of me performing new songs that I have written over the past several years. \u00a0I have a lot of new material and a lot of things to say, and I would like to share it in a way that is interactive, while also supporting my larger community around me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ec.)   Release this video footage in the traditional format of audio recordings (EP\u2019s and LP\u2019s). \u00a0Vinyl, compact disc, and digital downloads. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ed.)  Make T-Shirts and merchandise to help spread the music being made and the message the music carries. \u00a0I want to share my life with you. \u00a0I already do that, but it\u2019s at the slow and arduous pace of what money I save and work very hard to earn. \u00a0I would like to speed this process up, exponentially, with your help. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNaturally, the above proclamations, are completely dependent on the enthusiasm and the financial offerings from benefactors such as yourself. \u00a0For the sake of transparency, your patronage is on a revolving monthly basis to keep the wheels on our bus, spinning. \u00a0If you sign up for $5, you are giving $5 every month towards the creation of all the above. \u00a0This is not a new concept. \u00a0It has been this way for artists for hundreds of years (if not longer). \u00a0As a quick example, look at all your favorite classical composers and how they supported themselves in order to write and create. \u00a0It is a fundamental part of the artist\u2019s history.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy New Year\u2019s Resolution is to stop trying to do everything myself, and to ask for more help from my friends. \u00a0This is my first step towards making that happen and I thank you in advance for your love and support and connection. \u00a0It means the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Mike\u003cbr\u003e"

Having spent years performing under the name Mike Vitale (at local and regional venues, coffeeshops, bars, restaurants, resorts, corporate events, private parties, colleges, and universities) and having released a full length album called \u003cem\u003eIdiosyncrasies\u003c/em\u003e and an EP entitled \u003cem\u003eWhen Happiness and Home,\u003c/em\u003e under his own name, he decided to try something different in 2013 after successfully funding a new album using the crowdsourcing platform, Kickstarter.  This ended up becoming a brand new music project called The Hawkline Monster.  \u003cbr\u003eThe subsequent album is titled \u003cem\u003eWe Create and We Are Created \u003c/em\u003e by The Hawkline Monster and features 11 of Michael\u0027s songs, which he produced himself with the help of musical friends all over Southern California.  The album was released digitally in 2013 and released on compact disc in 2014 at The Constellation Room in Santa Ana, California.\u003cbr\u003eWhile it was a lot of fun playing under the name The Hawkline Monster, as of 2018, he is returning to using the name that his parents gave him, Mike Vitale. \u00a0I\u0027m going to revamping this profile to reflect such here in the coming weeks, if not sooner. \u00a0Stay tuned!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
