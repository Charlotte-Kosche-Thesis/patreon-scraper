The beauty of fanfiction is that we are all somehow brought together in a seemingly random fashion to celebrate the aspects of media and literature that we love, to explore universes we adore, and to deservedly right the wrongs done to our beloved characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe caveat to this spiel on my eternal love for the art of fanfiction is this: I am moving further, and further, and \u003cem\u003efurther\u003c/em\u003e away from fanfiction. It\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003enice\u003c/strong\u003e, actually, because some of the original things in my head are being given real form and breath and soul -- and because fanfiction is the type of home you can always return to from time to time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis page is not a place for me to create exclusive content only intended for those willing to give me spare change or better for my work. \u003c/strong\u003eMost of the things I will be sharing here are also being shared elsewhere:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mollykatheryn.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePrimary tumblr\u003c/a\u003e [\u003ca href=\"http://mollykatheryn.tumblr.com/tagged/mini_fic\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewriting tag\u003c/a\u003e]\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mollykatherynwrites.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWriting tumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mollykatherynreads.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePodcast website\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/your_kat\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAO3\u003c/a\u003e /\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/605355/your_kat\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFF.net\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eMy creations on this page will include \u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003eoriginal pieces\u003c/strong\u003e (both short stories and chapters of novels as they are written), some \u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003efanfiction\u003c/strong\u003e (most likely micro fictions compiled into larger creations), \u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003epodcast readings of my work\u003c/strong\u003e, and occasional \u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003especial free form podcasts\u003c/strong\u003e associated with released creations detailing my \"inspiration\" and approach to bringing my original spark of an idea to life (these will be limited to certain patron levels, please see below).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePosting schedule: likely \u003cem\u003esporadic\u003c/em\u003e, though I will be aiming to post \u003cstrong\u003e1-2 creations per month\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat this page represents is an opportunity for me to \u003cstrong\u003eask\u003c/strong\u003e.
