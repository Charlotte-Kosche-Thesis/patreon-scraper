    "summary": "Metal Gear Mondays is a semi-comedic book-club style podcast experiment hosted by four friends charting the entirety of the iconic Metal Gear video game series and the extended body of work of its creators, producers, and contributors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarted by a small group of friends, the podcast is hosted by Alessio Summerfield and features a 50/50 dynamic of two members who have experience with the titles and two members who are coming to these games absolutely blind. We share our break-down of each title\u0027s development history, gameplay, and story through a chapter-by-chapter discussion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarted as a modest idea for filling a void that was seen in the available podcasts on the market, the show has now grown to encompass over 60 individual episodes, 90+ hours of content, and several special guests. Your contributions (no matter how small) would go a long way to allowing the show to mature and continue.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, from the bottom of Alessio\u0027s, Sam\u0027s, Isaac\u0027s, and James\u0027s hearts! The show has continued this long because of the fans. We cannot show our appreciation for your support enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can follow along via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/MetalGearMondays\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/MetalGearMonday\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.bit.ly/mgmstore\"\u003eTeespring\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/MetalGearMondays\"\u003eSoundCloud\u003c/a\u003e!"
