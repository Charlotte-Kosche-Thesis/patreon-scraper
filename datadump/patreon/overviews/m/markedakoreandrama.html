The story revolves around Kevin Larson, a\nKorean adoptee raised on a farm in the midwest, whose life turns upside down\nwhen a mysterious Korean woman named Soo-ah Kim arrives on his birthday, calls\nhim by name, and says, \"I am here to fulfill your [Korean] father\u0027s\nwishes.\" The story is trippy. It has magic, love triangles, death, taboo\nlove (?), a powerful and secretive organization. And individuals searching for\nidentity and redemption.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMarked\u003c/em\u003e is a project hatched by the\nthree of us -- Matthew Salesses, Emily Evanowski, and Kevin Vollmers. (We\u0027re\nall Korean adoptees.) It\u0027s nearing completion, and the plan is to release it\nthis coming November (National Adoption Month) K-Drama style -- two episodes a\nweek, each Monday/Tuesday, for a 16-episode season - on the \u003ca href=\"http://www.wearegazillionstrong.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGazillion\nStrong\u003c/a\u003e website\nfor the price of $.50 p/chapter. Before we get there, though, we have some work\nto do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently, the 16 \"episodes\" have\nbeen written, but we need to tighten them up. Also, the images for the first\nfew have been completed, but we need to create more for the entire book. \u003cstrong\u003eThis\nis where you come in. We need your patronage. \u003c/strong\u003eOne\nof us is in a PhD program and a freelance writer (Matthew), one of us is an art\nstudent (Emily), and one of us is an activist/entrepreneur (Kevin). None of us\nhave the time or the finances to be completing the project with the resources\nwe have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, please consider\npartnering with us by becoming a patron of \u003cem\u003eMarked. \u003c/em\u003eThe process is super easy. Scroll to the bottom\nof the page and select the amount you would like to offer per month - $3, $5,\n$10, $25, $50, $100 . . . whatever fits your budget.

Kevin reached out to the well-published Matthew a couple of years ago. Kevin, whose experience as an adoptee is littered with \"what if\u0027s\" (\u003cem\u003eWhat if his Korean father hadn\u0027t died? What if his Korean mother and father had stayed together? What if his deceased Korean father\u0027s rumored high place in society is true?\u003c/em\u003e), asked Matthew to write a serialized novel for the adoptee magazine, \u003cem\u003eGazillion voices\u003c/em\u003e, about a Korean adoptee who finds out that his adoption story was completely untrue, fantastical, and dark. Emphasis on dark -- something Kevin wasn\u0027t seeing a lot of. Initially hesitant (he is a busy guy), Matthew wondered what would happen if someone wrote a novel like a Korean drama, 16 episodes illustrated to evoke the visual element. Matthew began to form a story around a central character named Kevin Larson, full of untapped potential. Another character, a mysterious Korean woman named Soo-ah Kim, enters the picture and is tasked with bringing Kevin to Korea, where his biological father is waiting for him . . . waiting with an ulterior motive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe story took off. Matthew did months of \"research,\" watching K-drama after K-drama and reading YA fantasy. Then, mixing his favorite romantic and fantastical elements, he wrote a draft that became \n\u003cem\u003eMarked\u003c/em\u003e. Kevin and Matthew hired Eric Sharp, a Korean adoptee actor and illustrator, and Eric created this cover.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.wearegazillionstrong.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Marked-Cover-C-6-1.5x101.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nKevin and Matthew also pulled in another partner for the project -- Emily Evanowski, a very promising illustrator and student at the School of Visual Arts. Since then, Emily has created numerous images, including the following.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.wearegazillionstrong.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/markedch1-1final-e1425581849938.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.wearegazillionstrong.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/markedch1-2-3-e1425581781677.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPretty cool, right?
