Its a Mithey here!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a\u003cstrong\u003e Minecraft map maker\u003c/strong\u003e who creates awesome custom content for everyone to enjoy!\u003cstrong\u003e I specialize a lot in creating maps with a lot of depth and quality\u003c/strong\u003e to them, especially in the \u003cstrong\u003eadventure and dungeon delving\u003c/strong\u003e side of things, though I often experiment with all sorts of different map types and mechanics. It has been my \u003cstrong\u003edream to become a successful Minecraft map maker\u003c/strong\u003e like some other people in the past such as Sethbling, Vechs, and Hypixel. With the support I get I\u0027ll be able to continue working toward that dream and \u003cstrong\u003ebe able to continue creating some amazing content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e for you all\u003c/strong\u003e to enjoy and go on journeys through!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently focusing on \u003cstrong\u003e3 big projects\u003c/strong\u003e that you can help support me with which includes a \u003cstrong\u003enew massive RPG map, new mini maps every week or so, and YouTube related content.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe RPG map can be summed up as an ever expanding mostly open world RPG full of variety and bite sized chunk like content that you can go out and explore and find the secrets of while progressing and upgrading several things including your base, character, and much more! One of the super awesome and special parts of it involves when updating the map you will not lose any progress at all, and updating in itself is easy! This means I can constantly keep updating the map nice and easily for you all to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe new mini maps like I said will be coming out every week or so. As the mini maps are often made over the duration of just a couple of days they\u0027re often pretty short, easy, not all that serious, and feel good like. I\u0027m also going to be doing my best to keep on experimenting with different cool mechanics with them and try to vary things up constantly!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as YouTube goes I\u0027m planning on making a huge map making tutorial along with other map making related videos. The tutorial will end up going over map making to a great degree so that anyone can go from someone who knows nothing to a pro map maker that is more than capable of creating amazing experiences!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to\u003cstrong\u003e help support me in doing what I love\u003c/strong\u003e here then feel free to pledge any amount that you like. In the process of course you will gain access to some patron only rewards and perks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, I hope you all enjoy and thanks a ton for the support~ ^^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you have any reward ideas or suggestions in general or anything feel free to let me know!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
