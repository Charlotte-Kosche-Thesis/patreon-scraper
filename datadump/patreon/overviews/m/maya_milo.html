    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHELLO DARLINGS.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you for finding\nyour way to my Patreon! My name is Maya Milo. I am a self-taught artist, a type\n1 diabetic, a chronically ill person, and a full-time day-dream creature. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve always been an artist, with my\nmajor focus always on illustration. My creativity bubbles over into other crafts,\nlike sewing, costuming and knitting, but this Patreon is solely focused on my career\nas an Illustrator. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately I\u2019ve been inspired by inking using dip and brush\npens, as well as painting with white ink on black paper. My plan is to continually\nhone and expand my skill set; first I\u0027ll start with watercolor painting, before\nmoving onto oils for some larger long-term projects. Some of my favorite\nvisual artists are Akiya\nKageichi, Dave McKean, Yoshitaka Amano, Chiara Bautista, Ayami\nKojima, and Kris Kuksi.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2016 I was diagnosed with\nBorderline Personality Disorder, as well as Bipolar II. I\u2019m thrilled that I\nfinally got a word for what I was going through, because I\u2019ve struggled with my\nmental health continually since childhood, and this is largely what I want to\nexpress and discuss in my art. Especially because Borderline is such a new\ndiagnosis, I feel it could be helpful if I catalog some of my experiences/ struggles. I know from experience that having some reference that says \u201cYES THIS IS A\nREAL THING, YOU MAY BE CRAZY BUT YOU\u2019RE NOT ALONE\u201d can literally save someone\u2019s\nlife.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dreams are intense and often lucid,\nmy nightmares chronic and haunting. Being Borderline means that, for me, life feels like an actual dream. I struggle daily with discerning whether or not life is actually happening. The best thing I can think to do with\nthese experiences and images is to pour them onto the page, and I have specific plans in mind for\nhow I want to do that! \u003cbr\u003eCurrently I am storyboarding my first project, a\n40 page graphic short-story. Over time I plan to release these short episodes,\nto eventually be compiled into a full length graphic novel. That is the current plan, it\nwill shift and change in the process but I will keep my patrons updated every\nstep of the way!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for stopping by my\nPatreon. I plan to draw about dreams \u0026amp; nightmares, reality \u0026amp; surreality,\nillness \u0026amp; insanity, nature \u0026amp; magic, life \u0026amp; death, gender \u0026amp; sex,\ntime \u0026amp; infinity. I hope you join me, this is gonna be wicked. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe live in a magical\ntime, my friends. Never before in history could an audience partake of art with\nsuch ease! With the exceptions of performance, music, or street painting, there\nhave been precious few times where it was easy for an audience to access their\nfavorite art whenever they wanted to, or as the art was being created. How many\npeople were allowed to watch Da Vinci paint? How many were allowed into livestreams\nfor a Q\u0026amp;A with Monet? Exactly! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is not to\ndirectly compare myself to legendary creators, but to drive home the point that\nthe Internet has revolutionized communication in our world. These days, one can\ncultivate an international audience from the comfort of their couch, without\nrequiring an expensive degree, an aristocratic background, or official Patronage\nfrom the Church like during the Renaissance.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, where does Patreon\nfit in?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon\non is a good idea because it is a return to the old ways of patronage, where\ncreators were supported directly by fans of their work. The industrial\nrevolution made this method unpopular, because industrializing art allowed\nit to be cranked out at a much faster pace. This shift may have benefited\nindustry and consumerism, but it came at the expense of creators, their\nindividual growth, originality, and individuality. But patronage is not obsolete,\nand the internet makes it much easier to provide than ever before.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis platform allows\nfans to directly support creators, nurturing a much closer relationship between\nartist and fan while also allowing artists the time and space to grow at\ntheir own pace. It bridges the gap between the old and the new ways, while\ncutting out the middlemen that were previously crucial to an artists\u0027 success.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe reward tiers allow\na good deal of flexibility for the patrons\u0027 budget, while benefiting them with\nrewards that put them directly in contact with their favorite artists. And\nPatreon takes a very reasonable charge for this service. You can rest assured\nthat your money is going directly towards supporting my livelihood, and not\ngetting caught in a net of fees.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe greatest benefit\nto me as an artist is that being supported on Patreon allows me to work from\nhome, at my own pace. As a chronically ill person, I need to be able to rest\nwhen my body requires it, not on the schedule of a 9 to 5. I can take the best\ncare of myself, and do the deep inner work that fuels my art safely while at\nhome, without threatening my well-being!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs you can see, it\u2019s\nfuckin\u2019 magical. \u0026lt;3 I am so grateful and blessed to be able to pursue my\ndreams, with the support of my family, loved ones, and friends! Thank you so\nmuch for stopping in to my little piece of the art world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers darlings~\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
