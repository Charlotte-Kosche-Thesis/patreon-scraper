After scouting a given position in full, I re-create them in NCAA 14 based on the information provided, and showcase them. Essentially, providing \"Tape\" on the prospects, while talking about them. I also provide a full spreadsheet to showcase the players, and rank them.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use a great\u00a0amount of time studying, watching, and talking sports, as of right now primarily in person and on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/moonlightswami\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e. But, because I talk so much on social media I get, and welcome a ton of questions. However, answering all of these questions can be difficult in 140 characters, and its not the easiest way to manage talking with everyone. On top of that, I no longer post my NFL predictions, reasoning, etc. in video format, nor do I ever talk about Fantasy advice, mainly for football in video format due to previous experiences. HOWEVER, that does not mean I don\u0027t miss doing it, because I do. Because of these factors, I thought Patreon would be an interesting website to look at. I have been approached previously by people who want to donate, but I have never had a donation page set up, and the idea of taking a donation without providing anything other than what I normally do with YouTube in return didn\u0027t feel right, even if the donator didn\u0027t feel that way. This is where Patreon comes in. Now, I have a way to provide those of you who want to take that extra step to support me, something special in return, that are special perks only Patrons of mine will receive."
