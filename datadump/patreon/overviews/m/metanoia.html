    "summary": "Hello, and thank you for coming to this page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are new to my content or have never met me, let me take a moment to explain who I am and my creations that are in the making.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI am a writer/numerologist/environmentalist who sees no boundary in between spirituality and science. In everything I seek, there is spiritual, emotional, and mental fulfillment, casting aside anything that has no sustenance to the soul or the mind. In everything I do, I strive to make a difference. Service does not just come from volunteering at local events or from eating vegan. It also comes through living an authentic life, where one\u0027s own unique self expression can shine through impulses and learned thoughts or behaviors. In this way, every person finds the unique quality or product they offer the world. This is my contribution.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My novel will comprise of nine lifetimes, each taking place on its own distinct planet, with its own sentient species and its own societal dynamics. In first person point of view, the reader is taken through a path through one\u0027s soul ascension that is equipped with evolving relationships, evolving awareness, and an evolving consciousness. Intrigued? Here is the introduction to Metanoia:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emeta\u2022noia:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n: a transformative change of heart; especially: a spiritual conversion.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOrigin of METANOIA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGreek, from \u003cem\u003emetanoiein\u003c/em\u003e to change one\u0027s mind, repent, from \u003cem\u003emeta-\u003c/em\u003e + \u003cem\u003enoein\u003c/em\u003e to think, from \u003cem\u003enous\u003c/em\u003e mind\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst Known Use: 1577\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlthough the word \u201cmetanoia\u201d holds the meaning of repentance, it also means an immense alteration of oneself in terms of mind, spirit, character, and morals. In this particular story, Metanoia is not just a word for spiritual transformation, but a complex design of pathways fitted into a singular, universal journey of truth. This journey passes through various mediums, providing a diverse means to understanding. Metanoia is the road that these souls are on in one form or another. It is traveled alone, and on different paths, often intersecting with those our souls are familiar with. Metanoia came about from nothing, and is everything. At first this concept is difficult to grasp, but there are moments of clarity in life and spirit when the idea that nothing is something, and something can be anything, begins to makes sense. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLet\u0027s begin.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
