    "summary": "I am an electronic musician and poet who struggles with depression and anxiety, which makes living and creating often difficult. For nearly twenty years I created and released songs free so that I could focus on the artistic aspect free from commercial concerns. Recently, Pink Dolphin Records has been kind enough to agree to release my entire retrospective catalog on limited edition double cassette and through digital and streaming markets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons will have access to every song I\u0027ve ever created, first chances to listen to developing songs, and my catalog of poems. Some of my songs have also been included on fundraising releases for the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and other important ventures. Your support guarantees that I will be able to provide music for these and other important organizations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon provides a unique opportunity for you to fund work that you believe in for a very low cost. Every little bit helps. With your support I can continue to provide music and poetry at a high level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am grateful for the friends, fans, and family who have supported me over the years.
