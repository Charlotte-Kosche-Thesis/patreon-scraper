By way of thanks, Patrons get access to all content one month in advance, after which it becomes freely available.

It is our galaxy, and this story begins in 2324. Corporations are very powerful, exemplified by the Chen Zua Corporation.\u00a0The SolSpace universe was originally created for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.woinrpg.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhat\u0027s OLD is NEW (WOIN)\u003c/a\u003e roleplaying game system, and is an official setting for that game; the events depicted in these tales are all canon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe cigar-smoking \u003cstrong\u003eSasha Bolotnikov\u003c/strong\u003e is the leader of the group and captain of the \u003cem\u003eMurphy\u003c/em\u003e. A Russian smuggler, she spent time in prison on Titan after being caught transporting illegal spices. Upon escape from prison, she immediately dove right back into her former career. Cool as a cucumber, Sasha is known for her luck at cards.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf Sasha is the \u003cem\u003eMurphy\u0027s\u003c/em\u003e heart, \u003cstrong\u003eGorrat\u003c/strong\u003e the enormous Ogron marine is its muscle. Nearly 7 feet tall, clad in a heavy, somewhat battered battlesuit with exposed circuitry and jury-rigged patches, and carrying his favorite antimatter rifle, Gorrat is always spoiling for a fight. He is slow on the uptake, never learned to read, and relies on the others to do most of his thinking for him. He does, however, somehow absorb a lot of random sports trivia. Gorrat is fundamentally good-natured, and has a big heart.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNot much use in a fight,\u003cstrong\u003e Dr. TikTok\u003c/strong\u003e is the \u003cem\u003eMurphy\u0027s\u003c/em\u003e android medic and general science officer.  Originally a technician on a moisture farm, he decided to pursue academic education. He is formally educated, but has little experience outside academia. A qualified doctor, and well-educated in various technical disciplines, TikTok is competent but has a cold nature and tendency to lecture; fortunately this is compensated for by his naivete which makes him strangely likeable. TikTok is fascinated by mythology - especially religions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen you\u0027re looking for \u003cstrong\u003eTalik\u003c/strong\u003e, look up. This black leather-clad Felan is at home on precarious ledges, leaping across the width of entire streets, and climbing to gain high vantage points. Talik is a burglar, adept at sneaking and picking locks, although she suffers from a very short attention span and extreme forgetfulness.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHolmes\u003c/strong\u003e never wanted to be a psychic. His talent was discovered by accident when he badly injured another child with an instinctive psi-blast. Viewed as an outsider, he learned quickly to charm his way through awkward situations, and developed into an intuitive, perceptive man with a firm grasp on psychology. Eventually, after obtaining a college degree in linguistics, he gave in and answered his calling, setting up as a commercial telepath.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/529e6f58e4b0f61963b40f53/t/5a69b3af24a6946fda176afc/1516876727104/murphycrew.png?format=1000w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
