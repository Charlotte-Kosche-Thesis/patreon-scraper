I have created gifts for family members, facilitated community art events, done ceramic work, etc. I always seem to come back to one medium though: comic illustration.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my best friends is a Spanish teacher and a native Spanish speaker. She always told me she thinks in Spanish and that when she speaks Spanish she feels like who she truly is. The truth is, I speak and think in comics. When I read comics, I know who I am. I experience comics in the the same way, I suspect, the she experiences the world when speaking\u00a0Spanish.\u003cdiv\u003eIt is my hope in the next several years to hone my comic making craft and develop more focused projects that I can truly dedicate my time towards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

This includes the work done on the podcast, site content updates, educational outreach programs, online course development, and more. Once we hit the milestone of $1,500 a month we will be able to ensure that all staff members are paid to for at least a half day of their time each month. Though we all know they put in way more time to this project than that monthly, hitting this milestone will indicate from you, the patrons, to us that you want to keep the site operating the way it is and that you value our time and energy put into the site.",
