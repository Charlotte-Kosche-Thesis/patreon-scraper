    "summary": "I am a divinatory artist.  What do I mean by that?  I create art in a variety of media, and that art is informed by divinatory methods such as tarot reading, casting runes, scrying, timing creations with lunar cycles and astrological alignments, and channeling, to name a few.  I am a modern-day mystic in an age when it is fashionable to scorn such things, but I offer my creations without attachment to any particular dogma or need for my audience to share my faith - in the end, all I wish to do is make the world a more beautiful and meaningful place, one creation at a time.  To that end, you will find here drawings, paintings, photos, digital art, and the occasional video, as well as documentation of my other creative activities, such as fiber arts, dancing, and brewing.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince there isn\u2019t much call for mysticism in the professional world, I\u2019ve done lots of things over the years to earn a living, including having been a co-founder of and the Creative Director/Logistician for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.templecon.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTempleCon\u003c/a\u003e retro-futurist gaming convention and the co-owner of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheTempleGames/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Temple Games\u003c/a\u003e.  Due to my stepmother\u0027s terminal illness, I have recently moved across country to the Puget Sound area in order to tend to the administrative side of her care, necessitating handing over those enterprises to other people. \u00a0Since my own health has been problematic - including a bout with cancer in 2017 - and living on an island tends to limit one\u0027s career opportunities, I\u0027m using this time to slow down a bit and focus on building my own business as an astrologer, tarot reader, and divinatory artist. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in.\u00a0 It is my hope that with your kind support, I can give free reign to the flood of art and spirit whose flow has in the past been too-frequently halted by the very real need to earn a living and the incredibly time-consuming ways I attempted to do that. \u00a0Your financial support will allow me to purchase the equipment to start making videos and live-streaming my process, as well as getting new art supplies (divinatory drawings go through a lot of paper and micron pens!), replacing my cranky scanner that likes to insert random squiggles in my work, getting materials for three-dimensional work, and replacing my thoroughly-destroyed Prismacolour set so I can do more colour work.\u00a0 Eventually, it would also help me to upgrade my astrological software so that I can start doing more predictive work as well as a research project in astrological analysis of group dynamics, with accompanying artwork, of course! \u00a0The pledges from 2016 got me Micron pens and paper, and the pledges from 2017 got me the camera that I now use to generate source material for my digital alterations and will be using to photograph my three-dimensional work, so Patreon has already made a big difference in what I can do creatively.\u00a0 With your help, I can further align my creative talents and skills with divination and the cycles of nature in a process that results in more art for you to enjoy."
