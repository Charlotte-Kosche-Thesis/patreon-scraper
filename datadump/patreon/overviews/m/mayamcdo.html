For those who might be new to M3... welcome, and I hope you enjoy your time along for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis book will be the first project of many (hopefully!), which highlights the ways in which life can be complicated but worth sharing and talking through and living without (too many) regrets. \u003cstrong\u003eI want to inspire you to live unapologetically, and to question everything - including me - in your pursuit for a full life.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027ve been reading and writing all my life, and finally want to share my love of the craft with the people around me, and the people around them, and so on...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m not deeply invested in my scribbles, I\u0027m working to keep myself alive, fed, and clothed. I love the work that I do because it\u0027s very people-oriented, but here -- this is my avenue for sharing my stories and building communities of friends that could last a lifetime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re really feeling inspired, join me on my journey by following me on Facebook and following #MayasMondayMotivation - a weekly affirmation, accompanied by puns, housekeeping (e.g. reminders to pay rent on the 1st of the month), and casual pleasantries to start your week off right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping to create a series of books; the first two are in progress:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.
