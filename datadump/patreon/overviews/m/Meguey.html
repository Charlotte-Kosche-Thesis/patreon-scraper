Coming next is\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e In the Company of Birds\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, in which you and another player try to \nattract the most birds to nest in your tree, and how many you attract \ntells your fortune together. After that, perhaps games about the sweet \nrising maple sap, the May bells of Montague, bringing the harvest home, \nor the ghosts of your Beloved Dead on All Hallow\u0027s Eve.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can \nread \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Holly and the Ivy\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@NightSkyGames/the-holly-and-the-ivy-a-midwinters-game-for-two-to-six-players-602a1fc442f1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere on Medium\u003c/a\u003e for a preview.
