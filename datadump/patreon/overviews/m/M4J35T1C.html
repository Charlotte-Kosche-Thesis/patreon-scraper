Welcome to my Patreon!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the man you all know commonly as M4J35T1C! Video games are a strong passion of mine that I developed at a very young age. Over time, I continued to experiment across various platforms and generated an interest across an array of different genres. In addition, I love to share my own experiences in gaming and decided, well, lets start producing some videos and giving back to the community that appreciates them as much as I do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChannel and Community Support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point, most of everything has been through use of my own funds. When I started this channel, I didn\u0027t expect to even reach 100 subscribers and considered this a casual pastime. Then, out of no where... BOOM! the channel gained a ton of traction, which has only fueled my passion for providing the community with even more, consistent grade A content. Apart from the time and effort, I have invested a lot in the channel between giveaways, equipment and software. My aim is to ensure that every visit you make to the channel isn\u0027t just about viewing a new video, but plunging you into a new experience each time you come back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWhere you come in\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I still anticipate funding a majority of the channel myself to keep it afloat, even the slightest bit from you guys in the community would mean the world to me as supporters of something I am most passionate about. With any funds received, I will be able to provide better and more frequent content on the channel as well as upgrade the current setup I am getting by on. Every bit counts and will allow me to continue producing top-shelf content for each and every one of you to enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eThe Rewards\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I dive into it, I just want to make note that you do NOT have to be a Patron in order to have my gratitude. Between the comments, emails, likes and subscriptions to the channel, I already appreciate every ounce of support given from you all in the community thus far. On the other hand, due to the persistence and overwhelming support to create a Patreon for those of you who want to give back and help me out a bit, this is the reason for its creation. Patreon serves as a means to reward the most loyal and supportive of you all in the community. I agree that those who choose to support me, support my passion and goals and truly feel the desire to help my channel to grow. Check out the different levels of support to the right \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUltimately...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just want to say thank you to every one of you who have supported me thus far.
