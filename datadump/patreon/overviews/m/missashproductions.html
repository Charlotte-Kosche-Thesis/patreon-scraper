In January 2017, after 3 years of serious filmmaking in Maryland, we packed up a car and drove West to Los Angeles and haven\u0027t looked back since. If you are more interested in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxddZUvd1lw\"\u003eOur story\u003c/a\u003e, feel free to check that video out! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where we need YOUR HELP to keep creating content! We\u0027ve gotten extremely efficient at creating no budget/ low budget shorts with limited resources, but now, especially in a brand new city, it\u0027s time for us to push ourselves to the next level of storytelling with better equipment, more actors and more crew and actual locations. We have scripts for pilots, web series and feature films that we\u0027d love to film, but are held back financially.\u00a0Your support helps us continue to focus on what we know we were born to do, storytelling and filmmaking. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe forget at the end of the day, we are all the same. Here at Miss Ash Productions, we promise to contribute our voices to share in our mutual human experience. In the words of a very incredible human, \"Love is love is love is love is love is love is love.....Now fill the world with music, love, and pride.\" \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening and checking us out. \u003cbr\u003eFind your passion, never let go.
