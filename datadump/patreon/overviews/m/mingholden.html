    "summary": "In 2013, I journeyed within the borders of Syria to write about the growing refugee crisis arising out of the civil war there. \u00a0I did so with the support of a Kickstarter campaign, and my donors received the dispatches from the journey as I wrote them. One excerpt from those writings, entitled \"The Surest Way To Survive\", earned the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://craborchardreview.siu.edu/dyer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efinalist slot for the \u003cem\u003eCrab Orchard Review\u003c/em\u003e\u0027s annual nonfiction contest\u003c/a\u003e\u0027 others went into\u00a0a series of Huffington Post articles (including this one, entitled \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ming-holden/im-antiwar-thats-why-i-su_b_3887378.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhat I Learned On The Ground In Syria\u003c/a\u003e\").\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis summer, that work has a sequel. \u00a0As we all know, the Syria conflict has not gotten better, and the world at large has a refugee crisis on its hands. \u00a0America has pledged to allow 2,000 Syrian refugees into the country. By contrast, \u003cstrong\u003eSweden is the only country in the EU to extend the offer of permanent residency to Syrian refugees and their families\u003c/strong\u003e. The Syrian refugee population in Sweden has reached at least 40,000. As soon as I heard this, I wondered what that has been like for the Syrian newcomers, who have traveled so many painful miles to an uncertain future. \u00a0To that end, \u003cstrong\u003eI will travel to Sweden for a week in July to learn about and connect with the Syrian refugee community there, and in exchange for your support you will receive \"dispatches\" of literary writing about the experience\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith experience in development work and refugee advocacy in twelve countries on four continents,\u00a0I am a well-meaning humanitarian, but by no means a wealthy one. \u00a0I\u0027m in the process of earning my second master\u0027s degree in the arts in my fifth year as a graduate student, and I owe something like $65,000 total in federal loans from my years in undergraduate and graduate programs. However, I am blessed with more privilege, visibility, and mobility than the great majority of humans on the planet may ever be. While I can\u0027t pledge continuous years of self-funded activism work, I can pledge a week of time and work and a plane ticket this summer, and hope that those of you who enjoy or benefit from my written work about the venture won\u0027t mind supporting the endeavor."
