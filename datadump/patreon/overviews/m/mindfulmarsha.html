    "summary": "1 in 5 Americans is affected by a clinical mental health issue and less than 50% seek treatment due to three major factors:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ea) Stigma - \"Stop feeling sorry for yourself...Snap out of it.\" Discrimination against mental health issues forces millions of people to live in shame instead of seek support. Stigma even shaped the crafting of Medicaid laws 50 years ago because the government didn\u0027t want to \u0027waste\u0027 federal money on mental illness (original Medicaid provisions specified that hospitals may use federal aid to treat physical conditions but generally not mental health).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \"There is no other area of medicine where the government is the source of the stigma.\"-Rep Tim Murphy, R-PA\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eb) Treatment cost - The average psychotherapy session ranges from $75 to $150 an hour. And a significant portion of clinical psychologists do not accept insurance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ec) Time / Convenience - If you\u0027re struggling with mental health issues while holding a full-time job, it can be incredibly difficult to find time during business hours to attend therapy sessions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeam Zinnbot is building Mindful Marsha, an interactive Facebook Messenger bot, to provide easy, affordable access to experimentally verified mental health exercises and curriculum targeting common anxiety, depression, and mental wellness issues. We\u0027re constantly working to enhance Marsha\u0027s understanding of your situation, her repertoire of exercises, and educational content that can help provide relief from anxiety and depression. In the long run, we envision Marsha working along with your physician to help manage and improve your mental health.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a founder of ZinnBot and creator of Marsha, I am energized by my personal struggle with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression which started 3 years ago, as well as the suffering I\u0027ve seen close friends and family go through because they did not get help for their own mental health issues. I am currently working on this project at night, when I get home from my day job, but with your support, could give this 100% of my brain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting the team on this journey. We\u0027ll see that it benefits some people that may never have sought the help they deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunding usage:\u003cbr\u003eSecure Web Servers\u003cbr\u003eProprietary Software Development\u003cbr\u003eAnalytics Software Subscription\u003cbr\u003eUser Acquisition\u003cbr\u003eWorkspace\u003cbr\u003e"
