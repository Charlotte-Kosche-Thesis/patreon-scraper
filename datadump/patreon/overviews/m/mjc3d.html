You can email me at mjc3d@cyberczar.org. Want to be even more anonymous? You can leave me feedback on my website at \u003ca href=\"https://mjc3d.com/feedback/.\"\u003ehttps://mjc3d.com/feedback/\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy backstory.\u003c/strong\u003e I have been using DAZ Studio (and before that Poser), Carrara, Bryce, Vue, Modo, Zbrush, and others for about 21 years. I picked up my first copy of Poser 1.0 back in 1996, and fell in love. I\u0027m still a hobbyist after all these years, and belive it or not I\u0027m still learning! For the longest time I\u0027ve kept my works private not thinking they were good enough or warranted being displayed publicly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs I\u0027ve published my work publicly I\u0027ve gotten to know myself more as a creator.\u003c/strong\u003e I live for instant gratification, and a direct line to my audience has been wonderful. I love making things and instantly sharing them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll of my works are released for free.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m not selling prints on DeviantArt, or otherwise asking for any money. I\u0027ve been a longtime supporter of the Creative Commons and everything I\u0027ve ever produced publicly has been released under a Creative Commons license. Non-Commercial, Attribution-Required, Share-Alike for any of my works. Of course if you\u0027d like to use my works commercially you are more than welcome to contact me so we can negotiate a license. :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen you support me at a dollar per-month or higher you\u0027re telling me that you believe in what I\u0027m doing and what I\u0027m creating, and for that I\u0027ll always be eternally grateful.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs one of my Patrons, you will have access to my private Discord server and Patron-only channel. \u003c/strong\u003eGet a first-hand look of what I\u0027m working on, and have a direct line to me with the possibility of influencing what I\u0027m working on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant something special?\u003c/strong\u003e Have a special request?

Your support allows me to buy the newest figures, utilize new scenes and backgrounds, and overall help keep my tools and resources fresh and updated. By supporting me and my works you\u0027re also helping to indirectly support a huge ecosystem of talented 3D artists and designers around the World.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhether you\u0027re backing me for $1 or $5 THANK YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
