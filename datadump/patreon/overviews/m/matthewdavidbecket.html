    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://www.strangeling.org/WhoAmI.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Matthew and I write fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to try to categorize the things I wrote into genre and (although some of them would easily fit into the genres Fantasy, Horror, Parody, or Suspense) they all had one common denominator - they were lies, hence fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI practiced writing lies and my writing started to get better. I studied writing theory and it got even better. You may have seen bits and pieces on my Facebook page. If so, I hope you enjoyed. I want to continue writing better and better, but that takes time and time is money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.strangeling.org/WhyImAtPatreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately many of the other social media platforms out there (such as Facebook, Wattpad, etc.) are no longer conducive to sharing the written word. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e As you have probably heard from many other creators, the algorithms and advertisement-driven sites are making it almost impossible for you to see what you WANT to see, and for me to show you what I WANT to show you.   Not to mention, I\u0027d like to make money at this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can help me with that. Besides my sheer want to tell stories, your patronage and encouragement are the biggest driving factors in my writing career. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.strangeling.org/WhatsInItForYou.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe perks of being a Patron? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll get frequent stories from me. Some will be stand alone short stories. Others will in a series format. I like writing both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also keep you updated on any submissions or publications. You will be beside me personally seeing my writing career progress. I want and will get published and I\u0027d love for you to be along with me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a fun little bonus I\u0027ve created - twice a month you\u0027ll send me to the movies, but you will vote on which movie I see. I will tally the votes between Patreon and my Facebook page. You can make me see the most god-awful movie ever (I really hate the Fast and Furious movies) or you can treat me to a something fantastic (Pixar, Tarantino, Wes Anderson). It doesn\u0027t matter, I HAVE TO SEE IT and write a review. Please be gentle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTravel with me. My wife (artist Jasmine Becket-Griffith) and I travel a lot. We have a busy schedule. I\u0027ll share photos with you, give you some of the backstage highlights, and my general take on this city we\u0027re visiting. (I hope you enjoy Southern California, Disney, and London. You\u0027ll be getting plenty of that.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always had the need to entertain people.  To get anything in return is amazing and I don\u0027t know how to begin to thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour writer, your liar, your entertainer,\u003cbr\u003e-Matthew David Becket\u003cbr\u003e"
