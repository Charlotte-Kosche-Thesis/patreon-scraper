    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"https://www.themainloop.com/wp-content/uploads/593_Sergio_20170323_ByLorena_Photography-1.jpg\"\u003eConsistent money is a goal for most emerging artists. One of the scariest things about being an independent fine artist is not knowing what I will be making, month to month. There are lean times where you are just hoping for something to come through, the walk to the mailbox in the hope of a check being there, or an email telling you that you sold something, or chasing down gallery owners (sometimes physically: I\u0027ve heard some stories).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.themainloop.com/wp-content/uploads/360_Sergio_20170323_ByLorena_Photography_forPatreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHow does one make sure they have the money they rely on to live, let alone thrive? One way is to sell as much original art as they can as often as possible, but this is extremely difficult. Sure I could try to lower my prices, so that every painting might sell but that\u2019s unfair for a few reasons. Instead most of us diversify by pursuing different avenues.Everything from selling prints, sketches, teaching, social media, and other services add up to a normal artist career. However, even all of this is no guarantee due to the unpredictability of income.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n Enter Patreon.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.themainloop.com/wp-content/uploads/112_Sergio_Lopez_20170314-2_ByLorena_Photography_forPatreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your support, I will now have an actual number that I can know what I\u2019ll be recieving monthly. If I get it high enough, I can know that a lot of my expenses will be covered. This allows me to \n\u003cem\u003enot have to worry about \u201cpainting what sells.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e Even though I already paint what I want, there is a juggle between guessing what is going to sell next, where I should put it so that it is in front of the right collector to buy it, where I need to focus my valuable resources, etc. I can spend even more time and mental energy on just the creative aspect of work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.themainloop.com/wp-content/uploads/454_Sergio_Lopez_20170314_ByLorena_Photography_forPatreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is for those of you who believe in me enough to help me continue to create. When my paintings come up in your feed, do you just appreciate what I do? Or, say you can\u2019t afford a print. Or just don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of ordering one and then thinking where am I gonna put it? How will I display it? Even a dollar helps because enough dollars add up.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.themainloop.com/wp-content/uploads/280_Sergio_Lopez_20170314_ByLorena_Photography_forPatreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEven if you\u2019re not supporting me, support another artist whose work you believe in. Support 5. Give them a dollar. Enough people, 5 dollars a month, we can all help each other and keep us all afloat. True freedom to create. Never has it been this convenient, maybe in history."
