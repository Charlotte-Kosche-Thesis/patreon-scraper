Yes, that is a broad range. Yes, there are infinite ways of sharing our stories. Life only seems ordinary until you embrace what makes it beautiful! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never believed I could pursue writing because \"if it won\u0027t support you financially then it isn\u0027t worth while.\" \u003cstrong\u003eWrong!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took a decade of pushing my craft by the wayside before I realized how important writing was to my happiness. Only after that did I decide to pursue writing as a career. Because it makes me so happy. My goal is to put more books into the hands of kids and young adults and to enlighten more people to various other forms of storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat do you do?\u003c/h3\u003e\nI write, of course! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve enjoyed writing since I was very young. Creative assignments for school. Harry Potter fanfiction. Cartoon fanfiction. I\u2019m not ashamed of my roots. I finally found my own stories when I was about 15 years old and I knew that was where my heart belonged.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are my current works in progress that you are helping bring to life:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStill Life (Book 1 of the Principles of Magic series)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKitty Guthrie has a BIG problem. It isn\u0027t homework or bullies. Not her sister\u0027s bad head or her mom\u0027s dark days. It isn\u0027t even trouble planning the biggest event Glade Crest Junior High has ever seen. Those are a piece of cake to handle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is Kitty has magic and lately it\u0027s gotten out of control. If anyone found out, she might as well tattoo F-R-E-A-K to her forehead! She wants to be known, but not like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut someone already knows. A whole group of someones actually.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen a boy named Will becomes her mentor in the Alliance--an organization of modern day Mages--to help her understand magic, Kitty expects to slip right back into her normal life afterwards. She has never been more wrong. The harder Kitty tries to keep her two worlds apart, the faster they come crashing towards each other. With magic, the crash might be more literal than she\u0027d like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo protect herself from the darker side of magic, Kitty has to be brave enough to rethink everything about her normal life or she might be left with nothing. Again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShadow of the Mad Sorceress (a Fantasy AGE adventure)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn the quaint country of Highfalls Swale, the youngest citizens are embarking on their Rite of Passage tradition: Choosing Night. They think it\u0027s just the beginning of their lives as adults in their communities. It becomes the beginning of a dark mystery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePolitical tides are shifting. History that was buried cannot hide any longer. Old evils are stirring beneath the surface of the complacent little region. The answers to the well being of the Swale and those who live there lie in the legends of the mad sorceress Dunmara who vanished hundreds of years ago. Or was she ever really gone?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTabletop RPGs? Like Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons? \u003cbr\u003eWhat are you, a NERD?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eYes, I am a fervent nerd. My husband and I are huge gamers. We love evenings playing board games and rpg adventures with our friends. These games bring people together and that is all I dream to do with my craft. So I also write these RPG campaigns and I live stream them with my husband to introduce more people to this form of storytelling and bring more people together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat\u0027s In It For You?\u003c/h3\u003e\nTo thank you for your support, I want to shout your name from the mountaintops and help you grow the way you\u0027ve helped me. You\u0027ll get an insider look at the creation of these works and a view of my journey through self publishing. Hopefully it inspires your own journey. You\u2019re also invited to witness the world of tabletop games and a different, much more interactive art of storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like the idea of filling the world with more readers and thinkers, I hope you\u2019ll consider supporting my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWriting Schedule:\u003c/h4\u003eIf you\u0027d like to catch my writing live, I stream on Twitch three times a week.
