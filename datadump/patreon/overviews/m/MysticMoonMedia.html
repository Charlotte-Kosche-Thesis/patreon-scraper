I tattooed for over four years, creating \nmostly custom work.  I am an adventurer at heart, so it did not surprise\n me to find myself in college. I received a degree in Graphic Design and\n began working for a local print shop.  This is when  Mystic Moon Media \nwas born.  I started by creating my traditional art of ink, watercolor \nand acrylic, but my love for the computer drove me to what I do today,  \nDigital Artistry.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor those who personally know Cherie Gerhardt, it came as no surprise \nwhen she chose to become a professional artist right out of high school.\n Her lifelong love affair with art led her to master skills in \ntattooing, graphic design, ink drawings, watercolors,and acrylic \npainting. However, when she began dabbling with computer drawing \nprograms, she discovered her true passion was for digital artistry.  \nCherie Gerhardt\u0027s art pieces are heavily influenced by her interest in \nmythical creatures\nand fairy tales. Her fantasy drawings range from sexy and serious to \ninnocent and heart-warming, making it easy to find a piece of art that \nis suitable for a wide variety of ages and interests.",
