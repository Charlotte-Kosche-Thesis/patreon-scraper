I post a new video (almost) every day, ranging from Horror, to Platformers, to random collaboration videos with other content creators. I love creating videos for people to enjoy, and I genuinely enjoy the process of it all as well. At 100,000 Subscribers, the channel is growing, but that doesn\u0027t mean that everything is going well. [DUN DUN DUNNNNN]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247,150,70);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs some of you might know, my main source of income is YouTube\u0027s payout for Ads watched on my videos. The last few years have been rough on the platform, with policies changing wildly and without warning that have really hurt our ability to remain self sufficient. The \"Adpocalypse\" hasn\u0027t gone away, and my videos are still being demonetized more often then not. So, in order to keep things running smoothly, I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247,150,70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does my money go towards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eYour support goes directly into what is needed to run my channel, both in terms of what you see, and what you do not. I have taken on a few financial responsibilities since pursuing content creation fulltime. Small things such as the internet bill, equipment, and the electricity, etc. All small things individually, but they add up. On top of this, I still need to be on the look out for the latest games releasing on Steam. You support goes directly into keeping things behind the scenes working, as well as what you see online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247,150,70);\"\u003eIs there a catch? And What is in it for me?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs there a catch? Nope! Once you become a Patron, you\u0027re done. Patreon will charge you between the 1st and 5th of every month. If you ever want to stop supporting my channel, you can simply stop. By becoming a Patron, however, you can unlock different rewards, ranging from access to my Discord server, to having your name in my supporter\u0027s credits, to free merch!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
