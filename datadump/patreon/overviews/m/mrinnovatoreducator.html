An odd combination to vlog about, however, if you think about it, both can solve any problem. I work at a STEM High School in Asheville, NC. I teach physical, earth, and environmental science, as well as sponsor an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ndainnovation.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eInnovation Club\u003c/a\u003e. Teaching is my passion, but as most teachers know, it is hard to make a living just on teaching. After my daughter was born, my wife and I decided it would be best for her to stay home with the baby, but I needed to find a second job to keep us afloat. Before I apply to flip burgers, I\u0027m going to give movie making a shot. I love making videos about science, engineering, and other STEM related stuff. Tara, my wife, does a lot of behind the scenes design work, while I do the silly stuff.
