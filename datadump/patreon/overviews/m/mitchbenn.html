    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page, friends...  I expect you\u0027re wondering why I asked you to meet me here. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll explain at (inordinate) length in due course, but basically:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you enjoy the things I do, and you\u0027d like me to carry on doing them, and you\u0027d like to HELP me carry on doing them, well now you can.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you may know, Patreon is a site which allows fans and supporters of artists and creators to directly sponsor those creators to create more stuff, be it music, videos, podcasts, stories, articles, or (as in my case) all of the above.  Some artists offer a monthly subscription; I\u0027m going with the other option which is the \"Per Thing\" pledge. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to become one of my Patreon patrons, you can pledge amounts from $1 per Thing (I know most of you are Brits like me but Patreon is an American site so dollars it is. They\u0027re worth about the same these days anyway).  Then every time I produce a Thing, be it a new song, new video, podcast or whatever, I will then receive that amount into my Patreon account (who then pass 95% of it on to me).  So if I have to take some time off, or just get lazy and forget to produce any Things for a couple of weeks, you pay nothing until I get my act together.  You can also CAP your monthly contributions, at, for example, $5 or $10 a month, so if you\u0027re pledging say, $1 a thing and I get a touch of the vapours and start writing two songs a day (as I have been known to do), you don\u0027t end up shelling out 60 bucks just because I\u0027ve gone a bit nuts. \u00a0You still get access to all the Things even if you hit your cap, of course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I\u0027ll be producing extra stuff JUST FOR YOU, my supporters. Exclusive songs, videos, surprises and rewards, to thank you for your help because you will be supporting me and taking an interest in my creative process and will as such be my \u00a0BEST FRIENDS.  Although if you turn up unannounced in my garden at 3am I will still call the police. Just thought I\u0027d make that clear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut why, I\u0027m sure some of you are wondering, is That Mitch Benn Off The Radio coming cap in hand to a crowdfunding site? Surely this sort of thing is for new artists trying to get a foothold in the business, not greybearded old gits who\u0027ve been going since the 90s...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is still a lot of misunderstanding about what crowdfunding actually is. \u00a0Crowdfunding is a way for people to directly support and sustain artists and creators whose work means something to them, in a collaborative framework, making it possible for those artists and creators to carry on being inventive and risky in this ever changing world in which we live in, as Paul McCartney so awkwardly put it. \u00a0The whole \"is crowdfunding begging\" debate is nonsense; crowdfunding isn\u0027t begging in the same way it isn\u0027t macram\u00e9 or windsurfing. \u00a0That\u0027s just not what it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all like being able to access online content for free. \u00a0I myself experience genuine indignation if some old video or TV show I\u0027m looking for on YouTube isn\u0027t up there, for free, RIGHT NOW. \u00a0And it\u0027s important to give stuff away; it\u0027s how people discover you. \u00a0And not everyone CAN pay. \u00a0But somebody has to get paid at some point or one day there won\u0027t BE any more content. \u00a0If the only people who can make artistic stuff are the cravenly mainstream or the independently wealthy, life is gonna get pretty dull pretty fast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond thing to bear in mind is that I am now literally Mitch Benn OFF The Radio. \u00a0As many of you will have noticed, I\u0027m no longer appearing on The Now Show.  I haven\u0027t been \"sacked\"; that\u0027s not how it works...  I just wasn\u0027t asked to be on the last series and there\u0027s no reason to expect I\u0027ll be asked back in the future.  And you know what? I\u0027m actually pretty okay about that.  I had a good long run on the show, it\u0027s provided me with whatever public profile I have and the whole point of The Now Show when it started was to find new radio comedy talent (that\u0027s how I got the job in the first place) so maybe it\u0027s time I made room for some new people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in one respect it is a bit of a relief; The Now Show was a pretty relentless drain on the creative resources, having to produce songs which, by and large, would be broadcast twice and then forgotten about.  But by the same token, I liked being OBLIGED to come up with new stuff all the time.  I enjoyed not even having the option to slack off.  Part of the plan with Patreon is to recreate that impetus, make sure I keep creating new things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause if anything it\u0027s more important now than ever before to keep the satire flag flying, by any and all means necessary and via whatever media may be available.  And when I\u0027m producing satirical material directly for my fans and supporters rather than via the radio, I won\u0027t have to keep taming it down for the Archers crowd or indeed worry about Punt \u0026amp; Dennis bagsying all the meaty stories that week just because I didn\u0027t turn up to the writers\u0027 meeting again...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also true that the loss of The Now Show has made a significant dent in my finances.  I wasn\u0027t getting paid as much as most people seem to think I was (a lot of people are still under the charming delusion that the minute you\u0027ve appeared on any broadcast media with any regularity then you\u0027re living in a gated millionaires\u0027 community and driving a Bentley. Such is very much NOT the case) but the Now Show did represent the closest thing I had to any sort of REGULAR income in my otherwise entirely piecemeal and chaotic monetary affairs. \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a sad fact that it\u0027s almost impossible these days to make a living - not even a decent living, just A Living - as a working comedian, if you\u0027re not on the TV.  It\u0027s not so much that the TV pays so much better than live work (it doesn\u0027t always); it\u0027s more that as a live gigging comedian, you\u0027re constantly having to compete with the comedians on TV as they\u0027re usually touring as well.  It\u0027s entirely understandable; if people have the choice between spending \u00a315 to go to a comedy club to see three or four comics they\u0027ve never heard of, or \u00a330 to go see That Guy Off The TV, most of them will go to see the guy off the TV.  The money comedy clubs pay the acts has hardly gone up a penny since I got into the business twenty years ago, while the overheads (petrol, train fares, hotel rooms) have rocketed in price, as has the cost of living in general.  That old 90s prediction that comedy would become \"the new rock \u0026amp; roll\" has come true in as much as now, like in the rock business, there are a couple of dozen acts at the top of the tree making millions while everyone else struggles to pay the rent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is where you, my wonderful generous damnedly handsome PATRONS come galloping to the rescue.\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can not only keep producing comedy songs, videos, podcasts etc. but I will be able to prioritise the most creative elements of my oeuvre (yes, I know, but it is the best word for it) and indeed take my work into rather edgier territory than has been possible, or at least advisable, heretofore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that will be at least partly up to you as well; the collaborative nature of Patreon will allow me to exchange and discuss ideas with you, the Patrons.  While I\u0027ve spent much of my career as a solo artist, I love bouncing ideas off people and producing unique little artistic fusions and crossovers.  You\u0027ll not just be funding the Things, you\u0027ll be helping to define and create the Things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if this is something you\u0027d like to get involved with, check out the different pledge options in that column over there, see if there\u0027s one which suits you, and let\u0027s start making fun stuff together!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
