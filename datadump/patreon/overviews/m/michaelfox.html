    "summary": "Hey team, welcome to my Patreon Page! It\u0027s great to be able to use Patreon for something I\u0027ve been thinking of doing for a long time.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m going to donate 100% of the money I raise.\u003c/strong\u003e 50% to the Boulder Shelter for the Homeless and 50% to the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless. But first let me explain about this website and my project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon:\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a website run by very close friends of mine; Tyler and Cole Palmer, Anthony Privitelli, and the rest of the great Patreon team. It\u0027s an awesome website built to better fund different artists and now a runner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow it works:\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eBasically, artists ask supporters/fans for 1 or 2 dollars per piece of art they release because creating great content costs money. It costs in terms of time, or materials, or equipment. In return, the creators give cool incentives to their supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow you might think that running doesn\u0027t cost money... but unlike most people on here. I\u0027m not going to keep anything I get, I\u0027m donating it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking that instead of my supporters donating per piece of content, they donate per training milestone and marathon I run. That way every mile I run, I will raise that many more dollars for a good cause. It will motivate me to keep going and complete my running program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eHow much will I be running: \u003c/i\u003eThis is my first Marathon. In fact, I\u0027ve never even run a half marathon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy training program calls for the following amount of miles every month. The Boulder Marathon is Oct. 4th so my training program goes accordingly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMilestones:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMay 26th - Boulder Boulder 10K\u003cbr\u003eJune - 95 miles\u003cbr\u003eJune 29th - Boulder Heart \u0026amp; Sole Half Marathon\u003cbr\u003eJuly \u00a0- 110 miles\u003cbr\u003eAugust - 125 miles\u003cbr\u003eSeptember - 140 miles\u003cbr\u003eOctober 4th - Boulder Marathon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much should you donate: \u003c/strong\u003eI have 7 milestones above. I will charge my supporters each time I reach a milestone. That will be once or twice a month. So you should think about how much you are willing to give and divide that by 7.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you would like to give $21 to my project, pledge $3 per milestone reached. If you pledge for me to reach my milestones. It will help me train that much harder.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
