    "summary": "Hi, my name is\u003cstrong\u003e Mike Exner III\u003c/strong\u003e, and by hook or by crook you\u0027ve found your way to my Patreon page! Most of you probably found this through the webcomic I write,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://adamant.loopholecomics.com\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://adamant.loopholecomics.com\"\u003eADAMANT\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- the most unbreakable superhero on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.cubeupload.com/HhgPvY.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdamant is about a superhero thrust into the future by his greatest enemy. When he arrives, he finds the world has undergone drastic, and sometimes frightening changes primarily due to his disappearance from the present.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.cubeupload.com/SeJso4.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdamant was created by me and artist Hany Khattab, and is supported by a rotating cast of incredible creators such as D.C. Stuelpner, Ian Waryanto, Josh Jensen and Micah Myers. The webcomic is offered to the masses for FREE, and you can find it at the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://adamant.loopholecomics.com\"\u003eAdamant website\u003c/a\u003e, or on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tapas.io/series/Adamant\"\u003eTapastic\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/adamant/list?title_no=3717\"\u003eWebtoons\u003c/a\u003e and even\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://adamant.thecomicseries.com/\"\u003eComicFury\u003c/a\u003e! This means you can\u00a0read the adventures of our stalwart hero from the very beginning whenever you\u0027d like. The creative team behind Adamant is NOT being paid for the tremendous work they do on the project. They are doing it for the love of making fun, engaging comics that our readers will enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where YOU come in! I\u0027d love to keep making Adamant for as long as I have stories to tell, and will endeavor to do exactly that. But if you like Adamant (or any of the work I do) you can financially support it (or me) through Patreon. I\u0027m going to create comics regardless, but your support means the world to me and my family. Patreon lets you set an amount you can give per month and with that funding I can work on making more great comics for you! In essence, the comics I make are made possible by contributions from readers like you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that begs the question... what do you get out of this deal? Well, for starters, there\u0027s plenty of FREE content here such as my Comic Short Archive (multi-page short comics I\u0027ve created), my Comic Pitch Graveyard (comics pitches that didn\u0027t quite make it) as well as\u00a0behind-the-scenes looks at work-in-progress comic projects I\u0027m developing with a variety of other fantastic artists. You can also read every page of the Adamant webcomic right here from the very beginning!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all that FREE content, what\u0027s left for those that pledge? I\u0027m glad you asked! Anyone that pledges even one solitary dollar will be granted access to Early Worm updates of the Adamant webcomic, which we post weeks (sometimes even months!) in advance, and your name will also be added to the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://adamant.loopholecomics.com/patrons/\"\u003ePATRONS\u003c/a\u003e page on the Adamant website. That\u0027s right, your name will be emblazoned for all time as a supporter of the Adamant webcomic and the artistic stylings of Mike Exner III. That\u0027s me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those that pledge a bit more we\u0027ve got additional rewards such as\u00a0PDF issues of all the comics I\u0027ve ever created, full scripts of every comic I write, complete access to pitches that are currently making the rounds at various publishers, and print copies of just about every comic I\u0027ve ever made! My goal is to make comics, and I want to share as much of that process as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if any of that interests you, I hope you\u0027ll consider lending your support. I\u0027ll try my very best to make it worth your while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.cubeupload.com/aqnpni.jpg\"\u003e"
