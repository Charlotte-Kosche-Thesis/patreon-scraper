I was the lead singer of\u00a0 The Misfits in the 90\u0027s and I have been making music and entertaining people ever since. I spend most of my time touring and performing. Being out on the road and being able to see the world is quite a blessing and I have been doing it a very long time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the father of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BcTk8YpBNdd/\"\u003e3 beautiful children\u003c/a\u003e. Being a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BdXtg0QBq_E/\"\u003eDad\u003c/a\u003e is the most important part of my not so normal life.\u00a0 I have been struggling for years to figure out a way to stay home more often and actually be present in my childrens\u0027 life while continuing to create, perform, compose and make a living the only way I know how.\u00a0 Touring and performing has always been the only way I could make a living and be able to take care of my responsibilities....... until now.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am SO happy that you found my Patreon page. Come with me on this journey and I will give you exclusive insight and access to my life and work.\u00a0 With your support and the support of my awesome network of friends and fans at last I have the opportunity to deliver and expand on even more creations and content for you. But most importantly I might be able to stay home more often and be a Dad. Children grow fast and when you spend 9 months on the road a year it seems to happen even faster. I spend more time on the phone and Skype with my children then in person. That can all change if you subscribe\u003cem\u003e right now !\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubscribe for less then a latte costs at Starbucks everyday right now and get unprecedented exclusive access to my life and career . You\u0027ll receive my weekly podcast and live video performances that only you can see. You\u0027ll also get access to my once a month live concert, exclusive artwork and T-shirts. You\u0027ll receive my newsletter and updates before anybody else. You\u0027ll get free DVDs and albums when they are released..... and much, much more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, all of you for your continued support.\u00a0 My family thanks you, too.\u00a0 Never before has there been an opportunity like this for creators like myself to enter into a new type of earnings model that has the power to significantly change the course of our lives and the lives of our families.\u00a0 Patreon has the ability to Revolutionize this industry for independent artists and creators like myself by giving us the opportunity to actually get paid for what we create and not give it to the tech giants that rule our digital lives. Again, and most importantly for artists like me it FINALLY gives us an opportunity to normalize our lives and careers which in turn has the power to allow us to be even more prolific and effective creators!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy now you might be wondering how this all works.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply choose your subscription tier from the side panel on the page.\u00a0 You will receive access and content based on what you choose.\u00a0 Your credit card is charged once a month.\u00a0 \u00a0You can also set a limit on your subscription so that you don\u0027t go over budget.\u00a0 You can opt out or change your subscription at any point.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Michale Graves\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
