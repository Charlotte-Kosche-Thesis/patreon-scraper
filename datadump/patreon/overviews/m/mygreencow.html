From Creative Journaling, to Happy Mail. Craft hauls, unboxings and reviews, whatever takes my fancy really.\u003cbr\u003eI think most of you may have found me through my creative journaling videos though, it\u0027s the most viewed video on my channel. It\u0027s a relatively new passion of mine, and it\u0027s been so lovely to find so many people who also enjoy the process of journaling creatively!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2yT5IPXgAARYsf.jpg:large\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about me and how I\u0027ve got to where I currently am.. I\u0027ve always been creative, I reckon I got that from both my parents, though the paper craft thing is pretty much all from my mum. For as long as I can remember I\u0027ve been obsessed with all things stationery!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI studied Art, Photography, DT, \u0026amp; IT for my GCSE\u0027s \u0026amp; then went on to study Photography \u0026amp; Interactive media at college. All of these I chose because I hadn\u0027t a clue about what I wanted to do when I was older. For this reason I didn\u0027t continue onto University.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CmrwPwzXgAAQ1Mm.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then I\u0027ve kind of just been going with the flow I suppose! I\u0027ve got a couple of online shops, and my youtube channel, I also create content for Creativity Magazine here and there. As long as I\u0027m enjoying what I do and can afford to live this way, I\u0027m not going to stop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C9omAleXkAI--Gc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to set up a Patreon page after having a couple of people mention it to me last year, so I thought now was a good time to set it up. In 2016 my main focus for my time was moving house, and not just moving house but moving into a house that needed A LOT done to it (If you watched my vlogs during that time you\u0027ll know what I mean). But now things have somewhat settled and I feel like I\u0027m able to set aside the time to create some exclusive content, and give Patreon a go!\u003cbr\u003eOf course I will still be creating the usual content over on my YouTube channel, I\u0027m never going to stop that. But this is for those of you who would like a little more each month :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, and thank you so much if you do decide to become a patron - Daisy X\u003c/div\u003e"
