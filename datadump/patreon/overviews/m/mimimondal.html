Also, I need more money than that. I woke up freezing last night to discover my heater has stopped working. Also, I want cake.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHOWEVER, if you *do* want to give me $42, you can watch me blabber on video, ask me a (reasonable) question, get an un/published story feedback every month (only one though, please), and probably catch up in person for a meal whenever you are in New York or I am at the place where you live. Not being a rapist or serial killer will be appreciated. I am mostly interested in knowing who you are at all. Wow.\u00a0",
