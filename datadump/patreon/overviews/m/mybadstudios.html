    "summary": "Hi there and welcome to my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time out of your day to have a look at what I am trying to achieve with my project. I am insanely passionate about this so I can (and normally do) speak your ear off but I am going to put in the effort to control myself and keep it short this time :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, I want to make games. Many many games... but not some \"2 weeks of work and now I\u0027ll publish what I have\" worthless games, no... decent games that people will actually WANT to play. More over, I want to allow these games to speak to one another so that if you have one you can do things in the other like playing a cart game and winning a GoldenSword as your trophy after 100 first places... then going into the multiplayer RPG and finding the GoldenSword now in your inventory!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlocking a hidden character in one game and then being able to play him in another. Ever seen a ninja participate in a witch\u0027s broomstick race? You might be able to soon enough! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to all of this I want to create a website that ties it all together into a unifying experience and gives you even more features like getting a social page similar to Facebook where you can invite friends and post on your wall and upload photos and all that good stuff but, very importantly, the website and the games will be tightly integrated with one another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you recruit new team members for your party, this does not mean that you simply have someone on your friends list on the website and now you can go chat in Discord... no. If they are your friend and they are playing the game then they are already linked to your party. Some games, for instance, will feature armies battling each other and the strength of your army will be determined by the number of friends you have and the combined stats of the best gear they and you have. When you are being attacked, your friends gear is automatically fetched to help defend you against the attack. XP is shared between participating players whether they are actually playing or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh I have so much more to share with you and get you all hyped up and super excited about this but this is already way longer than I wanted to keep you occupied on this page. Let me then end of with one final vision of mine (and the reason why I am on Patreon, exactly). All of this is getting made already. I\u0027ve already spent years building and refining the games and website systems and just need the time to put it all in place and create the rest and build the games... all of this is going to get made, there is not even a question about that... the only question is \"Will I be able to do what I want to do which is to make all of this available for free?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why I am here. I want to build games and a social hub and guild site and give my visitors an awesome experience while playing my games on the website, on their mobile devices, consoles and even on their TVs... and I want to make it all available for free. Bills dictate that I charge people but a few $ here and there can reduce that to only in-game advertising while a few more $ can finally afford me to work on this full time and not having to charge anyone a single cent to enjoy all that I have created!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what I need your help with and I humbly ask for your support towards this goal.\u003cbr\u003eI thank you once again for taking the time to check out this project of mine :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTill later"
