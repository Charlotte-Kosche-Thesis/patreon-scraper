With the support of Patrons I will be able to build more, film more, spend more time with you on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and here, guiding, advising and shooting the breeze. I can also invest in better equipment, better video editing software and more, which I will also be able to use to create more varied content such as convention footage and out-and-about stuff. If pledges reach a high enough level, I\u0027ll be able to have enough of an income to offer giveaways of builds and unopened kits to ALL my followers.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo again, a million thanks for deciding to help support me, I love you all and I never believed what they said about you anyway."

Alternatively you can choose a small Warhammer 40K vehicle kit (we can discuss, but I would say stick to \u0026lt;\u00a330 kits) \u00a0instead. This will be shipped to you free of charge (unless the size of the model and packaging is excessive in which case I may ask you to make a partial contribution towards shipping, but we will discuss that in advance). \u00a0If possible, the build may be filmed as a Patreon-exclusive series (unless the build is particularly complex in which case it will not be filmed other than quick video diary updates).\u00a0\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eALTERNATIVELY!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy not wait for something better? Instead of taking the offer above after three pledges, why not \u00a0leave it for 12 pledges? Patrons who have happily contributed 12 \u00a0consecutive pledge payments at this tier (and not previously taken their free HG build after three) \u003cstrong\u003ewill be able to choose an MG kit and it will receive the full Skill Level 5 paint job\u003c/strong\u003e. Alternatively, if you wish \u003cstrong\u003eyou can instead choose a Warhammer 40K vehicle kit\u003c/strong\u003e (plastic only - excludes Forgeworld kits). \"Vehicles\" includes Imperial Knights and so on. I *may* be open to non-vehicle WH kits, but my strengths lie in the vehicles - but you are welcome to ask.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf possible, the build may be filmed as a Patreon-exclusive series (unless the build is particularly complex in which case it will not be filmed other than quick video diary updates).\u00a0This will be shipped to you free of charge (unless the size of the model and packaging is excessive in which case I may ask you to make a partial contribution towards shipping, but we will discuss that in advance).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease note the build offer includes build and paint, not lighting, custom construction, dioramas or modification. This offer excludes the MG Destiny kits and variants, as those kits are HORRIBLE and I will hate you. I also reserve the right to suggest alternatives if you choose a kit that I feel will be a nightmare or LIVING HELL for me to build. The HG offer excludes excessively large kits such as Dendrobium or Neo Zeong due to the incredibly high cost of shipping such items (several hundred pounds at least). Offer is valid for one redemption per patron per 12-month subscription period and can be repeated after every 12 pledge payments.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will contact you when your 3x or 12x payment period is up. Please be aware there may be significant delay between your pledge period and the kit being completed - if I have a number of patrons at this level I will have to build their kits one by one in order, and I most likely will also be in the middle of a build, but I will keep you updated.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease be aware that cancelling or reducing your pledge below this tier before the 3x or 12x pledge triggers will reset your counter back to zero.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e",

I \u0027ll still need to go get a job to survive though, taking up a lot of my free time, so although I will do all I can to work on Patreon-exclusive builds for you time will be limited and I need to make sure I am still filming non-exclusive stuff too, so they may only be occasional. Let\u0027s keep going to the next goal to make sure I am posting more than a couple of videos a month anywhere!",

I will still need a job, but at least I only need to get a part-time one! I will have much more time and will be able to provide content much more frequently both for Patreon and non-Patreon followers! Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e",

I\u0027ll also be able to film more builds exclusively for Patreon supporters AND keep non-supporters happily in video content too. I\u0027ll be able to go to events, conventions and anything else that I think you may enjoy for filming or for writeup. I will also be able to run giveaways for built models and kits or anything else that tickles my fancy. Seriously, if we get here, I won\u0027t be able to thank you enough, but I will try my hardest.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e",
