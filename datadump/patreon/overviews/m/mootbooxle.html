    "summary": "Hi! Thank you for reading this. My name is Moot and I am passionate about things like analog synths and electric pianos, recording, Funk, Soul, and Jazz music, the talkbox, and game music. I am known for my old-school approach to nearly everything, and I like to spread these good old-school vibes through informative and FUN YouTube videos and albums I release on all the major digital outlets. \u003cbr\u003eI play many different instruments and perform and compose songs and music in a ton of different genres, but it all has my own unique, funky, soulful flair. \u003cbr\u003eSupporting me on Patreon will allow me to spend more of my time creating great sounds and videos that help and inspire people, from the geekiest music gear nerd to the most casual fan of good music. I\u0027m not your usual self-aggrandizing attention fiend. My main goal is to spread positive energy through music, to help fellow musicians get better at their craft, and for everyone to have a lot of fun along the way. I make my living solely from music, which can be pretty unpredictable money-wise. It\u0027s often \"feast or famine\". Consider supporting me on Patreon to keep the good music flowing freely through all life\u0027s ups and downs. \u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "\u003cstrong\u003eTHE SYNTH OF DREAMS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I was 11 years old (that\u0027s 22 years ago at the time of writing this), I have wanted a \u003cstrong\u003eMoog Minimoog Model D\u003c/strong\u003e synthesizer more than anything in the world. For many reasons too difficult to discuss here, this has never happened for me. The Minimoog has always eluded me, even when I came so close to being able to buy one several times. Over the years, I have watched them climb and climb in value to ridiculous heights...Vintage Minimoogs in good condition go for $6000-7000 and up very often. \u003cbr\u003eNow, in 2016, \u003cstrong\u003eMoog Music\u003c/strong\u003e has started making the Model D Minimoog once again, but with improved features and a (somewhat) more reasonable price.\u003cstrong\u003e I am working with everything in my power to finally reach my dream of owning one of these instruments.\u003c/strong\u003e I know my way around a Minimoog inside and out, with my eyes closed...That is a result of obsessing over this iconic instrument for two thirds of my life! \u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "\u003cstrong\u003eRELEASE AN ALBUM ON VINYL\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt has been a dream of mine since I began recording and releasing my own albums to release a vinyl LP. Vinyl is regaining popularity, which is wonderful, but it is still extremely expensive to produce, especially for an independent artist. \u003cbr\u003eSpecialized mastering is involved in preparing the music for a vinyl record to ensure that it plays back properly and the needle doesn\u0027t jump out of the groove. I happen to know an incredible mastering engineer, but he does not work for cheap! The work he has done on projects I\u0027ve produced has always been stellar. This goal is to cover the cost of mastering one of my fully analog-recorded albums and the pressing of a significant number of copies. \u003cstrong\u003eOnce this looks like it\u0027s going to come to fruition, Patrons who pledge $20 a month or more will be getting a signed copy as well as a digital download of the LP!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e",
