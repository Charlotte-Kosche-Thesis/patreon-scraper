    "summary": "Hey Guys! My name is Michael, and I create video lessons on music theory. Like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEKFuSQndhs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere It Started\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout 5 years ago I got it in my head that you could probably teach people about music without burying them in jargon or forcing them to read music notation. In fact I thought if you cut those things out you could get down to some of the real fundamentals in music and start developing a much deeper understanding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere It\u0027s At Now\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe amount of love and appreciation I\u0027ve gotten for these lessons has been utterly staggering. There are more and more people by the day that are watching, sharing, commenting, and contributing to this endeavor, and what started as a fun little experiment has turned into the most exciting project I\u0027ve ever worked on in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Want\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to do more. Lots more. Music is a vast and incredible subject and I\u0027ve barely scratched the surface. I have dozens upon dozens of video ideas on the waiting list, and there\u0027s a relentless stream of new ideas and suggestions coming in every day. But as long as this stays a nights-and-weekends hobby I\u0027m painfully limited on how much new material I can get out there. These videos take lots of time and even more mental effort, but if I can cut back (get rid of??) my day job I can start dedicating some serious effort to this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Bad Solution\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI regularly get offers for sponsorships and advertising deals. But pitching a product during one of my videos or \"reviewing\" a product because someone paid me just isn\u0027t a direction I want to take. And of course I could always make a set of DVDs and try to sell them to you, but what is this, 1995? I don\u0027t even own a DVD player.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Good Solution\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon makes sense to me. People who want to and can afford it can help fund the new videos, everything is still freely available (not locked away under a paywall or on some silly DVD set), and I\u0027m not stuck getting paid for pretending to like a product. I can make videos, you give me feedback and help decide what I do next, and there\u0027s no third party to mess with our business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want, and you can afford it, you can help me out with a monthly pledge. If you can\u0027t afford it or just aren\u0027t up for that, no problem! Hit the like button a couple times, learn a bit about music theory, tell me what you think and we\u0027ll call it even :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e...3D Printed Music Dice? What even is that?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you looked at the rewards you might be wondering that the heck \"3D printed musical dice\" are. So it turns out that when you\u0027re practicing something, like a chord progression, a scale or even just learning new chords, it\u0027s important to practice them in random keys. So I designed a 12 sided dice that has a different musical key on each face, as well as a 4 sided dice with basic chords qualities (major, minor, diminished, augmented), and a 6 sided dice with the different 7th chord qualities. I\u0027ll print you one (or all 3, depending on reward level) and mail it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks guys.\u003cbr\u003e-Mike\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
