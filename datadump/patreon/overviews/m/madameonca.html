I create in a broad variety of genres from print-making to torch-singing, tarot reading to event production.\u00a0Patron connects the art I make with you, the folks who excited by this work and my journey. \u00a0As you may know, I am also caring for a chronically ill, homebound child while paying the bills with my art. Join my Patreon for first access to all kinds of inventive content - previews of both work in process and the finished products - which allows me to both create art AND care for my family. THANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI print-make and paint, then create products from my art such as tarot decks, cards, wall art, wearable art and more. I write books and articles. I sing and write original songs, and I have embarked on teaching myself piano and uke. A cabaret MC, I also teach and perform fusion bellydance around the US and beyond. I annually produce 2 festivals, 2 theatrical stage shows, and a monthly community showcase. An internationally recognized tarot artist and author, I teach and read tarot at private, community and corporate events. I strive to be productive in spite of my child\u0027s illness, and your patronage makes all the difference. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to learn more about POTS, aka Postural Orthostatic Tachycardial Syndrome, the \u00a0illness that keeps my child homebound, please visit\u00a0www.dysautonomiainternational.org. OCTOBER is Dysautonomia Awareness Month. I never knew about it until it struck our family, and now I hope that spreading awareness will help other kids get help with an early diagnosis."
