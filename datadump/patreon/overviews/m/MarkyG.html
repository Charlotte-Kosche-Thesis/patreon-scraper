    "summary": "My name is Mark Gonzales. Since 2013 I have been a freelance photographer specializing in portraiture and street photos. During the last leg of 2017 I decided to move my skills into the world of filming. Filming has always been fascinating to me. The ability to capture stories, feelings, art and other creative ideas is something I want to share with the world. It was a art that I never stepped into. But my years in photography has helped me reach this point into taking another step closer to my dream as a filmmaker.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my work begins to sharpen, I found that many of my current supporters has always asked me to shoot with certain models / actors / actresses but I was limited by my ability to produce funds with my photography and filming. I have personally invested countless hours and my own money to just produce the work I want. I was in a position of doing something I love but hitting a financial wall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal with this Patreon is to support my craft. Your support will help me pay equipment, models / actors / actress, studio time and much more. My supporters are what drives me to my goal as a filmmaker. I thank everyone and with your help, I can fuel my creative drive as a filmmaker and photographer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to check out my website, visit http://www.MarkyG.me\u003cbr\u003e"
