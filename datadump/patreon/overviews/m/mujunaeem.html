src=\"https://mujunaeem.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/distributed-finance-model.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me explain a little bit about what we need a distributed finance model and why it is required for this to work successfully. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must first understand that advocating for social change towards a science-based and secular government in Maldives and other Islamic countries isn\u0027t going to be appreciated or welcomed by the those with vested interests in maintaining current status quo in these countries. We can rest assured, that the quickest way to shut down someone would be to cut off their funding, suffocating it them from vital resources. It would be a disaster for such an important work to fall prey to a single decisive attack that can put an end to it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a single private financier or funding it myself would mean that the source of financing the work is left vulnerable. To overcome this fundamental flaw, I am building a network of a series of financiers with small donations as a safety net. At the same time using Internet-based financial institutions to handle the money. This last point is important, as influential people tend to manipulate the workings of financial institutions to achieve their goals. Taking the money out of these local institutions is vital for survival. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other benefits of a distributed finance model are, when financiers have a change of heart and decide to pull out, the project would still have enough backers to offset any adverse outcome from an event like that. It just ensures safety and is a smart way to structure something like this. I hope that makes sense. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://mujunaeem.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/boddy-banner-how-can-help.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI literally cannot do this work without you. We know that due to the current political environment, the best way to share better ideas is not be depended on anybody else but the fans and supporters of this work. You guys are helping me grow and spread the message. Now I am offering you to actually help produce the work which is helping to shape minds, inform and educate people so that they can make better choices and find answers to social problems without picking fights with competing interests. I am honored at the response you have given me in such a very short amount of time. And we have only just started. There is much more we can do together moving forward. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to become a Patron of my work, it means making a commitment for a monthly subscription on the Patreon platform.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSo if you agree with what I\u0027m saying and if you care about not only continuing this work we\u0027ve been doing but making this bigger, with no outside restrictions whatsoever, then sign up on Patreon right now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mujunaeem.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/anonymity-in-patronage.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest concern from potential patrons so far is whether they could contribute to without having their identities being made public. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the way Patreon platform works, the account settings of individual users and my page can hide the identities of those who commit their financial backing to the various projects on the platform. This ability to mask backers identities was a primary factor in deciding to run the distributed financing model here. It gives the patrons confidence to know that vested interests would not hinder the interests of the supporters in an attempt to stop this work. This elimination of worry from potential patrons and makes it easier to make such a commitment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving said that, as anything that involves money, Patreon platform does verify the identities of the persons who use their platform and does share that with the creators (myself). This data remains between ourselves and not as public information.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://mujunaeem.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/body-banner-where-money-go.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am a refugee in Canada\u0027s Urgent Protection Program. I would like to do activism fulltime rather than as a something to do during my spare time. Having patrons would allow that to happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor my work to be fruitful and ongoing, I need immediate funding for the following purposes;\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInternet connection:\u003c/strong\u003e The work requires an internet connection to execute efficiently. A mobile 4G connection and a Mobile broadband connection is vital. Your contributions will allow for that to be possible.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eCloud collaboration tools:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to build a team of a distributed team collaborating on various aspect of my work and help on the same project at the same time, while being in their respective locations, this project needs to invest in cloud-based infrastructure that can manage a remote team. To that end, I would need to invest in appropriate cloud-based solutions with remote team management tools. Your contributions will enable that. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResearch funding:\u003c/strong\u003e the entire workload requires a massive amount of time and expenses to be committed to the research for the work to be effective. This work is never-ending and ongoing throughout the project.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInternet Security:\u003c/strong\u003e to manage the safety of the work, myself and others involved with the project, it is imperative that security expert consultation is available. This security component can only be outsourced to a competent service provider depending on the availability of funds.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003eI understand that some of you can contribute a lot towards the work, while others just a little and some of you somewhere in between. Every dollar counts for the project to not just grow, but keep going online. We are just only now beginning to help address the real issues, and we have a long way to go. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy committing to financing as little as $2 per month (I welcome larger amounts, and you can select any amount of your choice to contribute) it would ensure the unrestricted continuation of this effort. If you feel there is value in my work and there is some social good that can come from my it, let\u0027s work towards enabling that change. I hope that you would agree that this is a reasonable partnership. I thank you for your support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is just the beginning, and I can\u0027t wait for what comes next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mujunaeem.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/onetime-donations.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recognize not all who wants to make a donation to me can commit on an ongoing subscription basis.
