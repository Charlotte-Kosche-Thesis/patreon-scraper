    "summary": "Welcome! My name is Monica and I believe in the power of stories to transform hearts and minds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years, the story of Stone Soup has intrigued me; it tells about a community that is fed \u0026amp; nourished by one person\u0027s story-- a story which leads to the people in the community contributing the small bits of food that they have and in the end, a soup is made that all can (and do) eat.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe community in the story is a community after tragedy during a time of scarce resources.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that today we are much like that community in the story: we\u0027ve hidden our onions, our potatoes, our carrots, so that we have food for our families. We\u0027ve kept close our gifts, our skills, our talents. And few of us are listening to the other people around us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create more fiction, more essays, more poems, that add to the conversations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to dream, together, about what we are envisioning for the future, rather than just tearing down the past or eviscerating the things that have come before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe we need bridges, thresholds, and more in-between spaces where we can meet those unlike us. Liminal spaces where we can engage and listen and learn and act.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is one container, one in-between space where those conversations can happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd really, I want to use Patreon as a less busy space to create community and conversation-- a community that is absent trolls and built on mutual respect \u0026amp; mutual willingness to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love how Patreon removes the publisher from the equation, as far as connecting readers and authors; my plan for the future would be to both traditionally publish \u0026amp; to continue to self publish.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve gotten this far, thank you from the depths of my heart, for checking out my page, my work, my vision. I\u0027d love to have you on board, if it speaks to you. And if it does not, that is all right, as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo join the community and get access to all I write, select \"Become a Patron\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Some admin bits: if you don\u0027t love any of the reward levels, or they don\u0027t match your budget needs, feel free to get creative and make up your own! (You can do this when you are signing up and I\u0027ll still include the rewards for the nearest level)."
