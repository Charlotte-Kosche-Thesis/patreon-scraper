    "summary": "To all you GM\u2019s, DM\u2019s,\nStorytellers, and other fantasy RPG enthusiasts\u2014thank you for visiting my page\nand thanks for running your games for others! My project: Malrex\u2019s Modules, is\nto provide a tool/resource for GM\u2019s for their games.  Players have a tendency to do something or go\nsomewhere unexpected---my hope is that these modules are a tool that can be\nused at a moment\u2019s notice for the GM and shaped to help their own campaigns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eQuick Summary:\u003c/strong\u003e  By supporting\nMalrex\u2019s Modules, you will receive a short (6 page) to long adventure (20-30)\nwith most being around 12 pages. The adventure will follow the For Gold \u0026amp;\nGlory ruleset, which is retro-clone of 2\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;nd\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; edition of the \u2018world\u2019s\nmost popular fantasy role-playing game.\u2019 \u003cstrong\u003eAlthough\n2nd edition rules, I try to keep the vibe of 1st edition\ndungeons\u003c/strong\u003e, as I\u2019m more of a fan of sandbox style rather than a dominating\nstoryline. I may dabble with OSRIC and Labyrinth Lord rulesets as well.\u00a0 I want to provide the cliff\nnotes\u2014let the GM and players create the story! I plan to complete 1-2 per\nmonth, but more than likely, it will only be one, but plan your pledges accordingly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEach adventure may include new spells,\nmonsters, magic items, and maybe even templates (kits) for classes.  My goal is to present an adventure or\nencounter that is evocative, provide unexpected surprises for players, and easy\nto use for a GM at the table DURING play. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nNote:\u003c/strong\u003e Patreons will receive a\ndiscount for any adventure that is used for Merciless Merchants products on\nDrivethruRPG by email:  \u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/11180/The-Merciless-Merchants\"\u003ehttp://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/11180/The-...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIf you are still debating, check out some free downloads below.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCompleted Adventures:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1.
