    "summary": "Hey! Thanks for being such an avid listener of MNCast that you decided to visit this page, we\u0027re so glad you\u0027re here! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you\u0027ve probably heard us say on the show, the creation and delivery of MNCast every two weeks takes significant time, hard work and money on our end to make it possible. We\u0027re happy to put the work in for all of you at home, but we can\u0027t achieve our goals to expand the show beyond what it is, on our own. -- That\u0027s where you come in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a website you can use to move your involvement up a notch by signing up as a MNCast patron and giving whatever you can, whenever we release a new episode (every two weeks). Of course, we aren\u0027t asking for much and don\u0027t want to break anyone\u0027s budget apart - patrons who sign up at a minimum of only $1 per episode automatically get exclusive access to our private online community, and to our \"Lens\" feed through your Patreon app. And it\u0027s all upward from there. There are even more reward tiers at the $2, $5, and $10 per episode levels to make sure you\u0027re getting the most out of your membership.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope this has informed you a little bit more about what it means to us, and how easy it is to become a MNCast patron. The bottom line is, we want to make this show the best it can possibly be as we\u0027re sure you do as well, but because we are an audience supported show, our resources are limited only to what you at home can help us with. If you can find the means to include us in your giving, whatever that may be, you\u0027re helping MNCast grow exponentially to discover and deliver more of what you missed in Minnesota music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Until June 2018, everyone who signs up to pledge at least $2/episode = $4/month will be entered into our t-shirt drawing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e-Dan Smith \u0026amp; Jimmy Byrne // Hosts of MNCast\u003cbr\u003e"
