    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWhy make a Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etl;dr: Being a patron lets me push out updates in a timely manner and work on other types of viewers, like wheels and flight sticks\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve worked on this tool for around three years or so, and I\u0027m glad for all the people who have found a use for it. When I first created this, it was simply a winter break project where I simply took my week and worked on something I though should have existed already, but didn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward 3 years later, and now it\u0027s \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ea lot\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0more advanced than what the initial idea was. The idea was to originally just show an Xbox Controller on screen and simply window capture the controller. Since then, you can choose from around 8 different skins, use the tool natively with OBS via CLR Browser, remap buttons, create your own/edit skins, and easily generate a shareable URL. It\u0027s easy to say that this tool has progressed far more than what was initially imagined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWell, that was a nice exposition and all, but \u003cem\u003ewhy create a Patreon\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/h3\u003eGetting to the point, this project feels like it has a life of it\u0027s own sometimes. There are plenty of people who use it, with many people asking for new interesting features or asking for help on how to set up the tool or having issues and hoping to have them fixed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with trying to keep this tool updated, supported, and most importantly \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u00a0for everyone\u003c/i\u003e, I decided it would be in the best interest of everyone to start a Patreon for this tool. Soon (as of \u00a0the time of this writing), I\u0027ll be starting my Junior year at my University where I\u0027ll be studying Computer Sciences. I\u0027ll have to be jugging my time around a lot, but when it comes to my priorities, \u003cstrong\u003eschool will always comes first before any personal projects\u003c/strong\u003e. With creating this Patreon, it helps me with trying to focus my time better on this tool while studying, as I\u0027ll be incentivized to try and work on the tool as best as possible while still keeping my focus on school.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not looking to try and force people to pay for a service they\u0027ve had free from the start, as that\u0027s simply a cheap way of capitalizing off of users, as well as being poor way of making a quick buck. \u003cstrong\u003eInstead, I\u0027m asking those who would wish to lend me a helping hand with trying to make this tool the best that it can be, as well as to venture into similar approaches with other kinds of inputs.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, yeah, that\u0027s the gist of it. I\u0027d like to try and make similar tools for flight sticks and wheels, as well as creating more skins and features for users, and it will be those patrons who choose to support this effort that will be the reason why this can all be made a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWait, does this mean you won\u0027t be working on the tool until somebody coughs up cash?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eNO. \u003c/i\u003eI\u0027d like to make it clear that I DO intend to work on this too for as much as I can during my free time, but while school is going on, or other life matters appear, this tool is on the back of my mind. I\u0027ll always be adding things\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://trello.com/b/aSUJ68Km/gamepad-viewer-roadmap\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eto the trello\u003c/a\u003e, or answering emails for people who use the contact form, but this Patreon \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eDOES NOT\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0mean I\u0027m simply going to stop working on the tool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, what this Patreon \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eDOES\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0mean is that it\u0027d be in my interest to try and work on the tool in a considerable amount of time, as well as update at least around once a month so patrons can get their money\u0027s worth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSo, what does \u003cem\u003eper major update\u003c/em\u003e mean?\u003c/h3\u003eI don\u0027t really work on this on a monthly basis so the sane choice seemed like charging on a per-item basis.
