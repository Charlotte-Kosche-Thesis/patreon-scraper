Because I believe that everyone has something to say and share with the world! I have been making videos for over 4 years now and I want to be able to keep doing that far into the future! So please consider joining \u003cstrong\u003eTeamMako\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eWhy am I asking for your support?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCreating videos on YouTube is my full-time job. Seven days a week and often 15 hours a day. That\u0027s pretty much all the time I\u0027m awake! Making a variety of quality how-to and other original videos that inspire you to make amazing things on your own, that inspire you to be creative and to express yourself in your own unique way, is something that makes me truly happy. Reading your comments about how my videos have helped you, just makes my day and it makes me realise every time, that this is what I want to do for a living and for as long as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tEven though I looove creating videos that help you in any way and spend hours making them, making videos takes a lot of work, time and money. And even though some people assume that YouTubers make tons of money, the reality for most of us creators is the complete opposite!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThat\u0027s why your support would not only allow me to keep creating videos that make you feel inspired and motivated, but it will also help us become closer friends that are there for each other! Since you will always be part of the whole process, will be able to reach out to me and everyone else involved and be part of my team!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tYour support will\u00a0help me stay focused on what is most important: being creative, to inspire and to get inspired by you guys! It will also allow me to improve my current videos, make more painting videos (this is one of the most requested topics!) and also supporting myself as an artist! It will help me funding the space, tools, supplies and equipment I need to film.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eHow can I help?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is an amazing platform that allows people to support content creators they love and help them continue doing what they do! Through this website fans are directly helping their favourite creator to create new content without any sponsorships of companies they might not be 100% fan of just to get by! The way Patreon works is that everyone can donate whatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ePlease note\u003c/strong\u003e that on this page you can support through a monthly basis, donate as much as you want and for how long as you want since you can cancel or change your pledge at any time!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eBut what do I get out of it?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAside from helping me create even more and better videos, supporters will get access to an exclusive Patreon-only feed with access to sneak-peeks of projects I\u0027m working on, exclusive news and announcements, exclusive videos where I show you behind the scenes footage, share my thoughts, how I film and edit my videos!
