I\u0027ve got a lot of sweet projects going on in a culture that sucks at taking care of creatives and women. The goal of this Patreon is to remove some of the pressure on my finances to allow me more room to create, grow, and succeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I have a pretty full plate. Aside from my full-time \"normie\" job, I run Megan K Photography, and give regular lectures via my Religious Education Series sponsored by The Satanic Temple.

You can find more details about each of these projects below!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing high-quality, well-researched work on all these fronts is tiring and expensive. I want to use this Patreon to advance my work (both quality and quantity), access better gear as needed, reward my supporters, and give myself the room to pursue ambitious creative projects that have taken a back-burner to good ol\u0027 capitalistic needs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy contributing to my Patreon, you\u0027ll receive access to exclusive creative work, advanced copies of future projects, copies of all my currently-published work, access to my hard-earned creative experience through The Craft, and more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMassive, eternal thanks to all contributors!

This program is created and run by me and sponsored by The Satanic Temple National Council as part of an initiative to combat ignorance and bad faith history, and democratize access to education that would be otherwise relegated to prohibitive, expensive college settings. Talks given thus far include a deconstruction of horror movies as a vehicle for the Christian worldview, and a contextual understanding of the Mountain Meadows Massacre. Future talks will include deconstructing religion\u0027s role in extremism, ancient astronomy, possession as a cultural phenomenon, women\u0027s roles in religion, and re-thinking our cultural definition of religion, among other topics. Lectures are given in Salt Lake City, UT, with option to travel if expenses are covered.
