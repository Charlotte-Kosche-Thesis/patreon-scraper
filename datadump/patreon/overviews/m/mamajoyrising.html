Through your contributions I can continue to do all these things well! I will keep making video recordings of my songs and cover songs and the quality will improve because of your help. Since I am a huge advocate for inspiring and empowering young women in my local community I will be spending more time with them and I look forward to sharing what we create together. I will also be performing in more intimate listening room venues, expanding the house concert circuit, and I would love to play near you! Possibly the most important: I want to play more for women in shelters and for our future generation of young women.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u2019m happy to have this\nopportunity to share my creations with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I am a writer and\nperformer of songs and spoken word poetry. I blog and tell stories. I am a performance artist. I spend time volunteering for Girls Rock, a non-profit for young future female rock stars. I live in the mountains, primitively, close to nature and her inspirations. I have always known that I came into this world with a message to share through music and theater, so\u00a0I write about social issues;\npeoples\u2019 struggles and commonalities. I am also a recovering Jehovah\u0027s Witness and find healing through speaking out (or singing out, or acting out) about peoples\u0027 common religious struggles. We are all humans and suffer and enjoy\nthe same basic things. It is easy to forget but it is also easy to remember and\nI am here to facilitate that remembrance. \u003cbr\u003eBy showing your support for what I do you are helping me to share an important message that helps heal old wounds and brings back vitality for life. my life, my daughter\u0027s, and those who take the time to listen; like you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
