This will be the first time Danny and Debo will meet each other as well as many of their listeners as they attend wrestling events, comedy shows, and host a bbq! Our first goal is to raise enough money for Debo\u0027s plane ticket, anything over that will 100% go to show related experiences. Everything will be documented and shared with the listeners!"
