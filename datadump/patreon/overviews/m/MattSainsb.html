    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eBeing a little bit different (my background!)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started DigitallyDownloaded.net seven years ago, I wasn\u0027t quite sure what I wanted to do with it. Having worked at some of the largest gaming publications and websites out there, I knew I wanted to do something different, but I wasn\u0027t quite sure what it was.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then I realised that there were people out there that liked games that sat outside of the mainstream and blockbuster system, or the \"Hollywood of games\", if you will. People who liked indie games developed by one or two people with a simple passion and a story to tell. They liked playing games developed in Japan at a time when we were all being told that the Japanese games industry was dying because even the mighty Final Fantasy couldn\u0027t outsell Call of Duty. And that\u0027s when I found what I wanted to focus my on writing on, because I happened to like those things too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI then dedicated myself to giving that audience the best, in-depth coverage of alternative games and entertainment. I decided to focus primarially on the Asian entertainment markets, but anything genuinely interesting from outside that area worked for me too. I also wanted to provide people with a different approach to games criticism, and to write reviews that got people thinking about games in a different way. I wanted to look at the themes and artistry in games that other critics did not focus on, and I wanted to champion the kinds of games that many others would dismiss.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I would like to keep doing that, because I think it is something that fills a gap for plenty of people that share my interest in games. Which is why I\u0027m turning to Patreon; I would love to keep doing this work, but more importantly, I also want to do more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe basic realities are that to do what I am already doing, I need a lot of time every day. I need to play a bunch of games, write in-depth reviews of them, and then manage the DigitallyDownloaded.net website. After a couple of years hard at it, it\u0027s become quite tiring to do, given I also need to work full time to pay bills - after all, I\u0027m not going to be able to do much work if I\u0027m living in a box on the street.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is more frustrating than anything, however, is that I want to do more. I have some great ideas for some really in-depth feature artices, and even have plans for a series of e-books that investigate the truly special games on an really deep level. I simply haven\u0027t got time to do that at the moment, with all the other balls I need to juggle. I\u0027d love to start doing things with podcasting, and video, too - I\u0027ve got some cool concepts for documentaries on game developers and game development, just waiting to be made. And I\u0027d love to attend more game shows and travel to events so I can cover them on a more genuine level (and hunt out the news from the indies and niche publishers that get missed in all the excitement around what Sony, Microsoft, EA and Activision are doing). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start to to do all of that, I really do need to start earning a revenue from my games writing, so that I can then focus more of my time on it, and make the investment in video equipment, plane flights and so on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything at all. Or nothing, if you don\u0027t think my work is worthwhile enough. I don\u0027t want readers to feel like I\u0027m trying to pressure or extort money out of them, so I\u0027m not going to do tiers and rewards and such. I won\u0027t be locking any of my work behind minimum pledges, either, because the whole point of DigitallyDownloaded.net is to give everyone access to games writing that\u0027s a little different.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can contribute a dollar each month, I will be absolutely moved that you think my work has value to you. If you can afford a tenner, then l\u0027ll tip my cup of coffee to you for your generosity (a cup of coffee that you made happen!). If you\u0027re feeling even more generous than that, and you really want a photo of me bowing before a shrine to you or some such, I can probably do that too. Humour aside, the point is that I\u0027m simply inviting people to contribute if they believe in my work and that it has value to them. Whatever it\u0027s worth to them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also not going to set down specific milestones and goals, because there\u0027s only really one goal, and that\u0027s to make my games writing my sole source of income. Whatever I can plug back into my work I will. If a lot of people like my work I\u0027ll be able to do a lot. If not, it would be great if I can at least continue to write about games. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI of course will be completely transparent as we go along, so if at any stage you have any questions, please don\u0027t hesitate to ask me. I\u0027ll turn it into a FAQ and post it on this page, since I have absolutely no idea what questions people might have for me here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for your interest and support, and keeping completely independent games writing alive!"
