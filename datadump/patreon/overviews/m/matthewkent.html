    "summary": "Thanks for checking out my Patreon page! My name is Matthew Kent and I am (in order), a Christian, a husband, a father, a churchman, and a blogger/vlogger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://theologyontheground.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTheology on the Ground\u003c/a\u003e in April 2016 because I knew I needed to begin contributing to the public discourse. While there are plenty of good, faithful Christians proclaiming Biblical truth online, there still aren\u0027t nearly enough. The Biblical worldview accounts for a tiny portion of what is available online and every day we all get bombarded with messages that are hostile to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to seeing a need, I also felt a great burden to share what the Lord has been teaching me. Ever since I started following Jesus I\u0027ve been absolutely devouring Christian truth. I\u0027ve read through the Bible 11 times in the past decade as well as a pile of other Christian books and listened to countless sermons and podcasts. All of this has resulted in a lot of knowledge in my head that wasn\u0027t doing anyone any good. \u00a0At the beginning of 2016 I realized that I desperately needed an outlet for sharing the things that I think about and I started creating my blog.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also launched a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0UPD0wE7fgH-FjA8It5zoA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027ve begun writing my first book. I\u0027m hoping to expand what I am doing by launching a podcast as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve made it my goal to try to earn enough money to support my family by proclaiming Christian truth --I want to make this my full-time job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in -- you can help make that happen. While I will be pursuing other means of earning money from my blog as well, chances are the bulk of my income is going to need to come from the support of people like you. Any amount helps, so if you think you would like to give but don\u0027t think your gift will make a difference, let me assure you that it will and that I will be extremely grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI joined Patreon as a step of faith trusting that God could start to provide me with the means necessary to start \u00a0producing Christian content full-time. As I take this step I\u0027m encouraged in knowing that the generous gifts of faithful followers of Jesus are the means that God has used to fund countless ministries, both in our own time as well as all the way back to the early church and even the ministry of Jesus himself (see Luke 8:3).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill you join my support team?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlessings\u003cbr\u003e"
