The only ads you will see on our site after this would be if someone decided to pledge $100 to sponsor a month. And trust me, we will make that look a lot more tasteful than \u201c72 Year Old Mom Reveals Secret to Erase Wrinkles!\u201d",

If we don\u2019t have that much, then we can\u2019t afford the plane tickets!  If we don\u2019t manage to meet the $2000, its not all for a loss! We will simply save that money for Gamescom 2017!",
