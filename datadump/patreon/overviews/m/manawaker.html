    "summary": "I\u0027m CB Droege. I\u0027m an author and voice actor. I run Manawaker Studio, which is an independent small press. Some of what I post and publish is my own work, but many projects feature collaborations with other word and picture artists (most notably:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.manawaker.com/series/fffpodcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFlash Fiction Podcast\u003c/a\u003e (also on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/manawaker-studios-flash-fiction/id980747861\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e), which is hosted by me, and features the best flash fiction I can drag out of contributors around the world, and is free to the listening public). In-the-works projects include graphic novels and more anthologies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon funding goes toward the cost of running Manawaker Studio (things like website hosting, copyediting, commissioning visual artists, paying anthology and podcast contributors, travel, media equipment, electricity, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith patron support, I can take on more projects, and spend more time creating clever stories and games and other media, and less time trying to figure out how to make money at it. Patrons have already been responsible for the creation of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://recycledcomics.manawaker.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eManawaker Studio Recycled Comics\u003c/a\u003e, a weekly feature in which I create new stories out of old comic books. Like the podcast, these comics are available to everyone, thanks to my Patreon Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons can receive a number of benefits beyond mere happy feelings, and the knowledge that it makes my free projects possible. At the right levels, Patronage works like a subscription to Manawaker Studio books. We don\u0027t publish on precise schedules, but a patron who supports at a subscription level will get every book we put out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, every patron has access to the private patron feed, which\nincludes, among other things, original short fiction and poetry work, some of which will eventually make it into magazines and\njournals elsewhere, but much of which is written just for my patrons. You\u0027ll\nalso find news and previews of upcoming projects and occasional personal\nmusings. In addition, when I need beta-testers for games or beta-readers for stories, my patrons are the first folks I\u0027ll turn to in search of volunteers (no obligation on their part, though).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, all patrons get access to comics and podcasts a couple days early whenever humanly possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would super love it you decide that joining my small community of patrons has value to you, but if not, I sincerely hope you enjoy the projects that they make possible. Please follow my Patreon page to get notifications when new things are ready for public consumption!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eCB\u003cbr\u003e"
