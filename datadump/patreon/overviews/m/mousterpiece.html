We\u2019ve been hosting Mousterpiece Cinema for over 300 episodes and six years (it\u0027s now part of podcasting 1st grade!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you aren\u2019t already \u003cem\u003eintimately \u003c/em\u003efamiliar with the podcast, it\u2019s pretty much what the title suggests: each week, we offer an in-depth review of a Disney movie. That might seem fairly limiting if all you think of when you think of Disney movies is animated films like \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mousterpiececinema.blogspot.com/2011/11/episode-21-beauty-and-beast.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBeauty and the Beast\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://traffic.libsyn.com/mousterpiececinema/Mousterpiece_Cinema_Episode_27.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. But \u201cDisney\u201d means a lot more, and has for a long time: it means \u003ca href=\"http://moviemezzanine.com/inside-out-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePixar films\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://moviemezzanine.com/captain-america-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMarvel movies\u003c/a\u003e, the new \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://moviemezzanine.com/star-wars-force-awakens-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eStar Wars\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e films, live-action fare like \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://moviemezzanine.com/jungle-book-2016-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Jungle Book\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://moviemezzanine.com/alice-through-the-looking-glass-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlice Through the Looking Glass\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. And, of course, it also means films from the past 75-plus years of production, including those from Disney\u0027s other distribution arms like Touchstone (\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://moviemezzanine.com/rushmore-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRushmore\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, for example), Hollywood Pictures (\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://traffic.libsyn.com/mousterpiececinema/Mousterpiece_Cinema_Episode_112.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Sixth Sense\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e), and even Miramax from the days when Disney owned the then-Weinstein-led studio (\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://moviemezzanine.com/pulp-fiction-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePulp Fiction\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil earlier in 2017, we were fortunate enough to be hosted by Movie Mezzanine for nearly 3 years, and Sound on Sight (now known as Pop Optiq) for two-plus years before that. We\u2019ve also been fortunate enough to have guests of all kinds, from \u003ca href=\"http://moviemezzanine.com/the-hunchback-of-notre-dame-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eVulture\u2019s Mark Harris\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"http://moviemezzanine.com/alexander-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEntertainment Weekly\u2019s Anthony Breznican\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"http://moviemezzanine.com/mousterpiece-cinema-maleficent-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Verge\u2019s Tasha Robinson\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"http://traffic.libsyn.com/mousterpiececinema/Mousterpiece_Cinema_Episode_115.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSlate\u2019s Dana Stevens\u003c/a\u003e, and many, many, many more. But now that we\u2019re entering our seventh year, we\u2019ve decided to double down on making the best possible version of our podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the best possible version of the podcast will involve--that\u2019s right--your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Start a Patreon Page Now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past few months, we\u2019ve had to battle (more than we used to in the past) through some truly thorny Skype- and sound-related issues. Some of this can\u2019t be fixed--Skype is a fickle mistress. But some of it can be improved upon, as long as we can upgrade our recording equipment and software, as well as the podcast editing software. (Audacity has served us well for five years, but as a free software, it has its limits that something like Adobe Audition, which comes with a price tag, doesn\u2019t.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the show having extended through five years, we\u2019d also like to upgrade our home page, from a Blogspot that not a ton of people visit to a shiny new page from Squarespace, which also costs a bit of bread.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u2019s also the fact that this show--which we both love working on every week--takes up our time and a little bit of our money, and we figure it might be time to see if anyone\u2019s willing to throw a little bread our way. (Metaphorically. Put down your rye loaves, your pumpernickel slices, your--you get the point.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat If You Don\u2019t Reach Your Goals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe upside for you--if you\u2019re skeptical of this page or crowd-funding in general--is that nothing bad will happen if we don\u2019t reach our goals. We both love doing this podcast. That hasn\u2019t changed, nor will it. This is not a \u201cGive us all your money or the podcast\u2019s done-zo\u201d situation. We\u2019ll keep doing the show on a weekly basis. The software/recording issues we\u2019ve had to deal with before are issues we\u2019ll need to deal with in the future, should they crop up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if we \u003cem\u003edo \u003c/em\u003ereach our goals--or at least get enough to buy new microphones (which aren\u2019t cheap--combined for us, that alone would be a few hundred dollars)--we\u2019ll be even happier with each new episode we publish for all of you dedicated listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s In It For Me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood question! The general answer is obvious: if we reach all of our goals, we\u2019ll upgrade our editing and recording software and equipment, thus allowing for a more high-quality production for each episode. (Our hope is that we\u2019ll also be able to update previous episodes, in most cases, to have a slightly higher audio quality to align with the new episodes, so they all sound consistently crisp and clear.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u2019s not why you\u2019re asking. You want to know what rewards we can offer you, and we do have a few that may strike your fancy. The first couple are fairly basic: for $1 a month, we\u2019ll give you a personalized shout-out on the podcast (not just saying your name and moving on to the next thing, we promise); for $5 a month, we\u2019ll send you a newsletter each week, with some show notes, comments from both of us, and highlights of past weeks we want to alert you to, as well as teases for future guests and episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $10 a month (just $2.50 per episode in a four-weekend month), you get to tell us what to discuss on a future episode. Yes, really--we will shift things around to accommodate whatever movie you pick (one that we haven\u2019t already discussed, naturally, and we\u0027ll send you a list of everything we\u0027ve reviewed if you pledge here to make sure you don\u0027t request a repeat). If we hate it, we\u2019ll make sure to mention your name often! If we love it, we\u2019ll mention your name often and sound happy about it! Either way, you\u2019ll tell us what to talk about, and we\u2019ll let the Good Ship Listener know that you did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $15 a month, you get to tell us what to discuss on a future \u003cem\u003ebonus \u003c/em\u003eepisode. We\u2019re stretching the rules here a bit--in the past, our bonus episodes have encompassed movies that are tangentially related to Disney without being officially released by the company. (For example, in 2015, over the series of a few bonus shows, we discussed the \u003cem\u003eStar Wars \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://moviemezzanine.com/star-wars-prequels-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eprequels\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://moviemezzanine.com/star-wars-trilogy-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eoriginal trilogy\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://moviemezzanine.com/star-wars-holiday-special-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHoliday Special\u003c/a\u003e. They weren\u2019t Disney movies originally, but seeing as Disney owns Lucasfilm now, it\u2019s kinda-sorta connected.) But if you pledge at this level, we\u2019ll let you pick a movie/TV-movie/movie series of your choosing, and it can be released by Disney. Do you want us to talk about the Air Bud Cinematic Universe? Just the Buddies movies? Some Disney Channel TV-Movie silliness like \u003cem\u003eDescendants \u003c/em\u003eor \u003cem\u003eHigh School Musical\u003c/em\u003e? You\u2019ve got a chance to dictate our schedule here, in more ways than one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $20 a month, you get to tell us what to discuss on a future episode--with a wrinkle. We\u2019re calling this level Mousterpiece Cinema Revisited, because if you pledge this much per month, you can tell us what to discuss on a future episode, but it can only be from the first 100 movies we discussed. (Again, we\u0027ll send you a list of those movies you can choose from, should you pledge at this level.) Do you want us to give another look at \u003cem\u003eThe Fox and the Hound\u003c/em\u003e? Were we too harsh on \u003cem\u003eCinderella\u003c/em\u003e? You can make us revisit a film from our first 100 episodes at this level, to give it a second look.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast, but not least, if you pledge $25 a month, you get to appear on an episode of the podcast, Mr. or Mrs. or Ms. Big Spender. Yes, that\u2019s right, you too can be one of our guests if you\u2019re pledging at this level. Want to discuss the newest Marvel movie? Whatever live-action remake Disney has planned next? One of Disney\u2019s 70s-era live-action films? This dream can become reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve got cooked up so far. As always, we hope you keep listening to the podcast, and hope you give the Patreon a once-over. \u003cbr\u003e"
