It has become the online home for getting practical advice for your church ministry (one guy referred to it as the Independent Baptist Google), engage in dialogue about ministry philosophy, and even a lively debate about theology and doctrine every now and then. It is the epitome of every conference you could go to and it\u0027s available 24/7 at your fingertips. I wanted to make it possible for you to contribute to the ongoing development of this resource. How valuable has this community been to you? Would you feel like $1, $3 or $5 per month is worth the value that this group provides? That\u0027s only $12, $36, or $60 annually. If you do, please consider jumping onboard to help take this community to the next level!"

     "about": "I\u2019m Bryan. I\u2019ve been married to my amazing wife Angel for 14 years. We have been graced with 5 great kids; Andrew, Aaron, Abigail, Anna, and Alexander. This makes me the odd-one-out in the family. I\u2019m the only B. I grew up on the southside of Indianapolis. I was invited to church by a guy in my high school barbershop quartet (yes, you read that right.) I became a believer in Jesus Christ at the age of 15. My life has never been the same. God called me to preach when I was 18 and I began preparing for the ministry through Bible College. Following my second year of college, I started a summer internship at my home church, Northern Park Baptist Church in Greenwood, IN under my pastor, Allen Pierce. At the conclusion of the summer, my pastor asked me to stay on at the church as the youth/music pastor and finish my B.A. in Bible at Indiana Baptist College. Sensing that this was the Lord\u2019s will, I agreed and graduated from IBC in 2005. After 5 years of life and ministry at Northern Park, Angel and I (and our 2 month old first born) became houseparents at Hope Children\u2019s Home in Tampa, FL. We spent 2 years raising 25 abandoned, abused, neglected boys between the ages of 2 and 18 there before returning to Indiana where the Lord had impressed upon our hearts to plant Blue River Baptist Church in Edinburgh, IN. The Lord led us to step away as their pastor after 5 years. That was one of the toughest decisions that we\u2019ve ever made-but, it was the right one for us and the church. I also currently produce a weekly podcast called The Ministry Connection to help build community and facilitate discussion among Independent Baptist ministry leaders. God has called my family and I to go and serve Christ on the mission field of Thailand. We started deputation in January 2016. Let me know if you\u2019d like to schedule us to come and share our burden with your church! No matter what, we\u2019d love to have you pray for us! Let\u2019s connect on Twitter or Facebook!\u003cbr\u003e",
