I have been dabbling in crafting and creating since I was a small child (inspired by my grandmother\u0027s love of crocheting doilies). I live to create and have experimented with many mediums. One day I started making chainmaille on a whim, and found I have a knack for it. Voila, Malice in Chains was created! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been designing and handcrafting traditional, modern, original, and custom chainmaille jewelry and accessories for over 5 years. \u00a0In the past year, I have been fortunate enough to transition from working a traditional job, to focusing all of my time and energy on growing Malice in Chains. \u00a0This endeavor has morphed from simply a hobby, into my full-time job and sole source of income. \u00a0 As the one-woman-wrecking-ball behind Malice in Chains, I operate all facets of my small business including promotion, design, and production. \u00a0I pride myself on my creativity, eye for design, and excellent craftswomanship. \u00a0I am constantly seeking out ways to expand my skill set and bring y\u0027all unique, high quality wearable art pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting Malice in Chains on Patreon, you will receive insight into my creative process and techniques, ability to provide direct input on future lines of jewelry, option to receive new jewelry monthly,\u00a0first access to my latest pieces, and exclusive discount offers. \u00a0In addition, you will be helping to support me as I experiment with new techniques, components, tools, and materials, so that I may continue to grow and hone my craft. \u00a0The money collected through Patreon will go directly into a fund that is earmarked for purchasing new supplies and paying for community classes at The Southwest School of Art. \u00a0SSA offers jewelry making classes in concentrations such as casting, metal working, wire working, metal clay, wood, enameling, and more! \u00a0So far in my jewelry making journey, I am entirely self-taught, but I think the ability to attend studio classes concentrated on jewelry making could really help me take my pieces to the next level, allowing me to continue to pursue my passion!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\"Write it.
