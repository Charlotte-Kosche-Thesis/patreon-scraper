Planes and trains don\u0027t care.\u003cbr\u003eWhile abroad I will be keeping a travel blog, sharing pictures, travel stories, and tips if I have any I think will be useful. This blog is available for free, because I think experience is meant to be shared, but when I heard about Patreon, I figured it was worth a shot. Because even a little bit of guaranteed income, while in a totally foreign landscape, can be a blessing. So!
