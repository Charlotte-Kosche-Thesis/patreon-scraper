    "summary": "In October 2015, Heather wrote a post on her \"mommy blog\", dooce.com and, as she predicted in the post, someone thought it was a bit \"crazy.\" YOU DON\u0027T SAY. Her writing style is intentionally wild and tangential\u2014there\u0027s a reason they refer to it as \u003cem\u003estyle\u003c/em\u003e\u2014and within minutes of it going live someone became very concerned. In fact, they said her post was a \"manic rambling spiral into a not great place\". She tweeted about her prophecy coming true, and a comedian on twitter said he\u0027d love to listen to a podcast called \"Manic Rambling Spiral\". Suddenly she realized that if she were to make a diagram of what it\u0027s like to raise two daughters by herself it would look exactly like a manic rambling spiral. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould people want to listen to an honest podcast about parenting. About single parenting? About \u003cem\u003efull-time\u003c/em\u003e single parenting? About her butt?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHer very good friend John had recently become a full-time single father\u2014you\u0027re gonna want to listen to episode two, and be sure to bring some popcorn. It\u0027s a doozy. He\u0027d worked in radio in college so she knew he could figure out how to use a mic. Why not have this be a conversation showcasing two sides of this living arrangement\u2014a mother\u0027s perspective, and a father\u0027s perspective about raising kids alone. So they talked and planned and gathered equipment and found an amazing audio editor (Hi, Ryan!) and decided to start talking about parenting and life and the struggles that are universal to those raising children. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe call it \"Manic Rambling Spiral\" or \"MRS\".\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese podcasts resonated with a huge, diverse audience around the world and we\u0027re now turning to Patreon to allow our listeners the chance to get involved and support our efforts to keep this show - and the broader conversation - alive for as long as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what can you look forward to?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eA weekly podcast of about 50-60 minutes. We might miss a week from time to time\u2014you know, jobs, kids, life, tinder\u2014but we\u0027re pretty regular.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMore guests for the show! We\u0027ve got some great people lined up and we\u0027ll update Patreon as soon as we can with more concrete information. We\u0027ve also already had a few great guests this year.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eQuality: Seriously, our audio guy is amazing. Some podcasts are just recorded and released, but MRS is meticulous groomed so we sound amazing. Because we care about your ears.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eHonesty. Parenting is hard. Borderline impossible. We walk a fine line when talking about certain things, but generally we don\u0027t hold back. If you\u0027ve ever found yourself thinking, \"My god, I\u0027m a terrible parent.\" This podcast will help you realize you\u0027re not alone. Soon you\u0027ll be thinking, \"My God, at least I didn\u0027t do \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e.\"\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003eTake a look at the support tiers, compare them to the cost of a cup of coffee a few times a week, and come join the spiral. We also plan to add more tiers, more rewards, and more goals (yes, the first goal really does involve erotic fiction) as MRS continues to grow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, watching, and listening! We\u0027re excited to see where MRS takes us, and we\u0027re thrilled to have you along for the ride.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFrequently Asked Questions\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I help support Manic Rambling Spiral?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can support us by becoming a Patron. Just click the big red \u201cBecome a Patron\u201d button in the upper right and Patreon will walk you through everything.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf I become a Patron, what do I have to do?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u2019s sort of up to you. You can quietly support our weekly podcast through your contributions and that would be awesome. If you want to get more involved, you can also share the podcast - and this Patreon campaign - with friends, family, social networks, etc. That would be great, too! It\u2019s entirely up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow many episodes will you release in a month?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTypically, we release one new episode every Thursday. But our support tiers are monthly, so if we end up with 5 in a month rather than 4, your pledge stays the same. Simiarly, if we end up with only 3 in a month (because life), your pledge stay the same. When you sign up, you can choose how you\u2019d like to support. Patreon is pretty flexible. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to donate forever?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNope! You can change or cancel your pledge for any reason at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNo! Amounts are shown in US dollars but, if you\u2019re outside the US, you can use whatever currency you\u2019d like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes Heather really talk about her butt?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eStill have questions?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSend us an email, say hello, and let us know how we can help: stories@manicramblings.com.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
