Plagued by memories of her past, she has survived most of high school being a wallflower.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow in her senior year, her once-buried passions resurface when she discovers that her little sister Audrey is living out their shared childhood fantasy: protecting the world from monsters as a magical girl!  Lana transforms to fight alongside her sister and friends, forming a band of heavenly protectors known as \u0027Angels\u0027. Tasked with defending Earth from the invasion of the Cog Kingdom, the girls will find that being a magical girl isn\u2019t just about living out past passions, but confronting past pains as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCharacters\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLana Spark\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe pink Angel who wields the power of lightning, Lucky. Outwardly a positive and energetic girl, Lana uses enthusiasm to mask the anxiety that haunts her. As leader of the Angels, she uses empathy and optimism to inspire those around her, but her hesitations hold her back from showing the same kindness to herself. Even so, she strives to fit the role of her ideal magical girl, something she\u0027s dreamed of since she was little.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGabbi Chen\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blue angel with the power of shapeshifting, Amplifier.  Gabbi is a free-spirited trans girl who won\u2019t hesitate to speak her mind.  Playful and a loudmouth, Gabbi wants everyone to know she\u2019s the coolest around.  She\u2019s cocky and a bit of a knucklehead, always in favor of whatever sounds like the most fun course of action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaylor Jamison\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe golden angel with the power of mind, Amnesiac.  Taylor is a well respected young woman known for being a perfectionist.  She has a princess-like aura that exudes elegance and prestige.  She has a hard time getting along with others, as she has little tolerance for nonsense.  In the heat of action, Taylor is very calculating, always assessing the whole situation before making any decisions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudrey Spark\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe purple angel with the power of flames, Witch.  Audrey is Lana\u2019s little sister.  Most of the time, Audrey is very timid and quiet.  But when she does talk, she\u2019ll often surprise others with her sharp wit and perception.  Audrey\u2019s still young, but she\u2019s determined to find her own path in life.  Her insight comes in handy to make her a reliable member of the angels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNadia Kaminski\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe silver angel with the power of space, Centralia.  Nadia isn\u2019t very trusting.  She prefers to act as a lone wolf instead of going along with others.  Her attitude leads her to get combative when interacting with the rest of the angels.  Despite her stubbornness, Nadia still tries her best to do what she thinks is right, even if it means having to rely on others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eProject Info\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMagic by the Kilowatt, or MagiKilo for short, is a story set in America about five queer magical girls struggling with mental illness. This started as a creative writing project to help with therapy, but thanks to the support and encouragement from so many people, it\u0027s become something much larger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an experienced writer, composer and programmer, and I\u0027m trying to help fund this project to commission art from friends and justify my work on it. I have a history of mental illness and struggle to support myself and my girlfriend, anything you could contribute would help greatly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to support this project, you\u0027ll receive updates as soon as they\u0027re available!
