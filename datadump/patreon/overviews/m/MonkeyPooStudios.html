I\u0027m sure your parents wouldn\u0027t support this idea...hell, if you\u0027re married, you probably won\u0027t be for much longer... Basically, I don\u0027t have a good reason. All I have is a half damaged brain, a microphone and some weekly (bi-weekly/Monthly) creative offerings.. for you! If for some reason you\u0027ve subscribed to that via your podcast player of choice, then perhaps you\u0027d like to throw a little coin down on the table to keep the fun stuff coming? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0All Jokes aside. This is something that can benefit the both of us! It keeps your ears happy during your daily jog, or ride to work...wherever it is that you listen to podcasts. Hey, if it keeps you laughing, or gives you a bit of knowledge, then know that your support means\u00a0we can continue doing this. Heck it\u0027s only a\u00a0 couple of bucks a month! Check the back seat of your car, grab the change from the Tip jar at Starbucks, or \"forget\" to tip the Jimmy Johns guy for being freaky fast (Unless they too are listeners of the podcast) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBottom line...\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 If you find entertainment or education in these shows, if you find \nthere to be some value with what you\u0027ve received from\u00a0us or if you would\n like to see more output, then consider becoming a patron. You can give \nas little as a quarter or as much as you\u0027d like. Anything will help\nout. I will be grateful for your kindness. So grateful, I\u0027ll be sure to share it with the world on future episodes of the podcasts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003eIMPORTANT: Patreon is simply for the\u00a0listeners who\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWANT\u003c/strong\u003e to lend a helping hand. If you don\u0027t want to, or if you simply can not help, nothing changes. You can still enjoy the podcasts the exact same way you have been: free of charge!
