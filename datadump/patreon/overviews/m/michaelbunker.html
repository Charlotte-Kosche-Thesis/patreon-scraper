    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWriters are like everyone else\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e -- at least in some respects -- what we really \"want\" is hard to define sometimes. I wouldn\u0027t like to sign on to some dogma that there is some definite thing (a novel, story, genre) that I\u0027d \u003cem\u003esolely\u003c/em\u003e like to be writing, and everything else that I\u0027m writing I hate (or at the very least, don\u0027t want to write.) That\u0027s never true, at least not for me. I only write what I want to write, but writing can be like choosing where you want to eat. I like a lot of different kinds of food (you know this if you know me) and would and could be sublimely happy with any of them. That doesn\u0027t meant that there isn\u0027t a particular food that would hit the spot RIGHT NOW.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo let me get this straight before I go into the topic for this post. I\u0027m happy writing all the stuff I\u0027m writing now\u003c/strong\u003e (including the stuff I have on the docket to write.) I love the stories I\u0027m in, and I have every intention to continue them. So don\u0027t take this post as some kind of complaint. Because it isn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the stuff I\u0027ve written pays a little, but most of it doesn\u0027t really pay at all. Some of the stuff I\u0027m writing now will pay off, some will not. Almost everything an Indie writer writes is written on \"spec.\" That means \"speculation.\" That means, there is no money, only the hope that some day someone will pay to read it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think a lot of people (especially authors) think that financially I must have it made since I had a big bestseller a year and a half ago, and I sold an option on that book to Hollywood. Nothing could be further from the truth. I haven\u0027t released a new novel since the end of April 2015, and though that book did alright - it didn\u0027t do great. The money for almost all Indie writers slows to a trickle when you aren\u0027t putting out stuff regularly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI do have the advantage of living totally off-grid, raising a lot of our own food, and living a plain and simple lifestyle. That\u0027s what allows me to write \"full time.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.michaelbunker.com/bringing-the-amish-to-hollywood-or-selling-a-film-option-101/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe \u003cem\u003ePennsylvania\u003c/em\u003e script I\u0027ve been working on for months is a \"spec\" script\u003c/a\u003e. There is no money now, and no promise of money in the future. Months of work is invested with the hope that someday the show will get picked up and made and some money will come from it. Prior to the screenplay work, a good portion of 2015 was spent working with my friend Nick Cole trying to launch a very speculative project called Apocalypse Weird. A wonderful idea that just never found it\u0027s wings. Neither Nick nor I ever made a dime from Apocalypse Weird despite the better part of a year spent working on it. Every penny from the sales of the book \u003cem\u003eTexocalypse Now\u003c/em\u003e that Nick and I wrote together for the AW project went to support the project and to help other authors get started with their AW books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, with all of that work, some of my ongoing projects have suffered. \u003cem\u003eOklahoma\u003c/em\u003e (the sequel to \u003cem\u003ePennsylvania\u003c/em\u003e) is still in just the beginning stages, although I hope to have Part 1 ready to go out this summer. And of course a very few steadfast fans from the early days of my fiction career are still waiting for \u003cem\u003eCold Harbor\u003c/em\u003e, a project which keeps getting shoved back because of reasons (reality.) I\u0027m finally in full-scale writing mode on \u003cem\u003eFUTURITY\u003c/em\u003e, which I think will be one of the best things I\u0027ve ever written, but even that project has it\u0027s own dose of reality. I\u0027m sending it to my agent who will be shopping it around for awhile. So that could take a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd what does all of this have to do with what I \"want\" to write? Everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt some point, you need to make some money at this or it\u0027s just a hobby and not really a career. Those of you who have followed my career for some time know that I\u0027m an accidental Sci-fi writer. Sci-fi isn\u0027t my natural genre at all. I never meant to write sci-fi... at least not at first. My first novel \u003cem\u003eThe Last Pilgrims\u003c/em\u003e, as far as I was concerned, was a fictional historical novel set only 25 years in the future. No lasers, no robots, no machines. In fact... no cell phones and no Internet. It was a post-apocalyptic novel, but even that setting was merely a stage setter in order to tell the story of the real-life Ancient Waldenses, only set in our own time. Anyway, I soon learned that Amazon (and every other book seller) considers Dystopianism or Post-Apocalyptic books to be Sci-fi. Pretty soon, I was being called the Amish Sci-fi writer. \u003cem\u003eWICK\u003c/em\u003e was a prequel to \u003cem\u003eThe Last Pilgrims\u003c/em\u003e.  \u003cem\u003eFuturity\u003c/em\u003e (the novella) and \u003cem\u003ePennsylvania\u003c/em\u003e (serialized) were my first real sci-fi books. I never meant to write sci-fi at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat did I \"want\" to write?\u003c/strong\u003e Snobs and industry folk would call it \"Literary Fiction\" but I would call it something else. I mean, what in what genre did Hemingway write? Tolstoy? Turgenev? They didn\u0027t call it \"Literary Fiction\" back then. They just called them novels. Was Vonnegut really sci-fi? Not to me he wasn\u0027t. But that\u0027s what I would write if I had my perfect world. And some of them would be without any speculative genre at all. And some might have time travel or elements that can be considered sci-fi. My dream novel I hope to write some day is entitled \u003cem\u003eLubbock 1955\u003c/em\u003e. And it is a Jack Finneyesque time travel novel about the 50\u0027s and rock and roll and time. It wouldn\u0027t really be sci-fi either. That book will take a few years of research, and that can\u0027t happen until I can afford that kind of time spent studying old pictures and maps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI pitched a book to my agent the other day\u003c/strong\u003e, and he politely told me it was crap (my interpretation, ok?) and no one would read it. He\u0027s a pro, and I think he\u0027s funny as hell, but I also think he\u0027s wrong about this book. I think a lot of people would read it. I want to write it, so I plan to. I told him (with a gleam in my eye) that I would prove him wrong. He told me (and he\u0027s probably right) \"Get \u003cem\u003eFuturity\u003c/em\u003e done!\" But this book is begging to be written, and I\u0027m going to write it, even while I\u0027m doing everything else. I\u0027ll make special writing time to write it. This Patreon starts with that book. And that leads me to the point of all of this...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have resisted doing a \u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e thing for many years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you aren\u0027t familiar with Patreon, it is a fantastic service that allows artists to get subscribers who want to support their art. All kinds of artists use Patreon. I learned about it when my friend \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/benjadams?ty=h\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBen Adams\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (the superstar who made the \u003cem\u003eBrother, Frank\u003c/em\u003e cover) started his Patreon (seriously, support him. He\u0027s awesome.) I saw that a bunch of writers were doing Patreon, and I resisted it. I think authors should, as much as possible, make their money from selling books. I\u0027m not judging authors who use Indiegogo or Kickstarter or any other fundraising platform. I just couldn\u0027t justify doing it myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnyway, this morning one of my closest friends sent me a link to Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e and asked if I knew about it. He said that this could be a good thing for me, since I do so many things (including non-fiction writing, etc.) and it would provide a small amount to cover all the stuff I do for free (or on spec.) I told him I had looked at it many times and I had trouble justifying it for authors selling books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, just yesterday, a good friend of mine tagged me in a Facebook post that was written by a guy who had just discovered many of the Russian writers (my all-time favorite literature!) This guy had just stumbled upon Alexander Pushkin, and my friend asked me if I had read Pushkin (of course I have you ninny.) Well, the way my mind works... I saw \"Pushkin\" and I immediately start reminiscing in my mind about the first time I read \u003cem\u003eEugene Onegin\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cem\u003eEugene Onegin\u003c/em\u003e was Pushkin\u0027s poetic novel masterpiece (novel in verse) that he released serially, by chapters, between 1825 and 1832. It is Pushkin\u0027s most famous work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I started thinking that most of my favorite novels were written serially, and published by chapters. Hemingway did it. Tolstoy did it. Solzhenitsyn did it. \u003cem\u003eA Farewell to Arms\u003c/em\u003e was written chapter by chapter, published serially. Some of the greatest books in history were actually released serially in magazines and often were... gasp... Indie published. And many of those great authors were able to write because they had \u003cem\u003epatrons\u003c/em\u003e ~ people who supported their writing financially because the authors suffered in poverty. Pushkin was under house arrest a lot of the time (for pissing off the Czar) so a lot of other authors were his patrons and helped him get things published.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here was my friend, the next morning, telling me about Patreon. Which I had rejected using for almost two years. And the name \"Patreon\" comes from \"patron.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo I began to think it over.\u003c/strong\u003e What if... What if... instead of being (only) a way for me to finance my writing... what if Patreon could be a way for me to provide some content to many readers who are frustrated that due to my other responsibilities, my fiction book production has slowed down? What if... and just stick with me here... what if this gave me the ability to accomplish two things at once? What if I could write what I really, really, really \"want\" to write, and also provide a regular stream of story to my best reader friends... something they couldn\u0027t get anywhere else, and no one else would get at all (until the full novel is published in the future.)? And what if the story was written more along the lines of traditional literature... not some need to shove artificial action into the front of the book to keep the attention of social media age readers? No need to end every chapter with a cliffhanger. No need to satisfy what some industry folks think will sell?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what if this writing didn\u0027t hinder my other projects. Not a bit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI figured out how to do it. And Patreon, despite my resistance, is the answer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to start writing an epic literary novel entitled \u003cem\u003eHell and the Sea are Never Full\u003c/em\u003e, or just \u003cem\u003eHell and the Sea. \u003c/em\u003eAnd\u00a0I\u0027m going to give my best reader friends the story episodically as it comes out. Mostly chapter by chapter. Not some 20k word short story entitled \"Part 1.\" Instead, this will most likely be released a chapter at a time. No one will be able to tell me that the story needs to fit into some pre-conceived mold. I\u0027ll write the story as it should be written. It won\u0027t be sci-fi. It\u0027ll be a novel. An epic novel. (And if this works, when this novel is over, I\u0027ll start another one!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be no attempt made to encapsulate an entire thread or storyline in a single chapter. That\u0027s what makes for bad writing. In fact, most of the strictures now imposed upon writers makes for commercial, but not quality, writing. So I\u0027m going to write what I truly, truly, truly want to write. You want inside my mind, here you go! \u00a0And I already have the story! And readers will have to work too, like they ought to in a literary novel. Still, I promise a great story - one that my readers will love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the story, Patreon partners will get background to the writing process, and they\u0027ll get to see the story crafted from beginning to end.  I\u0027ll come up with some bang up other options readers can select. And no one else will get the story until it is released as a finished work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re going to do this OLD SCHOOL, and I think (and hope) it\u0027ll be glorious!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMichael Bunker\u003cbr\u003e"
