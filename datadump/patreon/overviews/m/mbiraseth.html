    "summary": "I love mbira.\u00a0 When I found this instrument I more or less shelved all the others.\u00a0 Mbira is my meditation, my escape, my reward... It is at once so simple and easy, while being the most difficult thing I\u0027ve ever undertaken.\u00a0 The depth of each song is infinite, with layers opening more and more every time they are explored.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a musician my whole life, and I\u0027ve never encountered something so sweet and magical, and so utterly mind bending that it remains ever elusive and mysterious... this little instrument has romanced my soul.\u00a0 In Zimbabwe they would say that my own ancestral spirits invited the Shave reMbira (the spirits which grant attraction to and skill in mbira) into my life.\u00a0 Thank you ancestors for this gift.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this page simply because I started putting videos for free on YouTube, and thought if someone out there enjoys those, they may just enjoy the heaps and heaps of other videos and audio recordings I have that maybe don\u0027t make the cut for public sharing, but would be very interesting and valuable for a hungry mbira enthusiast.\u00a0 When I first began this journey I craved to learn as much as I could and had very few teachers readily available.\u00a0 I would have loved to dig through some guy\u0027s archives, getting inspired here and there with licks played on an mbira.\u00a0 A lot of the videos either have a troubled start (sinking into the groove), or a crash landing abrupt stop.\u00a0 I believe this is par for the course with mbria exploration, but not something western music has much patience for.\u00a0 I even cringe at some of the sloppy playing on my YouTube videos but it is better than not sharing at all I believe.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll put up tutorial videos as well from time to time.\u00a0 But I generally feel more comfortable sharing my own explorations rather than representing a traditional culture that I am only a guest within. If you love this music, I cannot urge you enough to get as many traiditional recordings as you can (www.mbira.org has many to choose from) and listen, listen, listen... listen in the background while you do other things, and listen intently as a study session.\u00a0 There is no substitution for ingraining these patterns into your ears so you can then bring them back from your fingers. Join the Hadei kuMbira club from that same website and get a new album every month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo enjoy!\u00a0 There will always be new stuff loading in here.\u00a0 And 100% of the money gathered from this subscription goes to mbira related activities (purchasing new mbira, purchasing new albums, improving the videos, etc...) so your contribution to me will be reaching back to Zimbabwe!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo amount is too small.\u00a0 Thanks for your interest and your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
