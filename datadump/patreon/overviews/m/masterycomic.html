After multiple mis-starts, side story projects, IRL\ninjury recoveries, and dozens of rewrites,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eMastery\u003c/strong\u003e is finally underway!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince I\u0027m balancing this webcomic project with a\nday job and working as half of the husband/wife duo\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eManifested Dreams\u003c/strong\u003e at anime conventions, I won\u0027t be able\nto offer much special content in return for your support. In time, I hope to\nadd a weekly livestream where I\u0027ll likely be working on either the comic\nitself, convention artwork, or digital commissions. I\u0027ll be adding more rewards\nin as I get a feel for what it is that you, the viewer, want.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is a very hefty project. I have a ton of\ncontent to grind out for you all. I\u0027m going into this expecting to make little\nor nothing off of it. For me, their story just really needs to be told. That\nsaid, the lofty ideal of being able to drop my day job and focus fully on\nbringing this expansive multiverse to you\u00a0\u003cem\u003ewould\u003c/em\u003e be pretty sweet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUltimately, what will make me the happiest is\nknowing that you\u0027ll all fall just as hard for this cast as I have. I feel like\nmost of the support I can hope to receive will be morale... and that\u0027s\nfantastic. I wish I could offer more rewards for any generosity that you\u0027d show me here, but for right now it\u0027s all I can do to get Sarah, Ash, Min Hua and Rei\u0027s story to you in a timely manner.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo... yeah. Enough babbling on my end. Thank you for being\nhere, and I hope you stick around for the coming decade or four this ride just\nmight take.\u003cbr\u003e"
