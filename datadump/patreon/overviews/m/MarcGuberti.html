    "summary": "I started publishing my first pieces of content when I was 11 years old. As a digital marketer, I teach people how to grow their content brands using the web. I love analyzing my niche, reading up, and sharing what I learn with my audience. I wrote 19 books, published 25 training courses, and hosted two virtual summits before turning 20.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Breakthrough Success Podcast is my most exciting on-going project. I\u0027ve interviewed over 100 people on the show (Episode 100 will be released on February 22nd at 9 am eastern but I\u0027ve conducted the interview already and many others). I take the time to carefully think of each question which asking myself the question, \"Would listeners get a lot of value from the guest if I ask this question?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople were quick to write me off when I was first getting started because of my young age. Apparently, that indicated I was experienced and could never have a chance against someone who had 30 years of experience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen other people write you off, understand that those are other people. It\u0027s only bad if you write yourself off. That\u0027s when mediocrity happens. I didn\u0027t write myself off and focused on providing value to my audience. I continued refining my craft and people continued engaging with my content and sharing it with their friends. Both of those things still happen, and that\u0027s why you\u0027re hear on my Patreon Page today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I enjoy hosting the Breakthrough Success Podcast, it costs hundreds of dollars per month to pay for storage costs and employees. I can make the money back by using sponsored ads, but that would detract from the listener\u0027s experience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s\u00a0why I need your help. For as little as $1/mo, you can help keep Breakthrough Success running. I appreciate all of my patrons who help me continue to host Breakthrough Success and expand it as well. Someday, if you want me to, I hope to turn Breakthrough Success into a daily podcast. Either way, I\u0027m continuously thinking of how I can provide you and everyone with more value. Any small contribution will help me continue to realize that goal.\u003cbr\u003e"
