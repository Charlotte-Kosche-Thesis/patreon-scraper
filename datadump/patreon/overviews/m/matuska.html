I\u0027m currently working as a freelance illustrator and the bulk of my time is spent creating artwork on commission. I would love to dedicate more time to personal growth and experimentation as an artist. With your help as a patron, this can be possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy personal artistic goals include pushing myself past my comfort zones, and to positively represent people of all kinds in my work. Work posted here will include sexuality and gender exploration, as well as a celebration and variety of kinks. That said, work posted here may be NSFW and you must be 18 or older to become a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOften, lot of my personal work is not shared online due to commissions taking priority. My goal here is to make sharing more of my work more of a priority, which will lead to more and better art for the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this time, I don\u0027t have plans to make my work patreon exclusive. However, WIPs may be shared here. Sketches that will remain unfinished may also be found in uploads here that would otherwise not be uploaded. My main plan for updating here will be with big ol\u0027 piles of files that have already been shared elsewhere. These will sometimes include extra sketches and hi-res versions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also find me and my work on tumblr, weasyl, and furaffinity under the same name: matuska!\u003cbr\u003e"
