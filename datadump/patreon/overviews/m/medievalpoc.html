Ph.D. candidates, history educators, fantasy authors, fans of historical media and cultural studies, as well as those who are just interested in learning something different have found new and exciting information at Medievalpoc. These artworks and documentation are readily available on multiple social media platforms, including \u003ca href=\"http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e,\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/medievalpoc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Facebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/medievalpoc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://medievalpoc.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMedievalpoc.org\u003c/a\u003e. The goal of Medievalpoc is not to \u003cem\u003ehoard\u003c/em\u003e information, but to share it as widely as possible and incite discussion in social as well as activist and educational communities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe traditional relationship between creators and their patrons have long been a part of human history.

Patronage means more access to databases, art collections, and academic resources for the creation of Medievalpoc. In addition, your patronage can pave the way for exciting new projects across various media, like print, film, and interactive online content--projects Patrons can see in the making.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons of Medievalpoc will have a unique access to the creation of Medievalpoc, the research and writing process, as well as interviews, discussions, theory writing, rough drafts and brainstorming. Patrons can give feedback on projects as they happen. Creator Goals will be added and enhanced as new projects take shape and become realized through the unique processes that shape discussions at Medievalpoc. With patronage, Medievalpoc will be better able to expand its platforms and run more smoothly across social media sites, with improved synchronization and accessibility. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to forging a new era of Patron and Creator with my readers in my goal of bringing Art and History to life in a new way-a History in which we can see ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e"
