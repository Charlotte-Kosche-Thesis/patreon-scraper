    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003etl;dr - \u003c/strong\u003eYouTube is demonetizing our videos, so income fluctuates massively. Your contribution helps keep our stress levels down and independent of ad revenue, so we can focus on what we love; content creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWELCOME, TRYBE!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver two years ago we embarked on this crazy adventure called YouTube. We saw YouTube as an opportunity for us to try things we never dreamed of trying, and didn\u0027t think it would blossom to the beautiful raging flower it has become, it kind of just happened. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow YouTube of has become our lives; we live, eat, sleep, and breathe it, however, YouTube cannot sustain us. Our videos are being demonetized left and right during this \"adpocalypse\", which can be incredibly deflating. This is where you come in; if we have ever made you laugh, love that our channel is family-friendly, or if you just love what we are doing, please consider buying us the equivalent of an energy drink, and it will keep our dreams alive!\u00a0If 1% of our TRYBE could do this, we could put all our efforts into doing YouTube full-time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is what this Patreon is for. By supporting us here you are not only making our lives way less stressful, but you can actually help us become independent of YouTube ad revenue, provide stability, safety, and reassurance so that we can focus on doing what we love: producing more family friendly content for all to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/nNUDLn/Promo.jpg\" style=\"width: 647px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of our financial situation we will continue doing YouTube, and our videos will always be free! Men Try has become something that gives us purpose and a mission, and we absolutely love hearing how we have made your days brighter and filled with laughter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is all about frequency and quality. The more our trybe can support us, the more things we can do and share with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll we can promise you is that we do the best we can and invest as much time and love into YouTube as possible, without being irresponsible. Thank you for your ongoing support, it really is a huge deal for us, and we very much appreciate it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we will do with your donation?: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Reinvest back into Men Try; this means new equipment, money for props, costumes, decorations, a professional intro, and more robust experiences!\u003cbr\u003e- Currently we have two jobs: Men Try and our \"real\" jobs. By supporting us on Patreon you will eventually give us the opportunity to focus solely on YouTube!\u003cbr\u003e- Hopefully get to a point where we can up our release cadence to 2 videos per week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBIG NOTE\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cbr\u003eWe absolutely appreciate your support. Your contributions will help take Men Try to the next level. That being said, we don\u0027t want Patreon to take away from our main focus, YouTube. So if one perk in a tier proves to be too time consuming, it may change in order to maintain our primary focus. This is a massive experiment for us. Also, if there are new features, other offerings, new tiers, or anything you think would be awesome for us to embrace, feel free to throw them out to us. A big part of this movement is a focus on collaboration, and embracing our little trybe. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
