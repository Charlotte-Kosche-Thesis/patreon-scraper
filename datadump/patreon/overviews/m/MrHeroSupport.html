    "summary": "Hi Friends! If you are someone who is in hot pursuit of your best self and / or your best life then this is the network for you! My name is Shawn Furey and I love to see people succeed - at life! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing I\u0027ve learned from my own experience is that there are a lot of obstacles and opposition that lay between where you are now and where you are going! If you\u0027re going to overcome those hurdles then it\u0027ll be important that you discover, develop, and sustain a high level of personal power. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have noticed that there aren\u0027t always a lot of people around who demonstrate a lot of personal empowerment in their day-to-day lives and there\u0027s often even fewer people around who would applaud you when you do begin to become empowered. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo wonder so many people never reach their full potential in life! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up, I struggled to find anyone who demonstrated any kind of capacity to improve day-to-day situations and so I turned to history books, movies, and TV shows to find characters that I could look up to and aspire to be like someday. I found some real characters like Martin Luther King, Jr and some pretend characters like Superman. Now, after several years of researching the lives of empowered people and characters, I\u0027ve come to the conclusion that if you\u0027re looking for a way to develop and demonstrate personal power then all you have to do is try everyday to live heroically - to live your life as if you were the hero of your own story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin my Personal Empowerment Network and become a part of a community of empowered, self-confident, go-getters! We value personal development and situation improvement. We want to do well as individuals and as human beings. We want to achieve a sustainable sense of well-being and personal power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can become a member by becoming a 10-Dollar Hero! Your ten dollars per month contribution will allow you access to the weekly group community call-in line and will get you 30 minutes per month of one-on-one peer support with one of our Empower-Mentors!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBatman had Alfred, Bond had \"Q\", The Angels had Charlie, and now you\u0027ve got somebody too - actually, now you\u0027ve got a whole team of people who want to see you succeed - at life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to contribute even just a dollar or two per month to support this work then you would literally be making my dream come true - and helping to train the world\u0027s next generation of heroes! Thanks in advance."
