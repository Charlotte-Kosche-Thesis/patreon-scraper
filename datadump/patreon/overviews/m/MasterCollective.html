I believe we are creating a unique community that will create more good together than any of us could do separately (and we all do a TON separately), but through your patronage we will be able to better represent and embody the ideals that I believe you share with us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qH9n9eyPeqo4612AyogfZkiA7MN8m18VP7c92fTCC-KFcFGetHVxEt08DAk9l0V4j0gRhcMTHY7nmSioDUGINz3ojvkLGzEm0NmqwDRGu4XTdKGN3iWiiGMxawKmUgYEbd-OQgFbApdEeQ0khOPWlK3pkcDspLwad1eZe-JpfdIJyK9bmXSXiCxklONUvlgWu7VZlRVrA841SwujhikrNguNDPAq7GuebfyC_M1TcSsoHh9aW0d8zRxiUBmIr1sCl-M8763K42TRdt8N_159kvu8HLVJ-uZAoOkVSSKGnWtn0DTUjPKlCtQBH3bnt3cq9z2vYkrBgx_ggDUfOud946ZOy5Pyyh1B5i5rmXojAOAXyBpyQCGGcYkjtBakozv4RUBaGPSyjWeh9H3p6X-s7lo1xkkQQF-qILBydD-01SmDgbd_8tTSpYSpWgJbbKN9qVbqVX3Ew27LtfjYTf98UMOLDv72dqJBGqsrGebFI6D3AMyKSuW0NrlpfuM67L68wxiIbiuHAW5eXmDUgmkHm0Gn1U6Nu4szEQVSdjY2fheEpSqrxEDFMUCqJLR_qiqIa-s_3bA3oZbSdKM9TE6KCj46EpxdnVm0mBSy692q=w1279-h959-no\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a Patron will get you ground-level access to a number of our events, media, workshops, apparel, artwork, and other creations this network generates. Many exclusive benefits await you if you are gracious enough to become a Patron, but more than that your support means you also believe in some or all of what we do. For that we are truly thankful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an awesome platform to support creative people and organizations to create works. We are using it because we believe there is value in ongoing support for what we do. Maintaining a facility for our work and providing our skills affordably (or free) is critical to improving the community so Patreon is a perfect way for people who love our work or the people it helps to contribute. \u003cu\u003eYour contributions will directly fund the material expenses for holding events, workshops, and producing the content we offer in media channels.\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do we do?

We support artists, makers, and local artisans in developing and offering their art, food, or creations in efficient ways--rather than having people who are interested in creating things be slowed down with the business, we handle that so they can be focused on their passions. All the not-fun-but-necessary work of being a business is taken off of their plate and we see this as required to have people reaching their potential. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe do this work out of our first Full Spectrum facility, GamerHaven.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eFull Spectrum: GamerHaven\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGamerHaven is a creative coworking community space crafted from a former coffee shop. Full Spectrum spaces are membership spaces, so no less than 4 days a week are exclusively available to members in its full capacity. No worries though, membership is free and access is affordable and flexible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s larger than the sum of its parts; filled with current generation video games consoles, screens, comfortable seating, document printing, and other creative tools (tablets, high-end gaming PCs) and a incubator cafe that can offer member made food products, GamerHaven during its day-life flexes to accommodate entrepreneurs in need of working space, gamers who need a place to play with each other, students who need to print assignments and can relax as they wait, and any other combination of people who see value in all of our resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eGamerHaven Community Outreach\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause all of these tools are so rarely placed in a community-centric and intentional way with each other, it became clear that a part of its value would come from making this space openly available to whomever had any interest. While the typical rental of space for familiar events has been a staple, it also has lead to a number of community uses we didn\u2019t anticipate: community development corporations have held public meetings here, we\u2019ve partnered with local colleges for student/alumni networking, been host to leaders in creative industries interested in sharing their work with underexposed youth, and all varieties of private media and art driven events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t2tGIgD30ffpcwjSJNSQoJjcHuWiP1LaTzOVFgAwu-MGmYlPTDwwznQHHl3P5UlbB-ZdJACEf_lDXnyw4PNsb2zXjIgN_I-xQtwYiqyiTqZZetKvYPJkTEgQoaZfHfo6UYha4H-dVisLpuzcA4Ae1aMuzNmHUrlHRb68BWJ2QY9y5XAvjQO_PHTC3Jff3cvSfpryzKn7entWz7xNYnujzj-aZ21SDtTUcJL0tZD0vvG2lNK-nh4JrImngqlIKzf4GYrsUgsA65iCPXXKt8mssMv7GD9pcFOReUAHL53Ky0bp74XTtTdskcJ1rt9ni6j91FEjUSl6Tqut46pLjXsdi3l8SRBLE_YXV17PY_8g4RU_cdKjNgD73W_f9aKNQrutsaX-RWi2RwRCKpqed6D05xbNDqQrR7gm_aA83LOol1LL8W84H9KfO7DlF49A2wT_oK2Hb_lZp-TwLwOx5h3rGlOVp7qvgMWkgr8kivjrvTqp_x6nVM0rI3snStdLZqfbfnzI7hz-JPmxfH1SUjdciYqDEwo81Q_abBbrRu_HhBIFnndjySwJKP8Uk7tbFtBmZUjfOeRGYZMcQt23zkSt-ERtbPkQTM2PRuZNSXhy=w1279-h959-no\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7wjkFjOo_Uu5XPF5wQXTRPiSrFA206A0_SFyvjmtb9AXckV_eaKsB1H0OOQGh_NtQbkeAQLrSyi8UJcJxD9cc_GIUjD1KLGW9fMo_1zVO5s_mpRdaiD-0on5PBA4bZqb5LUuIKfHF05o_tHasX1ajFMXoNHkv4O7KDMt2-_0PdWVyvBN_Zcv8HE0pAs7wy2gAapvZY_UtLAKeUrwKAu9RlMpCdvQqOgdqDI9EwH7VfxvqR9GTg2cHxHvWiS9F6l6RT9fwHXOTptLJ5HLZto1GnGj0t761yuJ8WOc9Q8MGQlhkuDdLtREPO1HXXMz4jBUoPxj7Ng9PQty_9f_MNEw8qQREUjwoRvc-eFvBH7gOPrQpMZzPD4ajLLrtGtGTbVTGqj8lUtGyH8x1H4DxOTLDOx9Z47rAtBmV06_wClBQLuFXWUV7BFQbhMF1wMeAoyhvs-07KlJhkDBqsuRGZC3UZlFDYzMVVRTqRzwsS_T0zUrwzO8oBkFfILPmZ6tDmMUczlFd74kSJjKKtdya6RFTqXPXzS1zgNpFuKcG6u5db1fuZaHkgt1jNUlt_nKoyyIY2-FNBYIaz99ZVvaYPEdq-_oJH3b2JVPzOOb4-dC=w1279-h959-no\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePositioning GamerHaven as a place not just for the play of games but as a community space that can use modern tools and techniques for the neighborhood and community\u2019s good will make Master Collective\u2019s goals of empowering people who don\u2019t often get access to these tools easier.
