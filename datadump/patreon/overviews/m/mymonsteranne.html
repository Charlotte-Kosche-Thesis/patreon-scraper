    "summary": "Hi folks! I\u0027m Anne!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mostly do autobio comics. I\u0027ve done a crabby autobio zine called \u003cstrong\u003ebooty \u003c/strong\u003efor a while, though that project has been on hiatus since the\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eBig Bad Best of Booty\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0collection was published. I\u0027ve published two other long-form comics narratives: \u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Don\u0027t Get\u003c/strong\u003e, which is my story about surviving a campus shooting in 1992 and what living with that\u0027s been like, and\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSo...You\u0027re A Ref?\u003c/strong\u003e, which is a collection of ridiculous stories compiled from the last ten years of being a roller derby official.\u00a0 (These books are all available on my Etsy site and I might post some of those pages here as well from time to time, especially if there\u0027s a page I want to rework in retrospect.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027ve also done a lot of other side projects; I had a strip that ran in the University of Delaware newspaper for a little while called Helleborine, where a little minion of hell and a wee angel mostly bickered with one another about literary theory and how much they both didn\u0027t like Delaware. (So say we all, apparently?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also learned how to watercolor recently, and that\u0027s been a little mind-blowing in terms of the art I\u0027ve been creating. I had wanted to start a Patreon for some time to be able to house my content somewhere instead of posting it on Facebook or Instagram. So here you\u0027ll get access to some of the behind-the-scenes and the work that\u0027s in progress and other things I\u0027m working on, including short stories that may or may not morph into comics, exclusive content, and things that I think are cool but won\u0027t always release to the general public. Some of it may end up in publication, most of it likely will not, but it\u0027ll at least be a way for me to update my artwork and to show a wider range of projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll probably also get a lot of weird museum selfies, because I work in a pretty rad local museum and it\u0027s hard to pass up the chance to post pictures about my delightfully weird museum life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut...but I have all your books! And a hat! And you post on Facebook all the time anyway. What\u0027s all this about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor some time I\u0027ve been paring back on posting my art on social media platforms, in part because I\u0027m working with some newer material but in part because sometimes I just don\u0027t know where that art goes. I\u0027m also interested in developing a different kind of accountability; if left to my own devices I goof off or paint pictures of Edgar Allan Poe on skates, but that work rarely if ever sees the light of day (and sits around the studio, otherwise known as my dining room table).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also thinking about radically reformatting \u003cstrong\u003ebooty\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0as we head into the next issue, and I want to try out some different formats and things before I commit to putting it in print at a certain size or style.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how\u0027s this work again?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCheck the tiers on the side of the page. For $1 a month, you get access to most of my posts and see most of the art. $3, more access; $5 a month, even more access to different posts, new art, more in-depth work, and so forth. This may change in coming months, in part because I\u0027m a postalfreak and I love sending mail, so you might find some weird, awesome, random stuff in your mailbox at some of the higher tiers. I generally don\u0027t post on a set schedule, though that might change when I launch the next book project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out my work!\u00a0"
