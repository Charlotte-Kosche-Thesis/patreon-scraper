    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHappy New Year from Merlin, Amelie and Mos Chukma!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis past year marked the \u003cstrong\u003e10 year anniversary of the Mos Chukma Institute\u2019s Arts as Healing Program\u003c/strong\u003e. During this time, MCI has been aided by so many inspired and generous collaborators. Some have donated funding and supplies, even more have selflessly given time, expertise, and energetic assistance \u2013 whether in grant writing, all levels of film production, or direct service administering our art therapy program in the classroom.  Thanks to so many for helping Mos Chukma reach thousands of students with hundreds of meaningful lesson plans. MCI could not have thrived and evolved to this high degree of success without you!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eCurrently, MCI stands at a crossroads, as Founder and Director Amelie Prescott retired from full-time implementation of the program this past May, at the age of 75.  It was time for her to consider her longevity and health above day-to-day administering of direct service of the program. Now much of her attention is being drawn into her private practice, which she loves and is inspired by, but which largely takes precedence out of financial need. The calling of MCI: the archiving and disseminating of its philosophy, lesson plans, techniques, and curriculum; along with training new teachers to carry these traditions forward continue to herald the next evolution of MCI.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where you come in! \u003cstrong\u003eWe are asking for monthly support of $10 or $20 (some may be able to give more!) to help fund MCI to manifest into its next iteration of service.\u003c/strong\u003e Ms. Prescott can no longer carry the weight of the entire program on her shoulders alone. She and Mos Chukma need your help, so these ways of healing in the classroom, ceremony, trauma intervention, emotional intelligence development, connecting to the natural world, and resiliency building can continue to thrive!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Roots of MCI\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMs. Prescott has dedicated her life\u2019s work to gathering and developing medicine teachings from around the globe. From studying Buddhist spirituality and non-violence during her six years travelling in Asia in the 1960s; to being gifted medicine songs, prayers, and ceremonies of various Indigenous traditions of California and the South; to years of clinical studies and certification in EMDR, psychology, counseling, and Western Crisis Intervention  \u2013 Ms. Prescott has truly followed the calling of collecting, developing, and administering these healing tools to countless youth over the past more than forty years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have not seen her equal in terms of passion, inspiration, commitment, and generosity.  She even personally self-funded the first three years of the program, using money garnered from the sale of our home in Berkeley. She could not wait for approval or funding from government agencies or grant funders; she felt the need of the youth of New Orleans reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and took it upon herself to respond.  And respond she did. Funding and training a team of several teaching artists and film makers, MCI served hundreds of students a week during that delicate time when many students were still deeply traumatized from their experiences during and surrounding the storm \u2013 some were still weeping under tables during thunderstorms.  Many had received no mental health services at all, until MCI and Ms. Prescott felt the deep need and answered the calling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Need MCI to Persevere\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThis letter is a heartfelt request to answer a calling of great need presented to you right now! This life\u2019s work, and sophisticated understanding of trauma healing and resiliency building must be preserved and proliferated! With your help in the year to come, MCI will develop and publish its training manual and archive of lesson plans; train teachers; once again offer direct services to youth in New Orleans; and generate a quarterly newsletter, including: details of current activities, lesson plans, inspiration, healing tools, as well as offering volunteers a variety of ways to get involved. \u003cstrong\u003eAlso, as a 501 (c)(3) registered non-profit, all donations made to MCI are completely tax deductible, and each donor will be supplied with everything necessary to ensure this process can be easily completed for each tax year\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt a time when public education is under attack, and the Arts and mental health services for youth are being brutally gutted, it\u0027s a revolutionary act to support a program such as this. \u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s our hope that through our friends, family, and inspired parties each giving sustained support, even in small degrees, we can collectively secure the legacy of MCI and healing practices in classrooms for decades to come!\u003c/strong\u003e Please join me as I promise my on-going support for this noble cause, and please click our link to pledge below!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your time, love and support! Blessings on your New Year and the auspicious year to come!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVery Sincerely and Steeped in Gratitude,\u003cbr\u003eMerlin Ramsey\u003cbr\u003eAnd the Mos Chukma Family\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.moschukmainstitute.org/\"\u003ewww.moschukmainstitute.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
