    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey everyone! Hope all is well. :) Thank you so much for stopping by my Patreon page.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Myles, and for the past decade I have been a video blogger who has experimented with online platforms to see how they can be used as a vehicle for social change. This has taken place across a wide range of subjects including charity fundraising, mental health, activism \u0026amp; journalism. I have truly lived and breathed this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProgress is something you only notice when you look over your shoulder, and so I didn\u2019t expect a hobby to evolve into a career as a video strategist. I had some amazing years working for organisations like UK YouTube network ChannelFlip and news publisher the Guardian, but my ambition to utilize this platform for social change felt suppressed during this period. So in 2016 I left a well paid job, and decided to embark on my most purposeful project yet: to develop and launch my very own media organisation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy unconventional life story involving YouTube, combined with my background in psychology and my constant desire to help bring people together, has led me to this point. In a world that is becoming seemingly more volatile as traditional institutions are threatened by a technological revolution that shows no sign of stopping, I feel there is an urgent need for mainstream value systems to evolve. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore I want to create a media organisation that focuses on the education of value systems: not teaching people what to think, but how to think for themselves. The world is already full of opportunities to consume knowledge on academic subjects or news reports - all very important - but I wish to provide a platform that offers mental tools for self-improvement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I am producing a new video every week that gets published on both\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/MylesDyerOfficial\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/myles\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e, which cover a variety of topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"411\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nrcR_MoR3r9SmyZyKoLmRNmwW4n9SlZNLCwuvIED1azDomdY_ie1ZB1ybLig4fZttUZwEJKw-uLMMByBuABYUTO9oMjgpd9g0xkWcNBZFBSrlYjXY3hZP7F5rnlTn0ZrEXZ7L_2x\" style=\"\" width=\"624\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnderstanding \u003cstrong\u003ethe past\u003c/strong\u003e: Social commentary on news stories, world events or popular culture.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnderstanding \u003cstrong\u003ethe present\u003c/strong\u003e: Exercises and teachings around mental health \u0026amp; wellbeing. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnderstanding \u003cstrong\u003ethe future\u003c/strong\u003e: Looking ahead at how science \u0026amp; technology will change the way we live and function as a global society.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis means I am responsible for researching, scripting, presenting, filming, producing, distributing \u0026amp; marketing each video. Not too much haha! However, bills have to be paid and so I\u2019m currently stretched between this and searching for work as a video consultant while living off savings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt unfortunately means my videos don\u2019t get the full love and attention that they deserve. So the first phases of this Patreon endeavour is to reach the goal of \u003cstrong\u003e$1,500 per month\u003c/strong\u003e, which would provide me with basic financial security and thus freeing me to give this project my undivided attention. \u003cbr\u003eTo be very frank, this phase is the make-or-break of the entire project, because I only have so much runway to takeoff. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy funding this with small individual contributions, it not only gives me editorial freedom, but it also creates a community where we can discuss the direction of this project together as well. Once sustainability has been achieved, we can then focus on developing production values, expanding the volume of content and building an education network that strives to empower the lives of others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will join us on this journey. Even if you can spare only the minimum of $1/month, it all helps in the grand scheme of things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is just the beginning of what could become an incredible media organisation, and so I thank you in advance if you do choose to get involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Myles x\u003cbr\u003e"
