My name is Ms. Melody Monroe\u003c/strong\u003e and I\u0027m a hip hop soul artist and producer from Greensboro, NC.\u00a0Through this site, you have the ability to directly support your favorite hardworking musicians (hopefully me!), making it easier for them to provide you with more content you love. I want to release cover music every month for you to enjoy while I begin writing and officially complete and release my first \u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThink of my Patreon page as a digital tip-jar.\u003c/strong\u003e If you were to randomly pass me performing in the street and think you would put a dollar in my guitar case, then this is the new 21st century way of doing just that. Donating even just $1 per new song gets you exclusive goodies (see to the right!). And don\u0027t worry, \u003cem\u003ePatreon is super secure, and you can easily set a monthly budget so you know you won\u0027t tip too much. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour support would mean the world to me.\u003c/strong\u003e I want nothing more than to be able to consistently provide my listeners with new content. Your contribution, no matter how small, will help me do just that. I will use your donations to improve the quality of all future songs and videos, and help me get them out faster. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for stopping by\u003c/strong\u003e, and please check out the different donation levels to see what cool stuff you can get by being my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg height=\"77\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/s77sNiZprIm2xC7yb_6xVdqs-l0pH8zLYhQUPWtF18QRaqhQxjBXv1pBF4lQg5ahWlP5UWt3xR4j-7c1Da-bbUYn9Zcsiwsn-7a3Gd9GcNmZU0upOL0fONqPRAlOBFy1AqSF6DeI\" width=\"607\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s the deal: I\u0027ll create a cover song and hopefully video every month.

Now, I have a $30 phone. Due to life circumstances, I can\u0027t afford a purchase like this right now. I can make videos to go along with cover songs. It takes a lot of work, but I enjoy it. This will also improve the quality of the vids I put out and improve the overall quality of my social media content, etc. I think a refurbished S6 should do the trick. -\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-SM-G920V-Smartphone-Refurbished/dp/B014V5XDQW/ref=sr_1_27?s=wireless\u0026amp;ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1474413885\u0026amp;sr=1-27\u0026amp;keywords=samsung+galaxy+s6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e$330\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComputer battery\u003c/strong\u003e - I do all of my music and vids on a 2008 Macbook Pro.
