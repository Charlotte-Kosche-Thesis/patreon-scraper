    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me, My\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eMBDXHDR Art Photography and Post-Processing Craft, and\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eMy \"Art in the Public Realm\" (APR) and Calgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society (CWRS) projects.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! I\u0027m an applied sociologist (PhD) and co-author (along with Bob Stebbins) of\u003cstrong\u003e \"Social Entrepreneurship for Dummies\"\u003c/strong\u003e. My TEDx talk on social entrepreneurship has been viewed thousands of times and is here (\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/mbdTEDxYYC1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e http://bit.ly/mbdTEDxYYC1 \u003c/a\u003e). In a strange way that I can\u0027t fully explain, I feel I express many of my sociological and contemplative sensibilities visually through digital photography. This happens with my choice of subject matter and also with my post-processing craft, a unique synthesis of \u003cstrong\u003eAnsel Adams\u0027 Zone System\u003c/strong\u003e principles with \u003cstrong\u003eHigh Dynamic Range (HDR)\u003c/strong\u003e digital techniques. This proprietary integration, \u003cstrong\u003eMBDXHDR\u003c/strong\u003e, opens up a world of possibilities for expressing the wonders of luminosity, colour, and detail! I try to be a sociological \"witness to light\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I\u0027m particularly interested in the areas of travel, tourism, hospitality, urban and rural life, history, \u003cstrong\u003epublic art\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003enature\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith regard to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003epublic art\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u0027ve launched a potentially landmark collaborative social enterprise, \u003cstrong\u003e\"Art in the Public Realm\" -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://artinthepublicrealm.squarespace.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e http://artinthepublicrealm.squarespace.com\u003c/a\u003e. With this project, in its infancy, I bring my art photography and post-processing - as well as the post-processing of collaborators\u0027 images - to the appreciation of \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eart intended for public attention\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. The APR project will be enormous, too big to do alone. And that\u0027s why I\u0027ve joined Patreon; to solicit help from patrons acting as both vital financial supporters and, hopefully too, collaborators. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003eThat said, as a general rule, anyone who has authored a digital image of a public art piece and who is willing to lend their image for HDR+ enhancement to the APR project (and related social media) will have the enhanced image returned to them as a highest quality .tif file, beautifully suited to printing anything from a postcard to a poster. The enhancement and returned file are provided free of charge, a thank you gift in appreciation of the collaborator\u0027s supporting the APR project. And certainly, a\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003eppropriate attribution will always be given. So far, at least a dozen folks have collaborated with me in this way. If you would like to do the same, contact me at mbdxhdr@gmail.com .\u00a0\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith regard to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003enature\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, I am now doing post-processing for the amazing\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eCalgary Wildlife Rehabilitation Society\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(\u003ca href=\"http://calgarywildlife.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://calgarywildlife.org\u003c/a\u003e) pro bono and on an ongoing basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(195, 214, 155);\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(195, 214, 155);\"\u003eYour Patreon support, then, allows me to continue to build out these two major projects - \u003cu\u003eArt in the Public Realm\u003c/u\u003e and \u003cu\u003eCWRS\u003c/u\u003e post-processing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e.....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eREWARDS SECTION\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from knowing that your Patreon support allows for the ongoing development of the two above-mentioned photo projects, here, \u003cem\u003eexclusively\u003c/em\u003e through this Patreon site, are the rewards I will offer my Superfan patrons supporting these initiatives:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.

Here is a link to a photo of a good friend and supporter, Tony Davies, holding a 12 x 18 inch aluminium print of my post-processed work of a pic I took\u00a0of his pride-and-joy Lexus (whew!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.evernote.com/shard/s3/sh/589a0461-8bfb-48ae-8074-7d6da3e3d633/026fbfdf274c38b2acf7d329a527977e\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e https://www.evernote.com/shard/s3/sh/589a0461-8bfb-48ae-8074-7d6da3e3d633/026fbfdf274c38b2acf7d329a527977e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2.

Active Superfans can email me and request a free top-quality download link (i.e., in .tif format) for my HDR+ enhancements of these images.

This will give active Superfans an insider\u0027s look at my ponderings and doings.
