    "summary": "We\u0027re Chris Mosher and Jeremy Greer, and we host Monster of the Week: a creepy (but necessary) podcast that covers the TV show Supernatural. It\u0027s been almost a year, and we are super excited to launch our Patreon. Before we get too far, let us say this: \u003cstrong\u003eMonster of the Week will always be a freely available podcast for everyone. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo why are we doing this? Well, frankly, creating podcasts is a hugely time consuming thing. It\u0027s extremely fun, and we love doing it, so we want to make more episodes. We\u0027re hoping that you guys want us to make new episodes as well, so we\u0027re structuring our goals to provide bonus content: a series of extra episodes covering the books, comics, and anime of Supernatural. These episodes will be made available to our Patrons first, then to the general public shortly after.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur big goal: starting a whole new show! We want to apply our same, hunk-based coverage to the show Buffy: the Vampire Slayer. We think it will be a blast. Chris has seen it, but Jeremy never has, so it should be an...interesting experience. This show will have a weekly schedule, and be free to everyone. Patrons at a certain tier will get the episodes early, just like MOTW.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this, and thanks for pledging! We are so excited to make new shows for you."
