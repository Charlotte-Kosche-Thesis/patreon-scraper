    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Us\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started this locally-owned online newspaper to fill what we see as an important gap for our readers \u2014 both breaking news as it\u2019s happening, and in-depth coverage of county issues that can be hard to do with print deadlines. It\u0027s important to us to cover news that\u0027s valuable to the whole community, and we thank everyone for supporting our project and sharing ideas about what issues they\u0027d like to see covered.\u003cbr\u003eEveryone on our staff has worked at other local papers in the county, most of which are owned by Digital First Media, a national newspaper chain based in Denver, the same company that owns most of the other papers in Northern California. Corporate cutbacks and out of state owners made working for DFM increasingly difficult, so we decided to start a locally-owned and independent news source that would be accountable to the local community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy not Print?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u2019t have a print version, in part to put the money from printing costs towards better reporting around the county, and because a website lets us reach more readers more quickly. Plus, being online allows us to be nimble and efficient, cover breaking news as it happens, and update stories as new information comes in. Our coverage of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.mendovoice.com/?s=mendocinolakecomplex\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMendocino Lake Fire\u003c/a\u003e is a good example of this. While other papers had to wait a day or two to give an update, we had a reporter on the scene that day relaying the latest info.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Mendocino Voice\u2019s take on cannabis\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that for too long the debate over marijuana has been framed with an \u201cus vs. them\u201d mentality on all sides. This hindered public debate, and as a result nuanced and complex issues, with multiple stakeholders and countless interests, were often discussed as a simplistic binary \u2014 either cannabis was the demon reefer, or it was the ganja savior. We want to talk about it plainly, as a crop, a medicine, and an industry. Some kind of normalization of the cannabis industry is here to stay, and it constitutes a big part of our local economy.\u003cbr\u003eIf we were in Detroit we talk about cars, we\u2019d talk about GM and Ford; if we were in Napa we\u2019d talk wine. But we\u2019re in Mendocino, and so we\u2019re going to talk about weed. Coverage of the auto industry means talking about unions and strikes, corporate profits, about where new plants are to be built, air quality regulations, and bailouts. But it also means doing car reviews, talking about safety ratings, and covering a car show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a bunch of cool ideas about how to get you better news faster, using online data tools to improve our coverage. But to build those tools, we need funding! We started this account so you could get updates on our tech goals and support our project of bringing better local journalism to our region. We think Mendocino County deserves journalism using the best digital reporting tools available, and we hope you think so too!"
