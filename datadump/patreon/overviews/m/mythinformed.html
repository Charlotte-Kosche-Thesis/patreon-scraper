However, it takes great strength to listen\nto, try to understand and engage in real conversation with others who do NOT\nshare your views. Like the questioning the historicity of figures in religious\ntexts, we need to be able to ask the difficult and sometimes uncomfortable\nquestions. We can apply this ethos beyond religion and into other beliefs to\nwhich people subscribe. When we dig deep to explore the origins of one\u0027s\nbeliefs, we often find that we have more commonalities than differences. We can\nhumanize beliefs that we were previously quick to reject. If we apply context,\nwe enable ourselves to gain respect, empathy and understanding. We can agree to\ndisagree; and when we disagree we can disagree sanely. The effect of this\nprocess allows us better understand our own beliefs, and sometimes we humbly\nchange our minds.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOUR MISSION\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe promote viewpoint diversity to limit the effects of\nauthoritarian ideology.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOUR VISION\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA more egalitarian, pluralistic society.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOUR CORE VALUES\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe believe in:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n \u003cli\u003ePushing\n     boundaries.
