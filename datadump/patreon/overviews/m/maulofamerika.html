    "summary": "Maul of Amerika is a weekly unfiltered discussion on whatever the hell is going on in the world at the moment, brought to you by two friends that basically consider themselves brothers.\u00a0 Douglas and Carlo will dissect topics, bust each others balls, and offer intellectual insight around a diverse array of subjects, from politics to gaming to society to the arts to STEM and more.\u00a0 You name it, they\u0027ll shoot the shit about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo who are Douglas and Carlo professionally?\u00a0 Douglas is an aerospace systems engineer that used to work with the Space Shuttle Program.\u00a0 Now he\u0027s working on his fledgling sustainable agro-tech startup company and getting his Masters in International Relations to advance global sustainable development issues.\u00a0 Carlo is an actor and performer, with many years of experience at Universal Studios Orlando and appearing in Pirates of the Caribbean.\u00a0 Now he\u0027s working on pursuing his dream of becoming an Astrobiologist.\u00a0 Does that combo puzzle you?\u00a0 Good, that\u0027s exactly how he likes it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo who are Douglas and Carlo personally?\u00a0 Assholes.\u00a0 That\u0027s it.\u00a0 They\u0027re assholes, mainly because they don\u0027t mind challenging bullshit, and unfortunately many people these days don\u0027t like to be challenged.\u00a0 They don\u0027t suffer fools lightly; they take every opportunity to bash archaic thinking and outdated dogmatic thought processes; they prefer evidence based scientific modes of thinking and analysis and cannot stand pseudo-scientific unprovable bullshit; they are likely to simultaneously bust balls, give praise, and offer intellectual insight on any given subject; and in the end, they\u0027re quite entertaining to listen too.\u00a0 Agree or not with their position on something, you\u0027ll still probably laugh at some point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why Patreon?\u00a0 Simple, your patronage will tell us if you find us entertaining and informative, will enable the show to improve by investing in better technologies for both audio and video aspects, and gives the hosts a side income so they can focus more diligently on providing the best show possible.\u00a0 In short, if the show is good, you\u0027ll support it, and if you support it, it will get better and better.\u003cbr\u003e"
