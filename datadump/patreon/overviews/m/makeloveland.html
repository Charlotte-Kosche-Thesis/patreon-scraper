    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eFor an introduction or refresher on tax foreclosure in Detroit, please watch the VICE News video above or \u003ca href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/kznzky/detroits-housing-crisis-is-the-work-of-its-own-government\"\u003eread their article\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2010,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://makeloveland.com\"\u003eLOVELAND Technologies\u003c/a\u003e has independently mapped, tracked, and grappled with every dimension of the overwhelming tax foreclosure problem in Detroit and Wayne County. For the last five years, since the bankruptcy, we\u0027ve thought that every year had to be the last, because how could something this crazy continue once people see it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s taken an incredible amount of persistence to help move the needle. Fortunately, thanks to the work of many community leaders, advocates, researchers, reporters, and counselors, 2018 may be the tipping point.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo better play our part, every\u00a0month, on this channel, we\u0027ll post a short update on the latest tax foreclosure data, news, stories, and events to let you know what\u0027s happening. If you appreciate the work, please consider becoming a monthly patron or sponsor, or share the link with those who might.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the year progresses, we\u0027ll fill in a neat monthly chart of numbers, progress, and milestones, along with city-, neighborhood-, and parcel-level maps. If you follow these updates, you won\u0027t miss a thing that\u0027s happened, and you won\u0027t miss key dates coming up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur main focus will be on the 36,000 Detroit properties at immediate risk of foreclosure, and on stopping the sale of occupied homes at the September auction.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://taxforeclosure.sitecontrol.us/m/tax-foreclosure-notices-for-2018\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHere is a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://taxforeclosure.sitecontrol.us/m/tax-foreclosure-notices-for-2018\"\u003emap of 2018 foreclosure notices\u003c/a\u003e in Detroit and Wayne County, and here is a link to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1undPcy4JClU8qRGUBrGSqv_tgi3zqhg3BNIFXaPvzsQ/edit?usp=sharing\"\u003ethe raw data\u003c/a\u003e from the county.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://taxforeclosure.sitecontrol.us/m/tax-foreclosure-notices-for-2018\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQ81vk7WsAE10a9.jpg:large\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, we\u0027ll also look upstream to see how many Detroiters are paying their taxes on time, and how many are already at risk of foreclosure in 2019 so we\u0027re not all blindsided by the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll send this data and analysis to the offices of the Wayne County Treasurer, the Wayne County Executive, the Wayne County Commissioners, the Detroit City Council, and the Mayor of Detroit, and request their feedback and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully we can all help encourage them to commit to ending the sale of occupied homes, and also help launch programs that remove people from the foreclosure pipeline or prevent them from ever entering it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the year we\u0027ll zip everything up into a neat report, like a mini-book, and make it available for the world to see how Detroit has addressed this problem in 2018.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this model works, we can apply it to other issues in Detroit or nationally that will benefit from independent, community-supported, data-driven analysis and policy proposals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is work we have committed to because it is the right thing to do. If you appreciate it, please consider becoming a patron or sponsor at whatever level you can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: While our\u00a0hope and goal is to reach zero occupied homes at the auction, we understand there are people and organizations who just want or need this data and are not or do not wish to be seen as advocates. Loveland may call our community of subscribers supporters of patrons but we understand that contributions through this site do not necessarily indicate support for Loveland\u0027s views or activities. We want to build a big tent of people working on and researching this issue that can include multiple views and neutral parties, including the press.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can contact us any time at \u003cstrong\u003eteam@makeloveland.com\u003c/strong\u003e.
