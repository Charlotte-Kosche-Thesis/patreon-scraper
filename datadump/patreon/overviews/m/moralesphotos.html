    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003eFirst off let me just start by saying thank you! Thank you so much for coming to my page, your support means the world to me. I have been a photographer since 2011 when I first started taking classes at the Art Insitute of Pittsburgh. From that time until now I have been meticulously developing my photo style. After many years I have found a way to tell my story. With your support, I am able to continue to tell my story through photos. My photography is a special part of who I am. Allow me to explain a little more...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey say that if you look at what a person photographs, you will discover what\u2019s important to them. Wildlife. Landscape. Equine sports. My passion for these things cannot accurately be described in words but can be shown, with my photographs. These three things come together in my portfolios but they are also a part of my life every single day. Relatedly through my study of animals, I have developed the now seemingly natural ability to find animals, wherever they are. It would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t notice the beautiful landscapes that these animals are in. My favorite will always be the forest. There is something so magical about the forest and the animals that call it home. Being in the forest makes me feel like I am a child in an enchanted land.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd perhaps the most important of the three is equine sports. Horseback riding has easily become my biggest passion. Nothing can compare to the flawless, subtle communication between rider and horse. I can only hope that my photos are able to convey this communication. A true work of art and I say this as both a photographer and a horseback rider. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dreams include traveling the world, horseback riding, and being a professional photographer. Your investment takes me one step closer to achieving my goals. Again, thank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Mariza Morales"
