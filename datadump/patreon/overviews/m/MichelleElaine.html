I am a jewelry artist, painter and sculptor trying to make art my full time job! I primarily create polymer clay jewelry, watercolor paintings on wood, and small decorative clay masks; however I like to blur the lines between all three, including heavy amounts of painting in my sculpted work and three dimensional elements in my paintings. Most of my work inspired by my deep love of nature as well as mythology, folklore and stories of any kind.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me on etsy\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/MichellePetersenArt?ref=hdr_shop_menu\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0facebook\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MichelleElaineArt/?fref=photo\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and tumblr\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/blog/michelleelainepetersen\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an way for artists to gain the support they need to fund their art career on a steady, ongoing basis. Even when an artist finds some measure of success selling their work, it is still not a steady source of income. Patreon allows artists to have something we can rely on, because even when sales are in a slump we still need to buy supplies and keep creating! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon\u00a0allows anyone to pledge an amount of money of their choice (it can be as little as $1 per month!). In return you get various thank you gifts, access to daily sketches and your name entered every time I hold an art raffle! The money I raise on Patreon will go toward paint, clay and all other art related expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll you have to do is\u00a0create an account and, with a credit card or paypal, choose the ammount you would like to donate per month! If you like what I do and can\u0027t afford to donate, spread the word, anything helps!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards vary depending on the size of the donation (check out the options on the right side of the page)! Everyone will receive a reusable coupon for my etsy shop (\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/MichellePetersenArt?ref=hdr_shop_menu\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhich you can visit here\u003c/a\u003e)! And by reusable, I mean you can keep using it endlessly, you will never have to pay full price.\u00a0When I reach the goal of $200 a month I will begin raffling of a piece of art every three months, everyone who donates will be entered! The higher your donation, the more times your name will be entered. You will also get a chance to vote on which piece will be given away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
