I have a youtube channel and on it I love to explore creatively--do song covers, talk about acting, make style videos--the possibilities are endless! But, balancing my acting career, paying my bills, and trying to regularly make videos has proved to be quite difficult. Patreon has given me a direct channel and line of communication to my audience, enabled me to focus more fully on my acting career, and given me the time to make videos. It\u0027s even allowed me to produce full-scale short films and webseries!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to be a part of my team, you can become a Patron at one of the sponsorship levels listed to the side. I love connecting to you guys, my audience, through the different interactions I offer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has been so awesome to give me the freedom to focus my creative efforts on my acting career and the projects I produce. Even if you can\u0027t support me monetarily, just watching my stuff means a whole lot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by! You\u0027re great.\u003cbr\u003e"
