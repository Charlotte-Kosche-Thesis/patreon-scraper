Community is Contagious! Being involved makes you feel good! The largest barrier to getting involved is knowing about all of the great events, meetings, and educational opportunities happening in town. \u00a0Once you have this knowledge all in one place, you can decide how best to devote your time, what events you may be interested in, what organizations you want to be involved in!\u003cbr\u003e"
