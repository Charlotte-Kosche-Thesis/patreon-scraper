Decades ago, these neighborhoods were full of\nimmigrant Jews, with synagogues and kosher establishments everywhere. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nToday, new immigrants living here have created an amazing\ntapestry of languages and cultures. And a new Jewish thread is being woven in\nto that tapestry. Jewish newcomers to Queens (and some old-timers too!!)\nincluding young adults, families with kids, interfaith couples, LGBTQ folks,\nJews of color and seekers are looking for a place to connect.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe need partners and supporters like you to sustain and grow\nthis new community, and we want to share the flavor of Malkhut with our\nsupporters so we can all feel connected!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLed by Rabbi Rachel Goldenberg, Malkhut is building a\ncommunity based in joyful Jewish spiritual practices for all ages, such as\nchant and song, meditation, interactive study, and holiday celebrations. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe meet regularly for Shabbat in rental spaces in Astoria\nand Jackson Heights as well as in people\u2019s homes, and we have plans to expand\nour reach to more young adults and families with young children. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMalkhut is getting involved in local social justice issues, including\nthe creation of Hate Free Zones where we are allies in the work of loving and\nprotecting our neighbors. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo, nu?\u003c/strong\u003e \n(that\u2019s Yiddishified English for, \u201cwhat are you waiting for?\u201d)  Will you partner with us by becoming a\nmonthly supporter?
