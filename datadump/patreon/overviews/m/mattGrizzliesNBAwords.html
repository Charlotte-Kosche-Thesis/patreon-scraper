    "summary": "Hi, thanks for visiting my Semi-Patreon page. People who know me know I am a pretty simple guy. I like the Grizzlies and the NBA; I like reading and writing; and I like working with charities. Patreon struck me as a pretty cool place to merge all those interests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor people who don\u0027t know me, I previously wrote for SBNation\u0027s Grizzlies fan site. I\u0027m active on that savage, glorious place known as NBA Twitter. I\u0027ve also done several Grizzlies related podcasts - apologies for my super-nasally voice. But I found that writing for a Grizzlies blog was too narrowly focused, and often I was shoehorning my other interests into a space that was ill-suited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll predominantly be writing about the \u003cstrong\u003eGrizzlies\u003c/strong\u003e here, and the \u003cstrong\u003eNBA\u003c/strong\u003e as a whole. I\u0027ll also occasionally write about other things:\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003egreat books\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve read (just disregard those posts, nobody reads books these days anyway); my favorite NBA cities. I\u0027ll write about other \u003cstrong\u003erandom things\u003c/strong\u003e as they come. I might show you guys some fiction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently there is only one Reward tier - $2/month - and you guys get everything for that amount.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to why I call this a \"semi-Patreon\" page. After all, I have a full-time job that I love, so I don\u0027t need patrons. I also don\u0027t think it is fair to take all the money from people for something I\u0027m not doing full time. So I will be donating at least half the money earned here to charities. I say \"at least half\" because I really don\u0027t know where this will go, I\u0027m bad at math, and \"half\" seems like a way to make the math easy. What I can tell you is this: in December 2016, I started a Crowdrise campaign for the Memphis based charity Service Over Self, promoted it on twitter, and \u00a0in less than a month we raised over $9,000. With that money, SOS was able to put LED lightbulbs and insulation into homes in the poorest neighborhoods in Memphis, and now those families will save a few dollars every month for the next few decades because you guys clicked a few buttons. It felt really good to do that, and want to find more places to help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll offer updates of where our donations go. In the meantime, I\u0027ll write about the things I love here, and hopefully, you\u0027ll love them too."
