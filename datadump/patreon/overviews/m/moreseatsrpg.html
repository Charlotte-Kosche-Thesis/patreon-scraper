This newsletter was the brainchild of Kira Magrann and Anna Kreider, who then enlisted Misha Bushyager and Kimberley Lam to help with planning and execution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur plan is to send an email newsletter bi-weekly, featuring a roundup of games and game projects by gender-marginalized creators in order to boost awareness of them and to help them reach new audiences. This newsletter will be an opt-in newsletter hosted through Mail Chimp.

And who should subscribe?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMore Seats at the Table came out of a conversation between Kira and Anna about their frustrations with the perception that games by and about not-men are perceived as being only \u003cem\u003efor\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0not-men. The same, of course, is true along other axes of marginalization - i.e. games by PoC are perceived as being for PoC, etc.\u00a0This poses a huge barrier to marginalized creators, because while there are some gaming communities that have succeeded in attracting diverse groups of participants, the majority of games purchases are still being made by cishet men.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, even when you clear that first hurdle - getting cishet men to \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to play games by and about people who don\u0027t look like them, what we hear over and over again is that men don\u0027t know where to go to find games by marginalized creators that reflect their interests, because a thing that has happened over time is that many men have curated gaming social media circles that are mostly men - most of whom have done the same thing, so projects by marginalized folks just don\u0027t end up being on their radar.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo while the team behind More Seats is happy to encourage marginalized gamers to subscribe and find games that reflect them, we\u0027d like to specifically invite cishet men to subscribe to this list. And to our cishet male subscribers, we request that you do one of two things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSignal boost the games that interest you, specifically calling out the things about those games that you find exciting.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you are able to do so, purchase games that are particularly in your wheelhouse and are likely to see play in your gaming spaces.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t understand why this needs a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have created this Patreon as a way for people to support us in doing the work of curating games, processing submissions, and putting together the newsletter. Our time is valuable, and while this is something we feel passionately about doing, it\u0027s great to have that recognized. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore importantly! We\u0027ll also need your support if this thing takes off, as MailChimp is only free for lists up to 2000 subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you be inclusive when you\u0027re excluding men?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePromoting diversity and inclusion isn\u0027t the same thing as saying that \"everybody\" should be included. It\u0027s important to remember that \"staying neutral\" is a vote for the white male-dominated status quo, and that often promoting inclusivity means actively deciding who to exclude.
