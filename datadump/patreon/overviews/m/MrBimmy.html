( my fancy way of saying hello )\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHello world,\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Travis Williams\nand I am an up-and-coming artist. You can call me Mr. Bimmy. I\u2019ve been lucky\nenough to figure out exactly what I want to do in life. That is to draw cool\npictures of pretty girls as I find my artist voice and to inspire others to\nfind their own artist voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am 26 years old. When I\ngraduated from high school I wanted to be in video game design, but after a\ncouple years of coursework and various classes I discovered that my true\npassion is art. Since then I have searched for the path to improve my art\nskills. This has included classes, books, studying anatomy, drawing strangers\non buses and in coffee shops.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have spent hours and\nhours drawing. My chosen mediums are pencil and paper, and digital art. I\u2019ve\nbeen using Paint Tool Sai for the last five years. I have seen improvement but\nnever enough( Heh - heh - heh ).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have taught private\nindividuals and been involved in after school programs . \n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am still exploring. I am\nstill searching for my path. I know that I want to be an artist. I want to\nsupport myself with my art.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf there is one aspect that\nI could pass on it would be my passion. And if I were to cheat would also pass on my determination\nto achieve my passion.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow you can help?\nThis is your cue!\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support on Patreon\nwill serve a dual purpose. One, it will allow me to devote more time and effort\ninto finding the path to becoming a true artist. Two, it will let me teach and\ninspire others on how to grow in their art (nifty huh?). My motto is, \u201cImprovement\nand empowerment.\u201d \n\u003cbr\u003e\nNot only will I be able to\nfocus more of my time on the world of art but I will also be able to bring you\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFan Art\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTutorials\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCritiques\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePersonal One-On-One Sessions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYouTube Videos\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egroup meet ups\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eand more ! \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nIf donating is a little much I would also appreciate sharing my art with your friends and loved ones. Feel\nfree to suggest changes or new themes at any time. I don\u2019t promise that I will\nalways be able to comply, but the feedback is great. I want Patreon to be a\nsafe place for my patrons to feel creative and influence each other\u2019s\ninspiration. Don\u2019t be shy, I want to share this journey with all of you! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will your pledge go\nthrough?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll\nrewards will be distributed each month after payments have been confirmed.
