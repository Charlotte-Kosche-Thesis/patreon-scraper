In addition, Akuoreo will draw a shaded sketch cover image for that story, and we\u0027ll post the chapter on the same sites as the MSF High pages as a weekend bonus!  With this, you could see a continuation of the Console-tan story, a new Mahou Galaxy story, another Ruby and Azura story, more of Plot of the Retro Bimbo Aliens, or any of a number of character tales, such as teacher or student origin stories!",
