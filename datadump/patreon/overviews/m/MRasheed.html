This is of course unacceptable, and it is the duty of the people to make the oppressor as uncomfortable as possible. Remember, that\u00a0the nerve-wrecking, continuous threat of uprising was a major tool\u00a0used in the national argument against slavery; the discomforting continuous\u00a0wear upon the oppressor class\u00a0FORCED them to think about the horrors of what they had done.

It gives the impression that some unspoken law was broken in which whites expect Blacks not to make them uncomfortable by demanding the abolition of racism and its vile systems. I vow that I absolutely will use my cartooning to shine the spotlight on that evil whenever I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that you will join me as I continue to use my own\u00a0resources, skills and force towards that fight.\u00a0The purchase of my original \u003ca href=\"http://www.mrasheed.com/\"\u003egraphic novels\u003c/a\u003e, and/or a small monthly commitment to this Patreon account, would enable me to make folk uncomfortable full time, and even double my regular output.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your interest, financial support, and invaluable feedback.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVery respectfully,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eM.
