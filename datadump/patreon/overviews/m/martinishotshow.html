Our guests come on and share their experiences from projects they\u0027ve worked on. We don\u0027t just speak with directors, oh no, we cover all the different areas of entertainment! We\u0027ve had writers, directors, VFX artists, and Special Make Up Effects artists on the show so far and we have a lot more people coming up. The purpose of the show is to be entertaining and help these creators get the word out about the projects they are working on but also to provide education to those that may be just starting out and need some advice. Not only do we do interviews but we also cover industry events such as The International Make Up Artist Trade Show and The Independent Cinema Showcase.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecent Guests\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul style=\"\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eHoward Berger (Special Effects Make Up Department Head on The Orville)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePeter Macon (Actor, Bortus, on The Orville)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEzra Albarran (Writer/Director Alleys)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePhilip Blue (Writer/Director A Ghost and the Boy with A Box on His Head)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRuel Smith (VFX Artist on Black Panther, Writer/director of The Bus Ride)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, what does your contribution do for the show?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour contribution helps us create the show.
