    "summary": "To my wonderful, endlessly supportive community,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can hardly believe it but it has been 3 years since I turned my life around and launched a second career as a singer, songwriter and artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been an incredible ride -- but I\u0027ve financed all of it out of my personal savings, and \u003cstrong\u003ein order to not just keep it up, but take it to the next level, I need your help.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSigning up as one of my \"Patreons\" makes you a modern-day patron of the arts. \u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s simple: by signing up, you commit to paying me a small amount every time I release a new song\u003c/strong\u003e, album or or music video (on average, I expect that to be 12-14 times per year). All together, my Patreons will help me pay for the production of my music and videos -- which means we\u0027ll be making art together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027ll be more than just donors to my career - you\u0027ll be my co-producers.\u003c/strong\u003e Patreons will be among the first to hear songs, see videos, and help me come up with ideas for new projects. And Patreons get rewards and perks (listed to the right.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re ready to sign up, go for it! And THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re still thinking it over, I\u0027ve made an FAQ with answers to some common Patreon questions, and included a bit more information about what\u0027s coming up for me in 2018. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you, thank you, thank you for even considering supporting me. \u003c/strong\u003eIt has been the love and cheerleading from my friends and family that has kept me on this path when it has gotten hard. I am so profoundly grateful to all of you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd P.S. if a pledge of money isn\u0027t right or possible for you right now, don\u0027t worry!! There\u0027s other ways you can help (scroll down to the last item in the FAQ) and you can always come back later and sign up as a Patreon when and if you\u0027re ready.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are your plans for 2018? Are you making more music?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes! I\u0027m working on a bunch of new songs (many of them in Spanish!), and I\u0027m producing a live show! To start, I\u0027ll be performing in Costa Rica mostly for young/teenage audiences, but of course as soon as possible, I want to play live in other parts of the world :) I\u0027m also working hard to finish the official music video for By the Ocean, my most recent single. But with enough Patreons, the sky is the limit!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes my contribution go toward funding your personal expenses?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNope. Your monthly contribution will go 100% toward powering the production and promotion of my music and videos. Most of you know I work full time for a wonderful organization, so my Patreons don\u0027t finance any of my living expenses. (Though I really encourage supporting other artists that way. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a job that allows enough flexibility to be able to also make art!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow\u0027s this music thing really going? :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGood question! In the last 3 years,\u00a0I\u0027ve taught myself music theory, songwriting, released my first 5 singles on every major music platform including Spotify and iTunes, cultivated a modest but growing social media following (approximately 3500 fans of which only about 350 are my friends and family), produced three music videos, been featured in top-tier Costa Rican media and radio stations, and been signed by a small music label in Costa Rica. But I\u0027m just getting started -- there\u0027s SO much more I could do, if I manage to build a real Patreon family.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I cancel my commitment if my financial situation changes?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDefinitely, you can cancel any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will I be billed?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eYou\u0027ll be billed every time I release a new song, music video or album. I expect this to be about once per month, but maybe a couple times per year it will be twice per month. (You won\u0027t be billed if I release a quick homemade cover or short video I make with my iPhone. You\u0027ll only help me produce content that takes considerable time, money and effort to make.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I only want to support 1 song/video per month at most?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eEasy! When you\u0027re checking out, select \"Set a monthly max\". There you can specify how many times a month you\u0027d like to support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eNope! Everything is shown in US dollars on the website, but you may use any currency and it will be automatically converted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI can\u0027t commit to helping with money right now. Is there anything else I can do to help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOf course! The most important thing you can do right now is support me on Spotify: 1. Make sure you\u0027re\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1zia6RUQPNqAPMDA2CCnOR\"\u003efollowing me\u003c/a\u003e! 2) Add my songs to your playlists 3) Download them so they\u0027re \"available offline\". And of course sharing my music and videos on social media is always helpful! THANK YOU!\u003c/div\u003e"
