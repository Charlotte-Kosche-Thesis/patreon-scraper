     "about": "Hello!!! Thank you so much for following\u00a0us on Patreon.\u00a0 We are super excited to start sharing with you our journey in\u00a0all things herbal!\u00a0 Joy\u00a0is located in Washington state, and I (Omni) am located here in North Dakota.\u00a0 We have over 10 years of experience making our own herbal remedies that we have decided to put our passions to the test and go into small business.\u00a0We realized that all our friends and family started to come to us instead for their minor ailments.\u00a0 We contribute regularly to Crystal Connections Magazine for all things holistic related. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are very active on social media and holistic or natural remedies forums.\u00a0 Besides creating our products in our own kitchens, I (Omni) am a married, mother of 1 daughter and Joy is with a partner and their cat.\u00a0 We love gardening, being outdoors, retail therapy, creating new oils, sachets, crafts, wine and Death Wish Coffee.\u00a0 We love to travel both in the continental U.S.A. and Internationally.\u00a0 But who are we kidding!!! we would LOVE to see more of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years, we have been approached by people in person, at events, even while camping, in regards to peoples needs in holistic care and herbal medicine.\u00a0 We didn\u0027t realize that all the knowledge that we had wasn\u0027t all that common and that there is a hunger for taking back our most common needs, back into our own hands.\u00a0 We have had SOOO many ideas that we figured Patreon would be a great place to create content and help not only our past, present and future customers and business partners, but help those who have been seeking coaching, consulting and how-to\u0027s in the herbalism area.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is where I will ask you to JOIN US IN PATREON LAND!\u003cbr\u003eWe really want to help others and we believe you should learn how to make your own remedies properly! \u003c/strong\u003eWe would love to do this for free, but dreams are free....our bills and mouths to feed are not.\u00a0 I have a daughter that will be going to college in a few years (YIKES!!)\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is YOUR opportunity to give back to creators\u003c/strong\u003e like us, who spoil you with amazing content (bare with us as we learn as we go), by doing what we do best!\u00a0 With your support, we will be able to offer you tools to start your holistic journey, whether it is just a hobby you wish to learn or if you want to turn this into a real job!!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work? \u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a way to join your favorite creator\u0027s community and pay them for making the stuff you love.\u00a0 Instead of just throwing us the cash (although the thought crossed our minds about that lol ), you can now pay a few bucks \u003cem\u003eper month\u003c/em\u003e to help your favorite creators.\u00a0 For example, if you pay $1 per month (NO, we are not kidding, we are totally serious about that and we would be very honored if you did), then your card is only charged a total of $1 that month.\u00a0 This means that we can generate a monthly income, and you get bragging rights.\u00a0 Seriously, it\u0027s one of the perks!\u00a0 Without you, being a patron of the arts, we would not be able to do all the amazing things we want to do and show you.\u00a0 So this is ALL BECAUSE OF YOU!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging monthly, you are helping Joy and I create new content for you and everyone else to enjoy!\u00a0 We will be able to keep making free videos on our YouTube channel, but you will be able to have a VIP access to all our new learning material AND DISCOUNTS AT OUR STORE!!\u00a0 You can manage, change or quit your pledge at any time, and we will be grateful for whatever you could give.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe a patron today, you\u0027ll be glad that you did!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
