    "summary": "Hello! My name is Makena, otherwise known as M. B. Harkins. It\u0027s great to meet you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve always been a creative individual. Not only have I been making \nfilms since I was eight, but I\u2019ve been writing all my life. Even before I\n actually knew how to hold a pencil, I would tell stories of all sorts. \nWhen I was six years old I finished my first short novel, which I\u2019m \nstill proud of today, and in eighth grade I self-published my first \nfull-length novel, the first of a series. I\u2019ve always loved stories, and\n converting them into films that people can see playing out in front of \ntheir eyes exactly the way I had it pictured in my head makes it all the\n better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen I was eight years \nold, my dad gave me his old cell phone to play around with. Little did I\n know that this \u2018playing around\u2019 would soon be something I\u2019d have a \npassion for and commit myself to. It didn\u2019t take me long to notice that \nthis phone had a camera and could record videos, nor did it take me long\n to come up with hilarious and childish ideas for something I liked to \ncall \u2018The Random Show\u2019. Back then, I knew nothing about editing. \nEverything had to be done in one take, and would sometimes take multiple\n tries. My little cell phone had a pause button on it, to pause the \nrecording, and I\u2019d use this to act as sort of a \u2018cut\u2019 from one scene to \nthe next. But if one thing got messed up, so did the rest of the \nfootage. It wasn\u2019t until around 7th grade when I discovered the world of\n editing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost of what I created was\n done in Windows Movie Maker and eventually, after my laptop died, \niMovie. Only just recently have I moved up to Adobe Premiere Pro! I\u0027m \nstill learning, but I intend to keep practicing, and get better and \nbetter. Want to join me on this epic journey? If so, welcome aboard the \nFilm Crew!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour growing love and support for me and my work mean the world to me, \nas someone whose goal is to create and inspire. If you are looking for \nmore ways to support me and my projects, Patreon is definitely one of the best ways to do so! If you cannot afford to donate, that is perfectly okay! Liking \nand sharing my social media is one of the most helpful and meaningful \nways to express your love and support - and this method has absolutely \nno cost to you!"
