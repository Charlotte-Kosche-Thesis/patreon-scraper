    "summary": "Kia Ora tatou katoa,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, a huge thank you to those of you who are already supporting me in various ways. Your words, your prayers, by showing up, and of course, financially. You are truly wonderful and I couldn\u0027t do it without you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who maybe have just heard of me, or want to find out more about what I do, let me tell you a bit about myself:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an artist by vocation and an eclectic by nature. I can\u0027t avoid making things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving dabbled in pretty much everything from theatre to sculpture and graduated from Ilam School of Fine Art in New Zealand, I am excited to continue my artistic practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m convinced that the way I can best contribute to society is through my creative endeavours. Unfortunately, you can\u0027t quite apply for a job as an artist- so here I am. Will you support me financially? With your monthly support, I will eventually be freed up to focus more and more time and energy on making.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do I make? My practice is still highly experimental- I\u0027m trying lots of random things, but I\u0027m consolidating into contemporary art and writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a contemporary artist I work in various media, including \nmoving image and oil painting, to reflect on my life and the world around me. You can get\n a feel for my work through my \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/matthewjoilsartist/\"\u003eartist Facebook page\u003c/a\u003e. You can also view some of my work on \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX3QSDthXyU5GtfiP1dz2RA\"\u003eyoutube\u003c/a\u003e and on \u003ca href=\"https://matthewjoilsartist.tumblr.com/\"\u003etumblr. \u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI connect with words. As a writer I craft poetry and sometimes opinion articles reflecting on my Christian faith. You can read my poetry and articles on my \u003ca href=\"https://matthewjoils.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e, and keep up with news about that part of my life through my \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/matthewjoilswriter/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewriter Facebook page.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write songs as well. You will soon be able to listen to some of my songs on \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/matthew-alan-joils\"\u003esoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI Invite you to join me on my journey as I try to understand the world and enrich our experience as humans. If you like what I\u0027m producing, please consider supporting me financially, and letting others know about me as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAroha,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMatt\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
