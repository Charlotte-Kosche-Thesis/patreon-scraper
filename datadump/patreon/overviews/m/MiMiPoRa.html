    "summary": "Let me tell you a story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery year, our family gathers for a couple weeks in Colorado to get away from it all. It was on this occasion in 2017 that I found myself cooped up in a vacation house with readily available weed, my Wii U, and my younger cousin. So we loaded up Netflix, and upon seeing Power Rangers, we watched some.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe got about ten episodes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile there\u0027s no denying that there\u0027s something sublimely cool and goofy about Power Rangers, the two of us agreed that there was just too much in the show that wasn\u0027t, and that it was paced horribly to boot. As surreal and entertaining as it was, it just wasn\u0027t worth the time. And as we shut the Wii U off, a thought bubbled to the surface of my THC-addled brain, and formed on my lips.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What if I made videos that were just the GOOD parts?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI set to work almost immediately, scraping together some subpar rips and chopping them up on my potato of a laptop. Before long I had the first episode down to under seven minutes, a distillation of pure cheese that - with apologies to Saban Entertainment - was FAR more watchable than the original product. It was a hit with my cousin, and so I put it up online, sharing it with my friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I got home, I decided to get serious. I ordered DVDs, and more or less started cranking out a video every day. Smash cut to seven months later, a boxed set of seasons 4-7 of the show sitting on my bookshelf, a reminder of my resolve to go beyond Mighty Morphin and continue the service that I provide and bring joy to myself and everyone I know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d been thinking for a while that I might want to make a Patreon, but I was just unsure of myself and the project in general. In the past few months, two things have happened. First, I\u0027ve found my audience. Second, I\u0027ve realized that the pace I\u0027m going at isn\u0027t sustainable. I\u0027m missing out on too much by holing up and editing every night, and at the rate I\u0027m going, I might run out of Power Rangers by 2020.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo here\u2019s the plan.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the interest of not burning out (and not burning through the series), I\u0027ve decided to dial things back a bit. Starting with Zeo, I\u0027m going to be uploading three videos a week. Power Rangers will occupy Mondays and Wednesdays, while Saturdays will be something entirely different - a rotating time slot for equally awful yet enjoyable shows such as Big Bad Beetleborgs, Sonic Underground and Mega Man. Think of it as the Saturday morning cartoon slot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I get enough support, I\u2019ll move to doing three Power Rangers episodes each week. I honestly don\u0027t have any ideas for what I\u2019d do beyond that, but that\u0027s something to address if and when we reach that point. I\u0027m definitely open to suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t want to force anyone to pledge.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I have no plans for Patron-exclusive content. If you support me, here\u0027s what I can offer in return:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly access to videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour name at the end of each video.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy heartfelt gratitude.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
