    "summary": "Who am I?\u003cbr\u003eDo you like models and would you like to create your self-made collection of miniatures\u2026your small museum? I can help you.\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Milan Dufek, I\u00b4m an ardent modeller who likes figure painting. I\u2019m painting miniatures especially from various historical periods and I love to exchange and share new experiences with other modellers. There are the reasons, why I have created this website\u2026.and I\u2018d like to share with you now. \u003cbr\u003eI am the one who wakes up and going to sleep with the ideas and thoughts about figures. I have never thought about another hobby in my life. It is a passion and an obsession at the same time, relax and fun. I am greatly enjoying it.\u003cbr\u003eDeeping together in these worlds and see what really fulfils us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.taiko-miniatures.com/fotky/reklama_patr01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReview...\u003cbr\u003eHow long have I had dirty hands from the colours and have been sticking my fingers together? Much time has passed since I opened my first model. It was sometimes at the elementary school. At that time I could only buy a model of an aircraft. Nothing else was available. A few years later, when the market was opened, I bought my first Jeep model. Then the models of tanks and other combat vehicles followed. However, I still was not satisfied. Only after entering the college in 2000, I discovered the Games Workshop board game Warhammer. I think it was the moment when my miniature painter\u0027s journey began. Today, I\u2018m focusing more on historical miniatures and fantasy models I do from time to time just to \"clear my head\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.taiko-miniatures.com/fotky/reklama_patr02.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to share my experience gathered during the past years and Patreon is a great opportunity for that. It gives me the chance to focus on creating procedures, articles or videos to improve also your painting skills. Finally, in the future, it will allow me to work freelance and fully focus myself only on passing the experience to the others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.taiko-miniatures.com/fotky/obrazovka2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will you get?\u003cbr\u003eAt my Patreon site, all will find what they need. I focus mainly on painting with oil paints, but I will show you the work with Airbrush and acrylic colours as well. I am focusing on detailed videos from my work bench whish is the main point of this Patreon page. The lenth of each video will be from 30 min up to 120 min and it will be focused on basic steps of preparing and painting miniatures and busts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
