Mainly mecha and resin figures. I also build and paint wargaming miniatures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a regular contributer to Scifiantasy.com and winner of the Model of the Year contest 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon is to help support my work and to expand what i can do with regards to video and written reviews of GK kits and all other kits that i get my hands on, along with tutorials on how i do things. Pledges will allow me to devote more time to my work.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney generated from your subscriptions will go in to buying GK and other kits for review, upgrading my recording and editing setup. It will also go towards supplies and tools ect.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course i don\u0027t expect you fine people to just throw money at me ( although it would be nice!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will, depending on pledge level be entered into monthly giveaways for prints of completed works and miniatures. The winner of the miniature can even get it painted by me if they so desire,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this stage i want to keep rewards as simple as possible. As the the Patreon grows i will be adding higher pledge levels for greater rewards such as GK kits and completed figures and models. I will also be lowering the pledge levels that are currently set as more people pledge. The more people who pledge to more prizes i can give away!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be starting live-streams and possibly private hangouts for patrons. Live streams will be on Twitch and archived on YouTube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t feel obligated to pledge. I will keep doing what i am doing but it will just take longer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you do pledge. Please only pledge what you can afford. Any amount is welcome and appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
