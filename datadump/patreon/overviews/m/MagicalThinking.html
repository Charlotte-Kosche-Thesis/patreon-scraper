This is Elliott Terral, and you\u0027re visiting the Magical Thinking Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I launched Magical Thinking, I\u0027ve interviewed some of my favorite performers, creators, influencers, and badasses in the magic community, and I have loved every minute of it. I am so grateful for your help along they way, and now I\u0027d love to make you an even bigger part of the show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are always more folks to interview and topics to cover, and to keep the show ad-free and growing, I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the deal.

As I\u0027ve said before, it\u0027s our job to educate the public. MAGIC IS AN ART, but most people don\u0027t know or care.

Through your patronage, you\u0027ll be able to visit these conventions and meet magicians vicariously, so get in on the action! Not to mention, there are really talented, knowledgable magicians in places I wouldn\u0027t normally visit, so every dollar you spend, gets you closer to hearing episodes with some of the more elusive, underground experts.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBetter Equipment\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e:\u00a0Come on.

So with your patronage, I can upgrade and add microphones (so the guest has their own mic), sound dampening equipment (less noise interference), higher tech software, etc. to make the show sound even better!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePodcast Merch\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e: All the cool people are doing it.
