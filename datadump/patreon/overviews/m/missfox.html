I perform nationally for various Burlesque productions and conventions, model consistently for several known photographers, and donate my time as a mermaid to inspire little kids and show them the power of fantasy. Sometimes I\u0027m paid for what I do, sometime I do it out of love. Whichever it is, I can\u0027t stop. I live to make pretty things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the goal of life is to live, then I want to live doing what I love- making art is all its forms and offering it to people to enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have Multiple Sclerosis, and I\u0027ll be damned if it keeps me from being an artist. It does mean that from time to time, I have extremely limited energy and can\u0027t depend on my body to hold up. This makes it hard for me to create as consistently as a lot of online artists and internet personalities- but I always bounce back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage allows me to make more beautiful art with better quality- affording good photographers, wardrobe, good paper, pencils, paint and art supplies, costumes pieces, travel options to perform in new places, freedom to donate more of my time to charities and surprise mermaid appearances, and in so many ways you can\u0027t imagine. The maintenance and upkeep of my costumes, health, and equipment is an investment, along with sturdy materials to ensure good quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work hard, and your patronage ensures that I\u0027m not struggling, but surviving and moving forward. If you enjoy any of the art I make, thank you, and thank you for supporting the arts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you enjoy my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHIS PAGE WILL RUN AS FOLLOWS:\u003cbr\u003e-Progress picture updates of all projects!\u003cbr\u003e-Speed-paint videos of new paintings/drawings on Youtube, and performance videos of new costumes when available\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCOMPLETED WORKS:\u003cbr\u003e-New costumes will be COMPLETE costume looks, and will have a photo or set to go with each, available to patrons.\u003cbr\u003e-Completed paintings will be available as prints to patrons.\u003cbr\u003e-Photo sets will be 7 images, available as exclusives to patrons of $15+.\u003cbr\u003e"
