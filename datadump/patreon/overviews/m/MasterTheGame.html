    "summary": "Thank you for viewing my Patreon account. I hope you will consider becoming a Patron. I release content consistently on my YouTube channel every Thursday at 1:00 PM Eastern, my Blog at \u003ca href=\"http://www.rpgjuce.com\"\u003ewww.rpgjuce.com\u003c/a\u003e every Friday evening, and Website about Tabletop RPGs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the things the money would go to with the Patron Account money is better video quality. An external hard drive to ensure my laptop is backed up and no loss of video content. This would keep the channel going even if something were to happen to the laptop.\u00a0A better laptop to ensure my live chats and live play videos were of good quality. My current laptop is a about 3 years old. There would also be a few cameras to give various angles of live plays at my table for videos of my games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also look at expanding my website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.rpgjuce.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.rpgjuce.com\u003c/a\u003e which I could add more bandwidth and do another podcast like the one I did a few years back. With better podcast equipment we could provide better sound quality and more content in that area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things that some have discussed is bringing some production quality to in home games. It would include commentary from players and the game master that could be edited into the game. This is something that could take a lot of time but to be done right would need multiple cameras and some time invested into editing. Many people said this would add so much to the live play experience when watching games back. If this is done we would probably be hiring out the editing process on this and that isn\u0027t cheap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the backing of my Patrons I could give you all the content you desire. I trust you will consider backing my channel as we move forward with putting out more great content and upping our quality of production ten fold. This is all stuff I love doing and would love to be able to make it even better for all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings you have helped me get.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Blue Yeti Microphone\u003cbr\u003e*3 Point Lighting Setup\u003cbr\u003e*Green Screen (still learning)\u003cbr\u003e*New Webcam\u003cbr\u003e*Sony Vegas Platinum\u003cbr\u003e*Gaming Books\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am a YouTube creator for Tabletop RPG Content. The various games I cover are Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, Pathfinder, Palladium Fantasy, Heroes Unlimited, Rifts, and Savage Worlds. Pretending to know it all isn\u0027t something I excel at but I do encourage fun and creative ways to enjoy the hobby. You can find me doing live chats about various RPG content, and doing live plays. I am known for doing a lot of community building with other channels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also started the Tabletop RPG One Shot Group on Facebook as a place for gamers to find one shot games or start one shot games. Many people have began campaigns out of this as well. The idea behind that was that a lot of people have a game they want to play but can\u0027t get their group to play. So this was the solution to that. The Tabletop RPG One Shot Group has well over 3,000 members and is continuing to grow (8/27/2015).\u003cbr\u003e",
