Along the side, you can see my monthly funding goals, and the pledges and backer rewards are below.

My recent projects include the Light \u0026amp; Shadow Trilogy, about a young orphan chosen to be a spy and assassin at a royal court; the Novum Trilogy, about a genetic engineering project gone wrong; and the Dragon Corps series (under pen name Michaela Kendrick), about an elite military unit in a distant future.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e As you may know if you\u0027ve been following me on Facebook, I was recently able to start writing full time. This has been absolutely fantastic, but much of the writing I\u0027ve been doing has not been for \u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e projects. Having a steady income each month devoted to working on my own projects means that I get to spend more time on the stories and worlds that I love, and it means that I get to bring those stories to you more quickly. It means that there\u0027s no chance of missing new books because Facebook (or Amazon, or Twitter) has changed its algorithms and you aren\u0027t seeing updates. It means you get ebooks delivered right to your inbox in your preferred format, with bonus short stories and other cool freebies!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat sort of cool freebies are we talking about? \u003c/strong\u003eCheck out the backer rewards below - and if you don\u0027t see something you\u0027d like, shoot me an email or a Facebook message with your suggestion!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I working on right now?\u003c/strong\u003e In no particular order, I\u0027m working on the Dragon Corps series (a set of standalone Science Fiction Romances), the story for a video game called City of the Shroud, the Yeshuhain Chronicles, the Novum Trilogy, a book about nuns in space (not actually a joke), and a possible foray into contemporary romance (a la Susanna Kearsley) and historical romance.
