Yeah, I know, I know, there\u0027s a million of those, but there\u0027s a reason for it: there are far too many people out there who, due to either dishonesty or stupidity (or both!), are actively working to harm science, and make sure the next generation is even dumber than the current one. I\u0027m doing my part by educating kids in my professional life, and by making videos in my spare time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause making high quality videos involves some expenses, and I want the quality of my videos to improve, AND because I haven\u0027t chosen a career that involves swimming in cash, any donations will be greatly appreciated."
