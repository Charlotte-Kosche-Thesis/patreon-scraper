    "summary": "Hello friends and blog readers! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks so much for checking out my Patreon page. This is a new adventure for me but I am excited to tell you about it and offer you all the opportunity to be a part of my vision in some small way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe prompt here is to tell your Patron\u0027s why they should pledge to you...but I struggle with that for a couple of reasons. First of all because I already have so much support from you all. Simply by being a faithful follower of my blog and my writing, you all have shown so much love and support. But secondly because this concept of asking for financial backing is something I have never liked to do and something I have . But I have realized recently that I have found so much identity in my ability to be independent, and to always make a way for myself. And that is exactly what I have done my whole life. BUT this... The pursuit of my writing... is an area that God is truly humbling me in and teaching me that if I want to make it is a writer, I won\u0027t be able to do it alone anymore. I will need the help of others, who believe in what I do, who see the ways that God is using it, and who want to be a part of it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Backstory\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u2019s a bit of the back story. Two years ago over coffee with one of my friends I was asked, \u201cIf you could do just one thing for the rest of your life, what would that be?\u201d When my friend asked me that question, I really didn\u2019t know. I was in a time of life where I was really seeking God for direction. I had been making a living as a professional musician/music teacher for the previous five years and though it was fulfilling, I had always felt like there was more to my calling than I had tapped into. I went home that night and quite honestly forgot about our discussion. The next morning however, I woke up, sat straight up in my bed, as if a light bulb had come on, and said \u201cI would write.\u201d This was one of those rare moments in my life where I felt like God\u2019s voice and direction was so clear it almost seemed audible and I knew in that moment that God was calling me to pursue my writing in a more serious and intentional way. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLiterally that day I re-designed my previously personal and semi-private blog site into a site where I could write more publicly. I wrote several posts right away that had a significant response...and then about a month later wrote a post called \u003cem\u003eKeeping Sex Complicated\u003c/em\u003e that went viral. Within 24 hours after posting it I had tens of thousands of visitors on my blog and had reached an audience that spanned over thirty nations. That was the beginning of a crazy journey. Since then I have written several articles that have far surpassed the reach of that article and I now have a monthly readership that far exceeds anything that I could have ever predicted when I started this blog. I have received hundreds of messages/comments from readers over the past 2 years that have been a constant reminder of the extent to which people\u2019s lives are being impacted...and a reminder of why I do what I do. I don\u2019t say that to boost my ego but merely to explain that God has been using my blog in a way that I could have never made happen myself. And I am beyond humbled. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Vision\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I am in a place of life where I feel like God is calling me to move forward with it....but the hard thing about moving forward with writing is it is not exactly a lucrative business in the beginning stages. Over the past 2 years I have still been teaching music full time while writing the blog...though on average I put in about 10-15 hours a week writing/working on the blog/responding to messages, etc. I am in a place where I want to be able to give more time to my blog and to be putting out more material. In order to do that I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt this point I give everything I write out for free. The only material I get paid for is some of my freelance work for outside magazines...and a very small amount from advertising on my blog. Some bloggers/sites charge for their content which is something I never want to have to do. My plan is to continue to give it away for free...but to also give you, my readers, the chance to help make it possible for me to not only continue to get more regular material out to you but also to move forward in my vision for this blog. The hope is that through the help of you all through patreon, I will be able to devote more time to the blog and to my writing such as my first print book, Ebooks, and eventually a quarterly magazine, which will prayerfully eventually eliminate my need for patreon. I am also in the beginning stages of booking speaking gigs so my personal goal by next year is to be full time with my speaking and writing. My music will always play a part in both.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy vision for Forte-E-Bello is for it to be a community where women (and men) can be encouraged, challenged, and inspired, not simply through the articles but through knowing that they are not alone in their battle, struggles, pain, and joy. I will continue to write on the topics of life, love, faith and justice on the blog and also have plans to write my first Ebook and print book if time and money permits, as well as a quarterly print magazine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so so much for taking the time to read and check out my patreon site. I look forward to this potential partnership with you all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
