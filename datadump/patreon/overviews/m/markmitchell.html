    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBurial 2\u003c/em\u003e addresses issues of mass incarceration and prison reform; my sculptures are intended as a means to dismantle white supremacy.\u003c/strong\u003e Combining fine dressmaking and millinery techniques with text, my hand-sewn work tells stories, mourns, and memorializes, often using tropes of funeral traditions. The completed group of a dozen or more sculptures will serve as an activating window into mass incarceration and its devastating effects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i201/m3warlord/IMG_0429.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a gay male artist with HIV, I have long been involved in liberation struggle. But my activation to issues of mass incarceration deepened after \u003cstrong\u003ea friend\u2019s 21-year-old twins \u2013 young men I knew as children \u2013 were both incarcerated\u003c/strong\u003e, separating them for eleven years. Inspired by this family\u0027s struggle, \u003cem\u003eBurial 2\u003c/em\u003e aspires to address our current state of mass incarceration. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i201/m3warlord/IMG_0473.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI exhibited my last group of sculptures in 2013. The original \u003cem\u003eBurial\u003c/em\u003e dealt with issues of mortality and mourning through burial garments and containers. (It also spawned an award-winning \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/77758138\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edocumentary short\u003c/a\u003e.) Inspired by my personal experience with the twins, as well as the breathtakingly toxic news of the racial climate in our country and my deepening relationships with black friends and peers, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBurial 2\u003c/em\u003e mixes mourning with activism.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy research into prisons-for-profit, solitary confinement, and onerous legal financial obligations, framed by my experiences sending phone credits and postage to the twins, has awakened me to the vast insidiousness of mass incarceration. \u003cstrong\u003eThe world needs propaganda for revolutionary change. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work proposes that power relations have largely remained the same since the founding of our country, only taken on different forms. Governments and for-profit prisons exploit our black and brown brethren as products and labor alike. An unbroken line through U.S. history connects slavery and mass incarceration to stolen labor, murder, abuse, and intimidation. \u003cstrong\u003eWe who benefit from this unacceptable tradition are responsible for dismantling it.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i201/m3warlord/IMG_1127.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI limit myself to hand-sewing (no machines) for construction as well as detailing, and use only biodegradable materials to keep the work of \u003cem\u003eBurial 2\u003c/em\u003e as honest and pure as possible. Executing each piece demands tremendous physical and emotional resources, but \u003cstrong\u003emy days invested in creating these objects pale compared to the twins\u0027 sentences.\u003c/strong\u003e Likewise, the fine materials (silk, leather, wool) and high-end sewing techniques highlight issues of economic disparity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy techniques are based on more than 40 years devoted to studying vintage clothing and costume, fine sewing, \u003cem\u003ehaute couture\u003c/em\u003e, and millinery. I am at my creative peak, and \u003cem\u003eBurial 2\u003c/em\u003e has taken good shape since work on the sculptures begun in January 2015. Four pieces are complete and ready to show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i201/m3warlord/IMG_1272.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI estimate that \u003cem\u003eBurial 2\u003c/em\u003e will require between two and three more years to complete, and \u003cstrong\u003eyour patronage will allow me to fully realize it.\u003c/strong\u003e In addition, your support would enable me to take advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to show my work in a solo exhibition in Beirut, Lebanon in November 2016, by defraying shipping and travel expenses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i201/m3warlord/IMG_1271.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBurial 2\u003c/em\u003e has been supported and recognized by The New Foundation Seattle with a research and production residency in 2015, and by the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art with the prestigious CEL residency in 2016.\u00a0 I was a 2015 finalist for the Neddy Artist Award at Cornish College of the Arts.\u00a0 I will be sharing\u00a0 work-in-progress from \u003cem\u003eBurial 2\u003c/em\u003e this summer in an open studio residency at Seattle\u0027s Municipal Gallery as part of their \u003cem\u003eSeattle Presents\u003c/em\u003e series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i201/m3warlord/IMG_9984.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
