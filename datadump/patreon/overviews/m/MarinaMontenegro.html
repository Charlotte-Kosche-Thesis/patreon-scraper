My poems have appeared in various magazines during that time. In 2015, I founded Writing the Words blog to do my best to give back to the writing community. I post writing advice, free promotions for writers, and answer any questions writers may have. Writing has been my dream since I was five, my goal since I was 15, and my profession since I was 20. I hope my journey as a writer continues for many more years to come.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support. \u0026lt;3 I wish you all the best in the world.\u00a0"
