When Michai\u00a0was 20 months old I took him to his 1st symphony. He saw Gustavo Dudamel conduct and he told us that he wanted to be a conductor. Every day he begged us to take him to the symphony and would spend hours a day listening to classical music, conducting, watching videos on conductors and composers.\u00a0 At the age of two, he would sit through two-three hour-long symphonies in complete\u00a0rapture. He began begging us for a violin and lessons at the age of 2.5, and although he had the attention and focus needed to learn the instrument, no teacher believed he was really ready and they were all unwilling to meet with him. At the age of two, Michai was invited to apprentice with Alex Trieger, the conductor at the Crossroads High School Symphony. Michai\u00a0would sit next to Alex and watch him rehearse with the high school students.\u00a0 Finally, at the age of 3.5 we found a violin teacher who was willing to assess him, and after witnessing how mature he was, she took him on as her student. At the age of four, Michai\u00a0was the youngest person ever accepted into the Jewish Children\u0027s choir of Los Angeles. His most recent performance with the choir was at the LA King\u0027s Game in front\u00a0of 20,000 people. At the age of five, Michai\u00a0sat down at his keyboard and began playing all the Jewish songs he learned in choir, by ear. He began begging us for piano lessons and after a month of asking we got him a teacher. Michai\u00a0practices both violin and piano and has an extraordinary\u00a0talent for playing Jewish music as well as his own compositions. As an artist myself, it is very challenging for me to support his musical journey on my own. We have no family to turn to and so we are coming to you to ask for your patronage as in days of old.\u00a0 As a thank you for your support, Michai\u00a0would like to give weekly concerts at old age homes in your name.\u00a0 Thank you for taking the time to support us."
