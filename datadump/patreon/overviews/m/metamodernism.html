We are a novel type of think tank guided by the principles of the emerging paradigm of metamodernism, which we are co-creating. We also have 5 more research streams beyond abstraction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn some ways we are aspiring in the realm of Matt Bruenig\u0027s People\u0027s Policy Project think tank startup. We want to be crowdsourced, and produce public sociology, education, and policy advocacy that serves society and delivers social justice. In order to do this, seed capital is required to cover basic\u00a0living expenses and startup costs. We want to rise above the discourse of contemporary think tanks, which are ridden with problems, and engage both elites and masses about a new abstract metanarrative. Help us do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we\u0027ve done so far with no help/funding over the past 4 years:\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.abs-tract.org\"\u003eBusiness Plan, White Paper, and Website\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- 60+ academics interested in participating\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-abs-tract-organization\"\u003e25+ blog articles\u003c/a\u003e on abstraction related to topics (AI, society, cognitive mapping, intelligence, skepticism, political polarization, institutional racism, journalism, think tanks, and more)\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbiFAd2cw-Zbx2i6NKK5xNgcL4vK8ja6c\"\u003e25+ artistic short film webisodes\u003c/a\u003e/ clips (part of an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.abs-tract.org/art-film\"\u003eexperimental film\u003c/a\u003e to promote abstraction and make fun of ab-gimmicks)\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.abs-tract.org/podcast\"\u003e5 podcasts of critical political commentary\u003c/a\u003e (Chilluminati Chat).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eESSENTIAL VALUE PROPOSITION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eTATO\u0027s essential value proposition is found in the concept and special applications of \"abstraction,\" a manifold term differentiated across and within many fields, including math, computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and social theory. Such a vast methodological synthesis is resistant to summary, and is detailed within this Business Plan. Abstraction is generally defined as a conceptual process of complexity reduction that highlights the essential properties or first principles of a given object or idea. Given the wide range of expressions, from a shorthand for critical thinking to an integral process of knowledge production, the utility of abstraction cannot be understated. However, as the term \u0027abstract\u0027 is highly equivocal, TATO provides the necessary depth and insight to make abstraction more accessible and relevant to the public and specialists alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMISSION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur broad mission is to establish a new consensus of superordinate knowledge to streamline and pacify globalization. TATO emphasizes the urgency and opportunity to \u0027abstract\u0027 a unified social critique in the context of the emergent paradigm of \"metamodernism,\" as a new cultural, political, scientific, and social movement representing a post-ideological, open source, globally responsive, paradox resolving, grand narrative. In this context, abstraction comes to refer to the cumulative pursuit of higher-order self-evident logic that transcends contradictory discourses and dissolves ideological conflict. Our process involves the depoliticization, demystification, and distillation of truth in order to directly confront the multifarious epistemic crises at present. A new enlightenment is already underway and is limited only by the persistence of detractors bounded by the constructed opportunism of the system. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE CENTRAL PROBLEM\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe central problem is how all-important abstract (systemic) issues such as climate change and institutional racism become obfuscated and marginalized through market forces and cognitive biases, in turn producing self-defeating abstract wars of attrition against populations and the environment. This status-quo is exacerbated by our constant crisis of epistemic authority, where public trust is eroded, the mainstream media is corrupt and misinformative, and knowledge is instrumentalized at the expense of truth. The problem is in fact overdetermined by a nexus of causal factors.  In response, we seek to simplify the meta- crises in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio in civil discourse to correct these aberrations at the root level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE META- TURN\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe prefix \"meta-\" (variously denoting change, beyond, above, etc.) has many vital uses that coalesce with the advent of metamodernity. The concepts of \u201cmetacognition\u201d (thinking about thinking) and \u201cmetanoia\u201d (to change one\u2019s mind) are central to intellectual revolution. \"Meta-analysis\u201d reveals unknown common truths across conceptually related studies, providing a \u2018big picture\u2019 perspective and quality control. The study of \"metaphysics\" as social humanism reclaims it as a \u2018philosophy of first principles,\u2019 and highlights the distinction between physical and social science. Marx\u0027s notion of \"metabolic rift\" theorizes the entropy of ecological and social systems under capitalism, granting us the necessary foresight to prevent such dehumanizing decay. As a novel enterprise, TATO aims to be the superlative \"meta-\" think tank to apply these insights, coordinating epistemic communities and solving fundamental contradictions at an abstract level. Many conventional think tanks are demonstrably partial and have been increasingly corporatized under neoliberalism, undermining their function as progenitors of objective thought. Our role is in part to compel corporate social responsibility in the marketplace of ideas, with a program of capitalist \"absolution\" as a system-wide process of truth and reconciliation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBUSINESS PLAN\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSee website to download the business plan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT THE FOUNDER\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBrent Cooper is the Founder and Executive Director of The Abs-Tract Organization. His primary training is as a political sociologist, focusing on knowledge-power dynamics and elite-mass relations. He holds a B.A. in International Relations from UBC, where he won the Mack Eastman United Nations Essay Prize and received a Graduating Student Leader Award. He subsequently earned an MSc. in Political Sociology from the London School of Economics, where he crystallized a critical worldview, and wrote a dissertation on The Zeitgeist Movement. His varied work experience includes studying renewable energy markets at the National Research Council (Canada), internships at the Simons Centre for Disarmament and the Canadian International Council, and self-employment. His time is spent on research projects for The Abs-Tract Organization.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
