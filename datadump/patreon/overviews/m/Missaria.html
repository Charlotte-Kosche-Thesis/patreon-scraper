It\u0027s taken me a lot of decision making to finally decide that this is the place for me. My name is Missa, and I am a prominent figure in the Furry Fandom as an artist. I really REALLY love rocks and crystals. Im twenty one years old and I\u0027ve been doing this now as my only occupation for a solid three years and gladly so. It\u0027s a great life being able to be self employed and a huge gratification to continue to be able to survive off my own creations to cover my life expenses :bills in general,living in North California is a bit expensive, I own a LOT of animals and weird ones at that that all need food, Car insurance, Medical Bills are necessary, eventually vet bills and a lot more when I am living independently and not just covering my current living essentials. This has always been my life dream and I continue to try to keep it possible and feasible for my remaining life and I\u0027m trying to realistically measure out the success rate, so I can continue and adapt myself and my art to reach limits I\u0027ve never even imagined to achieve with my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone has a thing, and since I was two years old, art has been my thing, and specifically drawing animals. Specifically equines being the favorite, but I also expanded my species abilities and practiced a lot with dragons and anthros. Growing up I had always been humble about it but really self aware that everyone placed me as the dominant artist nearly everywhere I went, through elementary school, all the way up to now to some extreme fans of mine. I was always that person peopel turned to when everyone knew it was time for an art related school project, haha. Also I just doodled whenever and people always just caught on to that being my particular \"thing\". (That and being the person who always had some form of weird animal in her pocket or at a football game) I\u0027m in college now, and I still have a lot of confidence in what I do because my family really supported me from the day my Grandmother realized I could produce art. Also growing up, it was between family and a constant stream of friend\u0027s support with a few bystanders giving out a kind opinion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy participation in the furry community didn\u0027t ever become a part of my life until I was in highschool, but I was still drawing them even though I hadn\u0027t a clue what furries were. I started drawing werewolves in elementary school and as I got older I got more aware of anatomy and started playing with the human form and other species in the same manner a werewolf\u0027s anatomy may. Before long, someone or a few asked me if I was a furry. I was basically like...no, that doesn\u0027t ring a bell. At some point a friend turned me on to a furry chat site because he thought I could relate to them in a way because I already had a Egyptian Arabian mare sona, you all know as Missaria. I always had an extremely spiritual appreciation and attachment to horses and I made myself a representative feral horse character because I really didn\u0027t like drawing humans at the time. (I love that shit now :333) \u00a0Also, I was known and requested to make representative horse\u0027s for people in my life to vent through and tell stories with. Before long though, I officially understood what it actually entailed to be a \u0027furry\u0027 and from there I\u0027ve been just coasting happily through life with a tail on. Life is good. I\u0027ve never been more comfortable and happy in my life now that I know what I\u0027m really good at and enjoy doing simultaneously. All the while I can do it while cuddling my babs at home\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve actually been in the art business most of my life technically, getting paid under the table for side work from random people growing up. Like literally all the time. I\u0027d get art trades for some cool items too for doing pet portraits and such. I first got my digital art pad for my graduation form my other set of grandparents when I was 17. I practiced with it for over a year doing free work for people int he chat site. We were honestly a massive family and as dramatic as it got sometimes it was all just fricking great, and a pleasure working for them. When I turned 18, I finally decided after a lot of people henpecking me to do so, that I would start actually marketing my artwork. I got a paypal, and I went directly to the chatsite and the furry corner of Facebook. I found a lot of people were interested in what I did and from the very first post offering work I\u0027ve been constantly getting a steady flow of work. It doesn\u0027t hurt to mention either that I have over 1400 followers on FA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI keep the information of my to-do list on the front of my FurAffinity page. Since then I have had zero artist bewares for any commission based grievances or art related drama. I have a really great fanbase full of people who treat me really well truly.They keep me entertained, sane, and overall just really appreciative of what I have around me. I often have Facebook open for friends as well as followers in general or fans. It\u0027s also nice to be able to see them on my feed when I find the time to look at it, spend some time getting to know them, again when time allows. I really appreciate those who have brought me up and kept me here without a ripple in support. Honestly thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverall, I just want to show you all what I do here and what I\u0027m so passionate about. I want you to let me know what you want to see from me. I of course have to put my own energy into it and probably a few chips of my personality is going to break off into it as a biproduct,but overall I want to give you some say in the content you see. It gives me a chance to evolve and it gives you a chance to feel like you have a part in all of this because you truly do. I wouldn\u0027t be in such a cool situation if I didn\u0027t have my fans. I wouldn\u0027t have the means to make this page if I didn\u0027t feel you supported me for making it. The truth is, side income never hurts especially for emergencies such as medical extremes, car repairs, or a broken art tablet. I appreciate every donation you send my way, truly every dollar helps. It\u0027s what\u0027s going to keep me being able to spend time on this instead of working in retail to compensate for monetary losses.If you\u0027ve seen my Facebook you would know I\u0027m probably not an efficient sociability for being a retail worker haha. I have my more grr side of course. It comes out primarily when triggered by blatant ignorance or general stupidity that refuses to help itself, so retail is....not a genius plan in my situation. XD I prefer to draw furries anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a Patron\u0026lt;3 What does that entail?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a Patron of mine is still evolving in meaning for me and I\u0027m doing this as I go. But when I spend some more time here and learn exactly what I can do with this page and profile, you will see a lot more coming your way, especially if I can find myself with more freespace with shortened commissions lists, (recently mellowed it out) and find time for sidework that includes: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-personal creations (graphic work completely from the heart and soul, generally often pushing limits to my abilities trying to learn more and branch out while still venting energy and expression in whatever way works for the time) \u003cbr\u003e-excersizes\u003cbr\u003e-Full sheet studies (traditional/ digital)\u003cbr\u003e-character designs (I have characters that I haven\u0027t even been able to draw for literally years because I\u0027m always scrambling to fill orders. I would love to bring them to life but really truly need to get monetarily supported while attempting to finally bring them to life.)\u003cbr\u003e-Raffles\u003cbr\u003e-General Contests\u003cbr\u003e-Potential giveaways\u003cbr\u003e-Occasional Sales\u003cbr\u003e-YCH participation privileges (\"Spot holding\" or early claim, autobuy)//(Auctions will vary)\u003cbr\u003e-Gift cards for my business\u003cbr\u003e-YCH Bases (help me decide and vote on the next bases I make)\u003cbr\u003e-Streaming?

Some people choose to pay before the sketch, often loyal customers.\u003cbr\u003eAfter the sketch is completed, do NOT ask to change it. This is insurance of the work we agreed upon to the value of what you spent. (Small changes can be discussed but really avoid this. Change is not promised)\u003cbr\u003eThen comes the linework. Once you agree on linework I move onto color. Do NOT ask to change the linework after color is made. It immensely pisses off an artist x.x\u003cbr\u003eFrom there comes shading, and adjusting and all that.\u003cbr\u003eCritiques and fixes are welcome as long as it moves in the particular order.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are not happy with what you received, explain why please. If it is something fixable or that I personally agreed to and forgot, we can work it out and I\u0027ll give you what I owe you. If it was a personal mistake and you choose to go back on a certain agreement level, be it color, lineart, shading or sketch, very very rarely will I agree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are not entitled to a refund unless I completely disregarded the needs of your order. if I give you what you asked for,I cannot un-draw something and get back all the hard work and time spent on it.\u003cbr\u003eDo not ask for a refund.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf your character changes while I am working on them, unless your change is incredibly minute and easy for me to fix, you are getting the design you originally asked for. Again, I cannot go back and make up for all the work I already put into it. From there you\u0027ll either need to pay me for a new color job, or hope your character changes were small enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e****SHIT I WON\u0027T DRAW LIST****\u003cbr\u003eA lot of people don\u0027t hire me for certain things because they think I simply won\u0027t do those particular categories/fetishes.\u003cbr\u003eHonestly though I do a LOT of trollporn. I do a lot of bizarre fetishes honestly. Serious and non serious.\u003cbr\u003eNever be afraid to ask. I also changed my (shit I won\u0027t draw list)\u003cbr\u003eSome things I will totally do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVore\u003cbr\u003eStuff with my personal characters/ things/scenarios youde want to see them in.\u003cbr\u003eSize difference\u003cbr\u003eExtreme gore\u003cbr\u003eHumans\u003cbr\u003eMacros\u003cbr\u003eSneeze\u003cbr\u003eChub\u003cbr\u003eNostril fetish(jfc)\u003cbr\u003eCastration\u003cbr\u003eTransformation\u003cbr\u003eBeastiality(its art, so fuck it)\u003cbr\u003eRape\u003cbr\u003eInflation(depending on scenario)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings you should just not ask me for: \u003cbr\u003eScat\u003cbr\u003eCubs\u003cbr\u003eChunky vomit(maybe if it isn\u0027t specifically looking like brown post casserole grossness)\u003cbr\u003eExtreme Hypers\u003cbr\u003eBut for real.
