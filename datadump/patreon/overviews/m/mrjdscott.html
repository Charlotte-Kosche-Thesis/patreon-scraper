    "summary": "The Guy \u2013\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is\nJD Scott. I\u2019m a goof, man of mischief and social media enthusiast. I am also a\nTV host for HGTV, Great American Country and DIY Network. When not filming, I\nfocus a lot of attention on creating social media content and giving as much of my time as possible to the\ncharities that I support. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/kikKaGm.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Promise \u2013\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is\nimportant that everyone understands that they are NOT required to sign up for\nPatreon. This is a service strictly for those who want to be involved more and\nget some extra fancy stuff along the way. I will still be posting as usual on ALL\nmy regular social media pages. This is purely something additional for those\nwho want to support #TeamJD at the next level.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Reasons \u2013\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have\ncreated this amazing community of support online through my various social\nmedia platforms. People helping people, discussing topics and enjoying the\nentertainment I am able to provide. However, what many don\u0027t know is that maintaining\nthe current level of content takes up a large portion of what free time I have\nand incurs costs that are not covered by any other sources. Although I am involved with lots of great shows, I am not operating at the same level as\nmy brothers who have a large team of people working with them day to day. As\nsuch, this restricts the resources available to me for creating new projects I\nam interested in for myself and my followers. In this life, as status grows, so\ndo the costs and for a while now I have been trying to figure out the best way\nto subsidize these rising expenses of doing business. That is ultimately the\npurpose of this Patreon. To help bring everyone more of that content they enjoy\nseeing from me in my daily adventures. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Potential\n\u2013\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have a lot\nof wonderful ideas in the pipeline: \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTV\nshows\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eCollaboration\nvideos \n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTraveling\nworkshops on social media with Annalee Belle\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eLectures\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ePhotoshoots\n(Concept driven)\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eWeekly podcasts\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMusic\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eCharity\ninitiatives (which are the basis of my passion)\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Xqlhuyp.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs this\nconcept evolves and grows, I will improve upon the perks being offered to my\npatrons based on what we determine to be the most well received compensation.
