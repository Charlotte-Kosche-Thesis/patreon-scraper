    "summary": "As\u0027salamu Alykoum Everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI launched Andalus Online towards the end of 2016 with the intention of providing a place that addresses issues on modernity through a cosmological lens rooted in the Islamic tradition. The value of this work is a little hard to measure because its impact is intended to be at the intellectual and spiritual level. I have had the blessing of meeting and engaging with numerous people over the past few years, many of whom have been following my work since I first began writing in 2011 and have found it to be an invaluable supplementary source for their religious education. This is especially so as they go through higher education institutions, where the educational philosophy is aimed at graduating materialists who do not recognize the Sacred. I know from their feedback that this work was essential in protecting their spirituality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not attribute this to myself. It is by the grace of God that I have been placed in this position of being the means that others have sought to bridge the gap they see between what they learn in school and what they were taught were beliefs in accordance with Islam. The way I\u0027m able to do that is by also further pursuing my own education while also producing the work I put out that includes articles, videos, and a podcast through Andalus Online. To make this happen, this has to become a sustainable source of income for myself. This will help me pay the bills of my own education as well as the monthly hosting fees involved in keeping all this content available, it also allows me to get the necessary tools to make sure I improve the quality of the work that I produce, especially on the media side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make it worth your while and give something extra for your support, I reserved some exclusive material for my patrons that you can check out based on which tear you choose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod bless!\u003cbr\u003eMohamed"
