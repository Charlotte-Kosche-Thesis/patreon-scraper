    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/ffj1Ja/What_is_Patreon_zpsgxtcjvpy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAS A FAN OF MY WRITING AND VIDEOS, YOUR REGULAR FINANCIAL SUPPORT GIVES ME THE ABILITY TO FOCUS ALL MY ENERGIES ON CREATING MORE CONTENT, AND AT A HIGHER QUALITY.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lot more to add than this page. Trust me. I\u0027m an indie writer. It\u0027s what I do. (insert \"resting Muggle face\") But today, for the early adopters that most likely discovered me through my Harry Potter fanfiction on Wattpad, here\u0027s all you need to know:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that allows a\ncommunity of superfans to pledge ongoing support for as little as 25 cents a week. \u00a0I realize that doesn\u0027t seem like much, but when provided collectively, it gives an artist like me the\nability to invest in my own future and provide predictable security where fluctuating books\nsales cannot. It\u0027s 100% completely optional. All my fanfiction (which has already been written) will be\nfree forever and posted exclusively on Wattpad. This is in no way a\ntransaction. It is a recurring, complimentary donation to help fund my ability to become a full-time writer. I love to write books.  I\u0027d almost say that I \u003cem\u003eneed\u003c/em\u003e to write books. I\u0027ve never considered the money. That was never important to me, until I realized that my writing time was disappearing. \u00a0As of now, I have about 4 hours a week to devote to my passion. \u00a0And, as a full-time working dad, even counting on 4 free hours is a stretch. Your support is hugely appreciated, and my little family thanks you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s the 20th of June, and I\u0027m literally in the first days of this. \u00a0You should expect that this page will be changing frequently in the coming days, and all for the better! \u00a0This whole thing is honestly 1 part experiment, 1 part epic journey, and 5 parts faith. Over the next few weeks, I\u0027ll be rolling out higher tiers of support and explaining the individual benefits of each level, which will include special giveaways, exclusive behind-the-scenes glimpses into what I\u0027m up to, google hangouts, author materials for fellow Wattpaders, a chance to get my advice and a personal review on your writing project or book, recurring episodes of a Harry-Potter themed Puppet Show, fun collaborations, and opportunities for you to *become* a part of the writing process for my next big saga (something I\u0027ve been working on in secret for basically ever).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream series, which resembles a mix of \u003cem\u003eHarry Potter \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e, has gone nowhere for years, because I can\u0027t give it the time. At this point, I\u0027ve become a walking Maya Angelou quote - \u003cstrong\u003e\"There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\" \u003c/strong\u003eOh, the suffering I\u0027ve endured for my art! But wait, I don\u0027t have to be a starving artist, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo the patrons who are supporting me: We are kindred spirits. Come, raise your wands. This is YOUR community. I am YOUR author. Together we are going to create magic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd while I might not be the next J.K. Rowling, I ask that you remember how our dear Jo was only able to create Harry Potter and the Wizarding World because she was provided with financial assistance by the British government. To think...if she hadn\u0027t gotten the necessary funds to sustain her life...! Where would all of us be today? I\u0027d like to say I could do this without you, but in all honesty, I don\u0027t think I can. I tell stories and...that\u0027s where the story seems to be headed. My pride tells me not to step into the harsh realities of future chapters, but I have to accept that it\u0027s okay to ask for a boost from those who believe in you. So, here we go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve read my work, and if you\u0027re here because you like my writing and want to help me create more, then thank you. \u00a0I realize that I\u0027m taking a huge risk by even making this page, but oh well... I\u0027m done waiting for things to work out on their own. I\u0027ll let my readers decide for me, and launch with the hopeful words of Albus Dumbledore in my ears.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e- - - My Patron-only feed will go live in July 2017!\u003cbr\u003e- - - Find my writing here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/user/MCliffordAuthor\"\u003ehttps://www.wattpad.com/user/MCliffordAuthor\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
