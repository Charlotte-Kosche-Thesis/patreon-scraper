My name is Michael King and I write stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/free-story-table-8146070\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere\u0027s an example.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/free-story-table-8146070\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/free-story-at-8413071\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere\u0027s another.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try not to pin myself down to genre or style - I just try to be honest which, as a fiction writer, is a hard enough battle given that it\u0027s\u00a0an art of making stuff up. So, fantasy, sci-fi, horror, mystery, literary, some godly combination of all of them? Who knows what will come next. I hope you like surprises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe initial goal is getting a collection of 5 literary short stories and a fantasy novella completed. It\u0027s something of a dream of mine, and I\u0027d love to also put them up on Amazon. Of course, you get the stories at no extra cost and you always will. They\u0027ll be put up for patrons just like the freebies - as PDF, MOBI, and EPUB so that whatever format you know best, it is there for you and your digital perusal. Supporting will also help immensely with the unseen parts of writing - editing, creating a cover, and checking over the formatting for ebooks to a consistent quality. It also will be a life-changing opportunity for me to keep writing and become a better writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo find out more about the stories:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/what-are-short-8161548\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhat are the short stories about?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/what-is-novella-8161561\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhat is the novella about?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/v3lO5Ql.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other big reason I\u0027m setting up here on Patreon is community. Writing is one of those activities that, while solitary on the surface, thrives on a back-and-forth sharing, growing, and exposing of very messy notebooks. Art is messy before it becomes elegant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve found immense help from the people I\u0027ve shown my in-progress work to, and I\u0027ve improved dramatically over that time, enough to enter competitions. I\u0027d love to keep on that path and improve even further, and to extend that community cycle to discussions and feedback. And so, Patreon is a perfect comfy place to work that out as we go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIt\u0027s also common for Patreon artists to have a blog or update feed as a reward for supporters, and I\u0027ll be using that space to give a behind-the-scenes, view-from-the-studio-door look at the writing. I don\u0027t know about you, but seeing how something is done enhances the magic. To that end, I\u0027ll also be sharing what I\u0027m learning as I improve.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/aiwYekP.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re a fan of what I\u0027ve written and you\u0027d like to see more, see how it\u0027s done, see me improve, and support me in the creation of new and even more awesome stories, here is the place!\u003cbr\u003e"
