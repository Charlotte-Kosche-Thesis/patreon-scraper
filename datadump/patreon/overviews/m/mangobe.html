I want to share my songs with you and with people everywhere.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0As a small time D.I.Y. solo singer songwriter I have gone all in. I do not have a fall back and I put my everything into what I do. Without people who enjoy and actively appreciate, none of this would be possible. Without direct support and appreciation I could not make it down the road in any direction. I would not be able to afford to continue putting my all into music. I drove big trucks of all kinds for just at fourteen years of living. All I\u0027ve ever wanted to do was play music and travel. I\u0027ve enjoyed a lot of life training in both. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 The goals I am pursuing are to always be learning and improving personally, and at every aspect of my craft. I commit to inspiring and encouraging others through sharing my songs with people wherever I can. Any and all support helps me keep going. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0I write and perform and sing my owns songs full time. I tour locally, regionally, and nationally.

This will save a lot of time and money for me and make it so much more easy to get a good rhythm section for recordings and performances by giving me the tools to share with them fully composed pieces and the basic drum and bass parts that I am working from.
