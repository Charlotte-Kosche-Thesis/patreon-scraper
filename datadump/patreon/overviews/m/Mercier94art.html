    "summary": "Hello! My name is Brianna Mercier. As someone who was born tongue-tied, my main form of communication for the first 5 years of my life was restricted to drawing. Even now, 20 years later, I prefer to speak with my pictures rather than words.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe there is a special form of storytelling from illustrations and comics that can\u0027t quite be replicated through words, alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne of my goals as an artist is to move people in ways they have never been moved, before. I want to leave people speechless, at a loss for words to describe exactly what effect my work has left on them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am currently working on a short comic that experiments with emotional storytelling through minimal use of words. \"BLUE\" is about a girl struggling with depression. In my experience, my body tends to disconnect from my heart, and I feel like a robot who goes through the daily movements but can\u0027t find joy in the things I love. I can\u0027t draw, I can\u0027t listen to music, I can\u0027t create. I feel trapped in my mind and can\u0027t reach out to others for help. I want to express that in the most expressive way I can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I go through this emotional journey I hope you\u0027ll join me, and be as touched as I am through my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would rather purchase prints of my designs rather than supporting me on this website, my society6 account at \u00a0https://society6.com/mercier94_art\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!"
