Years later, it turned into something more than just a hobby. I usually focus on strategy games more than on any other genre, but I do love gaming in almost every form. I upload new content every day, typically multiple times a day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to the support of my amazing viewers, I\u0027ve been able to turn this into a livable, full time job. I love what I do and that enjoyment has not diminished at all over the years, even after making thousands of videos. However, YouTube is not the best way to make a living as a smaller creator, and ad revenue is very unreliable on top of that. Some months can be great, others not so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003ePatreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in. Patreon is a subscription system that allows you to donate a small amount each month to support the creators you enjoy (in this case - me!). By doing this you help me move away from having to rely on YouTube ad revenue, which allows me to put more effort into my content as well as not be constantly stressed about views.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon donations are completely optional and I\u0027m asking you to only pledge if you feel comfortable with it and have the means to do so. If you watch my content, you already support me in many other ways and Patreon will always be purely optional.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eGoals\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows me to specify goals and targets for funding and I will be using them to specify goals for things I didn\u0027t feel secure enough doing when relying too much on ad revenue. However, I don\u0027t want you to feel pressured to achieve these goals in any way and for that reason, I will only put in goals that can actually be realistically achieved based on the current level of pledges. I will update them over time and always keep them realistic. Feel free to make suggestions if you would like to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRewards are listed below and they all come with my deep gratitude because you are the reason I can continue doing this.\u00a0You can pledge at any tier you like and cancel at any time you want as well. If you are unable to pledge for any reason, do not worry - just the simple fact that you are watching my content supports me too! Please only pledge if you feel comfortable doing so!\u003cbr\u003e"
