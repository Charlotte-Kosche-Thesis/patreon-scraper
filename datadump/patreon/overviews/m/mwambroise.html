    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello and welcome to my Patreon page, thank you so much for\ncoming to visit! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs you can see, I am an artist \u2013 a sculptor \u2013 who works\nprimarily in the \u0027French Academic\u0027 tradition.  My works are principally focused on issues of identity, the\nbody, and the individuality and intersections of human experience.  I live in New York City. I teach at a\nuniversity in Philadelphia, at various local community arts\ninstitutions, and privately in my studio where I also run a model drawing\nsession for other artists in my community. Additionally, I work part-time in an\nart foundry.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs you might imagine, juggling so many hats is exhausting,\nand worse, leaves little time for the kind of dedicated studio practice I need\nto move into the next phase of my career. \nI have a long list of projects \u2013 bodies of work to be initiated or\ncompleted, grants to chase, calls-for-work to answer, work to be photographed, a website to be updated, and of course \u00a0\u2013 most importantly \u2013 a deep longing to dive into areas of\nexploration that are ever back-burnered in the service of keeping the lights\non.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy long-term goal has ever been to produce public works and statuary,\nportraits, commemorative memorials, and suchlike.  Unfortunately, the expenses of living in New York (and parenthood!) have, over the years, winnowed down my studio space to\na size that allows me to continue working passionately on a small scale, but does not allow\nme the time or space produce the large scale work I am trained for, or move\nforward into the areas of materials exploration I so very much want to engage\nwith.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nAs you may know, less than 5% of the artwork sold in NYC\neach year is sculpture\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 I get it \u2013 sculpture is very expensive and takes up\nlots of space; who has space to spare in New York City? Or any big city?  Perhaps I can help build your sculpture\ncollection. My longest running piece,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe\nMultitude\u003c/em\u003e, is an ever growing, multi-faceted piece, the individual elements\nof which fit beautifully on a bookshelf. \nAt a committed pledge level, one can be yours!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nThat\u2019s where you come in.\u003c/strong\u003e  If a few hundred people give me five dollars a month, I can\nnot only spend less time out of my studio making a buck, but also can begin to\nbuild a team around me \u2013 spend less time organizing, documenting, chasing\nleads, and jobbing \u2013 and more time dedicated to making sculpture and getting my work out there where you can see it in person!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
