    "summary": "I write mostly speculative fiction and am best known for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/story/35429097-the-war-of-six-crowns-the-vanished-knight\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe War of Six Crowns\u003c/a\u003e, a YA Epic Fantasy series about five teens who have to save a fantasy realm from a ruthless tyrant, all while having to deal with high school.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I\u0027m trying very hard to get exposure for my stories, which means that I\u0027m having to balance all of the costs of publishing with the fact that I more often than not have to give away my books for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first thing I want to do is to commission someone to draw a map of Tardith (the continent in which most of \u003cem\u003eThe War of Six Crowns \u003c/em\u003eis set.) Other than that, I also need to pay for covers, formatting, editing etc. for all the other books I\u0027d like to publish.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m using Patreon instead of something like, say, Kickstarter\u003c/strong\u003e because Patreon is about my patrons (See what they did there?) pledging small monthly payments instead of me trying to collect one big payment and having to do it all again the next time I publish.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is handy for me, given that I have over 20 books lined up for publishing. Running a Kickstarter for every one of them would mean I almost never do anything else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does this work? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBasically, you commit a specific amount to me for every month. This can be $1 or $1,000,000 per month. You get to decide how much money you\u0027d like to pledge. Patreon then deducts this amount at the end of the month and pays it over to me. (Check out my goals if you\u0027re interested in how I\u0027m going to use it.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also offer a wide variety of rewards in exchange for your subscription, from online hang-outs to the choice of what you\u0027d like me to work on next. You\u0027ll also get access to my patrons only feed where you\u0027ll be the first to see excerpts from my new books as well as the first to hear any news.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso, I\u0027ll think you hung the moon.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading! And thanks to everyone who\u0027s pledging their support."

In my country, I can only get ISBNs by submitting the books I publish with those numbers to our National Library. The sucky thing is that my books have to be printed in the US. Shipping those books to South Africa (where I live--now don\u0027t be jealous.) costs me at least $100 per shipment. If we get to this goal, I should be able to ship signed copies (or... you know... unsigned ones for those who don\u0027t want my terrible handwriting over your beautiful books) to competitions, reviewers etc. that I currently can\u0027t access.",

Yes, I know this sounds insane, but my creativity goes out the window if I try to type a new story directly to my computer. $15 buys me a pretty hard-cover notebook and also keeps me able to maintain a supply of ink for the fountain pen I use to rough draft. To give you an idea, I can go through a pack of six cartidges in two weeks if I\u0027m in a serious writing zone.",
