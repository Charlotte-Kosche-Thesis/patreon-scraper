But how much can science\nreally tell us about the specifics and the seemingly \u201clittle\u201d and simple things\n- such as the short and long-term effects of our thoughts and emotions on our\nphysical body from a DNA and cellular level, or how they affect our major organ\nfunction? \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy lifelong tendency toward curiosity found\nme seeking out the answers to these and other questions. To what extent does the manipulation of our emotional and mental state impact, alter, and change\nour bodies on a microscopic level? To what extent do living these states over\nan extended period of time affect our ability to live effectively and in what\nways might we have been compromising our potential for a better quality of life\nwithout even knowing it?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUsing myself as well as others as case\nstudies over the past decade and a half, I\u2019ve now come to a point where I want\nto further explore (and share!) in greater depth and detail how the nature of\nthe mind relates to the human physical body and what that means for those who\nwill begin to see and understand this relationship for themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eCan\nWe Map Physical Pains to Mental and Emotional Causes?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGiven what I have been discovering about\nthis dynamic relationship between our minds and our bodies, could it be\npossible to map out physical ailments and correlate them to our mental and\nemotional patterns? My answer is YES and this is exactly what I intend to do\nwith your support. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am creating a Body-Mind Mapping platform of how everyday life\nexperiences (such as pain, discomforts, twitches etc.) we experience now and\nthen relate to our mind experience and creation. Herein I focus on two\ndimensions:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBodily\nExperiences - \u003c/strong\u003eMapping\nhow specific experiences of pain, locations of discomfort, varying degrees of\ntwitches within and throughout the body relates to the body communicating to\nyou and trying to show you something about the impact and effect a state of\nemotion or thought pattern is having on you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBehaviours\nand Mannerisms\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 This\nalso includes facial features, posture, voice tonalities, etc. - mapping how\nfacial features, such as droopy eyes, the tendency to use your hands and arms a\ncertain way, and the slight changes in voice tonality can mirror aspects of your\nthoughts and emotions inside yourself you are not yet aware of. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u2019s\nWhere You Can Help!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI want YOU, my supporters to be part of the\ncreation process! Creating a Body-Mind Mapping platform requires a lot of case\nstudies and examples from which I build and share my perspectives on. \u003cbr\u003eAs you\nsupport me through a monthly pledge, I support you with material on how to understand your Body-Mind relationship, and how\nyou can utilize the information in becoming the best potential version of\nyourself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs we journey together, I walk you through a\nprocess of: Understanding your mind in your body, and using your body as mirror to know yourself better. The body has always communicated the truth / reality of what you\u0027re going through within, and magnificently reflects who you are and how you live without. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWon\u2019t you join me in this fascinating and\nlargely uncharted subject as we explore, uncover, and share our findings to the\nworld? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
