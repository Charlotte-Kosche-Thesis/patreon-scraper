The Mynock Podcast began with low expectations, but has blossomed into the beautiful power coupling sucking monster you see before you today.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the past year we\u0027ve had some amazing guests join us in our bombastic rants including: both Howard Brothers, the Foss Twins, Kinetic Operator, Dallas Parker, Brad Miller, and the ever elusive Pao L\u0027heaver.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve built somewhat turbulent relationships with a few of our fellow podcasters, while at the same time forging bonds that they\u0027ll be hard pressed to ever escape.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve seen several different metas come and go, bad ships become good, good ships become bad, and T-65s staying unfixed. \u00a0The Mynock Special reigned supreme for a few months before the Rooks concocted Dengaroo and Defenders assaulted everything. Nymranda ruined our fun, but that seems wholesome compared to the VCX and Fenn! (EDIT: Jeeze now what?!)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut now, we\u0027re ready to move forward...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eTROUBLE IN THE MAW\u003c/h1\u003e\nFirst I want to extend a massive heartfelt THANK YOU to everyone who has supported us and listened to us over the past year and a half. During worlds I had countless people come up to me and say how much they love the podcast. \u00a0Honestly that\u0027s why Dee and I do what we do (other than the insane narcissism); it\u0027s all for you guys.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut life has a way of catching up with you, and unfortunately the podcast has grown so time consuming for both of us that we\u0027re having some trouble keeping it afloat. The hosting fees aren\u0027t too expensive, but they do add up. \u00a0Recording gear sometimes breaks, and software becomes a bit too obsolete, which requires fixing before we can resume the quality of podcast that we have set out to give to all of you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother thing we can\u0027t stress enough is the major major major time commitment it is to this show every week.\u00a0 Dallas, Dee, and I spend quite a bit of time prepping (even if it doesn\u0027t seem like it).\u00a0 On the technical side I spend countless hours on upkeep to ensure we deliver the best quality episode EVERY WEEK!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m quoted as early on saying that I didn\u0027t want to do a Patreon. I didn\u0027t want to leech money out of a community I love, or make them think that I \"expected\" anything out of them. \u00a0Circumstances have changed a bit. This is a call for support and aid, rather than a tactless ploy to steal all your monies. \u00a0It would be fantastic if the Podcast could generate at least a small sum so that we can continue to create top notch content.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://pro.bols.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mynock_ryanphoto-1.jpg\" style=\"width: 644px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWHAT GLORIOUS LOOT!\u003c/h1\u003e\nHere is a more detailed rundown of what we\u0027ll be offering as rewards for our Patrons.\u00a0 Thank you so much for sticking with us after our initial 6 Month trial run.\u00a0 It was shaky, no doubt about that, but now we\u0027ve trimmed it down in order to really make your patron dollars count for something.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMARCH - APRIL 2018\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMYNOCK RECRUIT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSkreeee!
