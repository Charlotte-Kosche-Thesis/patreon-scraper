Here I am - Alice Spiegel, also known as MightyRaccoon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMainly I am known as a model, videogame streamer and an artist. Recently I have entered the fascinating world of cosplay and it became my dream to do it fulltime and live a hundred different lifes as the amazing characters of videogames, movies and comics. And of course not only to have fun, but to create some new level of art - to bring their stories into life, to show them from the new point of view! I think that this field is a new kind of art and I think it would be amazing for us to become a part of its history!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have noticed that the term \"art\" is very important for me? Yeah you\u0027re right! Thats because I\u0027ve been into \"art\" for years! \u003cbr\u003eAs an artist I draw a lot of game fanart, including mostly fantasy RPG games and MOBA\u0027s. They inspire me a lot, and the feedback I get makes me realize I am not the only one, who enjoys exploring and creating fantasy worlds and stories so much! Isn\u0027t that fantastic!?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy it as well, and I would be happy to provide more of artworks to people, who love them! I hope my drawings and paintings can make you happier and I will do my best for it! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay tuned, and all together we will make this world a more beautiful place! ;D \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
