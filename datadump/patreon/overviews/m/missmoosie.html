Give me any amount, and you get full access to all the SAI files for all my art from now on, and my absolute eternal gratitude for your help. These aren\u0027t exactly the most EXCLUSIVE things, but it\u0027s just a nice way you can support me if you like me that much \u0026lt;3 Also if I reach my goal of obtaining at least $1000 AUD ($784 USD) total from Patreon accumulated over the next few months (October, November and December) before January next year, all my patrons will get first exclusive access to Vlogs I intend to do while I\u0027m\u00a0overseas in Japan! You\u0027ll get to see videos I\u0027ve taken, showing you what I\u0027ve seen and you get to hear my voice! My face may not appear on Camera, but you\u0027ll get to see my hands and other random tidbits!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really would rather have a higher quantity of people support me a little bit instead of a few people supporting me with huge lump sums of money. I can make more content for everyone this way without feeling like you\u0027re not getting your money\u0027s worth. Your cash supports source (SAI) files, my general living, and all that good stuff! This will also help me pay for the medications I take, which means I\u0027ll\u00a0likely be able to draw more often without stressing too much!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much should I pledge per month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are no exclusive rewards for pledging or donating more than anyone else! You can pledge one dollar or two dollars or a thousand dollars! It\u0027s all up to you and how much you wish to support me with. Even just one dollar a month would be extremely appreciated on my end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter how much you pledge, you get access to my Patreon, which is all the source (SAI) files for pretty much everything I\u00a0post on my Tumblr! Commissions aren\u0027t usually included in this, however. I don\u0027t really like the idea of having EXCLUSIVE paid content, at least at this point in time, because I want everybody to be able to enjoy my\u00a0content equally. So i can\u0027t really convince you to support me by saying you\u0027ll get special treats, I\u00a0would just like you to support me if you feel like doing so and are interested in my SAI files and possible Vlogs from Japan if I reach my goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can I do with the SAI files I receive?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, you can\u0027t claim them as your own artwork, however, I don\u0027t mind if you use them to colour the line art as practice, or see my sketch layer to observe how I structured my piece, or even trace them to get a general structure of something or an element of something you\u0027re working on. But please, if you do anything like that, change it enough so you\u0027re not going to get accused of foul play, and \u003cstrong\u003ePLEASE \u003c/strong\u003edon\u0027t \u003cstrong\u003eONLY \u003c/strong\u003epost things that are derived from my work. This stuff gets \u003cem\u003ereally obvious\u003c/em\u003e to people online \u003cem\u003ereally fast\u003c/em\u003e and most people don\u0027t like that sort of thing. I \u003cstrong\u003ewon\u0027t \u003c/strong\u003ebe coming to defend you if you build an art blog specifically off of traced items. Even if you put in the description of your post that you used one of my SAI source files as a foundation for the piece; that\u0027s a lot better than just winging it and hoping no one will notice. Honesty goes a LONG way, and I\u0027d be interested to see peoples colourings, or just works in general that are created from my SAI files; so feel free to tag me on Tumblr if you do something like that. The only exception to this is that I am NOT ok with \"recoloured\" or \"look-alike\" characters of Moosie. Her design belongs to me, and even if you have the materials to do so, creating a \"rip off\" of her will not be considered to be acceptable under these rules.\u003cbr\u003e"
