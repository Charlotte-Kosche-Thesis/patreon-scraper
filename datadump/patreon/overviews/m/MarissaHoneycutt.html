    "summary": "My name is Marissa Honeycutt and I am an unexpected author. I didn\u0027t set out to publish my first book, The Life of Anna. I only meant to write it down to get the story out of my head. But then I started sharing it with other people and found out I wasn\u0027t the only twisted mind in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI seek to write the unexpected. I don\u0027t want to join the legions of romance novels with predictable plots (not that there\u0027s anything wrong with predictable). I want to make you cry and scream and cheer as you walk the pages with my characters. I want to dare to go \u003cem\u003ethere...\u003c/em\u003ewherever\u003cem\u003e there \u003c/em\u003eis in the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLearn more about me and my published words at\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.marissahoneycutt.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you consider supporting me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing and love interacting with my readers. My biggest joy is finding out someone likes something I wrote. I\u0027d gladly write just for feedback, but unfortunately, feedback doesn\u0027t pay the bills. Unfortunately. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strive to keep my books at a reasonable price level so as many people can read them as possible. I am an indy writer so that I can charge only a few dollars for my books, instead of $10-$20, like authors with publishers must do. But all authors have the same basic expenses, like editors and cover designers, and they must be paid. I work exclusively with individuals who are also small-businesses and by supporting me, you are supporting them as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream would be to sponsor a gathering with myself and my readers. Somewhere beautiful where we could hang out, talk about books and get to know one another. A cruise would be amazing!!  Or maybe a cabin in the woods? Maybe a hotel in New York City? Maybe all of the above! After all, dreams should be big, shouldn\u0027t they?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the Patreon website...\"For patrons, Patreon is a way to join your favorite creator\u0027s community and pay them for making the stuff you love. Instead of \u003cem\u003eliterally\u003c/em\u003e throwing money at your screen (trust us, that doesn\u2019t work), you can now pay a few bucks \u003cem\u003eper month \u003c/em\u003eor \u003cem\u003eper post\u003c/em\u003e that a creator makes.  For example, if you pay $2 per video, and the creator releases 3 videos in February, then your card gets charged a total of $6 that month.  This means the creator gets paid regularly (every time she releases something new), and you become a bonafide, real-life patron of the arts.  That\u2019s right--Imagine \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e, in a long frilly white wig, painted on a 10-foot canvas on the wall of a Victorian mansion.  And imagine your favorite creators \u003cem\u003emaking a living\u003c/em\u003e doing what they do best\u2026 because of you.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to learn more about How Patreon Works?

She doesn\u0027t seek to write any particular genre, style, or length, only\nfollowing her gut instincts and the lead of her characters. The Life of Anna\ncrosses many genre lines including erotica, suspense, psychological thriller,\nhorror, political conspiracy, paranormal, and romance. Marissa\u0027s story of Anna\nbegan with a dream about being kidnapped with Adam Savage from Mythbusters\n(Yes, really). Over the next year and a half, it morphed into the story that is\nnow known as \"The Life of Anna.\" She has also published Distorted\nHope, which is based on her kidnapped dream. Abandoned Grace was published last\nyear as a side story to The Life of Anna. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMarissa stays busy running her household,\nfending off two adorable kittens, and interacting with her readers on social\nmedia. She is a self-proclaimed geek and is striving to learn the basics of\ngraphic design. She is also actively pursuing a more natural lifestyle, which\nincludes essential oils, natural cleaning products, and whole, organic foods.\nMarissa\u0027s addictions include the Science and History Channels, anything\nchocolate mint, vintage books, cute kitty cats and laughter.\u003cbr\u003e",
