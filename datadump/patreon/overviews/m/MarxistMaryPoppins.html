    "summary": "Hi friends! 2017 has already been a long and strange year, huh? When I was visiting my family this summer I watched my step-dad jump from one rail tie to another on an abandoned train track and thought, \"That reminds me of the chimney sweeps in Mary Poppins,\" and then, \"They\u0027re amazing dancers... what could they do if they unionized?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal this year is to write songs for a musical that I\u0027ve been calling Mary Jordan: A Marxist Musical. I definitely don\u0027t want to do this alone, and I want to use it as a vehicle to highlight oft-marginalized voices. Voices that are queer, and POC, and poor and white, and differently abled, and above all else, voices of people who are struggling to come to terms with this election and its fallout. I\u0027m reaching out to people across the political spectrum: let me know if you\u0027d like to share your thoughts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubscribe if you\u0027re interested in hearing these songs as they progress! My end goal is a web series or full length film starring mostly women, POC, and poor whites/other marginalized groups. Any thoughts and comments are greatly appreciated, as this is baby\u0027s very first rodeo.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSarah\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. Where is your money going, if you choose to invest? To purchase my rompers, of course! Just kidding: my goal is to save this monthly money (whatever amount it ends up being) and use it to pay my actors as close to a minimum wage as I can. Comedy often lacks diversity because the only people available are the people who can afford to not work: I want to allow people to work AND make art at the same time. Hopefully art that is woke AF. Wake me up and call me on things if you see me falling asleep again."
