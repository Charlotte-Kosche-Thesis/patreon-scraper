    "summary": "Over the years I have worked in publishing, development (as a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,153124/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edesigner\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e) and all the while helping as a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/aug/18/games.shopping\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efreelance journalist\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. The latter came about because I wanted to impart my knowledge openly to gamers who cared about the wonderful medium that is gaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in 2009 it reached a point where I felt that \u003cstrong\u003emecha games\u003c/strong\u003e were badly misrepresented in the gaming press. With a bit of encouragement from friends who convinced me that people wanted to know more about this gaming genre, I gladly set up \u003ca href=\"http://www.mechadamashii.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMecha Damashii\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the main points I felt was utterly necessary from my experience as a freelancer was total publisher and PR department independence. This meant I have turned down multiple companies\u0027 attempts at coercing the site into controlling what I said and I how I said it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost places tend to take the access to exclusive content in the hope it will boost their readership. I have always found this dependency unsettling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I wanted to keep the advertising to a bare minimum. Resulting in only using Play Asia\u0027s affiliation program. As this is based on sales, rather than site views, it\u0027s not always helped pay for the upkeep for the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s fine and I totally understand that people should be entitled to spend their hard earned money as they see fit. However, as the years have passed and the community has grown I wanted to ensure that the site would be able to support itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still want to avoid advertising and this is when I was recommended to use Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you love mecha games \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/Cacophanus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eas much as I do\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and want to see more of the genre covered by people who know and care about it, then please donate whatever you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will be used gratefully to keep \u003ca href=\"http://www.mechadamashii.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMecha Damashii\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e going for as many years as you want it to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, your hopeful Newtype...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOllie \"\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Cacophanus/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCacophanus\u003c/a\u003e\" Barder\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEditor-In-Chief\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
