I spent twenty years writing about NASCAR, but other sports have popped up frequently in my blogs, short stories and novels.\u003cbr\u003eWhat brought me to Patreon? I could use some money. I could use a vehicle to draw attention to my books.\u003cbr\u003eI think it\u0027s fair to say I\u0027m known for my independence. I don\u0027t want restrictions on my freedom to write what I think. Patrons have the right to withhold their support any time they want, but most of my fans value my independence. That might not be the case with advertisers or corporate affiliations.\u003cbr\u003eYour support won\u0027t change my outlook. Your interests may have an effect on what subjects I explore. If you tell me to shut up, I won\u0027t, but I may take it under advisement. I promise I\u0027ll listen\u003cbr\u003eYour support might get me out more. I might be able to afford to do more writing on site.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m anxious to see what, if anything, develops.\u003cbr\u003eSamuel Johnson said, \"None but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money.\"\u003cbr\u003eThus do I hope to be less a blockhead."
