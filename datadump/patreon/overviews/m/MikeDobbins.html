I\u0027ve created a Patreon page where people who appreciate creativity, originality, and the arts can support me. \u00a0This page wouldn\u0027t exist without YOU, the reader, so thank you for stopping by. \u00a0After all, while it brings me great joy to write, this joy is easily surpassed when others enjoy what I write. \u00a0"
