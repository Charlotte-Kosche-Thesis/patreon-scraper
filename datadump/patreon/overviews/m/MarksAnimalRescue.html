     "about": "A Sun Sentinel article written in April, 2015 exposed some grim statistics on euthanasia at Broward County animal shelters. 52% of all the animals received are said to be put down. An average of nearly 30,000 animals are killed each year and the numbers continue to rise. Even worse, if you look at the statistics country wide, there are millions of healthy animals put down every year. So, why are there so many shelter animals? Failure to spay and neuter, abandonment, the surrendering of pets, animals cast away to the streets as disposable meaningless lives, just to name a few.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has become very evident that more help is needed to reform our outdated system on how we the public view and treat our animal population. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor some the response is \u201coh well\u2026 it is just an animal\u201d. Others are just mean and cruel and contribute to the problem. For those that do care, WE have to give these poor souls a voice that is heard. We have to speak out every day, until those in power realize and take seriously, that our little furry friends need our protection and our support. Many of these poor souls have died needlessly, for lack of any sort of care. Just the simple touch of a human hand can make such a difference to an animal in pain. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe ask you now, to open your hearts, minds and hands to our mission of love, mercy and hope.\u003cbr\u003e",
