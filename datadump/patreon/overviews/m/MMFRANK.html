    "summary": "I\u0027m Currently a stay at home boyfriend for my partner who is in the military so I got a lot of time on my hands. \u00a0I love D\u0026amp;D, video games, anime, and Tv shows, I\u0027m very interested in becoming an actor as well! \u00a0Favorite anime\u0027s are one piece, Bleach, Code Geass, Death Note, Youjo Senki, Overlord and a few other darker ones. \u00a0I\u0027m also 19 years old. \u00a0I originally created the world which I plan on focusing on in freshmen year of high school. \u00a0This includes extensive lore and characters already created, just never got around to writing any of the story I wanted. \u00a0Then I started using the world, Teth, for a fantasy D\u0026amp;D styled game which helped me flush the world out to become an actual living and breathing creation. \u00a0A few members that have played are already working on their own books which focus around the characters they played inside Teth which have become part of official cannon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur main focus will be on a boy names Mathews residing inside Teth\u0027s most powerful Empire, The Imperium.  This country resides on the Continent of Saragoth which is quite unique because of the Collage of Mag\u00ed. \u00a0An organization created to guide and protect those that can use powerful magic from others less endowed who are fearful and resentful. \u00a0Inside the Imperium it is required that anyone with a certain aptitude for magic must attend 4 years with the nearest Collage to ensure the safety of its citizens. \u00a0The story will focus on his adventures in the first year of school as an apprentice. \u00a0(Please note that there are scenes that may be a tad violent and that even tho it may seem like a children book it has a much darker and game of thrones ish theme) \u00a0Free bit of lore other than what was written is that Teth is a super planet and far far bigger than Earth which would make The Imperium about the size of the continent of Africa, and it\u0027s only one country!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI might also post fan fiction which will be free as well as short stories that will be a certain length otherwise they too will be free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the subject above Please!!!! Be aware all finished works will be accessible for free online (if it does get prints that will cost) \u00a0So this is for pure support and is not necessary however!!!! \u00a0I will only be releasing full books/Compilation of short stories so supporting me just gets you everything early!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(please do not at any point think this is based off, near or around the harry potter series. \u00a0The fact is I\u0027ve never actually read those books or seen all the movies, no hate please (\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;) \u00a0)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso if you ever want to try out my game world please send me a message and you can explore Teth 100 years before the main story line in the time of Areon the God Speaker. (Kaizuka Areon)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent List of Known books/stories:\u003cbr\u003eBrecker\u0027s Equality\u003cbr\u003eThe Mathew Chronicles, Book 1: Mathew and The Arcona\u003cbr\u003eBook Of Species by Ranmo K Delph\u003cbr\u003e(short story) Fixing Problems\u003cbr\u003e"
