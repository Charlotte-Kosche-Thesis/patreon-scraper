I studied Medicine at Xavier University School of Medicine. I\u0027m currently living in Toronto, Canada. I really enjoy Arts and Sciences. My field of interest is Neuroscience. Particularly the specialties of Psychiatry, Neurology, and Neurosurgery. One of my many passions is video \u0026amp; sound editing. So I decided to amalgamate my interest and passion and create a podcast to share with you. I truly enjoy making these, and hope you can help me with this endeavor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s28.postimg.org/dxgll7wv1/Matter_banner_3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating a podcast is hard work. Tons of research goes into all my \npodcasts. I triple check all my sources. I have other fellow physicians and scientists go over my information. And try to keep up with the latest Neuroscience news. Overall, I\u0027d say each podcast takes 30 to 50 hours to make. On top of this, I have a full \ntime job. But I do it because I\u0027m passionate about this. The funds raised for What\u0027s the Matter will go into equipment, software, research, writing, recording and editing. Every dollar given to this podcast\nfrees me up a little more to focus on making the best content I can.\u003cbr\u003e"
