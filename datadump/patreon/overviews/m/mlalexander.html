At times I also delve into other subjects as well such as emotion, philosophy, morality, science fiction and fantasy. Some\u00a0stories I create are straightforward pure erotica (which I always try to do to the\u00a0same high standard as my other tales) and I try to be clear at the start of each story just what you are reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am here on Patreon to give people a chance to read my stories and erotica and to gain their support so that I can devote more time and attention to writing and perfecting my craft. A great deal of the works that will be posted on Patreon will be exclusively available just on the site; a special thank you to all of you on here supporting me in my endeavours. I see Patreon as a virtual shelf to publish some of my works on, so that my fans can read and revisit them at any time of their choosing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment my Patreon is a work-in-progress so I do ask my Patreons to please have patience with me as I sort out a number of projects I have been worked on in the background. I will be publishing a number of works over the next couple of months so you will have something to enjoy as I get my projects in order.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy future plans are to\u00a0release two to three standalone stories or chapters in my ongoing series each month and will keep you, my Patreons, as up to date with my release schedule as possible so you are aware of what to expect coming out in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I hope to realise my ultimate goal to take on writing full time (and devote myself to keeping the future hubby as happy as a clam).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are currently three tiers of patronage which my supporters can subscribe to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSilver Tier ($1 a month)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the\u00a0Silver Tier\u00a0($1 a month) you will get access to various short one-off erotic and romantic stories, updates on the projects I am working on and sneak peaks of future works. You will also get access to the various erotic artwork pieces assorted with these stories.
