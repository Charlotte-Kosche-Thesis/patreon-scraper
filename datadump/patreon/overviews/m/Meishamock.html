I\u0027m a strong cosplayer, festival-goer, raver and just playful nerd.

When I was in 5th grade I used to wear a wolf tail to school EVERY day. I told everyone it was real and I was a wolf. Some kids believed me, some thought it was cool and some thought I was one weird wild child. At some point, in the middle of the school year, my teacher had to have a meeting with my parents. She talked about how I would be bullied if I wore a tail and I just couldn\u0027t survive in the real world like that. Little did she know that years later I would flourish wearing tails and playing \"dress up\". The wolf child in me stills lives on!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Why Support you on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 First, you don\u0027t have to support my Patreon!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ll still be posting lots and lots on my Social Media but, Patreon is for people that want even more stuff! Patreon would really help me with my business, and give me more time to focusing on creating cosplays for you all to see! I want to get to the point where I can fully support myself with my cosplay and festival work. My main goal right now is to get more products into my store for people to buy! I want to get nerd- inspired rave clothing into the store and with your help I can produce more and more. I can also make more elaborate cosplays.
