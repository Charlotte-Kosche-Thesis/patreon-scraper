    "summary": "Films are an integral part of all our lives. I, like you, adore movies. \nThey are a continuous source of joy and inspiration; from a very young, \nAlec, sat wide-eyed on his father\u0027s sofa, watching Star Wars for the \nfirst time, to this moment. I love thinking about and debating movies \nand want to share that with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis channel is a one-man \noperation (plus a lot of support from family and friends). I juggle this \nwith scraping together money to eat and pay the rent, having recently moved to \nSweden from the UK. As this channel is still small, the money made from \nGoogle Ad revenue is a minuscule amount and doesn\u0027t cover the time and \nenergy put into making these videos. Forming ideas, research, preparing \ntreatments, filming, editing, promotion. All of this requires \nsubstantial resources, which I do not have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you \ncome in, I need your help. If you can give even a few dollars a month it\n would be an enormous help! It will keep me fed and motivated and most \nimportantly, improve the quality of the videos. I started out with an \nidea, an old pc, even older editing software and a single microphone \nbalanced on some table coasters. Things have come a long way since then, \nbut there is still some way to go. Even being able to purchase some \nclose microphones will vastly improve the sound quality of future \nreviews. Being able to buy my own camera will mean my brother can \nfinally have his returned to him. I have lofty ambitions in life and I \nwant you to be a part of it. With your help I aim to release four movie \nrelated videos every single month. Final Verdict Film Reviews, Greatest Film Lists for every genre, Screen Justice Warrior Rants, Film Jury Discussions, Order Order! Film Rankings and much more. Perhaps in the future, even a new and improved Movie Trial video series! With actual video this time! If you can contribute, I really \nappreciate it and there will be some fun bonuses for you on Patreon as \nan incentive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_H-esDJCx4?list=PLECbK_JYKh2eZOiMsvXCBjEWbzlfobI8Q\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n want to thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen for watching the channel and \nsupporting me. I hope to keep this hobby going as long as I am willing \nand able and your help strengthens my resolve. Let\u0027s have fun and \ntalk movies! I\u0027ve been Smart Alec, goodbye for now \u0026amp; until next time, friends!"
