    "summary": "Hi! My name\u0027s Henry and I run \u003ca href=\"http://emeraldotter.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea tumblr art blog\u003c/a\u003e, where I post two pictures a day, everyday. I wanted to start a Patreon so I can create art that\u0027s more personalized for select clients who are especially interested in my art and other content. If you pledge to this Patreon, you will be getting exclusive, personalized content from me to you. This content includes access to lottery art, exclusive commissions, concept art, and monthly pin-up sketches. For more information on the benefits of becoming a patron, please see the different tier rewards on the sidebar! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll art from requests, lotteries, and pin-ups are exclusive to Patreon only! Streaming art is not. I\u2019ll only post request or lottery art on my public blog if you give me permission. Pin-ups will always be exclusive to Patreon, since my art blog does not feature any suggestive content, though the pin-ups are only 16+ in rating (no nudity or explicit sexual content.) I\u0027m also going to use Patreon to show off concept work for a potential web comic, if there\u0027s enough interest. I\u2019m new to Patreon, so these rewards and conditions may be subject to change. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll definitely let you know. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThings will work on a monthly basis. For monthly rewards, I will contact you on the first of the month for your preferences in your art reward if you are an eligible patron. Don\u0027t feel like you need to know what you want immediately, however! I will have your rewards to you by the second half of the month.\u00a0Pin-ups will have polling open for eligible patrons throughout the month before they come out, in the beginning of the month. I will hold an art lottery in the middle of each month, and everyone who pledges is eligible. I am committed to open and prompt communication, so if there are any issues with the schedule I will let you know! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m a recent college graduate who\u0027s recently enrolled in a Masters of Science program. Over the past year, I\u0027ve had to put my career plans on hold due to intense illness that left me mostly bedridden for over three months. I am improving, but things are still difficult for me. However, I don\u0027t want that to define me! I want to work! All Patreon money goes toward my medical expenses and graduate school. I have been doing commission work for the past year and many people can attest to my work ethic. Art is very important to me; I\u0027ve been running my digital drawing blog since 2012, and I want to use my skill-set in a way that is meaningful to me as well as others. If you have any questions for me, please do not hesitate to contact me at either my art blog or through Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks so much for your consideration! I really appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e"
