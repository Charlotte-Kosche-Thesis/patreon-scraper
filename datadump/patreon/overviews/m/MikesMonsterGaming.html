The support\nthat you give to the channel seriously means a lot and it\u2019s amazing to me that\nyou even want to watch my content at all so thank you for being a part of my\ncommunity and being a Fellow Monster Gamer. Its seriously unreal that anyone\nwould want to bother watching my content at all let alone give me any amount of\nsupport so from the bottom of my heart, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut for those that don\u0027t know who I am whats up guys Mike\nhere and I run a Youtube and Twitch channel known as Mike\u0027s Monster Gaming. I\ndo a lot of Let\u0027s Plays, unboxings, vlogs, reactions, thoughts, live streams\nand more to entertain the masses. Youtube and Twitch have allowed me to make so\nmany amazing friends and be able to do so many amazing things and leave a\npositive impact on a lot of people and I want to be able to do more of it.  Mike\u0027s Monster Gaming is also the home of The\nMMG Perspective where I talk about some of my favorite and not so favorite\nretro games and games that are recent. As you can imagine video making and live\nstreaming is a lot of work. For the MMG Perspective alone I am writing out a\nscript, trying not to screw up saying it on camera or recording, and then\ntrying to edit and piece together a decent review/perspective of the titles that\nI talk about. I am no artist by any means either I honestly cannot draw to save\nmy life so all of the artwork and channel assets that you see on the channel\nand live streams are all done by professional and talented artists and thats\njust one side of the expenses that comes into play when it comes to running my\ngaming channel. There is the cost of electricity, gaming consoles, capture\ncards, green screen, cameras, microphones, audio mixer, editing software,\ncomputer parts so it can handle all of the other equipment and many more. Not\nto mention all of the bills I have to pay and keeping myself fed and being able\nto have a roof over my head. And sadly Youtube isn\u0027t very friendly to Gaming\nchannels and I barely make anything from that in terms of ad revenue. Most of\nmy funding/support comes from Twitch Subscriptions whether paid or for free\nthrough Amazon Prime, donating money through streamlabs or donating bits during\ntwitch streams, buying T Shirts from my Merchandise store, and now Patreon as\nwell.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nSo why the heck are you making a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am making a Patreon for quite a few reasons. For one it\u2019s\nanother way for you guys to choose to support me and what I do if you so\nchoose. Second, things are pretty rough for me outside of YouTube and Twitch,\nfor me and a lot of other creators out there we all have our battles that we\nface off the camera in terms of financial struggles whether its bills or\notherwise and I am no different so it would seriously help me out a lot. But\nthe most important reason why I am making this Patreon is the fact that I want\nto make YouTube and Twitch a full time job so I can continue to entertain you\nguys and bring positivity to this world and I simply cannot do it alone and I\nneed your help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBetween my 9 to 5 job, taking care of things at home,\nrelationships, bills, running NYC\u2019s premiere gaming group Switch \u0026amp; Play\nNYC, and other hurdles that I have to face on a daily basis, it is extremely\nhard to be able to have the time to create content for you guys whether it is\nYoutube or Twitch. Luckily Live Stream Let\u0027s Plays allow me to try to have some\nconsistent content on both platforms for all of you to enjoy and having the\naudience be part of the content that I make. With your help I can be able to do\nYoutube and Twitch full time and be able to give you guys biweekly or monthly\nMMG Perspective Videos instead of just putting them out there when I can and\nwhen they are finished. It would also allow me to do some charity live streams\nwhere we work together to raise money for important world issues and spread\nsome love and support to those that can\u0027t do that for themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nSo What will I get if I decide to support you on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst of all regardless of if you decide to choose to support\nme on here you have my eternal thanks for even considering to support me on\nthis platform. But in terms of Patreon Perks there are quite a lot depending on\nhow much you can support me with every month.
