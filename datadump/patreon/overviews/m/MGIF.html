Apart from when it\u0027s stressful, or exhausting, or terrifying, of course. That said, it\u0027s also exciting and rewarding, except for when it\u0027s lonely, or really, really difficult, or infuriating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Is This Man Talking To Me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/540b2ce1e4b042802a34d426/t/566165aee4b0af254262ec24/1449223601629/?format=500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Gareth, (or GaryDooton to many - don\u0027t ask). I\u0027m a full time, self employed, freelance portrait photographer. I\u0027ve been a long time contributor to GamesTM Magazine as well as other publications and I really flipping love taking photos.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.garethdutton.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYou can see some of them here\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also take photographs and write for the excellent, delightful videogames website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://midnightresistance.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMidnight Resistance\u003c/a\u003e.

It was created in conjunction with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/davehurricane\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDavid Woollard\u003c/a\u003e, an extraordinary web developer without whose input this would not have been even remotely possible.\u00a0Without David, it would\nbe like writing words and printing photos without any paper to put them on, which would\nbe very stupid indeed. He is the gallery and I am hanging my art stuff inside him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was just the beginning. We are now into\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://garethdutton.com/mgif\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSeries Two\u003c/a\u003e of MGIF, where each chapter is an in-depth, intimate look at people working within the games industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Are You Doing This\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/540b2ce1e4b042802a34d426/t/556acc30e4b07145d3841195/1433062455968/Aubrey-10.jpg?format=1000w\u0026amp;storage=local\" style=\"width: 668px;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am creating something different to most current games writing and reportage: I am a portrait photographer, so what I\u0027m doing here is creating portraits of and documenting people who all happen to be involved with the games industry. I\u0027m giving the idea of a portrait a broader perspective, however, by combining writing, an interview podcast AND photography to create something unique and refreshing. By focusing on the people behind the games, I\u0027m looking at the games industry from an angle that is rarely considered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do this by separating the creators from their games. By combining photography, writing and podcasting, I can create a comprehensive portrait of a person beyond a single photograph.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/540b2ce1e4b042802a34d426/t/55520605e4b0b1995ca9e224/1431438897418/?format=1000w\u0026amp;storage=local\" style=\"width: 620px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan is to make series two of Making Games Is Fun an ongoing story, where each chapter looks at a different developer, be it a single, bedroom coder, a tiny team of hopefuls, or an individual person in a large company. I have a broad selection of volunteers on the list already, all of whom have agreed to be involved, including some very prominent people and companies (ALL TOP SECRET RIGHT NOW).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing Patreon to fund this means that I am not beholden to an editor and I can be totally and independently in control of what,\u00a0who and how. The people involved are not on their guard because I\u0027m not press, I\u0027m just me. That way, you get to find out about the person and not the media trained face of a company. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will My Patreon Cash Pay For?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI believe that Patreon should be about total transparency, so let me break down for you my working week as a freelancer:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-----\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a house husband and dad, I have three days a week to work - Tuesday to Thursday. This is when I either work on processing images from home or I carry out paid commissions that I\u0027ve previously booked in. My working days last from however long it takes to get my daughter into nursery and get back home until 5pm\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWeekends are a wildcard, and I tend to attempt to sneak off and fit some stuff in as and when possible. In fact, it\u0027s Sunday right now as I escape upstairs to edit and tweak this Patreon text! I also sometimes get a chance to sneak some work in after 9pm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-----\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy taking on such a huge body of ongoing work, it has to come second to seeking out other paid work; each chapter in series two takes around 50 to 60 hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis means the ongoing support would be for the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Exciting bills / reducing the need for other commissions\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Travel and expenses to allow me to visit people and studios, especially to places outside of London\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*\u00a0Service charges for the upkeep and tech support of the website where the content is hosted, as well as possible further web development (basically, paying David for his hard work and expertise)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis means that you, as a patron, are helping me to create a huge, sprawling, ongoing documentary series that simply cannot happen through any current videogames site or publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will A Chapter From Series Two Look Like?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEach chapter in series two will look at a different studio or individual and will consist of:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Photodocumentary and portrait photography\u003cbr\u003e* Portraits\u003cbr\u003e* Writing about the individual or studio\u003cbr\u003e* A podcast interview\u003cbr\u003e* Other embedded bits of video or relevant media\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease take the time to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.garethdutton.com/mgif\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esee what I\u0027ve created so far\u003c/a\u003e, and judge for yourself whether you enjoy them enough to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFINALLY, And Most Importantly\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNo matter what level of support I receive, or if everyone runs away and feels like it\u0027s not worth supporting me anymore, I will still create these documentaries. More support means I can make more chapters more quickly with greater ease, because it means I don\u0027t have to spread that 50 to 60 hour time commitment over a longer period of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t spare your money, don\u0027t feel beholden to giving it to some idiot on the Internet. I will completely understand if, at any point, you need to alter or withdraw your support. If you swap monetary support for just tweeting and talking about it, that\u0027s just as valuable to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t owe me anything, I\u0027m just using a system available to me to attempt to increase the volume and frequency of my artistic output.\u00a0If funds dry up, the chapters will become fewer and less frequent, but I won\u0027t stop making them, no matter what, so they\u0027ll always be here for you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for showing an interest in what I\u0027m doing, I really, truly appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e"
