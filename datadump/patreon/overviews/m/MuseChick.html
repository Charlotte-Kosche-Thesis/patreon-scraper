    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Eleanor but some of you may already know me as MuseChick. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create and post piano tutorials on YouTube. These are usually accompaniment style, so they\u0027re easy and quick to learn and you can sing along to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to create tutorials that are accessible and helpful for people of all abilities but especially for people that are possibly new to piano or not very confident with their playing. I talk you through the notes, chords and will play each part with singing so you can hear how the song fits together before doing a full run through at the end.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make these videos because I love sharing something that I love doing, with others.\u00a0Lots of the feedback I get is people telling me that my videos have been their motivation to either learn how to play or get back into playing, which in turn is my motivation to keep making content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos will always be free for you to watch and enjoy on YouTube, that\u0027s part of what I love about it but the reality is that doing this costs money. I have to buy sheets, music to listen to and learn, printer ink/paper, tune my piano more regularly and my filming and editing equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI suffer from ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis) which has left me unable to work a paid job. YouTube is the closet thing to a paid job that I\u0027ve had, which is partly why it means so much to me, it\u0027s given me a sense of purpose and being able to give something back. I would love if I could rely on making these videos a little more for some income and to cover the costs of the things I need to make the videos, because I love doing them for you. Copyright laws on YouTube mean that lots of my videos are not eligible for monetisation and the ones that are, I have to share the revenue with the song owner. Knowing this, some of my viewers expressed an interest in supporting me through Patreon so here we are!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, my videos will always be completely free for everyone to enjoy but the option of supporting me in this way is available to anyone who would like to. You can choose a fixed pledge amount with a reward or choose whatever amount you\u0027d like without reward. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much for your support and if you\u0027ve got any other ideas for rewards that you\u0027d like to see, please do let me know and I\u0027d be more than happy to consider them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Eleanor x\u003cbr\u003e"
