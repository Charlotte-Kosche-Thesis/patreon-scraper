    "summary": "Hello, Nerdy People and\nLovers of Music! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are Mudville Comedy! We sing new, original\nmusic based on pop-culture, TV, movies, and other nerdy things on our YouTube\nchannel every week! All the songs are written and performed by LA-based\ncomedians and best friends, Minhdzuy Khorami \u0026amp; Greg Smith.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe think that a lot of stuff\nis really cool and fun and neat, so we love singing about the stuff that we\nthink is cool and fun and neat. Rather than making fun of stuff, we like to\ncelebrate it! Because liking stuff is cool! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo where does Patreon come\nin? As much as we love making our songs, it doesn\u2019t exactly pay the bills\n(yet!) We spend a lot of our time trying to find free spaces in our very busy\nschedules in order to find time to write songs, record songs, shoot videos,\nedit videos, and share the videos online. All of our expenses like props,\nequipment, and software are out of pocket. So in order to keep making new\nsongs, \u003cstrong\u003ewe need your help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur songs will always be\nfree on YouTube, so you will still be able to see things if you can\u2019t or don\u2019t\nwant to pay. We\u2019re asking for fans for an ongoing pledge of $1, $5, or more per\nvideo we release. These videos will be music videos for our original songs,\nepisodes of our webseries, \u201cRejected Songs,\u201d and episodes of \u201cThe Mudville\nShow.\u201d We release a new video every Monday, so that means we\u2019ll normally have 4\nvideos a month! (Remember that you can set your monthly maximum so you won\u2019t go\nover budget if we release more) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy being funded directly by\nyou will allow us to maintain creative control over our work, meaning that we can\ntry new things and continue singing dumb songs the way that we want it to be! \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you SO MUCH for your\nsupport. It really means the world to us. And please, feel free to talk to us\nand let us know what you think. The easiest way will be on Twitter, Facebook,\nor through the comments here! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe love doing this and if\nyou like what we do enough to support us, that just means the world to us! =) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
