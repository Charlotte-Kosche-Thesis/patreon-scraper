And she\u0027s only 7 years old. Of course, being her father I\u0027m\n terribly biased. You should watch some of her videos and see for \nyourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis whole project started because she and I watch a \nlot of movies together. And for years she\u0027s kept me entertained by how \nshe talks about those movies. What she notices, how she interprets \nvarious scenes, how she mispronounces everything - continuously makes me\n laugh. I decided to start filming these movie reviews of hers and put \nthem online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHer blog site is MissObservation.com and right now, \nit\u0027s primarily movie reviews. However, we are branching out into other \nsubjects including (but not limited to) drawings, original songs, book \nreviews, Videos of her playing with her Shiba Inu, Kitsu, some of her \nother favorite things, and general thoughts on life. By pledging to \nsupport Phoenix in her video blog evolution you will be promoting the \ngreatest thing that\u0027s ever happened to me... and maybe the world??? But \nseriously, you will be enabling her to continue to do what she loves and\n in the process, entertain us all with her wonderful mis-observations. \nAnd more importantly, you will be contributing to her college savings \nfund. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will do our best to release one video a week. And if you choose, you can \nset a monthly max so you \nnever go over your budget! For your support, we are offering \nsome pretty neat rewards. I\u0027ll let Phoenix tell you about them in the rewards column:"
