    "summary": "Thank you for checking out my Patreon page! My name is Rolf de Nes. I\u0027m 26 years old, live in The Netherlands with my girlfriend Saskia and have been creating YouTube videos since January 1st, 2013 as M1NDR.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started watching DayZ videos back when it was a mod for ArmA 2: OA, but couldn\u0027t play it myself due to being limited to a basic laptop back then. When I finally did get my desktop PC, DayZ mod was the first game I was dying to play. When DayZ Standalone got released on Steam Early Acces, I called up my girlfriend to cancel our date to download the game, hop on and play all night. It\u0027s safe to say she wasn\u0027t happy, but I was hooked after I set my first steps near Balota airfield.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the live streams people ask me all the time why I still support the game and it\u0027s developers after how long DayZ has been in Early Acces. Although I am happy to discuss DayZ\u0027s ups and downs during the development process, the biggest reason for why I stick around is that in my opinion there is no better game out there that allows you to create and tell your own stories. I love telling stories through YouTube videos, accompanied with just the right music to fit the mood for each situation. Music in my opinion makes 30% of the viewing experience and I always actively look to improve both which music I choose for a video, and how I like to implement it to match the footage. Do I cut right on the drop, or do I use a longer fade-through to help lift some of the more subtle moods in the story? If the music doesn\u0027t fit perfectly, it can seriously hurt something incredible that happened in-game. I believe the footage ALWAYS comes first, and the music just adds to that. Riding that fine line is where I always look to improve my editing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause people like to support the channel by subscribing or giving a tip during the live stream, I was very skeptical about starting a Patreon page. I don\u0027t want to give anyone the wrong impression that I\u0027m just looking for monetary gain. That being said, I am both a Twitch live streamer and a YouTuber creator. I\u0027m fully aware there is a BIG difference between people that watch my live streams and people that watch my videos. If you\u0027re a regular viewer of my live streams and already support there through subscribing and/or tips, please don\u0027t feel obligated to also have to support on Patreon!\u00a0This Patreon page is for people who watch my YouTube videos and want to support the content they enjoy directly, without having to go catch me live streaming to do it. I also think it\u0027s important all videos will release at the same time for everyone, no matter of being a supporter on Patreon or not. I don\u0027t create daily content so delaying a video for this reason just doesn\u0027t seem like a good idea to me. Nothing will change for the perspective of the normal viewer with starting my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI however do want to offer a benefit to Patreon supporters. I edit my videos and create the thumbnail live on Twitch from start to finish. What I want to do is offer a recorded video of the editing process exclusively to Patrons. I will interact personally with Patrons and answer any editing-related questions directly. Of course Patrons are more than welcome to visit the editing live streams as well! I\u0027m also looking into options for Discord connectivity and interaction. I will provide more info about that when I have it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you would like to support the content by becoming a Patron. Contribute an amount you\u0027re comfortable with and how much you can afford. The last thing I want is for people to feel like they have to support when their financial situation doesn\u0027t allow them to. If you are not able to support through Patreon, instead disabling your adblock for my videos will help me a ton as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRolf de Nes\u003cbr\u003eM1NDR\u003cbr\u003e"
