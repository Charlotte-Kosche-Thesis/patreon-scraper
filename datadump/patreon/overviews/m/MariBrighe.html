I\u0027m a hard-working queer trans feminist writer/essayist, activist, spoken word performer, and all-around rabble rouser. You find my work in places like Autostraddle, TransAdvocate, Everyday Feminism, Vice, The Advocate, Mic, Bustle, and Daily Dot, as well as on my own blog at TransNerdFeminist.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love what I do, and I\u0027ve been slowly working towards being able to make LGBT work my full-time job. I\u0027m also physically disabled and neurodivergent, which has made continuing to work full-time in health care (as I have for a decade) impossible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, freelancing is really unstable gig, and it doesn\u0027t always let me work on the things I\u0027m the most passionate about. With a regular monthly income, I can better carve out time to work on those projects. Also, a number of the things I do, like performing, discussing trans issues on social media, and appearing at conventions are still largely uncompensated. My Patreon will allow me to keep the lights on, make sure my partner and I have food on our table, and not hopefully not continue to destroy my body at my hospital job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary goal is to have the time and support to create a series of essays that will help make queer theory and gender theory more accessible. My plan is to start with a series of articles explaining the core tenants and foundational works of queer theory and gender theory in clear, understandable language. Those conceptual articles will be interspersed with essays that utilize the critical structures of queer theory and gender theory to analyze pop culture to demonstrate how these theories are used and what insights they can give us. The long term goal will be to collect these in a book for publication.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for helping me make this work possible!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
