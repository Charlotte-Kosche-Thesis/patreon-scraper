    "summary": "I started out as a True Crime fan and decided I wanted to give it a try on my own. It\u0027s a huge passion of mine, and has definitely become a labour of love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs \u003cstrong\u003eThe Minds of Madness\u003c/strong\u003e podcast has evolved, it has become more time intensive, as we strive to make sure that our research is as accurate as possible, and brings dignity to the families and victims that are affected by the cases we cover.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve had listeners ask for longer episodes, which we would absolutely \u003cem\u003eLOVE\u003c/em\u003e to do.\u003cbr\u003eBut as I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve heard from other podcasters, an enormous amount of time and money is involved in putting each and every episode together. \u003cbr\u003eFrom research, to script writing, to recording, to editing. It could easily be a full-time job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust as an example, a recent 30 minute episode took us 17 hours to edit. And that was after all the interviews had been recorded. I can\u0027t even tell you how much time went into research and writing, but days were involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve also invested thousands of dollars out of our own pockets, just to get this podcast up and running. Some of the costs include paying to get our theme music and graphic work created, our recording, mixing and editing equipment, monthly fee\u0027s for research databases, monthly fee for a US phone plan so we can contact people for the show, and also buying and mailing out merchandise to listeners and fellow podcasters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve decided to set up this patreon account in hopes of ensuring this podcast is brought to you on a regular basis, in the most professional and accurate way possible. But for that, we need your help. There is no way we could sustain the amount of time and finances long-term that goes into producing a show like this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you that would like to support us in bringing these well researched, written and produced podcast episodes to you, please support us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHelp us make this sustainable! We need your help. Please consider giving a monthly amount, no matter how small. \u003cem\u003eEvery little bit helps\u003c/em\u003e, and we greatly appreciate it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours truly,\u003cbr\u003eTeam Madness\u003cbr\u003e"
