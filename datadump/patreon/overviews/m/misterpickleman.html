Very likely, you\u0027re here because you\u0027ve seen me post about this on Twitter or Inkbunny. If that\u0027s the case, then you already know what\u0027s going on. For those of you who are wholly new to me, here\u0027s the rundown:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be using Patreon for its original purpose; as a tip jar. There will be no paywalling. Everything I create will be publicly available officially on either my Inkbunny account or Twitter as they are finished. To that extent, there will be VERY infrequent postings here, and even then they will not be exclusive by any means. I should also point out that I\u0027m not one of those money-powered artists; a large pledge will not help me work any faster. (The only thing that will help in that regard would be me improving as an artist. A slow process, but it seems to be happening.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will I be doing with this tip jar money? Well, each month I will hold a poll asking what percentage of the money raised I will keep. The money I keep will go towards possible help with my art. (Hiring someone to do the color work or scene building for backgrounds.) The rest will be given to what I, personally, believe would be a worthwhile cause. It might be to another artist who needs help, a website to go to server and bandwidth costs, a convention for equipment and staff, or to a traditional charity. (In regards to the latter, I prefer local no-kill shelters as my charity of choice.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow the big question: Why am I asking for support and promising nothing in return?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t know if any answer I give would be satisfactory. I want to use my talent to help support the things that matter to me."
