I\u0027ve been in the IT industry for the last 30 years and I\u0027ve seen it and done it all - from small servers to geo-clusters.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m now looking at a complete sea-change, something that will take me back to my roots.\u003cbr\u003eElectronics is where it all started for me so what could be better?\u003cbr\u003eEven though I don\u2019t consider myself an expert in electronics, I have been around for a while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. These days there are so many options for the Maker. So many in fact that often a Maker will either buy several products for a project or just give up. It shouldn\u2019t be like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. There are several things that I am passionate about;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLearning new things\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003emaking stuff\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eteaching people\u003c/strong\u003e. I believe that anyone can do anything with enough opportunity and motivation. For me there\u0027s nothing more rewarding than seeing someone learn and make something that they thought was impossible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I decided to launch into a YouTube channel. MickMake has several goals:\u003cbr\u003e* Help the Maker/ProMaker by providing honest, straight-up reviews on products by a Maker.\u003cbr\u003e* Showcase ideas for projects from those product reviews - IE how can I \u003cstrong\u003euse\u003c/strong\u003e it?\u003cbr\u003e* Provide in-depth videos on how technologies actually work.\u003cbr\u003e* Make electronics more accessible to people who are just starting out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eSo, why Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuying electronics can be an expensive exercise and this requires finances. Not only that, but my eventual goal is to be able to put all my full time effort into MickMake.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the solution was to start a Patreon page. By supporting me in this endeavour you are also supporting yourself. Every little bit helps, whatever it is, and I appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you are looking at supporting me. A big \u003cstrong\u003eThank You\u003c/strong\u003e! I hope that you get a lot out of MickMake.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
