There is also worry about Content ID, Monetization, AD block, changes to Youtube landscape and so on.\u00a0 I am also not a partner on Twitch yet, although I am an affiliate. Patreon enables me to spend more time focusing on Youtube content, Podcasts, and Twitch streaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can pledge any amount you want on a monthly basis. These pledges will give me the ability to upgrade my computer, audio, streaming capability, video editing software and allow me to work with artists to bring some special projects I\u0027d love to life. If successful enough then even trips to conventions to bring back proper coverage.\u00a0Plain and simple this will make my content better. And will make my life and my family\u0027s life just a little easier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is something that I love to do. This is something that I want to be able to do and hopefully be able to support myself and my family. I think it\u0027s everyone\u0027s dream to find something they love to do and do it. That is what I am trying to do. Your Patreon pledge makes that dream possible. Every single dollar counts. I really mean that. Regardless of wether or not you pledge today I want to thank you for checking my Patreon campaign out and for watching my content. Without you there is no MMO INKS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo matter how much I make or do not make here, it doesn\u0027t mean content will stop. I make videos and entertain on Twitch because I love to do so, this doesn\u0027t change that. This helps and enables me to continue to do so with less stress and worry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003eInks\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
