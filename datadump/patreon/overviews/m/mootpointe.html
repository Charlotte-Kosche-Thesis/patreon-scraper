    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowdfunding platform like Kickstarter or Go Fund Me except instead of a lump sum campaign Patreon seeks \u201cpatrons\u201d to support the arts and artists on a monthly basis. It\u2019s somewhat like public television and their pledge drives. For instance, you offer this much support and get a certain gift, or you offer that much support and get a certain other gift. Check out Moot Point\u2019s really cool stuff in the \u201cRewards\" section.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason for the Patreon campaign is simple; I can\u2019t produce the strip with any regularity without your support. So there you have it. With your support and wonderful patronage Moot Pointe can continue its rampage through the galaxy. Without your support it slowly dies and gets buried in a shallow grave behind the shed. With you ... life, joy, laughter. Without you ... death and stench. The choice is obvious.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see by the samples below, or by visiting the website, the strips in general often have some significant art and storyline, at least significant enough to take some time to create. Yet another reason I\u2019m unable to produce the strip in large quantities while also maintaining a \u201cnormal\u201d occupation. So with your help, there\u0027s lots, lots, lots, lots, and lots more to come. And also with your help, I can tell my current boss to go stick his head in a blender. Oh wait, I\u0027m self-employed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS MOOT POINTE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoot Pointe is an increasingly populer webcomic that lampoons politics, pop culture, everyday life, and just about everything and anything. Nothing is off limits ... except toast; it never makes fun of toast. So, whether you\u2019re on the left, on the right, for this, or against that, Moot Pointe is for you. We really think no matter what side you\u0027re on or position you have, things are taken a bit too seriously nowadays and we all just need to lighten up and laugh a little more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY AND WHAT IS ME\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is David Mills and\u00a0I\u2019ve been producing Moot Pointe on and off for\ndecades mostly for my own amusement and the enjoyment of family, friends, and\nthat guy that lives behind the 7-11. The strip had its genesis way back in the \u002780s. But since it\u2019s not what I do for a living I\u2019ve\nliterally gone 5 to 10 years at a time without drawing. Recently (Late 2016, early 2017) I took a few months off from my regular job to\ncreate a website and Facebook page to get things rolling again. This Patreon\ncampaign is an attempt to now keep it rolling. I have decades of comics,\nfermenting like a barrel of delicious Vernors ginger ale, just waiting to be\nunleashed upon an unsuspecting world. With your help, we can indeed keep it rolling\nand continue the chaos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANKS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, and thanks again. Myself and the gang at\nMoot Pointe greatly appreciate it. Enjoy a sampling of comics below. Some of the strips are stand-alones and some are excerpts from longer romps.
