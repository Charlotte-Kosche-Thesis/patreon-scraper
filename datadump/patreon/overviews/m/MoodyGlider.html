I\u0027ve been drawing for eight years now, and I\u0027m currently trying to get into freelancing as a job, but I\u0027ve always struggled trying to sell my art, so I\u0027m hoping Patreon can be a gateway to finally gaining an audience for my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I am unemployed and finishing my last year of college. I\u2019m basically living on my loan payments right now that I will have to start paying back within the next year. I\u2019m trying to get prepared for a job outside of school where I\u0027ll be drawing frequently and providing drawing services for clients, and all I really need right now is a little support from patrons like you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Art\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout high school, I was an art student that had a lot of experience using mediums such as pencil, charcoal, colored pencil, and watercolors. Right now I\u0027m an Emerging Media and Digital Arts student, learning about various design fields (website, character, graphic, video game) and new technologies. Besides school art, I\u0027ve drawn anthropomorphic (anthro/furry) art even longer, where I\u0027ve practiced, on top of traditional art, making digital art with GIMP, Paint Tool Sai, and Photoshop for over eight years now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also passionate about writing and music, but for Patreon I want to focus on working on my art with the help of patron pledges. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExamples of my work: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/2jaloie.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/2d7hj85.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/okbqg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also find at me at other websites such as: \u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://moodyglider.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://moodyglider.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.weasyl.com/~moodyglider\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWeasyl\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://moodyglider.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MoodyGlider\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/moodyglider/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFurAffinity\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExpectations/Goals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, I plan to get in the habit of working on art frequently, and to form new relationships with clients and my patrons. If you were to pledge to my art, you will assuredly see updates with art weekly and gain benefits that non-patrons don\u0027t have, which may include a monthly character sketch of your character or access to patron-exclusive sketches and art posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I have further success, I will try to update with finished colored pencil drawings every single week or even weekly digital art pieces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut none of this can happen without a little support from you all! So please, consider becoming a Patron of my art so I can live comfortably doing what I love and have money for my basic necessities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for reading!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(If you are interested in a commission, please message me about it or email me at moodyglider@gmail.com)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
