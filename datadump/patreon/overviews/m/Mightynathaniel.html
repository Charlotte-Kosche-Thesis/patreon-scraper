    "summary": "Welcome ! I am so happy to have you aboard . Thank YOU !\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born with health problems and growing up I faced many difficulties , with out a good start ,\u00a0 by the time I was a teenager I had faced serious epilepsy ( I would wake up with bruises from shaking hard in my sleep ) , pre-diabetic condition ( High blood sugar from a poor diet) , sleep apnea ( difficulty getting oxygen while sleeping , trouble recovering , leading to an oxygenating machine being used while sleeping ) , this all lead to problems in school and eventually being put on various pharmaceuticals which seemed to adversely affect my health further .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  As a child my favorite pastime was to read books . I particularly enjoyed non fiction . My mother was a nurse so she had medical textbooks around the home . I started devouring any information I could on health and exercise . In my studies I found out about men and women from a bygone era , an era pre steroid , Where absolutely amazing feats of strength were performed . Through their ways of life they were increasing not only muscle strength , but , neural (mental) strength , bone strength , ligament \u0026amp; tendon strength . These amazing people became just a few of my teachers and guides . \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Over the years , through continued study of nutrition, exercise \u0026amp; herbalism , I  healed myself of all the ailments of my childhood . I Got off all pharmaceuticals . The epilepsy went away , the inability to focus went away , sleep improved , weight came off , blood pressure and cholesterol became great . Overall my body became full of a new vitality .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately , while growing up and developing myself into a better condition , I had to witness my grandparents die from preventable heart disease and had to watch my father succumb to pancreatitis , diabetes , drug addiction and nutritional deficiency . He ended up not being a part of my life early on and I watched him go from a 300 lb muscular strong man , withering down , to a 100 lb and under sickly figure . The medical community was unable to help him as his body became unable to recieve nutrients .\u00a0 This painfully motivated me greatly to go another route .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201c\u003cstrong\u003eEvery adversity\u003c/strong\u003e,\u003cstrong\u003eevery\u003c/strong\u003e failure, \u003cstrong\u003eevery\u003c/strong\u003e heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit.\u201d \u2013 Napoleon Hill\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   The old time performer that always drew me in the most was \u201cThe Mighty Atom\u201d . To make a long \u0026amp; strange story short , I learned that he passed down his steel bending art form and practices to only one gentleman , Slim Farman .Slim passed it down to a few others . Through a series of strange coincidences and bizarre events I ended up meeting  some of these teachers and valuable information and practices have been passed to me . It seems this was meant to be .\u00a0 Now the journey continues !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  I now perform , entertain  and inspire with my performances just as the old time strongmen did that I had read about as a younger man . The steel that I bend is transformed through my being  and becomes unique artifacts that withstand time \u0026amp; space .    Thank You !   I may also be consulted with about your personal health , nutrition , or exercise programs . I love to help .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether we can do wonderful things !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely yours ,\u003cbr\u003eNathaniel \u201d The Mighty \u201d Day\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
