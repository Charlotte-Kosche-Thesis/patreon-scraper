It\u0027s about people who are granted abilities by the twelve signs of the Zodiac and how humanity is susceptible to political corruption and baseless prejudice. The story follows a cast of diverse characters that I\u0027ve poured my very soul into and had the pleasure of watching them flourish beneath my fingers.

Becoming a published author is something that has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl writing a fake newspaper for herself on the first iteration of Word. For the majority of my life (all 24 years of it) I considered the profession out of my reach and unrealistic, but since the beginning of 2017 I\u0027ve decided to put my heart into what I\u0027ve always loved most: creating.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eBeginning with rp that turned into writing fan-fiction, I became part of a community and family that I am forever grateful for. Writing for characters that I loved and wanted to explore is what brought me to some of the best friends I\u0027ve ever had and without them, I would have never had the wherewithal or conviction to finally sit down and plot out my trilogy,\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eStar Ties\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhat it means to support me: \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eBy becoming a patron, you\u0027ll receive access to things like chapter previews for fics I\u0027m writing, full patreon-exclusive one shots, NSFW scenes, venting pieces, Q\u0026amp;A, commission priority, and more! \u003cbr\u003eAside from those incentives, you would be directly helping me on my way to living out my dream of becoming a full-time writer. Of course, that road will take a lot of work. Currently, I\u0027m a full-time student living with fantastic roommates in Orange County (so, y\u0027know, expensive as hell) trying desperately to put myself through college and pay my bills at the same time via a shift leading position at Gamestop. The balance between work hours and class units has put me on a constraint that feels like graduation is a thing of fantasies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate hope for this Patreon is being able to quit my job and focus all of my energy into getting my bachelor\u0027s degree in Linguistics, and writing Star Ties to completion (as well as flesh out a handful of other stories already worming their way into my head). I want to share my characters with the world and hear every gushing detail of the way people felt when reading my work, as well as explore deeper themes and emotionally moving subjects. The sky is the limit, and as my supporter, you\u0027re my wings! (Okay, I promise to never drop a cheesy line like that again). The point is, my work is for readers as much as it is for myself, and I can\u0027t wait to show you what I can do.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e[DISCLAIMER: since my work contains NSFW themes, you must be 18+ to become a patron on certain tiers.
