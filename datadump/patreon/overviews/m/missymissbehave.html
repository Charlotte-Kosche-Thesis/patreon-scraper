I am a 23 year old, transfeminine artist and I have been making music my entire life. To cope with my gender dysphoria I have always written stories about my life and turned them into sound. Before, most of those stories went unheard, but now I\u0027d like to be able to share them with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me on Patreon will directly support my passion for music by paying for studio costs. In addition to recording, engineering, and producing all of my music I also play cello, piano, guitar, and sing. Music has been my omnipresent guardian during my toughest times, creating a safe haven of sound that has helped me deal with my gender. I want to share what I love so much about music with you and Patreon is the best way to fund my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my Patreon, you\u0027ll have access to songs that won\u0027t ever be available anywhere else. These songs are written exclusively for my patrons. At the end of the calendar year, I\u0027ll create a collection of my work, and deliver the album to all my active patrons.\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for supporting my work as an artist!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMissy Miss Behave\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxoxo"
