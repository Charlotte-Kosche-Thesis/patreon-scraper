As a teenager, he didn\u2019t\nknow what he wanted to be\u2014but his classmates were fairly sure that it would\ninvolve lots of words and screaming at people from across a room. In his\ntwenties, he wanted to be a science fiction writer like Robert Heinlein or\nDouglas Adams. In his thirties, he wanted to be a fantasy writer like Robert\nAsprin or Terry Pratchett. In his forties, he still wanted to do dodgy things\nlike this, but wisely did not tell this to the administration of the university\nhe was attending\u2026but they might have figured it out anyways, thanks to his\nhumorous astrology column for the student newspaper. Now, in his fifties, he\nbelieves that he would really like to be a stand-up comedian like Eddie Izzard\nor Ross Noble. Sadly, none of these ambitions will ever be fulfilled, for Morgan\nis Morgan. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Third Degree Wiccan and Adept Major (6=5) in Golden\nDawn, Morgan Drake Eckstein has been involved in Wicca and paganism his entire\nlife. He is a board member of Hearthstone Community Church (Denver,\nColorado\u2014the Open Full Moon People), as well as a former elected officer of\nBast Temple (Evolving Order of Eclectic Ways/[formerly] Golden Dawn in the\nOuter/Ba Iset Order of the Rosy Cross [BIORC] in the Inner). He holds two\nbachelor degrees from the University of Colorado at Denver (literary studies\nand history). He is happily married to a ceramic artist. He is owned by several\ncats who wish that he would make more money as a writer and artist, so that\nthey could eat fresh shrimp every night.",
