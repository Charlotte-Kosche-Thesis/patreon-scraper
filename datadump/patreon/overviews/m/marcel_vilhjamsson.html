    "summary": "Maybe you already know me as singer,\nmusician and composer of the bands Helrunar\n(\u003ca href=\"https://de-de.facebook.com/helrunar\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://de-de.facebook.com/helrunar\u003c/a\u003e)\nand \u00c1rsti\u00f0ir l\u00edfsins (\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/arstidirlifsins\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/arstidirlifsins\u003c/a\u003e).\nBoth bands have already produced several albums which have received\ncritical acclaim. Stylistically, both bands are rooted in the Extreme\nMetal genre, yet we often transcend this genre lyrically as well as\nmusically. A further musical project of mine, called W\u00f6ljager (\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/woeljager\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/woeljager\u003c/a\u003e),\nfocuses on Dark Folk/Neofolk. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the last years I have also\nbeen working at the Wolfgang-Borchert-Theatre in M\u00fcnster, Germany\nand served as an assistant director for the (locally well-known)\nactor and director Konrad Haller. Furthermore I have been creating\nliterature such as poetry and theatre plays, just like the play \"Vom Leben und Sterben\", which was written in connection with the W\u00f6ljager-album and performed on Burg Vischering in L\u00fcdinghausen (Germany) and on Prophecy Fest 2016 with great success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, I have constantly\nbeen working on various artistic projects; and now I want to try to\nmake a living as a freelance artist (i.e. author, musician and\ndramatist). The main problem is, of course, the funding - not just\nfor my own everyday life, but also for the many present and future\nprojects I want to carry out. The theatre-play would, for example, have never been realized without the support of my patrons here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLike many artists, I often have to face\ngreat financial problems that can sometimes even lead to existential\nthreats and thus affect my creative work rather negatively. So I hope\nto find a friendly patron here. Someone, who likes my art and who\nwould be able to help me overcome the greatest financial\nissues. Some of my patrons became good friends with me since I started this profile and I like to keep them closely informed on my works to give them a deeper insight into my artistic concepts. If you want to join this circle you are very welcome and your support will be very much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom time to time, I am going upload samples of my\ncurrent work to keep my patrons informed. Presently, you find some\nexamples of my earlier musical releases here, which I created by\nmyself or in co-operation with the other great artists I call my\nfriends. The content I am going to upload for my patrons consists of exclusive material: Lyrics, images, poems, descriptions of\nwork-in-progress, impressions from the studio and live-shows or maybe even freshly\nrecorded songs other people are not going to hear before the official\nrelease date (which might, in many cases, be much later). Maybe\nyou\u00b4ll also find completely unreleased material here sooner or\nlater, just for your personal entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who are\nfamiliar with my previous work know that all this is no idle talk.\nFrom the results of my work you can expect excellent quality on an\nartistically high level!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this spirit, I hope for your\nfriendly support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith kind regards\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarcel Vilj\u00e1lmsson\u003cbr\u003e"
