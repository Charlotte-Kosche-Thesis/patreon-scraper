This poor ol girl, my 2009 Pontiac Vibe GT, needs a complete engine swap, which will cost roughly $1000 to buy the new engine, maybe about $300-$500 more for anything else we may have to fix, replacing wires, front end alignment fixing, air filtration check, fluid replacement, and everything else I need to get her back in shape so I can start using my car as another source of income as a delivery driver.\u00a0",

Once that is paid off, if I continued to have this much support, I could use the funds to begin saving for my big trips around the world! The United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, anywhere I make friends, I could go! And bring you even more awesome content, sharing the lifestyles and cultures of those crafty, creative people like us, and even have a chance to meet YOU! Yeah, YOU! I could host meets in the places I visit and have a blast with ya, running around in fursuit, chilling at local hotspots, making silly videos, all to have fun!\u00a0",
