Each chapter is about 1200-1600 words long, almost always at least 1300 and occasionally straying as long as 1800.

By becoming a Patron, you\u0027re supporting my philosophical stuff \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e getting access to some interesting activity stream content \u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003econtributing toward some neat milestone goals, and you\u0027re also greatly helping me remain in a stable enough living situation to continue writing this story.
