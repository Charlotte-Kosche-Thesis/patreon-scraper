    "summary": "I\u0027ve spent the last twenty five years researching the connection between physical fitness, nutrition and disease prevention, and the incredible workings of the mind.   I teach dance and various fitness classes, and am a personal trainer and nutrition consultant.  I have spent the past three years giving brain seminars, with the main focus being how to activate dormant areas, mainly the frontal lobes, enabling more positive brain power!  For those who, like me,  want to live a long, healthy rich life, Patreon provides a means by which we can come together, be educated, reach goals, and support one another. I\u0027ve created \"Thirty days to FITacular\" as a weight management program in which individuals will lose significant amounts of weight while consuming an abundant amount of food.The bonus is, by following my thirty day meal plan, you will become an incredibly energized, powerhouse of a healthy individual! Every calorie you consume during this program will be nutrient dense.  Your hypothalamus will be sending messages to your body that your satiated, happy, and your immune system is running strong.\u00a0 Right now, until your body receives these micronutrients, it\u0027s going to signal that you\u0027re hungry. If you continue on this path you will constantly be eating! Each day you will receive nutrient dense recipes, reading material on different subjects such as water intake, protein, acid and alkaline foods, bad versus good fat, organic truth, cancer prevention, enriched and fortified foods, fiber, craving challenges, etc.  In this FITacular program you will also receive an exercise platform to raise metabolism, condition the heart, and shock your system into giving up unwanted fat. An individual can permanently hold a healthy weight and size if the focus is directed towards consuming large amounts of nutrient dense foods and by engaging in moderate exercise."
