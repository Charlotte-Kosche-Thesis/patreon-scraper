(the \u003cstrong\u003eGiant Cartoon Show\u003c/strong\u003e) Maybe you found me because of the cover songs I do, or perhaps you like my Let\u0027s Play videos and epic 5 hour gaming streams.\u003cbr\u003eMaybe you just like the occasional skit or review I sometimes do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a real mixed bag around here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best part about all of this has been the family we\u0027ve all built around the channel. You awesome homies have given me so much and have become such a positive part of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s build something new together!\u003cbr\u003eWith a few small changes I think we can put the channel in a place where I can do it full time, and when that happens it means videos EVERYDAY... MULTIPLE videos everyday!\u003cbr\u003eCan you even handle it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first part of that is Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOut of your own spontaneity some of you started donating during my live-streams, and I was blown away. That was enough for me start involving you homies as patrons so that Mattytime can be a full-time 7-days-a-week thing for everyone. And the best part is you will be able to have a say in some of my future content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, I love you. -Matt\u003cbr\u003e"
