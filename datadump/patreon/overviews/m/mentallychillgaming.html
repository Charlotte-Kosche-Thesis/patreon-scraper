You can help me make that happen! By pledging money, you have enabled me to be my very worst and laziest self when it comes to the outside world. This means that I get to sit in my gaming chair, and play endless hours of video games for both our entertainments.

This includes new games to play, fast food, more Funko Pops for the massive wall of them behind me on stream, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance for allowing me to continue playing games for you!\u003cbr\u003e"
