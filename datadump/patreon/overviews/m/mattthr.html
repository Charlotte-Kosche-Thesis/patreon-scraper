The fun in gaming comes from the people that play, the stories that they tell. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why do so many game writers choose to focus on the rules and the pieces?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m doing something different. Writing all sorts of content - reviews, features, interviews and more - in the form of a narrative, an experience. A story that I made with the help of my friends and family and the bits in a game box.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://fortressat.com/board-games/by-author/articles-by-matt-thrower\"\u003eYou can read some of my stories here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey are more readable than a traditional review, I think, and although they\u0027re a little more opaque, they\u0027re also more open-ended. They stimulate more discussion, more thought about what games mean to us, to you and the people you play them with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey\u0027re also more work. It takes more time and effort to write this way, and that\u0027s difficult with the demands of family and working life. I think the results are worthwhile: if you agree, and you\u0027d like to see more of it, then I could use the support to take the pressure off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoard games can take us to some wonderful places, places we can\u0027t otherwise reach. Will you join us on our journey, with access to exclusive insights as to how we got there? \u003cbr\u003e"
