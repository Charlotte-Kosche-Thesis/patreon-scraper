So we decided, as an experiment, to start recording a podcast and to our surprise we found that people were listening to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMany years later we\u0027re still doing it and it\u0027s become a weekly ritual. We\u0027ve expanded into multiple shows, segments, sketches and games - as much for our own entertainment as for the listener\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0We\u0027re asking people to show their support by backing us here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\nAny money we receive will be put straight back into our podcasts and initially it will help us cover the cost of running the shows. Beyond that it can also enable us to do new and exciting things like more elaborate segments and sketches, attend and cover more events, and possibly even expand into doing more video content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for checking out our Patreon and we look forward to talking into your ears!\u003cbr\u003e"
