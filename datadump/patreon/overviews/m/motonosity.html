    "summary": "Oh hey! Welcome to the Patreon page for The Build Series by Motonosity (that\u2019s me!). Back in early 2016, I bought a 2015 Honda CRF450R, and the Supermoto Build Series was born. It was a runaway success, more popular than I could ever imagine. I then followed it up with the Ruckus Build Series, showing what can be done with a measly little scooter. And although many have loved watching me build my bikes, I want to do more. \u003cstrong\u003eI want to build these bikes with YOU\u003c/strong\u003e. That\u2019s where The Build Series comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is The Build Series?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust like the two build seasons that have come before, this is a video series in which I take a motorcycle and make it into something better than it was. Along the way, I show you a little bit of how to build the same bike on your own, show off some of the awesome parts companies are making for the bikes, and provide some good old fashioned family friendly entertainment with my friends. We\u2019re taking things to the next level from the Motonosity builds of yore, though. YOU will be able to get involved with the builds through your support here on Patreon. Join the community, discuss the project with me and the other supporters, help choose parts for the builds (and future bikes for builds), and interact in live streams after episodes. If you\u2019re a top tier supporter, you can even tune into builds LIVE! Last but not least, when the The Build Series is over and the bike is complete, one of The Build Series FANS will be offered the bike for $1!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do The Build Series?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started doing build series to document actually building the bikes that I own. I had modified two bikes before (my R1 and my WR250X) with very little actual documentation of making them. I set out providing some entertainment while documenting the build in case others wanted to build a similar bike of their own. But I always hear from fans that they don\u2019t have the time or means to build a bike. I\u2019d like to bring that joy to some of you through The Build Series. We\u0027ll take it to the next level by showing more of the build and letting you guys contribute ideas to the build. I want to teach more, provide more, and entertain more. And because you all enjoyed seeing my build partner FryRiding in episodes, I want to be able to bring him and more of my fellow creators into town to appear in The Build Series episodes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat happens to the bike?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOh yeah! At the end of the Series, we will choose one \u003cstrong\u003eFAN\u003c/strong\u003e of The Build Series and offer the bike for just $1 in appreciation for following and supporting The Build Series. In addition, if we hit the $1,000 goal, a \u003cstrong\u003eBRAND NEW bike\u003c/strong\u003e of the same model as The Build Series bike will also be sold for $1 to a FAN of The Build Series! (taxes and registration fees paid for by buyer)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen are episodes released? How many will there be?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Build Series episodes are released every Sunday around 12 pm (noon) ET. In the event an episode is not released, don\u2019t worry! You are ONLY charged PER EPISODE. No episode, no charge. I try to shoot for 12-15 episodes for each season. It\u2019s usually a pretty realistic target for completing the build, but it\u2019s hard to estimate just how long a vehicle project will take. Things never go as planned! You can choose to support the series for as many episodes as you\u2019d like, so don\u2019t feel that you need to commit to the entire series if you don\u2019t want to or aren\u2019t able to! Just know that if you aren\u2019t a current patron, you won\u2019t have access to the community, planning, live streams, or any other rewards for supporting The Build Series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan\u0027t support the build but still want to join The Build Series FAN email list for updates?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a FAN of The Build Series, join our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://eepurl.com/c8zT21\"\u003eemail list\u003c/a\u003e for free to get updates on the series! We\u0027ll keep you updated on what\u0027s going on and what\u0027s to come :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*New owner of bike must reside in the continental 48 United States and must be 18 or older. This is a Patreon funded project. Patrons are pledging to the support the series and gain access to the Build Series community and fund the creation of the videos. The new owner must agree to sign all documents in front of or stamped by a notary when transferring ownership of the motorcycle. Anyone who participates in this project agrees to all of the terms stated above along with releasing liability to the content creator or anyone else who works on the motorcycle. The new owner also agrees to sign a release of liability upon taking over ownership of the new motorcycle.
