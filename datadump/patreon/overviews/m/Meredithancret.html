    "summary": "When I was growing up in the Bible Belt there wasn\u0027t a lot of choice when it came to LGBT fiction, but one thing I noticed over and over again was that so much of the fiction available focussed on the negative aspects of being gay. The negative social reactions, the problems with family and friends, the oppression and often fear that came with being gay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI don\u0027t know about anyone else, but I lived with that fear on a daily basis. I didn\u0027t need to read about it from someone else. I wanted to read happily ever afters and stories that gave me a positive feeling about my future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI turned to fantasy novels and science fiction, but very little of those stories contained LGBTQ+ characters and almost certainly they were not the main character or the one that got the girl or guy in the end. I appreciated the stories, but I wanted to read something I could relate too a little better as a lesbian. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe\u00a0that if we want members of the LGBTQ+ community to really believe that \"it gets better\" that we have a duty to show them that in as many ways as possible, so to that end I want to create positive portrayals of lesbians in fiction. These stories span from science fiction versions of Rapunzel to Pagan versions of Beauty and the Beast and short story retellings of folklore from around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my\u00a0hope that these stories will provide a safe haven of fiction for lesbians like me and show them that happily ever afters are possible for them as well. \u003cbr\u003e"
