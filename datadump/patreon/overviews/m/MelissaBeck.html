    "summary": "Hi.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have discovered me nearly two decades ago on that show I rarely discuss but am thankful to have participated in that you somehow know not to ask me about but understand that I\u0027ll answer kindly and honestly anyway if you still feel compelled. From there, you may have followed my original blog PrincessMelissa. Highlights of that blog include: 99 Products, my courtship with my then boyfriend now husband who I later revealed to be Justin Beck, old boy in Glassjaw and my brutal labor and delivery story for my first daughter Shalom. I have three daughters now because we just keep fucking raw! Shout out to Maja and Shira.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway,\u00a0I killed PrincessMelissa after about 8 years but, if you\u0027re here, then I know for a fact you found my secret and locked social media where I have recreated manic snippets of PrincessMelissa in 140 characters or less and shown you my personal evolution.\u00a0 Have I evolved? Still stank. Still hate a racist. But now I\u0027m married with children. I\u0027ve added \u00a0breastfeeding, IKEA and Beyonc\u00e9 to the short list of things I like which already includes Hello Kitty, Glassjaw, Shorty and Mercy. My Twitter and my Instagram are private because I hate a comments section open to n00bs and strangers. I share what I share with people who I think get it. I do not wish to invite gaze. I did that and it made me a shut-in, you see. Yeah, yeah. Setting up a Patreon is basically me doing \u003cem\u003egaze for pay(s)\u003c/em\u003e (see what I did there), but can I live? Dang. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like the feeling of sharing my observations into a great wide nothing. I know and you know and \u003cem\u003eyou get it\u003c/em\u003e and we go our separate ways but we live in each other\u0027s hearts and minds. I like you and you like me. We feed each other in a safe space. We have an understanding. I don\u0027t rock with eggs, flags or dogs and if you\u0027re here, you know exactly what that means. And for that, I say\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/mWD_VPiMlso\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/mWD_VPiMlso\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
