I think it boils down to this: if you\u0027re here because you happen to enjoy my writing, or have come across it through some fluke or another, then I think there may also be some desire to help support that writing. A pledge to be a patron of my writing is a pledge to help one more aspiring artist toward that ever-appealing goal of being able to create art for a living. Any pledge would be appreciated, and I will be digging deep into my brain-meats to think up some terrific rewards to thank anyone so kind as to help me get even a teensy bit closer to achieving my dreams. Added bonus: if I ever become The Malevolent Overlord of All Existence, I\u0027m far less likely to have you cast into The Fires of Eternal Agony if you pledged to be my patron. So there\u0027s that, too.\u00a0"
