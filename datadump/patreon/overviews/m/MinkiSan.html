    "summary": "I\u0027m rarely serious but thought I should tell you guys about me and why I make YouTube Videos. Its a long read so skip to the end if you want the pr\u00e9cis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2005 I went on Honeymoon to The Moon Palace in Cancun, Mexico. My new wife and I had a great first week and were feeling like the luckiest people on earth. Then a tropical storm was forecast and it was moving up the coast and getting stronger. To cut a long story short that storm became Hurricane Wilma.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter being ushered into a safety shelter with 4500 others we were told that we would be back on our holiday within 24 hours. On the 4th day of the storm I was bailing water into large bins, carrying those bins to a lorry bay with another person and dumping the water out into a lorry dock.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur bin was caught by the wind and I didn\u0027t let go. I was pulled into the water that had accumulated and washed out into the full force of the water. I did a bit of drowning and was bashed up a touch but luckily managed to get stuck under the side of a lorry and so with some help I made it back into the shelter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came home to the UK with a bad back but was treated for a cacophony of diseases as I had drowned in sewage water but was just given pain killers for my bad back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it this far thank you but it gets worse. After 3 years of working in constant pain and taking more and more sick days I had no choice but to quit my job. I decided to work for myself but that turned out to be impossible as the pain was getting worse and I was spending more and more days out of action and in bed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter three years of having a bad back and months of moaning to my gp I was finally given an MRI and it showed that I had broken my back in three places. The breaks had healed but it left me with a lot of nerve damage and at the time two slipped discs. I was told I would need an operation and that would happen in the next few months, I put my life on hold and waited for the operation that would get me back to work. Suffice to say, after four years of testing, waiting for the operation \"in the next few months\" I was told that actually we cannot fix this, you have permanent nerve damage and something called Chronic Pain Syndrome so go away, take these tablets and keep walking as much as you can because one day you will need a wheelchair.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that is my life, I am in constant pain and not an insignificant bit of pain, imagine a knife jabbed in your spine every time you move your legs and then as you move another hot knife twisted around in the base of your back while someone electrocutes your legs and the more you walk and move the more your stabbed and the hotter the knife gets. If you can actually imagine that, well done, now imagine it is going to last for the rest of your life and you can get a sense of the despair.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat brings me to now, I can only really work for myself because I am the most unreliable human on the planet. I say \"yes I can do that\", then my back says, you\u0027re not walking today mate and I say, \"I am letting you down today\". So I was looking for things to do to keep my mind from going mushy and I started making YouTube videos. I was recruited by a network and I started getting a couple more hits on my videos but they are far from popular. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am going to be putting a lot more effort into YouTube, I intend to stream gameplay, I intend to do some live broadcasting and I intend to make my channel big and popular. I am going to make a Patreon video and then add a link to my videos to my Patreon page but other than that I am not going to mention it. I am not greedy, I am not begging for money but I think I should open my channel up to as many revenue streams as possible and if this is going to be a full time job then I should at least try and make it pay for the things I am going to have to buy to be more professional and capable of producing the quality videos I want to produce and I will spend some of the money on food, some of that food will be cake.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have the equipment I need now to make the videos I want and am streaming and making videos for YouTube, Twitch and Dailymotion which I thought was something about a daily poo until I realised it was for videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am updating this page after several months and two patrons, I can\u0027t believe I have two patrons and I am so hopeful for the future because of this. I will continue to make as many videos and streams as I can until the channel has grown to something huge. I have created a T-Shirt store and I really think that I have turned a corner as far as the depression and general malaise that had become my daily routine. Thank you for being a part of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading all of this, its a lot to read, I tried to be serious but its hard. If I don\u0027t make jokes and muck about a lot the reality of my existence creeps into my mind and I go outside and shout at pigeons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are good people, I like you so here is something you can get from me. Every person who donates will get mentioned on my channel. Every person who donates will get my heartfelt gratitude and if I ever get famous and you want me to do something for you, use your name in a game or if you even want my autograph (maybe for some fraud) then you can have it, if there is anything else you want then let me know via my channel, I\u0027m really nice and will help if I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
