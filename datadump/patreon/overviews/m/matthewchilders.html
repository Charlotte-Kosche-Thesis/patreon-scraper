I have been making comics for almost six years now and have brought to life such titles as \u003cstrong\u003eDick Ruby\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eHawk and a Handsaw\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Four Horsemen\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eJigsaw World\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eAshes of the Immortals\u003c/strong\u003e, and I\u0027ve also worked on Army of Darkness for Dynamite Comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile still relatively new to the game I have worked hard to create a unique energetic classic style of comics that embraces the fun and energy that I believe comics can provide. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on a new book entitled \u003cstrong\u003eMoon Hunters: Tales of the River Folk\u003c/strong\u003e that will be published by\u003cstrong\u003e Action Lab Comics\u003c/strong\u003e. This is my first fantasy story since \u003cstrong\u003eThe Four Horsemen\u003c/strong\u003e, and my first foray into writing and all ages material. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoon Hunters is the story of a young, brash, and feisty young hornling named Lyria Two-Horns who begins her quest to become a legendary Moon Hunters. Imagine Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets Lord of the Rings and you only just start to get a glimpse of this world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here is what I\u0027m doing with this Patreon. I will share (almost) everything I draw and every new page I create freely. I love the idea of Patreon, but between doing the work, my day job, and keeping up with the website, facebook, twitter, whatever. It\u0027s hard for me to see doing\u00a0content specifically for rewards. So I\u0027m making 99% of my content free for you to see. If you like the work, if you enjoy what I\u0027m doing, then you can imagine Patreon as a giant tip-jar. Want to support me this month with a buck? AWESOME. Can\u0027t support me this month, but want to check out the art anyway. That\u0027s cool. No worries.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, anyone who tips will get to see every finished issue or story I do for free. This is my 1% reward. Everything else is free, but if you want to be top tier and read every full issue of Moon Hunters or any other comic, then just leave a tip.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFair? I think so. I hope so. I hope you enjoy the work, and thanks for stopping by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions about Moon Hunters or like what you see but have ideas for cool rewards that we currently don\u0027t have please feel free to email me at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:matt@matthewchilders.com\"\u003ematt@matthewchilders.com\u003c/a\u003e"
