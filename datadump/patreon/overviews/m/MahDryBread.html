    "summary": "Hey, I\u0027m Medraut Stowe, or Mah-Dry-Bread on the internet. \u00a0I run a show on YouTube where I make videos about Video Games from Let\u0027s Play\u0027s to Reviews. \u00a0On the side I do live streams of video games where I like to goof off with the live chat and I also host Pass The Controller Please, a weekly charity stream every Friday from 5PM till 7PM EST. \u00a0I\u0027ve been doing a video a day since March 30th 2011 now and have no plans to stop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/medraut567\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery single day (and twice on Mondays, Wednesdays, \u0026amp; Fridays) I upload a video of me playing a game. \u00a0It could be any genre, could be solo or co-op, could be with fans, could be anything! \u00a0When I can, I\u0027ll crack out the more rare but long running series on the weekends. \u00a0Sometimes it\u0027s Flash Trash, part of a series where my friend Brandon and I play bad horror flash games and riff on them. \u00a0Every once in awhile I\u0027ll just pick up a game I\u0027m good at like Warhammer 40K Dawn of War or Age of Empires III and just teach people some of what I\u0027ve learned over the years to help get better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside of YouTube, I try to stream about three or four times a week on Smashcast.tv for about two to three hours at a time. \u00a0Every stream is then uploaded back to my YouTube channel for anyone who couldn\u0027t make it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople often ask how I find time to do all of this stuff, and the answer is because it\u0027s my full time job. \u00a0I\u0027m disabled (I have cerebral palsy and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) so finding employment around here in Ontario is pretty tough, especially without a post-secondary education, so I decided to take my two greatest skills and passions and put them to work. \u00a0Editing video and playing Video Games. \u00a0Swallowed the juice, said the words and here I am. \u00a0Even with this job, money is hard to come by what with being a small channel and YouTube advertisements being worth very little.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027m here. \u00a0I want to keep doing what I do and make a living doing it. \u00a0One day I\u0027ll be there and with your help, it will only make things better, so if you want to donate to help me do what I do, that would be pretty damn cool. \u00a0Anything you\u0027re willing to give would be very much appreciated, but at the end of the day the show is free and I\u0027m just happy to have you watching.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil next time, have a nice day!\u003cbr\u003e"
