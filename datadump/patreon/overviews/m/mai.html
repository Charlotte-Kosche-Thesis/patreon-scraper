    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello! Welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePlease feel free to look around and see if there\u0027s anything you like! Hopefully, if you\u0027ve come to this page, you already know about me, but if you read on through, I explain everything below. But for a \"Tl:dr\"; I love to draw, and have done so as a hobby for years. There are bigger things I would like to do, like a comic series and animations. I know I have the potential, but I\u0027m short on the kinetic, (Physics joke, sorry. XD) Help me out, and get metaphorical cookies! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just a Math teacher attempting to be an amateur artist/animator. It started off as a small hobby of drawing friends\u0027 Pokemon and Yugioh cards for them in elementary school, as well as wanting to copy my favorite show, Sailor Moon, and it eventually developed into a passion for drawing cartoons and comics. I\u0027ve had friends insist I should be putting my work out more. I figure I could if I took the time and effort for it. I don\u0027t have too much free time but I want to work on this. More than anything I need critique and advice, but earning a few bucks to pay for better programs and equipment would be nice.\u00a0\u00a0 I hope I can receive commissions and advice that would help me practice with all kinds of elements. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I have here\u003cstrong\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Webcomic, Kitsune, as been a passion project of mine for some time now. You can read everything of I\u0027ve posted of it here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/kitsune/list?title_no=66945\"\u003ehttp://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/kitsune/list?...\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI update the comic about once a week. Any patron will be able to view pages a week before anyone else! Please come view it! As far as any commissions, I am willing to try just about anything. Commissions technically start at $5, but once I have an audience, I may throw something of a collective offer to my \"Tip Jar Members\" as well. Please keep it pg-13 or lower... I\u0027m a bit of a prude so NSFW materials aren\u0027t really my thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you donate even a cent to me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo be honest, you probably shouldn\u0027t. I\u0027m a total amateur and I don\u0027t have too much time between my current jobs to produce as much as you probably would like. Your money is much better spent on a professional, or at least someone with much more talent and time than me. \u003cstrong\u003eHOWEVER,\u003c/strong\u003e I am working on a few personal projects; my comic, animations, etc... And I am using this platform as my very first attempt at opening commissions for sketches and such. If you would be wiling to help support my cause so I may afford better software and updated equipment, I should be able to produce more, and hopefully better, content. I don\u0027t have too much to offer now, but think of it as a long-term investment in a promising future of fun art and animations. Right now, I\u0027m broke thanks largely to college bills depleting my meager paychecks. My current jobs are barely enough to pay my bills, so buying \nsomething like Adobe Creative Suite is pretty much out of the question. I\n manage to make do with Autodesk Sketchbook and a monthly subscription \nto Photoshop CC, but I would love to try out Adobe Illustrator, or After\n effects. I want to do more with animation too. So even one cent of donation would be greatly appreciated, and I will show that appreciation through my dedication and artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get if you donate?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor $1 a month, you get access to WIPs and sketches that I don\u0027t post anywhere else. Also, you get early access to my comic pages. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $5 a month, I\u0027ll sketch \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e! Or your friend, your OC, your friend\u0027s OC... anyone you choose, even a celebrity. You can choose the costume, the setting... I\u0027ll do my best to match what you ask for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $7 a month, I\u0027ll offer you a commissioned piece with base colors and line work included.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $10 a month, You get a fully detailed commissioned piece.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yes, this means I\u0027ll accept a new request from you each month that you pay.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "I\u0027m thinking I\u0027d like to be able to give the other Adobe CC options a try, like After Effects, Flash or Premiere. I don\u0027t know which one would suit me, so if you have a suggestion please tell me. Anyway with the new animation software, I\u0027ll mess around with the tools and produce 3 or 4 small animations of various things within a month or so. I will also commit to livestreaming once a month to be able to communicate with you during this process. Please make request on what you would like to see animated!\u003cbr\u003e",
