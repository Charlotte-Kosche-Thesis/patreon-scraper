Patreon is one such stream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a little bit different from Kickstarter in that it\u2019s designed to encourage users to pledge a few dollars a month as an optional subscription. Some Patreon creators do paywall content just for those subscribers, but we\u2019re hoping to avoid that and focus on other incentives \u2014 the primary incentive being keeping the site online! But we\u2019ll dole out other thank-yous to our patrons, like credits and badges (akin to those offered in the Kickstarter) as well as early access to some MOP content and specific avenues for participating in the site. There are also some larger rewards intended for one-off contributions from people who want to sponsor a specific chunk of content (we\u2019ll work around Patreon\u2019s infrastructure to make those happen).\u00a0We hope to strike a fair balance between our early bird Kickstarter donors and our long-term Patreon supporters as well as allow our community to sponsor what we do without dictating the terms. You\u2019ll let us know if we can do even better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much for your support in keeping the site and the staff online and awesome.\u00a0With love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://massivelyop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/team.jpg\" title=\"team.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
