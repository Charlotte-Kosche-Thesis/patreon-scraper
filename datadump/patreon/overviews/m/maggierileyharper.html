    "summary": "I write poetry. I like mythology, the way that human beings connect with their history, and metaphors. I enjoy stirring up the human condition and seeing what comes out. Combining these things seems to give me the best results. I decided to try out a Patreon to share my poetry, because while I can write novels and publish them, there\u0027s less immediate access in the world of verse unless you\u0027re singing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI \u003cem\u003ecan \u003c/em\u003esing, technically, but I\u0027m not going to sing these verses. Some are too raw to sing, others are too silly, or ridiculous. Most of what I write is the simple practice of finding a concept and turning it around, applying it to things I never imagined before. I use a lot of ancient Greek inspiration, or mythology from Australia, the US, and the British Isles. I think those stories are apocryphal and exist to teach us things. I like to look at those lessons and try to spin them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease join me on the journey."
