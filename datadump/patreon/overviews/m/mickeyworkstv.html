    "summary": "HI My name is Kun Wang. I am also a creator of MickeyworksTV (YouTube Channel and other 2 channels in China area).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI do love making videos and share the my thoughts to everyone who can watch my videos.\u003cbr\u003eA huge amount of viewers of my videos are come from China , Taiwan, HK, US. Most of them are students who works so hard to make a better living condition. I want to help! it\u0027s one of reasons I make so many videos and spent a lot of time on chatting with them in my Weibo.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe videos are all about how tech-related\u00a0gadget can change our world. More importantly, How do these things change our life.\u003cbr\u003eI am making different video category to tell people how I live my life with tech-related product.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eunbox them, review them, use them in my daily life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI hope people can live there life with positive attitude like myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to make more videos to teach some knowledge to them in the future.\u003cbr\u003eAll I need is more time. So much more time.\u003cbr\u003eI want to be a full-time video maker for my channel and then help them back in the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere is my Project one for My Vlog-Series\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project comes to my mind since The second week after I arrived in this beautiful City- Vancouver Canada. \u003cbr\u003eAs a Chinese I have been living in China for 26 years before I left. I love Canada, especially Vancouver that I am currently living in. \u003cbr\u003eI WANT TO SHOW IT TO MY PEOPLE FROM CHINA, Want them to see there are Chinese people living in a paradise place, and encourage them to live strong and chase their dreams no matter what just like what I did,\u003cbr\u003eThe fund will be using purchasing camera system like Drone (I use it to shoot from above ) and Underwater camera (I use it to shoot under the sea or in the heavily rainy day) , some hard drive discs for storage massive video clips, and other accessories to support a better video and audio quality ( I already owned a Rode microphone, so it\u0027s fine). these cost could probably around $4000 CAD. \u003cbr\u003e30 Episodes for Vancouver , it means including PNE, BC Place, FlyOver Canada, Rogers Center, etc. Some places need to purchase tickets. probably over $2000 CAD for tickets\u003cbr\u003eI drive my own car all along with my all gears, the gas , parking tickets , etc, need another  $500 CAD. I guess\u003cbr\u003eThe rest of fund I\u0027ll use it to pay my camera man\u0027s cost if I do need them to use a secondary camera (I\u0027ll need them, I know)\u003cbr\u003eI need to spent over 45 days to make all these Episodes and also design T-shirts for you guys. It\u0027s not a very \"easy\" job for me. \u003cbr\u003eHope it canbe done, You all will get a behind-scene video planning post on my YouTube Channel (MickeyworksTV) as you could watch it when it\u0027s ready.\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much. \u003cbr\u003eThank you for support a Chinese.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpzx9sMpCwKP_xTwoYZx7lA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/462/387/44c8be9a08d5fdb25124456e8a98886b_original.jpg?w=456\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;v=1463787185\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;q=92\u0026amp;s=763268e8a374ea05260c3ed25d12ac24\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-weight: inherit;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e"
