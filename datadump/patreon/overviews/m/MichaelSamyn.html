    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eI want to apply my 12 years of experience with videogames to the \ncreation of new digital works of art. Works that defy categorization, \nthat are interesting and moving, and easily accessible yet not \ncommercial.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eMy current work is focused on spiritual contemplation. I am fascinated by Old Master art and want to figure out how to achieve such deep emotional effects through digital means (such as, but not limited by, Virtual Reality). The umbrella for this project is \u003ca href=\"http://cathedral-in-the-clouds.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCathedral-in-the-Clouds\u003c/a\u003e and this year I dedicate one week per month to \u003ca href=\"http://olt.lt/ms/the-synthetic-image-research-project/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Synthetic Image research project\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the analog world I study classical guitar. Now in my fourth year in school, I hope to be able to work up the courage one day to share some of my playing with you.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow did I get here?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://tale-of-tales.com/presskit/images/ToTgames.png\" width=\"625\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe videogames I created with Tale of Tales: 8, The Endless Forest, The Graveyard, The Path, Fatale, Vanitas, Bient\u00f4t l\u0027\u00e9t\u00e9, Luxuria Superbia and Sunset. Ask me about them and I may never shut up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI have devoted 12 years of my life trying to create artistic videogames with \n\u003ca href=\"http://tale-of-tales.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTale of Tales\u003c/a\u003e, a studio I run out of Ghent, Belgium, with my partner \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/auriea\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAuriea Harvey\u003c/a\u003e. Our goal has always been to create beautiful interactive things for people. That was the case when we were making net.art with \u003ca href=\"http://entropy8zuper.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEntropy8Zuper!\u003c/a\u003e, and it will continue to be now that we are \u003ca href=\"http://tale-of-tales.com/Sunset/blog/index.php/and-the-sun-sets/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emoving away from games\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThroughout our involvement with videogames we have continuously \nattempted to \u201cmake games for people who don\u2019t play games.\u201d We wanted to \nuse videogames as a mature medium and work with subject matter and form \nthat could be appreciated by anyone, whether they\u2019re familiar with games\n or not. After a decade or so we realized that this plan wasn\u2019t working.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnly gamers play games. That was true ten years ago. And it remains true \ntoday. So it\u0027s time to move on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhich is where you come in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAway from the market\u003c/h3\u003e\n\tThe kind of research and creation I want to do is impossible within a \ncommercial sphere. While I am deeply concerned with accessibility and \nclarity, I cannot be sidetracked by demands and expectations of \nconsumers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI now aim to support my research and production through non-commercial funding from art grants, crowd sourcing and generous patrons such as you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIt\u2019s uncanny how commerce has penetrated our daily lives and how little creation is being done without\n commercial ties. It has become almost impossible to imagine what people\n would create if their livelihood didn\u0027t depend on it. No need to say I\u2019m very excited to see what will happen \nthanks to your support!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eProcess\u003c/h3\u003e\nSince my goals are rather ambitions, I cannot give you finished products yet. Not often, anyway. But I do want to share all of my thinking and progress with you. Hopefully some of it will inspire you - I have a relentlessly optimistic faith in the power of beauty and creation. For this purpose I maintain a \u003ca href=\"http://olt.lt/ms\"\u003edevelopment blog\u003c/a\u003e and I regularly post here to keep you abreast of what\u0027s going on in my head and heart. My Patreon backers are always the first to hear about anything happening at Tale of Tales. And the first I listen to. So don\u0027t be shy!\u003cbr\u003e"
