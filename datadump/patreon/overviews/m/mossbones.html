Who on earth is Melanie Ashton and why does she want my hard-earned crust? \u003cbr\u003eErm, well...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI was born of the rain and the cold, damp earth of Northern England. I\u0027m an artist, a self-taught doll maker, author, illustrator and photographer. A wanderling, a dreamer, a collector of bones, a lover of rust and dusty sequins and a delighter in twisted humour and unfortunate tales. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m never happier than when I have clay down my fingernails, paint in my mouth and twigs in my hair, penning a tale or sculpting, immersed in the exploration of making the intangible tangible.\u00a0I desire to keep searching for treasures in the mists, listen quietly to the whispers and roars of the natural world, to keep alive a connectedness to the \"Unseen\". I desire to continue to bring this back sculpture by sculpture, tale by tale and sketch by sketch into the world and share all the mysteries, quiet imaginings and unsettling tales with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1160.photobucket.com/albums/q493/Mossbones/_DSC0958_zpsgd0tfkz8.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I here asking for pledges?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here because I am at an important transition point in my creative life, \u00a0I desperately need to step away from smaller more commercial pieces with which I eek out a basic living, in order to develop and grow as an artist. To be able to continue creating my art I need your support. To put it plainly I need a living wage and funds for materials, studio rental, equipment and to further my artistic skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an artist is as fundamental a need to me as breathing. So I am incredibly grateful for the support I have received thus far, from those who purchase work and from those who simply write to tell me how much a piece has touched them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I have so much more to share. Sketchbooks full to bursting with ideas and inspirations lay piled up gathering dust not because I do not have the desire to create them but because my resources are incredibly limited.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtists were once an valued part of the community and received patronage which essentially paid them to create. Times have changed and now the artist is rarely seen as an essential part of the collective, which quite often leaves us at the edges scratching for pennies while we work, or sometimes giving up entirely the creativity that makes us who we are. Patreon allows artists to connect with a global community of generous people who appreciate and wish to support the arts. It\u0027s all about tiny raindrops creating a vast ocean, which means that everyone can make a difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCollectively even the smallest pledge will give me the opportunity to live my purpose and make all I dream possible, which is no small thing at all.\u003cbr\u003eFor those who wish to support me but are unable to become patrons, you will help me enormously just by sharing this page and my work through social networks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has been challenging for me on many levels to take this leap of faith and ask for help. I\u0027ve written about\u00a0that journey and why I made the decision to come to Patreon here: \u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://anthropomorphica.com/journal-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDeep Breaths and Waking the Ones that Inhabit the Depths\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1160.photobucket.com/albums/q493/Mossbones/_DSC0891_zpsknipz6pu.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will your pledge be supporting me to create in the coming year?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe first project I am embarking on is \u00a0\u0027The Darkened Offerings\u0027 a new collection of 9 sculptures that weave together elements of folklore, witchcraft, animism bound together with gossamer thin threads of connection to the natural landscape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA set of masks to be created for a collodian project with photographer\u003ca href=\"http://www.jwalkerimagery.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e James Walker\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0James creates beautifully atmospheric images and I look forward to our worlds colliding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStoryboarding for an animated film for a deliciously melancholic piece of music by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BreakTheSilence33/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBreak The Silence\u003c/a\u003e.

Patreon  allows artists to be supported on a  monthly basis from as little as $1 per month or per creation.

The rewards for patrons are listed \u00a0at the side of this page.\u003cbr\u003eI have set up my pledges as a fixed monthly amount which means you will never be charged more than you have pledged. \u003cbr\u003ePatreon accepts Visa, MasterCard, America Express, JCB, Discover, Diners Club and PayPal.
