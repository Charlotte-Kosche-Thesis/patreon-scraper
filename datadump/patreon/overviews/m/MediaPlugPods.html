We can\u0027t thank you enough for indulging us and listening to the podcasts we create, and if you subscribe to us, our gratitude to you is even greater.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the most basic level, your subscription means that you\u0027ll be getting your own personal feed to the podcast, where you\u0027ll get the occasional bonus episode. From there, it\u2019s about what additional perks you would like to have: Do you want to be thanked in our show? Do you want the chance to choose our discussion topic of the week? Do you want the chance to hangout with one or maybe even both of the Scotts? Or, would you like to be a guest on the podcast? It\u0027s all up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the perks aren\u2019t what our Patreon is about. We started this podcasting network because we simply love movies and love talking about how much we love them. By listening and supporting us, you recognize that, and we want to reward you for helping us out. Thank you for subscribing to us, and thank you for caring about what we do."
