Most recently, she has gained notoriety for her custom Vinyls and one of a kind Sculptures.\u003cbr\u003eBorn into a big hearted family of artists and designers, Miss Mindy was always surrounded by creativity. Her biggest inspiration was her grandmother Mary, who worked as an ink and paint girl at Disney in the 1930\u2019s on Snow White \u0026amp; Pinocchio, wore bright red lipstick and tiny polyester suits. Her Sister, CJ Metzger is also a tremendous \u0027paint-ress\u0027,  fellow collaborator and muse. Miss Mindy\u0027s Husband Rick, is also an amazing fine artist, but as for the miniature sets \u0026amp; Disney lovers, they know him as Ahab\u0027s Shipyard...\u003cbr\u003eMiss Mindy has been a prolific professional artist for many years. She continues to paint commissions for her private collectors, and showcase her paintings and sculpture, whilst Character designing for animation studios like Disney, WildBrain, Warner Brothers. She\u0027s directed her own cartoon with Nickelodeon Animation, and has some treats in store for the future! Aside from Animation, Miss Mindy also creates illustration and product for Mattel, Hard Rock caf\u00e9, Zippo, and many others. She has also written and illustrated two books with Baby Tattoo Books Publishing and recently designed her own line of vinyl toys with Disney Vinylmation ~ Which released in late 2015 and is now sold out.\u003cbr\u003eSHOW DATES: More info to TBA:\u003cbr\u003e Disney Cruise Lines / Residency\u003cbr\u003e October WonderGround residency 2016\u003cbr\u003e Screaming Sky Gallery Mini Solo show, Portland OR.\u003cbr\u003e",
