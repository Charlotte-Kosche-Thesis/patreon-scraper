    "summary": "Major League Fantasy Sports is an organization that I created in December of 2011. I started playing fantasy sports back in 2004 and I quickly grew board of the nature of the design of the league formats. I set out on a quest to design a system that was more competitive and that limited the amount of blind luck that is rife within the basic traditional concepts. We have acheived that over years of work in testing new models and alternative formats.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough years of hard work we have made major strides in the fantasy baseball and fantasy football space. We have 10 writers, 2 editors, and 3 live radio shows we host. Our writing crew, radio show crew, and guests are well written as well as major players in the business. Our shows will dicuss all formats of fantasy sports as well as the pro-sports angle all rolled into one. Our content from the writers is geared towards all formats and league set ups.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a 100% funded organization through donations. When you visit majorleaguefantasysports.com you should notice a very glaring thing. No ads of any sort any where. No pop-ups or any other variation of ad that drives you nuts. What this does for us as an organization is it does not put any handcuffs on us. We can be as PC as we want to be or don\u0027t want to be. We can criticize any organization without the threat of\u00a0someone pulling our funding.\u00a0You can see the point of the freedom I am sure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will post articles at least once per day every week. Our show schedule is fantasy baseball shows every Sunday 7-9pm EST, Thursday 8-10pm EST, and Saturday 1-3pm EST (Football). Once we get into September we will have Football shows every Sunday 11-12:45pm EST, and Tuesday 8-10pm EST. All of our shows are live call in shows which can be listened to in podcast form after the live airing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe ask for everyone who finds value in our work to donate as little as $2 per month which will go towards the funding of all the website costs, and expansion projects we want to deploy. We are all working many hours per week to bring this to the people from sheer passion. We want to build a great community oriented organization that is\u00a0self funded so we will always be in control of our works.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for your support and if you can\u0027t afford a donation please do not feel obligated to do so.\u00a0You are more than welcome to frequent our organization and if you can\u0027t help us monetarily than help us by telling others about us."
