I want to give a thank you back to anyone who would be willing to spend their own money just to help me achieve my goal and my ideas will come in through the rewards. Even though I see them more as stepping stones to where we can do something more for each other. What you do with your money is up to you, But I want to create a community that holds everyone near and dear to me as well as to everyone around us. Not just creating content, But creating an experience Every time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor any questions Email me.And also for the Rewards email me here if you guys have pledged already or if you want to ask me anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMickyj789@gmail.com"

     "description": "This is a step up, From being just a casual background character, Who really wants to be one of those, Instead, How about we bump you up to where the action is. I would love to make your character, A completely original idea by you and for you, As the main character\u0027s best friend or even their potential love interest if you so choose.\u00a0\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will get your own sub plot that will be fully fleshed out as well as your own little story in the book and will join the main protagonist on their journey through life, Or a mystical world. I will email or contact you about my future book ideas and then you can decide which one you want to be apart of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will only happen once per person so if one person decides to keep this as their monthly pledge, I will not be creating another character for another book as to try and encourage others to want to take a shot and see what they like. Hoping the current people decide to allow someone else the chance to have their moment.\u003c/p\u003e",
