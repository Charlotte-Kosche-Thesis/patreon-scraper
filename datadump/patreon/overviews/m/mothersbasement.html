    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnime, Games, Movies\u2026 the best of them affect us deeply, thanks to thousands of little details that we\u2019re not supposed to think about. I\u0027m Geoff Thew, professional dirtbag, and I do nothing but think about those details. Because when\nyou start to really appreciate them, it helps you love your favourite media on a\nwhole new level.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy YouTube channel, Mother\u0027s Basement, focuses on analyzing specific aspects of media - like levels in video games, or opening theme songs to anime - in order to figure out what makes them tick. If you enjoy critical breakdowns of cinematography and symbolism, discussion of the production process, and educational tangents about science and other topics, you\u0027ll find all that and more in my Mother\u0027s Basement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/syXo_JeSzuE\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will You be Funding?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel has two main series - \"What\u0027s in an OP?,\" where I analyze the opening theme songs of anime, and \"What\u0027 s in a Game?,\" where I analyze things like mechanics, cutscenes, and level design. What\u0027s in an OP? comes out every other week, while What\u0027s in a Game comes out once per month. In addition to these, I produce at least one review, toplist, rant, or additional analysis video every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s at least four videos every month, two about anime, one about games, and one wild card. And you\u0027ll be funding all of it. Of course, some of you will only want to watch the anime stuff, and some of you will only want to watch the gaming videos, which is why I\u0027ve decided to make the payment schedule monthly instead of per-video. That way you can kick in however much you feel is fair for how much I cover whatever interests you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2XGvq3JusSY\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Back Me?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eHopefully because you\u0027ve seen my stuff and like what I do! And because you know I\u0027ll deliver. I hold every video I make to a professional standard of quality, and I\u0027ve been consistently following a regular schedule since the channel started. I plan to put every penny I earn toward paying for equipment, editing services, and other stuff to help me create more, better content. If we can raise enough, I\u0027ll be able to do two anime or gaming analysis videos every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m NEVER going to hide my content behind a paywall - the point of patreon is to improve the channel, not take away from it. And again, I\u0027m very adamant about sticking to my schedule, so you will get increasing value every month for your contribution - whatever you feel four videos (or more) per month are worth.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut if you want the pot sweetened a little, I\u0027ve also got some pretty slick reward tiers below that give you more ways to interact with - and even be part of - the channel. Check them out in the sidebar.\u003cbr\u003e"
