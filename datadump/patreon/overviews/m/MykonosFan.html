Lately I\u0027ve been getting into streaming while reviving Learning To Love PlayStation on the side.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m On Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor years I\u0027ve invested hundreds of hours into the video making process for my own channel and for Find The Computer Room, as well as personally funding equipment purchases like a capture device and a condenser microphone. I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to gain a fantastic audience that is always there to give me feedback for improvement and talk about games with me. One day I was asked about a \"tip jar\" avenue, and after some thought, decided to open this Patreon. I would love to get to a point of doing this full time, so it made sense to open it up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Your Pledge Goes Toward\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, thank you for letting the thought of my Patreon stay on your mind this long. So let\u0027s get transparent. I\u0027ve had base equipment covered for a while, as stated above. So for the time being, a pledge goes toward helping my bills be covered.\u003cbr\u003eIt is $35 a month for the lowest tier internet package where I live in West Virginia, for speeds that basically don\u0027t permit streaming. Past the amount for an internet bill, we start creeping into \"Living The Dream\" territory where I can cover some other necessary bills, which at present total to about $150. After bills are covered each month, I would put additional tips into other general life costs. With that rate of donation, YouTube basically becomes a part-time job and I can soundly invest more time into content creation. Any further donation amount past that puts me further and further toward doing this full time. Occasionally if a need or idea arises, I will float it with you to see if you are comfortable with where your money is going. If the donation total continues to climb, maybe we can work out some better rewards for you, too, since I\u0027ll be able to invest more time into creation. A new video series? A podcast? Something else?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eTo answer the bold, your donation goes toward me doing this as a job and honing my passion. If you\u0027re donating, you like what I do. The more raised, the more I can do for you. I appreciate anything, and I also appreciate you even if you can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
