I love to create, I love sharing my work, and I love when people love my work. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main goal is to branch into setting up and photographing items for brands and visual content. And than means buying props and items to photograph that I can have available. \u00a0So I need to work hard to travel, buy items and props, lighting, etc-order matted prints for the images that I want to sell and of course send to my Patrons, packaging, shipping costs, etc. \u00a0I keep my hands full with my two awesome little ones-this is my mommy time."
