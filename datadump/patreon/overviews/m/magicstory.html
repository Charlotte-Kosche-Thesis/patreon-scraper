I truly hope you enjoy it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am dedicated to producing the highest quality product possible and firmly believe in equitable exchanges of value. To make this project happen, I work with the best and pay them for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make Under the Silver Moon a reality, contributions from the actors who bring the characters to life, the amazing director who casts them and coaches them, the studio that records us and the audio engineers who put it all together totaled upwards of 150 hours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order for Magic Story to continue we need to at least cover the professional fees that constitute the bare minimum. Anything above and beyond will be used to improve the audio experience (like adding a full score).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for listening and\u00a0I look forward to going on this incredible journey with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003e~Shaun Penrod"

(The column that publishes the storyline.) However, since I already listen to podcasts as I drive to work or exercise, then adding one more to my line-up would be perfect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided if I were going to present the Magic storyline in audio form then I wanted it to be the most amazing audio experience imaginable, like a movie in your mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMagic Story is for Magic: The Gathering players who want to stay current with the lore and fantasy enthusiasts looking for a great episodic story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be blown away by the quality of the show and I look forward to taking this journey with you.",
