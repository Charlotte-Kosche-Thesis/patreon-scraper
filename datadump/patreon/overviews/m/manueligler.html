Better less and good, than a lot with poor quality. In my opinion, music plays a really big role in healing the heart and the soul. It\u0027s the kind of therapy we all love to take. If you ask me why - I think God intended it to do so. If you want to support my music and what I\u0027m doing, this is your chance! You\u0027ll also get something in return, check those reward tiers on the right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be forever grateful for your support! Seriously, I couldn\u0027t follow my passion and pursue creating music without you. This is the reason I\u0027m so excited about this whole thing. \u003cstrong\u003eYou are my inspiration!\u003c/strong\u003e I hope that at some point in the future I\u0027ll be able to meet every single one of you and thank you in person. You rock!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, see you on the other side! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLove, Manuel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Important note: I\u0027ll never collect on more than four creations per month - right now probably only on one ore less.\u003cbr\u003e"
