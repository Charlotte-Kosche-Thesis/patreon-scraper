    "summary": "Over the last ten years, one of my major preoccupations as an independent historian has been trying to solve the mystery of the \u0027strange death\u0027 at the age of 54 of Lord Castlereagh, England\u0027s foreign secretary, in 1822.\u00a0Lord Castlereagh (known from mid-1821 as Lord Londonderry) is generally believed to have committed suicide by severing the carotid artery in the left side of his neck with a penknife at his country house in North Cray, near London, on the morning of Monday, August 12, 1822. I have reached the conclusion that, far from committing suicide, Castlereagh was murdered and that his death was dressed up afterwards as suicide. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0The \u0027strangeness\u0027 of Castlereagh\u0027s death is very largely due to the fact that unfounded psycho-medical speculations have been used (and continue to be used) to render its misrepresentation as a suicide convincing. In addition, numerous anecdotes of an apocryphal nature began being circulated after Castlereagh\u0027s death in an effort to make it seem as if Castlereagh had given\u00a0ample evidence of mental deterioration to his relatives and close friends, supporting the inquest conclusion that he had gone insane. Other anecdotes suggested that he\u00a0had premeditated suicide at least as far back as 1815. But there is no basis to most of these stories; not only can they not be corroborated, others\u00a0simply could not have happened. Yet many historians take these anecdotes seriously and use them to buttress their theories as to the nature of Castlereagh\u0027s final crisis.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0This book presents a systematic deconstruction of the familiar story of Castlereagh\u0027s so-called suicide, showing why it should not be believed. It explores Castlereagh\u0027s mental state in the obscure last few months of his life, revealing his growing awareness that a conspiracy existed to prevent him from representing England at a forthcoming continental congress being hosted by Metternich in Vienna and Verona. As the date of his departure drew near,\u00a0Castlereagh became acutely aware that he had entered the danger zone.\u00a0Indeed, the last words Castlereagh ever spoke (to his wife\u0027s maid, Mrs. Robinson) were that \u0027there is a conspiracy against me.\u0027 Less than five minutes after uttering these words, if Mrs. Robinson told the truth at the inquest, he was dead. History asks us to believe that, in a strange twist of fate, the man who was terrified of being murdered before he could leave England only ended up doing the conspirators\u0027 work for them by killing himself!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0The book identifies the chief perpetrators of the plot to kill Castlereagh and\u00a0examines their varied motives in considerable detail.\u00a0Some of\u00a0the most fascinating material relates to the pivotal role of King George IV\u0027s domineering mistress, Lady Conyngham, whose hatred of Castlereagh and his wife, Emily, was partly related to the fact that the Castlereaghs were relatives and friends of the king\u0027s previous mistress, Lady Hertford. The final chapter argues that Castlereagh\u0027s death was a major watershed in the history of English relations with the continental powers, setting the stage for the three great military collaborations with France against the \u0027despotic\u0027 states of Europe, the Crimean War and the First and Second World Wars. By contrast, Castlereagh\u0027s foreign policy aimed at peaceful co-existence with Russia, Prussia, and Austria, England\u0027s former allies in the coalition against Napoleon, despite the differences from England in form of government.\u00a0Had Castlereagh lived for another ten or twenty years, not only would his policy have entrenched itself, he would almost certainly have become prime minister. The future not just of Europe, but of the world, would have been very different."

     "about": "I graduated from the University of Sydney with a Ph.D. in History in 2001. I spent the following 15 years researching the origins of the Crimean War, the Boer War, and the First and Second World Wars. As 2017 began, I found myself thinking that the time had come to make my conclusions available in book form. The book for which I am seeking financial support, \u003cem\u003eMurder at Cray Farm: The Suiciding of Lord Castlereagh\u003c/em\u003e, is, first and foremost, an attempt to correct the historical record by showing that the only really sound view to take of Castlereagh\u0027s death is that he was murdered. However, it also sheds a great deal of light on the profound political tensions of the early 1820s, many of which were created by King George IV\u0027s appalling choice of paramour, the avaricious, tantrum-prone Lady Elizabeth Conyngham.",
