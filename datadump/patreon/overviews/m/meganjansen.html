    "summary": "Hey, everyone, my name is Megan and I have always had a passion for writing, particularly fantasy and scifi. This Patreon is for my first serial \"Argentum\". I have been working on this story for about a year, doing world-building and writing several drafts. I have thought about what formats to present my story in and decided on Patreon because of the opportunity to connect with readers and give them more material than just the story. I foresee doing at least three seasons of this serial. I would like to write more serials, but \"Argentum\" is my priority for the present. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis is the summary of \"Argentum\":\u003cbr\u003ePrince Nicolas of Argentum takes matters into his own hands when his sister Princess Cassandra is abducted by an unknown evil. When everyone tells Nicolas that he can\u2019t, he defies his father\u2019s orders and goes to save her himself. Faced with a fight he could never have prepared for, he also finds himself facing struggles in his relationships with his family and friends. Accompanied by his boyfriend, Gilbert; a brave knight named Laila; and Silas, a warlock\u2019s apprentice; can he overcome these obstacles and bring his sister home safely? Or will everything he holds dear be destroyed?"
