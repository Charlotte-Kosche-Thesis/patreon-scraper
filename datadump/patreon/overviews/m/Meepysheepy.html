I\u0026#8217;m meepy sheepy. It means so much to me that you\u0026#8217;re even here and looking at this. \u0026lt;3 Obviously none of this is mandatory and I greatly appreciate all the support no matter what. Let\u0026#8217;s get into the info! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0026#8217;m a cosplayer from Florida who\u0026#8217;s been cosplaying since 2010. From the moment I went to my first convention I knew that this would be something I would love. I\u0027ve always been a really creative person and I\u0027d much rather do things hands on than anything else. Even now I still take notes on paper, even with a computer right in front of me. 2015 is when I started to realize that cosplay wasn\u0027t just a silly thing I could do on weekends, but something I could do as a job. I quickly started trying to learn how to make them on my own and realized the possibilities were endless, every day I learned something new and it\u0027s so inspiring. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  From the start it was 1 costume a year to maybe 2 all the way up to 2016 where I had 10! And I definitely don\u0027t want it to stop there. My goal is to have one new cosplay each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/b6SZCZh.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  As much as cosplaying is fun and amazing. Just the same as any other hobby it\u0027s expensive, especially trying to make this as the primary thing I want to do. Of course life comes first. I will never put a costume over my own life and lessen my living for it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Each costume can very easily be $100, even something like lingerie where I\u0027m only wearing two articles of clothing. Sometimes it can go as high as $500 or even more. Wigs, contacts, makeup, materials, shoes it all adds up very quickly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Patreon is a friendly supportive environment for not only cosplayers, but artists in all forms. People have told me they want prints or even just want to support me and it blows my mind. Patreon gives me a way to not only thank you for the love and support, but to also give something back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0oyN2uD.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Everything that I will receive will always be used towards improvements or towards costumes. PC parts, worbla, Eva foam, heat guns, dremals, paints, glues, fabrics, traveling, con expenses. The list goes on. With cosplaying and going to conventions I also do twitch streaming so occasionally I\u0027ll need a new desk or a new graphics card or any of those things. Worbla is usually $80 a roll and just for a cape I spent over $30. Each and every penny will find a good use and will be lovingly used in each project I make."
