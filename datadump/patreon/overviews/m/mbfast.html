We are excited by fiction, personal essays, cultural criticism, and interviews. We believe in the serious, but we also believe that if you can\u0027t make people laugh, you don\u0027t deserve to make them think. We believe in craft and passion, and we want to support a diverse community of artists that care about these things too. By paying our contributors, we show respect for the process and the challenge of creating original, dynamic work. Let\u0027s share the intriguing and the humorous and the meaningful. Let\u0027s sate our appetite. Let\u0027s go for the gut.",
