Now, in addition to Ship in a Bottle and Peppermint Saga, did you know I am also the guy behind Starship Moonhawk and The Lavenders? I know, sometimes I forget too, it\u0027s been so long since they updated on the regular. At this tier, I can rent my sanctum sanctorum and get some real work done. I plan to get a small office somewhere and produce more work across all of these projects. I have big plans for audiobooks, animated shows, new comics, maybe even the R-18 spinoff of Starship Moonhawk: Marshal Dillon MacKenzie. The sky truly is the limit.",
