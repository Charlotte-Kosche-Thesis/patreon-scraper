    "summary": "Hey, I\u2019m opening up for receiving help along my journey as a activist for animals, nature and humans. So thank you so much if you for some reason are supporting me or are thinking about it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn\u00a07th grade I decided to become a special soldier, because I thought it was so wrong how few people in the world could do so much harm to others. But, if that is possible, then it\u2019s also possible to be one person doing a lot of good to others, I wanted to be like that. \n\nLater in life, and after learning about our world problems, I changed my view of what special solider I wanted to be. Not anymore just for humans, but also for animals and nature. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my journey to find my best way to solve world problems, I have become an activist for 10+ organizations, started two organizations\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/worldsavinghustle/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWorld Saving Hustle\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fortheanimals.no/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFor the Animals\u003c/a\u003e, organized activism events and generally helped fellow humans, nature and animals where I have been able to. \n\nMy lifestyle is also super human-, animal- and nature friendly. I\u2019m vegan, almost a minimalist and zero waste. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way I have done this is by working a full time job in the summer, then saved up and sustained myself with that for a longer period of time. I\u2019m now running out of money, and would after the plan look for a new job. Then I would have to slow down my activism and projects, so I have decided to reach out and see if there is anyone who wants to support me with my activism and projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have all the necessary equipment, camera, microphones, water bottle and a ten pack of bamboo toothbrushes. So the money I will spend from now on is for only the necessities like food, phone bills, transport and the organizational costs of activism and other projects. \n\nI will also make a rule to not buy unnecessarily expensive coffee and food when I\u2019m out and about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurther plans is to move out in nature, live at an animal sanctuary or at home with dad or mom. Therefore rent is not an expense in my life right now. \n\nTo show you that I will keep my word, I will vlog on YouTube at least once a week to give an update on my life. You all will have (as usual) full access to me and I always read and answer every message I get, even the hate ones. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m more ready then I have ever been. I have slowly warmed up, and will give everything I have to fulfill the wishes I seek. I will do my best to make the world a better place and if you need help with something then hit me up, I want to help where I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading through all of this. The entry to support me is only 1$, and everything helps! The people who support me will receive rewards and get access to different levels of content based on the pledged amount."
