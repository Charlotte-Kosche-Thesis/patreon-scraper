    "summary": "Hello current and future patrons! My best friend Joel and I record a podcast about shared movie universes, primarily in the superhero genre, but we\u0027ve covered other things such as sci-fi, fantasy and other generally nerdy things. Our episodes are very long, thorough and well-produced. They have a tendency of reaching three or four hours long. We have a lot of fun making these episodes and want to make sure we can keep providing lots of quality content for a long time. As anyone familiar with podcasts knows, there are costs associated and if any of you out there appreciate what we do enough to contribute then it would make all the difference in our being able to continue this endeavor. So if you enjoy us, take a look at what we have to offer our patrons. Anything is appreciated and we\u0027re constantly looking for opportunities to provide something extra for our patrons. Thanks for checking us out - we\u0027re happy to be sharing a universe with you!"
