There are not many LARPs in this\nregion due very \u201clitigious\u201d nature of NY and high cost of living expenses out\nhere. Due to these rising costs of insurance and venues in NY, we needed new\nways to reduce the deficit cost to our events. We asked our participants if\nthey would be willing to do a Patreon and \u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003emany\nwonderful people said yes!\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e The money raised here will help cover\ninsurance costs, venue costs, and pay for food, props and materials used for\nour events.
