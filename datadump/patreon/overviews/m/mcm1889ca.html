I produce, on average, 6,000 words of content per day. That\u0027s a good-sized novel every two weeks. Lots of that is freelance work, and will eventually end up in a TV show...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the rest is \u003cstrong\u003especulative\u003c/strong\u003e: hours of effort that\u0027ll probably go \u003cem\u003epoof;\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0not because the product is bad, but because \"we already have a dog show,\" or \"we\u0027re looking for gritty comedies this year\" or \"I don\u0027t like socks\"...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m constantly creating content that, statistically speaking, \n\u003cstrong\u003enobody will ever see\u003c/strong\u003e.

     "about": "MCM is an author and Emmy-nominated screenwriter with a knack for the eclectic. He got his start creating and writing the award-winning animated series RollBots (YTV/4Kids), about robots that transform into marbles and race on sky-bound rollercoaster tracks. He\u2019s also the co-creator (with Craig Young and Cory Morrison) of the preschool series Shutterbugs (TVOKids/Knowledge), as well as the internet fable The Pig and the Box, downloaded over 2 million times in over a dozen languages, and praised by award-winning author Cory Doctorow. In 2011, he was invited to \u201cperform\u201d his third livewritten novel at the Vooruit arts centre in Ghent, Belgium, creating an 80,000-word thriller in realtime, broadcast on the internet to an audience of tens of thousands, using input from the audience to influence the story. Beyond that, he and his writing partner, Craig Young, have also written for the TV series Justin Time (Disney/Netflix), Ollie: The Boy Who Became What He Ate (CBC), True and the Rainbow Kingdom (TVOKids/Netflix), Worry Eaters (Hahn Film), and story edited the series Terrific Trucks for NBC/Sprout. In his spare time, MCM merges code and fiction, like the app-based Dirt (iOS/Android) \u2014 a mystery told in texts and photos. He lives in Ottawa, Canada with his wife and two daughters, and also the damn cat who wakes him up at 2AM to look at socks.\u003cbr\u003e",
