In that time, we\u0027ve killed everything in Fallout 3, completed Mass Effect without guns, finished Hitman without killing, and got through New Vegas and all its DLC without healing. Thanks to that, we\u0027ve already grown past 300,000 subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started the channel in 2013, it was just a hobby for me, while I was also working a full-time job. But thanks to the channel\u0027s fantastic growth, I decided to leave my job in September 2015 to work exclusively on this, meaning we\u0027re making a lot more videos these days, and hopefully better ones too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s incredibly exciting, but not without difficulty - YouTube\u0027s ad revenue is unreliable, and the amount it pays has been steadily declining for years, so I\u0027m hoping that Patreon can help make this sustainable for me, so I can continue doing this full-time through 2018 and beyond, and take the channel to some exciting new places, with more videos, more community playdays, and more livestreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, every Patron gets access to the monthly Patroncast - a behind-the-scenes look at Many A True Nerd, where you can also ask any questions you\u0027d like - as well as sneak peeks at upcoming games, and, most importatly, an occasional photo of Tabby, the Many A True Cat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, feel free to have a look at some of our videos, which are, and always will be, freely available on YouTube, and if you feel like this is something you\u0027d like to support, then thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the best, Jon"
