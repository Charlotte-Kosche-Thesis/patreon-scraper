Skated heavily and passionately until I tore my ACL when I was 16 and hung up my skates for 20 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStrapped the blades back on 2 years ago and started tapping into the scene once more. I noticed there were only a few podcasts out there around the world... and none that I could find in Australia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so here we are!"
