My name is Misha.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a mom, a seminarian, a writer, poet, preacher, and performer. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt is my goal to get my book published before the end of summer, 2017. \u00a0Sooner sounds good, too. \u00a0I have been compiling stories and poetry for my book, \u0027Reverent Heretic\u0027 for several years now. \u00a0Many of you have heard a lot of my stories, some have heard one or two, and some of you are new to the idea that I might have stories to tell. \u00a0Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to click and read this far! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThose of you who have known that I have books inside me may also wonder about \u0027Fat Chick Naked\u0027, which I plan to make my second offering. Third? \u00a0Well, that is down the road quite a bit further, but it\u0027s already brewing. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am currently in the third year of grad school and my path toward ministry, and the single mom of a fantastic teenage daughter. \u00a0We have been sustained all along the way by a mixture of hard work, paid side gigs, internship stipends, student loans, grace and miracles. \u00a0The grace and miracles part is where you all have come in, and I trust will again. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnd here\u0027s where I try to pay forward those graces and miracles. \u00a0These books that I\u0027ve been compelled to share. \u00a0 It\u0027s time. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnd your generous belief in these projects, and in the future of my ministry, are what gets me up in the mornings. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you. \u00a0Let\u0027s do this together, shall we?\u003cbr\u003e*****Please remember! \u00a0It\u0027s true that these are set up to be monthly gifts. \u00a0BUT...if you choose a one-time gift...THAT\u0027S FINE, TOO! \u00a0You can get the gift for the tier you choose as many times as you help out...whether you stay on for awhile, or give once, and then cancel. \u00a0Like, say you want to give at the $500 level just this once...that\u0027s easy. \u00a0It *says* monthly, but you choose when to stop. \u00a0Or, choose a lower, sustained gift for each month for a longer time. Or go big, then taper. Or the other way around, if you like what you begin to receive and want more. \u00a0YOU always choose.*****"
