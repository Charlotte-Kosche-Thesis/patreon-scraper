    "summary": "Well, we are taking the plunge. For those that don\u0027t know who I am, let me introduce myself briefly. My name is Mike Bainbridge, a graduate of Northern Illinois University with a degree in Journalism. I currently work full-time in the marketing arena, but for the past decade I have been writing about college fantasy football on the side. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere most of you recognize me from is College Football Geek where I began contributing back in my junior year of college. When the site went away a few years back, I began writing for Athlon Sports as a part of their Contributor Network, but since that can be limited in terms of the topics I can produce, I have been continually looking for an avenue to provide year-round college fantasy content. That brings me here...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page on Patreon will allow for me to provide my followers with year-round information for college fantasy fans without having to create a full-on site, or present content on just a Google Docs which I have been doing of late. For what I believe will be a very small cost compared to what has been offered in the past, you will get access to:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e- Projections and rankings to over 1,000 players\u003cbr\u003e- Updated Depth Charts throughout the offseason and possibly in-season\u003cbr\u003e- Team-by-team previews and analysis\u003cbr\u003e- Daily Player Movement Tracking around college football\u003cbr\u003e- Potential Sleepers/Busts articles\u003cbr\u003e- Impact Freshman\u003cbr\u003e- Impact JUCO transfers\u003cbr\u003e- Weekly Start Em - Sit Em\u003cbr\u003e- Weekly Waiver Wire Adds\u003cbr\u003e- Weekly AMA chats to set lineups for Saturday, ask about trade proposals, etc.\u003cbr\u003e- And more...\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t expect this to be limited to the above either. I would like for the content to be fluid in terms of what Patrons are looking for with their CFF needs. Feedback will be welcomed.\u00a0Now, who will this information tailor to?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- College Fantasy fantatics - obviously\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- If you prefer a devy or dynasty league format, potential targets will be provided that not only project down the road in their college careers, but beyond.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Everyday college football fans benefit by getting to know skill position players from all 130 FBS teams. There are potential stars all over the country that the general fan may not be aware of that can be brought can be unearthed here. Not all of them reside in the Power 5 conferences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- College football writers can benefit as well by tracking player movement and reading insightful content on 130 FBS teams to stay in the know.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, I am not 100 percent sure how this will pan out or how much interest this will gauge. I do know that there is more than enough material to provide to you year-round and limited avenues to seek out that information. I am hopeful this site can only add to a growing interest in college fantasy football.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you - Mike"
