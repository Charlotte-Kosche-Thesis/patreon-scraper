I prioritized writing about a year and a half ago, and because my work status is \u0027casual\u0027 I get no leave or sick-pay. BUT I have enough time to write! Earlier this year I won the Victorian Premiers Award for YA fiction, and I used the prize money to pay off my debts. I\u0027m so lucky - I\u0027m at zero, a clean slate. (Full disclosure: I also bought a bed and put some funds towards a trip, my first time off in over two years.) I\u0027m incredibly grateful to be in the position that I\u0027m in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNow: to the future!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve got so many books in my head right now: the next two installments in the Mirii Mahoney series (sequels to \u003cem\u003eWelcome to Orphancorp\u003c/em\u003e), a new YA-ish (or YA cross-over, or NA or dark YA) series, plus a stand-alone novel for adults. I\u0027m not a hugely established writer, but I\u0027m setting up this Patreon to supplement my income and ease some of the stress of finances. Writing, and building a writing career takes time and costs a bunch. I\u0027ll use these funds to invest in my career - paying costs like travel and admission (cons are a great way to connect with other writers and readers, but can be costly), for software, printing costs, promotions, website fees and similar essentials.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI believe in art and in creators.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPeople who make stuff with their own heads and hands and hearts are valuable and I want to support them.
