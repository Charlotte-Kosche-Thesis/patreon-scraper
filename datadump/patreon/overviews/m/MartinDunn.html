I along with my colleagues over at the CAE Bullpen, are working diligently creating new and exciting content. The stuff I\u0027d be sharing here would be everything from exclusive video content, pitches I\u0027m preparing, concept art, tutorials, and more.

I have 4 preteens (yikes). I work endlessly on my craft and I\u0027m always working to produce new, exciting stories that I myself would want to read. Which, I hope means that you would want to read them as well. The goal here is to be able to continue to afford the costs it takes to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery patron will be essential in our progress. The idea of having a community to help me pursue and create is amazing. I believe in collaborative effort over all, and to that end I will always take ideas, suggestions, and questions with open arms! Everyone who backs $3 or more will have full access to all the published content I make available here on the Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"What does that include?\" \u003cbr\u003eThis will include \u0027creator posts\u0027, early releases of content such as pages, concept art, blog posts, PDFs, wallpapers, live-streams, and a lot more stuff.
