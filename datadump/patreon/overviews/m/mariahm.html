Nothing I do, now, is not a political act.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the election, every single artist I know (myself very much included) went through the same crisis of faith: Does our art matter in the face of this horror show?

I\u0027m Mariah MacCarthy. I\u0027m a creatrix. That means I make things. I\u0027m a performer, I\u0027m a writer, I\u0027m a producer, I\u0027m a storyteller, I\u0027m a burlesque dabbler, I\u0027m a tap dancer, I\u0027m a teacher, I\u0027m an advice columnist, I\u0027m a novelist, I\u0027m a restless maker of STUFF, in many different genres and media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work is unabashedly feminist, with women\u0027s stories and queer stories always at the center, but above and beyond that, every single thing I create is about connection. I want you to know that you\u0027re not alone. I want you to know that you deserve love. I want you to come away from something I\u0027ve created understanding a little better how your fellow human operates. I want you to know that you\u0027re not broken because everyone is broken, so if everyone is broken then no one is. You\u0027re fine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what I\u0027m working on right now: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo upcoming productions of my solo show, \u003cem\u003eBaby Mama: One Woman\u0027s Quest to Give Her Child to Gay People, \u003c/em\u003ecoming up in New York City and Cincinnati;\u003cbr\u003eI am currently finishing my young adult novel, \u003cem\u003eSquad\u003c/em\u003e, about toxic friendships between cheerleaders, which was just picked up by FSG;\u003cbr\u003eI write a weekly advice column, \"Help Me, Dylan,\" in which I answer readers\u0027 questions like, \"Is my boyfriend gay? How do I stop harming myself? What do I do about my misogynist cousin?\" and try to help those people find peace; \u003cbr\u003eand articles all over the Internet about everything from labiaplasty to becoming sex positive after sexual assault to pooping after childbirth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFull disclosure: I do get paid to do some of the things I just described. But none of it pays a living wage, even combined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I wanna do more! I wanna finish the musical I started writing, I wanna do another solo show, I wanna start a podcast, I wanna make ALL THE THINGS. I think it\u0027s important that artists make things. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor my whole adult human life, I have had a variety of day jobs, and it\u0027s been a fantastic learning experience. And one of the many things I\u0027ve learned is that for me, day jobs are a really great way for me to spend most of my day doing things I\u0027m not good at, and then having less time and energy away for the things that I AM good at, like making things. But for years, I took that as a given. I took it as a given that art doesn\u0027t come with a living wage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what if it could? What if the things we do for free because we love them, could become our livelihood?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I want for EVERY ARTIST is for us to make a living wage for our art. Your participation in this community will ensure that I spend my time doing the things I\u0027m good at, like making things. The work of connection and transcending isolation, the work I was put on this earth to do. My life\u0027s work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange, you\u0027ll get VIP access to my process. I\u0027ll send you every new article and advice column that I write, I\u0027ll send you excerpts of works-in-progress, I\u0027ll send you behind-the-scenes videos and photos. I\u0027ll also make sure to send you guys some pictures of my cat. Sophie. \u0027Cause she\u0027s the cutest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the more this community grows, the more it can become its own thing. Maybe we\u0027ll do a monthly webcast. Maybe we\u0027ll all get dinner together sometimes, or I\u0027ll send you creative prompts so you can go make your own things. The sky really is the limit. I\u0027m going to be listening to you and what you\u0027re interested in seeing as a member of this new community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for supporting artists. You\u0027re beautiful. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
