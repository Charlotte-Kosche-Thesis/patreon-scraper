    "summary": "Hi, my name is Salim Garami. I\u0027m a graduate in Filmmaking Practices from ASU, I\u0027m an aspiring filmmaker and somebody who tries to get involved in as many film productions and festivals as I possibly can, I\u0027m the former co-host of the movie-based college radio show \u003cem\u003eA Night at the Opera\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0on ASU\u0027s The Blaze, and I\u0027m the writer and head honcho of my personal movie review blogsite\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://moviemotorbreath.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMovie Motorbreath\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m also pretty cool, I like to think. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m Humphrey Bogart or Steve McQueen but...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd before I became any of those things, I used to be a cinephile. I still am one, but I use to too. I started writing in Motorbreath in 2011 and I like to think it has gotten way better at writing and expressing my thoughts on film because of it as well as it influencing the way I\u0027d like to expect my own film work to be - both in observation and in making me more aware of what I write and want to say. It gives me a voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMovie Motorbreath is more than just a movie-related blog, though nothing I ever put there is unrelated to cinema. I interject my own history with some of these films, I slowly learn more about films and acknowledge that by exploring further into these films and try to share what I\u0027ve learned, hell, there\u0027s literally \u003ca href=\"https://moviemotorbreath.wordpress.com/in-josh-martinezs-honor/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea page dedicated to my best friend\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://moviemotorbreath.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/dont-call-them-theyll-call-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea post about my favorite local revival screenings\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s most of my personality put into a blog that happens to be dedicated to cinema.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther personal favorite reviews include:\u003cbr\u003e- \u003ca href=\"https://moviemotorbreath.wordpress.com/2015/12/22/history-by-lightning-leaves-scorched-earth/)\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eD.W.

It also takes money and the amount of movies I want to push myself to see and review mean a lot of tickets being paid before I come back and put my thoughts to a blog page. I don\u0027t like pirating movies - I write to support art and artists can\u0027t eat off of some guy like me on the internet saying \"this movie was good\". The financial cost of watching films is why I find myself now wanting to take the leap and see if I can just cover this labor of love with the support of people who\u0027d love to read and watch my stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether Motorbreath gets absolutely no pledges or makes me an unexpected millionaire, it\u0027s going to keep going. I love movies. I love watching them and I love writing and talking about them and I have too much to say not to put it out there. There\u0027s no need to feel guilty if you enjoy reading my stuff, but can\u0027t pledge or if you\u0027d rather not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I also don\u0027t just want to write blogs for this title of Movie Motorbreath. I\u0027ve already tried my hand at expanding to podcast and video - the podcast was really not good, while the YouTube channel is fine but amateur (I\u0027m pretty proud of Hit Me With Your Best Shot, a series based on The Film Experience\u0027s interactive series of the same name and it\u0027s gonna be returning really soon) and I\u0027d love to just expand more and more into other ways of reviewing and critiquing movies, film history, and culture. There are some things that I can just illustrate better with a video than I can with a long essay and some that I can just illustrate better in the conversation of a podcast and this would definitely help in getting those off the ground.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also would probably be nice to have a chance to pay my recent co-writer Michael Margetis for his contributions. He\u0027s a guy just as excited about seeing and talking about films as I am and two heads are better than one sometimes. Unless you can\u0027t go on a ride or something because of those two heads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, Movie Motorbreath can keep on running steadily, maybe even more rapidly. By all means, whether you want to pledge or not, please visit the Wordpress site (again moviemotorbreath.wordpress.com) and check out some of our writing. Thanks for clicking on the link. And remember, keep the reel rolling, just keep the reel rolling."
