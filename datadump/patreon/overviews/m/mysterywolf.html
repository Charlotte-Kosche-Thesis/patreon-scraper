(I don\u0027t judge.)\u003cbr\u003eAllow me to introduce myself- I am a faceless nobody.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I have a Patreon! This Patreon is about my works of writing. Simply put, I\u0027d love to be able to write more, RP more, create stuff for everyone, but I don\u0027t have the funds to be able to do so- which is where this Patreon comes in! Support will help me live my dream of having a website and creating content for the world to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003eThe world of 18 and over, of course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you write about:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy works will vary tremendously, although many short stories involve transformation of all sorts.\u003cbr\u003eMuch of my short written work are for mature audiences only, although I can also write material for all ages too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy published works are for all ages, though I recommend teen and higher as it contains violence and guns. These works take MUCH longer to complete as I do my very best to make them as long, and interesting, as a real book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get as a Patreon?:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe lowest tier reward gets you early access to most stories, as well as access to ALL Patreon only stories, with a new one out every month. Higher tiers include things such as voting access on that exclusive story, a cameo in the story, or even make me write a story for you every month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, so long as I stay at the proper reward goal, you get a shot at getting picked for a story every month, regardless of how much you pledge. \u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s right, even as low as $1 gets you a chance to get a story for that month. (Every month I select someone at random. You have the entire month to respond, otherwise you become ineligible, so don\u0027t think TOO long!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you release written works?:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAbout once a week I am for weekly stories, and once a month for monthly stories- while I have no specific dates set in stone, I try to aim for Tuesdays for everything, the last Tuesday being the big monthly one.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s roughly four a month, more or less depending on commissions and the Patreon amount (I\u0027ll write more if I get more time to do so!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money I use here go exactly?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA portion of it will go towards helping keep up my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil I am able to make more here, a portion of it will go towards artwork, either for my website, or for written works. This will increase when I reach goals in the amount I am making per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rest will go towards the goal of helping me live a dream to write more often. The more money I can make, the more time I have to write (Okay, there is a limit to how much time I have, but I\u0027ll figure out what to do with excess money if I ever reach that point.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards and other details:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSet as a goal: A random Patreon gets a story, or an additional story, written for the month. This is active, so long as the goal is reached.\u003cbr\u003eThe rules for this are thus: You must have pledged for at least one payment process. (In short, I must have obtained money from you, even as low as $1 counts.) And you have one week to respond when selected.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLinks to stuff I actually do:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuraffinity Page: \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/bluemysterywolf/\"\u003eFuraffinity Link\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSoFurry Page: \u003ca href=\"https://blue-mystery-wolf.sofurry.com/\"\u003ehttps://blue-mystery-wolf.sofurry.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Pack-Kyle-Smith-ebook/dp/B00S5YIFEG\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eMy website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.mysterysden.com/\"\u003eMysterys Den\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck the progress of what I\u0027m currently working on here: \u003ca href=\"https://trello.com/b/iwFtYxrg\"\u003eTrello\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
