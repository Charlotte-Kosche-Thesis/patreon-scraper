I\u0027ve been writing fanfiction for over twenty years, and have met so many amazing people through fandoms. My published novel, \"Zero at the Bone\" (written as Jane Seville), a gay romantic thriller, has sold over 22,000 copies, been translated into five languages, and been adapted as a Korean manga!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you\u0027re here, you probably know me from my long career writing fanfiction. Between Harry Potter, Brokeback Mountain, Criminal Minds, and most recently Sherlock, my fanfiction has been read by at least half a million people, a figure that still blows my mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY AM I HERE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m ready to take my first steps toward mainstream publishing. My current writing project, a novel tentatively titled \"Flagstaff,\" is in rewrites. I\u0027m hoping that some of my fans and readers will want to support my work and come along with me as I prepare this manuscript to be shopped to agents and publishers! The enthusiasm of my readers and fans has already provided me with so much emotional and motivational support - through Patreon, I\u0027m hoping it can help me devote more time and mental energy to this project, and whatever other projects may come up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT CAN I EXPECT TO SEE HERE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy Patreon is public! All content is available both to backers and visitors. No pledges are necessary to view any content I post, although I do reserve the right to occasionally post patron-only additional content when the occasion presents itself. If you\u0027d like to pledge to support me, the only thing I can promise you is my heartfelt appreciation!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to use my Patreon blog to post pieces about writing, both in general and my personal experience with it, discuss what\u0027s going on in \"Flagstaff,\" talk about my experiences as a fanfiction author, think out loud about fandom and society, and generally write about things I\u0027d hesitate to post on a more public space. Some of the posts on the Patreon blog may eventually end up on my Tumblr, some won\u0027t.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWILL THERE BE FANFICTION HERE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m going to say no. I will probably write \u003cem\u003eabout\u003c/em\u003e fanfiction, but my general philosophy is that nobody will ever have to pay to read fanfiction from me. That being said, I don\u0027t discount the possibility of giving backers sneak peeks of works in progress or early access for fanfiction works that will also be public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO WHAT IS \"FLAGSTAFF\" ABOUT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe short answer is that it\u0027s about a cranky homicide detective and former FBI profiler who\u0027s investigating a thorny case while trying to deal with having a Relationship (which she usually avoids) with a younger man who literally showed up on her doorstep - the long answer is more about the tropes that I\u0027m hoping to subvert and the gender roles I\u0027m trying to reverse. If you\u0027re curious, see my public post \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/on-my-for-trope-13244502\"\u003eOn my motivations for writing \"Flagstaff\"\u003c/a\u003e\" here on Patreon, but here\u0027s a teaser in the meantime:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eStop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA group of people go through a traumatic, pulse-pounding, movie-trailer-ready adventure. They face adversity and have near-death experiences. Two of these people, a man and a woman, are forced to work together to save the group, and survive hardship with only each other as support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know where this is going. You\u2019ve seen this movie. You\u2019ve read this book. You know this story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the end of the adventure, our two heroes have had a moment of connection. They have saved everyone\u2019s lives, their eyes meet -- will words be spoken? Will declarations be made? Alas, they are torn apart by the circumstances. They return to their separate lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know that it\u2019s not over quite yet. It never is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe can\u2019t stop thinking of her. Has he missed his chance? He has to take the risk, or regret it the rest of his days. He boards a plane. Travels across several continents. Appears at her house.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe opens the door, and you\u2019re ready for it. The music will swell, they\u2019ll fall into an embrace. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come!\u201d she\u2019ll say. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay away!\u201d he\u2019ll say. You know what\u2019ll happen, because you have definitely heard this one before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this isn\u2019t that story. This is the story that picks up where that one leaves off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe opens the door, and sees him standing there. She opens her mouth, and you wait for it. Her eyes widen...here it comes...and she says:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWhat the \u003cstrong\u003efuck \u003c/strong\u003eare you doing here?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
