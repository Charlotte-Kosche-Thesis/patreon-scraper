However, the best cards that life has to offer have not been thrown my way; as people who have followed my work for any amount of time can surely attest, there has been a sudden, sharp decline in my productivity. To be simply and frankly put, this is a result of my current unhealthy living situation. The goal of this Patreon is to assist me in changing that very situation. Through art and -- with enough support and interest -- extending my knowledge and skill to others, I hope to help others in exchange for help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to take gradual, steady steps towards improving my current situation as I attain support. This \u201cabout\u201d section will receive updates as I move forward with bettering my living situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future I really hope to be able to produce lots of extra things for you guys to enjoy, mainly a webcomic! -- But also cool stuff like stickers, key chains, and other smaller art resources and assets!
