    "summary": "Greetings! My name is Matt Motto and I have been a guitarist and private music instructor for over 12 years. I\u0027ve played and taught just about every style of guitar-driven music there is (from classical to jazz to metal and everything in-between!) and I take pride in making sure my students fully understand the concepts and technique involved in each particular style. Through my band, Dissona, I have performed for and engaged with fans all across the country and have met some truly inspiring people along the way. This Patreon page represents a musical avenue which will allow for me to continue to create the best possible original music and content for my fans. My deepest thanks to all who have supported me along the way and a heartfelt greeting to those new fans interested in assisting me on this journey!"
