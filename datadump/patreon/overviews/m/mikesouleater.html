(Wow, how original, haha) I am one of the \u003cem\u003efew \u003c/em\u003epeople on YouTube that lives in Michigan, which is super fun (besides the constant weather changes)! YouTube has given me a platform to express myself, and build up my self-confidence in an amazing way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Brings Me To Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have heard of many websites and networks that offer fan-funding, but none have compared to what I\u0027ve heard about Patreon. This platform gives you guys the chance to support me (in more ways than one), and gives me a chance to thank you personally with some really awesome rewards! I am in no way making this page to beg for money, rather asking for support of people that find me funny or relatable online! Without any support, I would not be making videos almost DAILY, and having an amazing time doing it! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I Doing This?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI create videos to give people an escape from the stress of the real world. I hope that by watching my content, I can help someone going through a rough time, or just put a smile on someone\u0027s face. Whenever I had a rough patch, I would get so much joy and relaxation watching people test \"As Seen On TV\" products, eat really disgusting jelly beans, or just be themselves while helping others just like me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would just like to thank ANYONE that has such a huge heart to help me out on here. Like I have said previously, without your support, I wouldn\u0027t be doing what I do today. So again, Thank You so very much for being on this journey with me (whether or not you donate), because your support means the WORLD to me. :)"
