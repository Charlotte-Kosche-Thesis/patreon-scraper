    "summary": "Hi there! Thanks for coming and taking a look at my page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Marius Jenkins. I\u2019m a queer freelance artist living in Florida, and I work primarily as a Starbucks barista. From home, I work as a commission artist and produce a high volume of free content, both fanwork and original. I love to create and I love commissions, but unfortunately, I don\u2019t make enough money off of my art to pay my bills. I\u2019m chronically ill, so it\u2019s really not good for my body to work at the job that I do, but it\u2019s currently the only way I have to make ends meet at the moment. I would like to hope that one day, that won\u2019t be the case! Fortunately, that\u0027s what this page is for: to ask for help from generous people who want to help an artist build their brand and work up to something big(and get some cool stuff in the process, of course)! Pledging to me offers a wide variety of rewards:\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eaccess to my sketchbook and unposted studies, works in progress, and doodles, a choice in which pieces I polish up, discount commission prices, and monthly art and designs!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work focuses on a wide variety of subjects-from fanwork to mythology to high fantasy. My strongest suits are character and creature design. Most of my commission work revolves around different characters, and my personal work often includes a wide variety of different animals and monsters. Although the majority of my work is digital, I\u0027m very familiar with traditional media, and I do quite a lot of pencil, ink, watercolour, and marker work. All of that can be found in my sketchbook, which I post monthly right here! My favourite line of work is definitely character design, which I do regularly both for fun and for commission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WlzZf3c.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport for my work means the world to me. I\u0027m so excited to be working towards my goal of making art my primary job. Thank you very much for reading, and thank you for your support!"
