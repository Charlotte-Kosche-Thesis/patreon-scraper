    "summary": "It was the 10th of February, 2012 when young Mathwiz posted his first commentary video on YouTube. 6 months later, he would enter high school and take his first video production class. Meanwhile, after months of saving his money, he would buy his first capture card so he could make WWE \u002713 wrestling videos. Little did he know that, for the next 4 years, YouTube would become the cornerstone of his life. As the months went by, the shy high school freshman would slowly gain confidence in his own voice. As a result, not only did his commentary improve, but so to did his ability to interact with other people. He spoke to his friends more often, reached out to new people, and participated in his school\u0027s televised morning announcements. By the time his graduation rolled around, Mathwiz found himself \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0hiding in the crowd of soon-to-be graduates, but instead standing on stage giving a speech in front of over a thousand people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause he enjoyed making his silly wrestling videos so much, and because he enjoyed taking media-related courses in high school, Mathwiz decided that he should attend college as an Electronic Media major. If he could get this much enjoyment out of a mere hobby, who knew what the rest of the media industry could offer him? After all, he couldn\u0027t realistically make a living off of his small YouTube channel. Eventually, he would have to push his passion project into the background to find a place in the real world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOr so he thought...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eDuring his senior year of high school and freshman year of college, Mathwiz consumed copious quantities of anime analysis. Through these videos, Mathwiz not only found a new type of content to invest in, but he also learned more information about the platform he had been promoting for nearly 5 years. Then, on a late winter night in his second semester, Mathwiz had a shocking epiphany. He wanted to drop out of college to pursue a full-time YouTube career. He thought: \u003cem\u003e\"why should I bury myself in tuition debt when I\u0027m already doing something that I\u0027m passionate and ambitious about?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e***********************************************************************************************\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat fateful day is almost here, and while I\u0027m excited for this next journey, I feel a fair share of trepidation about it as well. I know that I\u0027ve only been making anime analysis videos for just over 2 months, but opening that second channel has only reignited my drive to produce more content. Restarting from square one has been a humbling experience, and the support from each and every one of you so far has been unbelievable. I can\u0027t thank you enough for watching my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo clarify a few things, I will \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0take content away from you. That\u0027s not what this Patreon is about. If you lack the means or simply do not want to pledge, that\u0027s perfectly fine! I will still release the same videos at the same rate that I was previously. I am not going to nor do I wish to charge you for my regular content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt honestly means the world to me that you took the time to read this. At this point, I know that I can\u0027t provide much in return for your support other than improving the content that I already produce, but I\u0027ll try to do what I can. I\u0027m hoping to rework this page once I get the hang of things, both on this platform and in my personal life. For now, I hope that this is a solid enough prototype to build off of in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo...allow me to re-introduce myself. What\u0027s up, everyone? This is Mathwiz97, and welcome to my Patreon!"
