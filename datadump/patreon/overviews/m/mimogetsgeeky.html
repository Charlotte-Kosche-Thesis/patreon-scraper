My name is Mimo and I love crafting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been a while now since I follow the \"enaml pins\"-community and I always had such cool ideas in my mind from which I thought that the one or other of you might like. I already made up some designs, but unfortunately I didn\u0027t go any further because I know the money is needed at other places.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy motives are mainly inspired by old and new tv shows, movies and videogames and therefore really geeky and nerdy, I think. :D I only work on designs I myself would really want to own as enamel pins and that is why I think this would work the same way for others and I would be so proud and happy if you would want to have them, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really hope that some geeks will find their way to my patreon page and believe in what I want to create and support me. This is a journey I would love to share with you. :) Thanks for listening! \u2665"

I would be so glad if you would join me on my adventure. Every single dollar helps, I\u0027m not expecting someone to support me with a great amount of money. Every dollar you can bare for me is a dollar less that I need to earn through more work. By this, I can concentrate more on my designs and create more lovely pins. Thanks!\u00a0",
