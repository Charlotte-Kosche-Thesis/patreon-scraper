    "summary": "Thank you for coming to look at my Patreon page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is a wonderful thing - it enlivens our surroundings, helps us to focus, invites some deep thinking, or calms a turbulent mind. I\u0027m hoping you will enjoy coming along on this ride with me, and help me to continue my artistic endeavours by becoming a Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, about my art practise; \u00a0Australian wild flowers and sea shells, Celtic, Gothic and Elizabethan decorative styles, and history of architecture and pottery are all inspirational. Making a design to create a painting, illustrating calligraphy projects, sculpting in porcelain or making pottery for feasting, are the things that I love to do and to share. The act of making art - the process, the sheer obsessiveness - that inspiration when it all clicks together and something new emerges - nourishes the spirit and the results make us feel like something worthwhile is created into the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe artist Phyllis Shillito was my tutor when I studied at her School of Art \u0026amp; Design in Sydney. Best described, I think, as ferociously devoted to her cause - excellence in the Arts - she was a scary old stick when I met her, and the 2 years of being in her presence opened my eyes to a world where colour could be possessed and good design was transferable to all aspects of the created environment. Many people in the Arts arena admired and respected Ms Shillito. My aim here is to share some of what I learnt from my days at her school. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter Art School, I worked\u00a0as a colourist and graphic artist in various studios in Sydney for a few years, until I moved to Hobart Tasmania, where I completed my Bachelor of Fine Arts at the University of Tasmania. That experience has given me confidence to set up my own studio as a painter/calligrapher and pottery maker. Many of my friends and customers know me for my pottery as Black Squirrel Feastware. Some of that work will inform my graphic offerings here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
