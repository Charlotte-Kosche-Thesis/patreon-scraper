This is my passion: to create and grow a community of viewers and fellow gamers who love to do the same things I do. This Patreon is not something that the life of the channel is based upon, just something for further down the line when our community is a bit larger. There will be Patreon-only merch, private sessions, pretty much whatever I can possibly do to thank you all for your involvement. Anyways, thank you to whoever reads this, and ensure that there\u0027s no such thing as a glass ceiling!"
