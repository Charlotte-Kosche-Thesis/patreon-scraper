    "summary": "Hi there, I\u0027m Christopher Cookson. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a kid, I grew up in Marlborough, New Zealand, and like many young people couldn\u0027t wait to get out of the place. \u003cbr\u003eAt high school I was heavily involved in writing and photography for the school magazine, but a grumpy science professor at university who didn\u0027t see the point in creative disciplines more or less resulted in my silence for many years.\u003cbr\u003eUnexpectedly, I was forced to return to my hometown as a young adult, and I began rediscovering and documenting the place where I live.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had my share of physical and financial setbacks over the years, and although I love people in small doses, I\u0027m a bit of an introvert.\u003cbr\u003eI sometimes suffer from patches of anxiety, but I\u0027ve found time in nature cures it, yet I can\u0027t go to the doctor and ask for a prescription for nature, and simply spending time in nature without working creates financial anxiety, so I\u0027m going to try a different way.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to try sharing my joy at the world around me, and I hope it inspires and relaxes you, and if you\u0027re able to spare a few dollars, you\u0027ll be helping ensure I can feed my family.\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t need to be rich, but money provides options to invest in the things I care about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Passion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 1999, I was part of launching\u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.marlboroughonline.co.nz/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMarlborough Online\u003c/a\u003e, a website about my region. In 2002, I took over the complete running of the website.\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, I\u0027ve taken thousands of photographs of my region, and when I get time, I paint, and have even been known to make the occasional video.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, I self-published my first book,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.marlboroughonline.co.nz/marlborough/shop/wind-on-the-withers/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWind on the Withers\u003c/a\u003e, a collection of poetry and photography celebrating Marlborough\u0027s Iconic Wither Hills.\u003cbr\u003eMy passion is my documenting and sharing the beauty of the place where I live.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m passionate about the environment, so I\u0027d love to earn enough that I can give something back. Apparently about 85% of New Zealand\u0027s native vegetation has been destroyed since humans arrived, yet the natural environment is very much the source of my creative inspiration, enjoyment, and relaxation. I\u0027d love to be able to have the resources to not only record the beauty of nature around me, but also do my bit to enhance it by planting trees, investing in predator control and other things that are so desperately needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Art\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tend to work in a very spontaneous way. When I was a teenager, one day I sat down at the piano and started messing around and over the following months I taught myself to play. I\u0027ll often sit down and play whatever comes into my head for extended periods with no music.\u003cbr\u003eSome years ago I had the urge to paint, so I literally dropped everything, jumped on my bike and went into town and bought a very limited set of oils and a few brushes and started experimenting. I\u0027ve since experimented with acrylic and watercolour in a similar way.\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t had any formal art training, and although I\u0027m sure I could learn useful techniques, I try to avoid it, because my paintings represent my personality, flaws and all. I don\u0027t aim to conform, but rather express myself and what matters to me through my art.\u003cbr\u003eI love heading out with my camera on a wild day with rapidly changing weather and light on a whim, as that can often yield the most interesting results.\u003cbr\u003eMy poetry is much the same. Sometimes I\u0027ll wake up in the middle of the night with words in my head. I keep a small notebook and pencil to write, as I love the tactile sense of a pencil, and the flow of handwriting lends itself more to creativity than a computer keyboard."
