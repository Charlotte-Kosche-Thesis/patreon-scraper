    "summary": "Hi everyone. \u00a0My name is Joey. \u00a0I live out of a van, and backpack as much as possible. \u00a0I spend more than 200 nights per year in a tent in the backcountry. \u00a0I have been backpacking and exploring the Rocky Mountain west of the United States since 2005.  In 2014, I sold off most of my possessions, and started my van life (Nothing fancy, just a cargo van with a mattress and bunch of gear in the back). \u00a02017 will be my 4th year living this way. I support myself by working temp service jobs a few days per month. \u00a0I make less than 8 thousand dollars per year, and still wake up excited to be alive every day. \u00a0My primary expenses are food, gas, and auto insurance. \u00a0I don\u0027t have a phone, and am only connected to the online world a few times per month. \u00a0For me, backpacking is about the experience, and discovery. \u00a0I\u0027m not into achievements or accomplishments. \u00a0I\u0027m not into speed hiking, or seeing how fast I can hike through a place. \u00a0I would much rather \"be there\", \"see it\", and \"feel it\". \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hobby has become both making backpacking videos, and writing trip reports. \u00a0I have published more than 50 videos on YouTube, and still have more than 20 videos already shot that I need to edit and publish. \u00a0And that doesn\u0027t include any of the trips for 2017. \u00a0Most of these videos showcase some of the more remote areas in the lower 48 states, places that many people will never have the chance to see. \u00a0I try to keep the videos as real as possible, and give viewers a feeling of \"being there\". \u00a0The videos aren\u0027t intended to be used as a guide. \u00a0They are my way of journaling\u00a0about my adventures, sort of like writing a book.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have set up this page as way for those of you who enjoy watching and reading about my backpacking trips to offer support. \u00a0Contributions lead directly to improvements. \u00a0It helps upgrade camera gear and editing software, which results in better videos. \u00a0It also leads directly to more material.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am specifically looking to raise some money for starting up a website, and also to purchase a new laptop.  My current laptop isn\u0027t capable of processing my video files. If i\u0027m able to get a new laptop that can process files faster, i will be able to edit videos on the road, which will result in even more content. The website will be a central hub for all of my videos, trip reports, routes, and trip photos. \u00a0 Anyone interested in making a specific donation towards this, or that can offer help in the matter, please send me a message.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow it works is you select a monthly amount to donate. \u00a0You can go with $1 per month, or higher. \u00a0You can also add in your own number instead of the set tiers I have listed. \u00a0I don\u0027t really like the idea of offering different rewards for different donation tiers. \u00a0Right now I have set it up to were all Patrons will receive the same thing in appreciate of your donation. Your name will be listed as a supporter on the website when it is up and running. \u00a0You will also be able to send in comments and questions for me to answer on camera in my monthly video updates. \u00a0You can make suggestions, ask me anything, or just say hi. \u00a0And I will let you vote on which video you want to see me make next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s important for me to state that I don\u0027t do any of this for money. \u00a0The people that know me know how uncomfortable it makes me feel to accept any sort of donation. \u00a0I\u0027m totally fine living the way I am right now, and plan to continue to do so. \u00a0Only donate what you can afford.  And don\u0027t ever, ever, ever feel like you need to give money to enjoy any of the material I publish.  Its all for free, and I intend to keep it that way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also open to anyone interested in donating gear or food packages. I am more than happy to pay for shipping, and will send an address upon request. Right now I am looking for tents (Both 3 man and 2 man), down jackets (medium or large, and any thickness), and boots (size 10 to 11).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoing forward in 2017  I will be releasing at least 1 full length backpacking video per month, sometimes more.  I will also be doing monthly update videos, where I will discuss where I\u0027m at, show a few highlights, and answer question from Patrons. I also intend to start publishing short videos where I talk about numerous topics, such as gear, hiking in grizzly bear country, backpacking tips, and so on. I will be writing trip reports as well, to go along with each video.  I have more than 100 trip reports I can publish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for the interest, and more importantly, thanks for watching the videos. \u00a0I appreciate it. \u00a0Knowing that people are watching these all the way through really means more to me than any contribution.\u003cbr\u003eJoey"
