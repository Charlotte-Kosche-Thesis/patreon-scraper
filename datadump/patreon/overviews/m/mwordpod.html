So why do they still get so much shit??? Every day, millennials are blamed for destroying industries like we are all on some serial killing spree. Conner \u0026amp; Kyle are sick of it. They bought two microphones (effectively burying the bullhorn industry) and began this podcast (basically killing the radio industry).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConner \u0026amp; Kyle have been friends for years, but in 2017, they both moved away from each other (mostly geographically). The M Word is all about embracing the millennial identity, letting a friendship survive the trauma of long distance, \u0026amp; solving the problems of the world (some of which they created themselves).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd none of this would be possible without people like YOU! That\u0027s right, YOU! I bet you weren\u0027t expecting a special shout out in this section of the internet normally reserved for narcissists \u0026amp; 2018-era presidents. Because of YOU, these kinds of discussions can continue and be supported. Thank you for believing that good content has value. And, thank you for putting your money where your mouth is (and we know where that mouth has been, you dirty bird).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.mwordpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_0465-225x300.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://www.mwordpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_0179-1-300x240.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
