We\u2019re a group of people\n that see a potential place to envision up new ways to create our own \nworld\u2019s, our own beings, and with just a boost of our minds. We believe \nanything is possible. What will you bring? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Mobius Grid is a videogame oriented fanmade virtual world. With \nthe goal to provide a rich environment in which like said above. A place\n to socialize, collaborate, and build an immersive experience. While our\n primary focus is on the Sonic universe, we are open to all gaming \nuniverses, and we want to not just end there. What about a place to see \nyour favorite comic book world be seen in a virtually new way, or a TV \nshow you\u2019d love to see come to life before your very own eyes. With \nMobius Grid all of this could potentially happen, but it won\u2019t get there\n without you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now we\u2019re small. But over time the registered users could be \nsomething to really show \u201cthat anything is possible, if you have a big \nenough community to make it so.\u201d So far our diverse userbase includes \npeople portraying themselves as humans, furries/anthros, robots, and \nother characters that are based from games and media, and things are \njust getting started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe grid has been constantly evolving since opening our server to the\n public, and being community-centric. Our team continues to listen and \nchange according to its userbase. The moderators and admins are here to \nhelp you feel comfortable, show you how to get started in making your \ncharacter get off the ground, and just be there like any other \nregistered member. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf any of this has captured your imagination. Then feel free to sign \nup, download our viewer so you can connect to the grid and login to our \nserver. (using the first and last name used during the account creation \nprocess, and your unique password) You can even join our forum, \nintroduce yourself, report any bugs or server problems you\u2019re having, \nand like all our other wants for registered members. Socialize and build\n friendships.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur team thanks all the current members and potential ones over the \ncoming months and hopefully years there after.
