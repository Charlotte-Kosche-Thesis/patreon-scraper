I\u0027ve always loved the process of creating art- the smell of paint, the touch of paper and glue, the feeling of diving deep into an abyss and discovering a hidden secret.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile some of you may know me as a journalist, I like to think of myself as a storyteller. I seek facts and truth in my art and creative writing in a very similar way to how I report. The process and the medium is different but for me the goal is the same. That goal is to help people understand the world around them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never thought of becoming an artist professionally or making money from it because for me art is part of who I am. For a long time art was something I did for me, as a way to process things I didn\u0027t understand as a child and teenager. But as I became older, I\u0027ve realized the importance of sharing and collaborating with fans.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that is why I\u0027ve started a Patreon campaign. To share my art and writing with you.\u00a0Art gives us a glimpse of the deeper beauty \u00a0and truth in the universe. I want to share those glimpses with you. With your support I will be able to buy art supplies and pay the hosting fee for my websites. In return, I will create art, stories, videos, and maybe even a zine or two reflecting on the issues that impact the world, ranging from feminism, water, poverty, urbanization, to the problems and triumphs of technology.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will join me on my journey of discovery and in doing so discover something new about yourself and the world we live in."
