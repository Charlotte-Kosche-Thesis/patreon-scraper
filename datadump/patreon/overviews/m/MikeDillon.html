With the help of you guys, my supporters, I can guarantee that I will be making videos, and making them more often!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want this to be \u00a0clear: \u003cstrong\u003ethis is not for ToraDora! Randomness, or any other abridged series I make. There is no revenue being made from those parodies.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Any ad revenue accrued from my abridged series and anime-related videos go towards the license owners. This is specifically for me to be able to make content for YouTube, which will include Let\u0027s Plays, Update Videos, Twitch Stream Highlights, and other content. Having a Patreon will guarantee that I can make content regularly, and be able to supplement the time involved in making all of my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making my YouTube videos, there is no doubt in my mind that this is true. I want to keep making videos, and it\u0027s pained me in the past to go on hiatuses, but issues in my personal life have prevented me from doing so, and this will help me continue to do so on a \u003cstrong\u003eREGULAR \u003c/strong\u003ebasis! Regardless of how this turns out, I will be working on uploading content as often as possible. However, should I meet my goals, I will be able to make videos more regularly than I could before, which means the world to me. This will help me avoid working crappy, minimum-wage jobs in order to keep myself living, and will also genuinely keep my spirits up more than anyone could explain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for anyone who is reading this, thank you for watching my videos, and thank you to anyone who supports me, whether it be through Patreon, or through kind words. You mean the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMike Dillon (XvXBL0ODXvX)"
