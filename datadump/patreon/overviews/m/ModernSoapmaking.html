    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eHey there, superstar!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI\u2019m Kenna, the owner and founder of \u003ca href=\"http://www.modernsoapmaking.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eModern Soapmaking\u003c/a\u003e, a massive soapmaking + biz website that hosts tons of free \u0026amp; premium content about handmade soap and running a soapmaking business.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2016, I decided to take a big leap and launch a resource for the soapmaking community called EOcalc.com. My goal was to create a tool that helped soapmakers and cosmetic formulators use essential oils in their products safely, making the complicated IFRA guidelines easy to follow and giving away tried and true essential oil blends for use in making soap and cosmetics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.eocalc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/new-look-and-home-for-the-essential-oil-calculator.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAbout the EO Calc\u003c/h2\u003eThe Essential Oil Calculator is a huge library of 200+ essential oil blends that are free to use by soapmakers and cosmetics formulators, no matter if they are a hobbyist or business owner. The Essential Oil Calculator also calculates safe usage rates according to IFRA guidelines for any type of product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe initial development of EOcalc.com cost thousands of dollars and was largely supported by\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/essential-oil-blend-calculator#/\"\u003ea successful crowdfunding campaign\u003c/a\u003e. The initial blends in the essential oil calculator were from my own formulary, and additional blends are added by the community all the time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery month, EOcalc.com helps thousands of soapmakers and cosmetic formulators access reliable information, but that comes at a cost.\nThere have been several feature requests, such as adding metric options for usage rates and leaving reviews on blends, that we\u0027d love to add, but we can\u0027t foot that bill alone. Additionally, the calculator costs a pretty penny to keep online.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMost other similar tools in the industry use advertising banners to fund the expenses of the tool, but I want to keep Adwords and other banner advertisements off the calculator. You can help me do that by supporting the project here on Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Essential Oil Calculator is updated once every quarter. During the update, we add new essential oil blends contributed by us and the community, add a few new essential oils to the available options, adjust usage rates or constituent levels, and other updates as necessary.\u003cbr\u003e\n.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow Patreon Works\u003c/h2\u003ePatreon is like a virtual tip jar, where you get to say, \"\n\u003cem\u003eHey, what you are doing is awesome!

Enjoy!\u003c/em\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you like or use the Essential Oil Calculator, you can help me keep it online and update-to-date by becoming a patron: pledging to donate a monthly tip, even if that\u0027s $1 a month.
