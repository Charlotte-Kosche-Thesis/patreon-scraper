    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for checking out my Patreon!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo and a half years ago I went vegan over night after watching\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4HJcq8qHAY\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e101 Reasons to Go Vegan\u003c/a\u003e. I can honestly say that going vegan is the best decision I have ever made. In the next few months I spent hours and hours learning about animal exploitation, climate change, health and injustice.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a while I felt being vegan wasn\u0027t enough. I wanted to contribute in bigger ways. That is when I joined NOAH -for dyrs rettigheter, the biggest animal rights organization in Norway, as a volunteer. I put up posters, gave out flyers, recruited new members and I met a lot of awesome people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began listening to podcasts, my favorite being The Rich Roll Podcast, ofc! I found that there weren\u0027t many Norwegian podcasts focusing on veganism so I figured I\u0027d make my own. I then started my own podcast called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/veganpodden\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVeganpodden\u003c/a\u003e. In April of 2017 I uploaded my first podcast episode, a conversation with Veganmannen. The first episode has since been listened to by over 1,300 people. I now have uploaded 23 episodes which have been listened to approx 10,000 times. These are some of the people I have had on my podcast so far:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlant based docor, Tanja Kalchencko\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnimal-rights activist James Aspey\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePolitician Une Bastholm\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLeader of Green Peace Norway, Truls Gulowsen\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnette Marie Antonsen\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-arn2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/29695266_1995701250749667_8645416950280662965_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=3147dcf706ef40ace306780ca6d42db1\u0026amp;oe=5B66911C\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also just started my own\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBXt_oaJGLSVUMXKSq3ei-w/videos?disable_polymer=1\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e where I will document my activism journey. I will make videos about lifestyle, veganism and activism!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m a student, studying human geography at the University of Oslo. I am studying in order to help the animals in a more substantial way later in life. I also have two part time jobs at the moment. I am a private tutor and I clean an office. These are great jobs, but I would like to be able to work part time as an activist for the animals instead. I feel I have a lot to offer when it comes to animal-rights activism.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday I am active as an animal-rights activist in a handful of different animal-rights organizations, mainly Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), Anonymous for the Voiceless and the Save Movement. I am a DxE organizer in Oslo and I spend many hours weekly on activism and doing what I love! Earlier this year I attended my first disruption with DxE Oslo where I spoke up for the animals. I really went out of my comfort zone, but I was surrounded by great friends and fellow activists, which made it a great experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe and my friend Martin Skadal are in the beginning stages of starting the organization\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fortheanimalsno/?ref=bookmarks\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFor the Animals\u003c/a\u003e and together with Hege Braate Vaag I am planning on hosting retreats with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.vegangathering.no/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVegan Gathering\u003c/a\u003e. Along side with these projects I\u0027m taining for a marathon (I will run for the animals). Something else that is fun is that I\u0027m helping organizing the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1726984030724627/\"\u003eOfficial Animal Rights March\u003c/a\u003e of 2018 in Oslo!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am now\u00a0opening up to receiving some help along my journey as an animal-rights activist. Your contribution would mean the world to me and help me a great deal \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e for reading through all of this. The entry to support my activism is only 1$, and everything helps! The people who support me will receive rewards and get access to different levels of content based on the pledged amount.\u003cbr\u003e"
