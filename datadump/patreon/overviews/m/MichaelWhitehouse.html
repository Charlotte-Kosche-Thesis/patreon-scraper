    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome, stranger. Pull up a chair and warm yourself by the fire. The rain is torrential outside and I doubt you would get far in the dark, so you best stay a while. Let us pass the time with a story, for I have such a strange and ominous tale to tell...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, my name is Michael Whitehouse, but you can call me Mike. Over the past few years I\u0027ve been sharing my horror stories online with over a million readers to date. You might have read some of them: Bedtime, The Melancholy of Herbert Solomon, Forgotten Valentine, On a Hill, and a bunch of others. It\u0027s\u00a0 been an amazing experience with many of my stories making it on to a whole host of \"most frightening\" lists. I\u0027ve been overwhelmed by the response.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve received hundreds of messages from people asking why I don\u0027t upload stories more often, and why I haven\u0027t finished my first novel yet. I\u0027m a freelance writer by trade and while that gives me a good amount of flexibility in theory, in practice the vast majority of my time has been going towards that because, well, it pays the bills. After writing for clients for 12 to 15 hours straight, it\u0027s almost impossible to work on my own material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Patreon is a site which turns you into a patron of the arts. I provide content you like, and in return you pay whatever you want for it. For example, you could pledge $1 for every story I post. You can use Paypal or any other payment method and no money gets taken off until you receive the story. Just to underline that,\u003cstrong\u003e I don\u0027t get a penny unless I upload the stories\u003c/strong\u003e. You can pledge as little or as much as you like and you can cancel payments at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, you might be asking, why should I do that if I can get your stuff for free? The truth is if I can get enough people to buy into my horror stories, then I can put much more time towards creating them, turning out a short story every week and still having time to write a couple of chapters for the novel version of Bedtime.\u00a0 It\u0027s the difference between getting a handful of stories from me a year or several books full. That is what Patreon is all about, fans being able to get more of the content they love by supporting the creators who provide it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to read my stories for free, you can find everything here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.wattpad.com/user/MichaelWhitehouse6\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.wattpad.com/user/MichaelWhitehouse6\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate your support and hope to be scaring the hell out of you for many years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~ Mike\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

As I grew up he would continue to tell me stories, some were based on local myths and legends, others on classic literature such as Poe, and a few were entirely of his own creation. \n\nMore than anything I owe my love for telling stories to my father, and the sense of wonder about the world which he encouraged me to explore. My name is Michael and it means a great deal to me that you have taken some time to read one or two of the stories I have written, born out of that imagination forged all those years ago.",
