This page brings the message forward that men are fine the way they are and the last thing they need to do is to follow the urgings of the media and others to try to be more like women. \u00a0Men are good and masculinity is not something to feel bad about. \u00a0We will offer videos on many aspects of men and their unique ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCONTENT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will be starting with four categories of videos. Each of the four can be accessed via the featured tags on the left hand side of the page. \u00a0The four categories are Men\u0027s Issues, Men and Healing, Things I Wish My Father Had Told Me, and Online Video Class Archives. The first is a continuation of the types of videos I have been doing on my youtube channel. \u00a0The second category, Things I Wish My Father Had Told Me, will focus on ideas and tips on day to day coping specifically geared to men. The third category Men and Healing will be a look into the unique ways that men heal that the media and academia have completely overlooked. \u00a0The Men and Healing vids will reference the fourth category \"Online Class Video Archive\" which is a group of videos I did about 5 years ago for an online international class for therapists about healing from loss and specifically about men and healing. \u00a0The video and audio quality are not the best but I think you will find the content very helpful. \u00a0The Online Class Video Archives will be available only to Patreon subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCOST\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping we can build a place that will be helpful to men in their daily lives, a place where men can get information they might not get in other places. The lowest level of support is just two dollars a month (you can set your per video amount to $2 and then set your max per month to 2$) so I am hoping that will allow nearly everyone to join in. \u00a0 \u00a0I hope you will join us.\u003cbr\u003e"
