You can even become a producer of the show and an official sponsor! \u003cem\u003e(See rewards.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you\u0027re new to the show,\u00a0The Unconventionalists podcast is a weekly show about the ups and downs of the entrepreneurial journey featuring guests such as JP Sears, Chris Guillebeau, Sarah Knight, Alastair Humphreys, Rebecca Tracey, Daniel Priestley, Samantha Clarke or the founders of The Minimalists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListeners often say that each episode feels like eavesdropping on an intimate conversation between two old friends catching up over a drink and chatting about what it is really like to start up a company and build an audience that is excited about what you\u0027re trying to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom making Philip McKernan cry to asking Milly Toovey about the fear of showing vulnerability online, I do my best to use my warm manner to tease out the truth and create moments of total honesty with our ever-growing roster of world-class guests ranging from best-selling authors, entrepreneurs, politicians, athletes and adventurers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the bottom of my heart, thank you for helping keep the fire burning and I can\u0027t wait to keep creating phenomenal content for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMark x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
