    "summary": "I\u0027m a Senior at the University of Southern California School of Architecture and my thesis combines my two passions; motorcycles and architecture. Last Semester I wrote my thesis and It described how I was going to combine these two loves of mine into something real. My vision was to take the two things I love most and successfully combine them into a design that\u0027s unique and practical, all the while, retaining the essences of each subject. Motorcycles are athletic machines that give us the ability to travel unlike hardly any other vehicle. Architecture, in this instance, distills down to a creatively designed shelter that intelligently performs it\u0027s programmatic function(s) efficiently, all the while remaining practical to build/afford. I\u0027m not just designing a motorcycle with architecture strapped to it, I\u0027m designing and building a shelter solution that\u0027s dependently integrated into an all terrain motorcycle. It\u0027s purpose is to give it\u0027s user a travel experience unlike any other; nearly uninhibited travel on an athletic and widely capable vehicle all while providing the user a home that\u0027s comfortable, practical, and sustainable. If the RV was architecture on four wheels, this would be an attempt at architecture on two."

Last semester entailed writing about the idea, now I need to finish building it by late April 2018. In just the last couple weeks of 2017 I managed to hurdle the first two obstacles of this goal; extending the swing-arm of the bike I started with, as well as converting the front end of the bike over to a much more capable beefed up CR500 setup. With your support I\u0027ll be able to bring this thing into reality without having to dig myself into even more college loan debt.",

     "description": "At this point I\u0027ve written the thesis and built it! now it\u0027s time to finish the thesis and put the MotoHome to the test! The entire reason for designing a fully capable off-road motorcycle shelter is because the intention is to be able to travel as I please and take the path less traveled. The narrative behind my design is that it would allow me to take the trip of a lifetime to the southernmost tip of South America and back. I\u0027ll be crossing over twenty thousand miles of deserts, rivers, beaches, and possibly scaling the Andes mountains! I\u0027ll be following in the footsteps of the many riders who\u0027ve accomplished such amazing feats, however, the main difference is that I\u0027ll be doing it on a bike I built and designed, that has an integrated shelter I built, all with your support. There\u0027s nothing else like it it for architects. We work and live to hopefully, one day, experience (and share the experience) we\u0027ve designed in all it\u0027s functioning glory. $10,000 is just a guess at the cost for the preparation and travel expenses included in this several month excursion. My estimates so far show that fuel alone will total over $2,000. Let\u0027s just get the thing built first! If the time comes for the real trip to begin, I\u0027ll be looking to assemble a team to document the trip and project thus far. I\u0027ll be broadcasting the trip LIVE when I can for my supporters and other curious minds to follow along. The trip will most likely turn into at least a documentary, or maybe even a show series! I see limitless potential and I\u0027m excited for whereever things go, no matter how far they go. I\u0027m just happy I get to share the experience with my family, friends and supporters.",

I\u0027m thinking the video should be something action-packed, something showing the bike in its current state proving that it\u0027s still quite an athletic machine. Most likely I\u0027ll be working with some fellow USC Trojans from the USC Film School! Stay tuned for it! I could use a little help getting the project prepared for the video. Be one of the first to donate and help create the next MotoHome video that\u0027s gonna go viral!",
