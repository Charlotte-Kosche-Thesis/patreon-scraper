Dalek December was a series of comedy sketches about the Daleks, made in part to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Doctor Who and the Daleks themselves.\u00a0For some reason, my portrayal of the alien pepper-pots really captured people\u0027s imagination, and it was the overwhelming response to these sketches that led to me releasing a series I\u0027d had in the back of my mind as an idea for years; The Adventures of Derek \u0026amp; Matt. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mIyj8yK2UNs?list=PLxgYfktFv1mkcQgjNDIy_aMvaMM7kqOyx\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show followed Matt and Derek, a normal human and his Dalek room mate. When Derek brought one of Matt\u0027s remote control daleks to life, he set off a chain of events which eventually led to the creation of The Cult of Scratchwood; a collection of the greatest minds of the Dalek empire in the room at the moment. The Cult\u0027s ultimate aim is the total conquest of Earth and the extermination of all other life forms. Unfortunately they keep getting distracted by other things, such as music, the internet, television, etc. So they haven\u0027t really got very far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaRjzCmefkE?list=PLxgYfktFv1mn0Ymoh345bVCs7QZGRdy6n\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlongside my videos about the Cult of Scratchwood, I also produce and present an independent comedy radio show on Livestream, called Teatime With Matt. I usually do a series of 6 shows a year, plus a Christmas special. In 2015, I undertook a 24 Hour broadcast entitled Teatime With Matt\u0027s 24 Hour Tea Break in order to raise money for Mind, a charity that supports people suffering from mental health conditions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AF-WqmF2Bz8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy You Should Become A Patron\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of my content is a labour of love, and while it\u0027s something I love doing with a passion, it does eat into a lot of my spare time and particularly my income.
