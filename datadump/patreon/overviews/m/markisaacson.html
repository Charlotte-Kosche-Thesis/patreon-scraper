    "summary": "Way back when, at a darker time in my life, I turned to writing to help ease my mind. What was born from that early work was a story that has been following me around for almost seven years, a story I\u0027m desperate to finally finish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy problem, however, is that I\u0027m always coming up with other ideas, and over time I\u0027ve become more concerned with the quality of my work and whether that first but much loved story would ever be up to the standard I\u0027d set for myself. So as other ideas came, it fell further back into the pile of work waiting to be completed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realised, however, that none of the ideas I\u0027ve since had would have existed without it, that I\u0027d be nowhere near the writer I am today if it wasn\u0027t for that early work that helped me out of that funk. But what of all these other projects?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy solution was obvious. What if every idea I\u0027ve had, every concept and project I\u0027ve wanted to write in some form or another, was part of a much larger whole? What if they were somehow connected to each other, small or large tethers that built upon one another to form an entire world of characters, places and stories?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eCodename: Reliance\u003c/strong\u003e, my pet project which aims to bring everything I\u0027ve ever wanted to work on together into one cohesive unit of storytelling using various forms of media and interactivity. Codename: Reliance will pull all my ideas under one \u0027cloud\u0027 of ideas, one world, allowing me to tell the stories I want to tell but also challenging the notion of what it means to deliver a story to an audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCodename: Reliance\u003c/strong\u003e will use multiple kinds of technology, from e-books and video games to film and animation, to tell this overarching story of a world that\u0027s full of danger, delight and imagination. Everything will connect to each other in some way, through characters, settings and events that take place within one another, to tell a story like no other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it\u0027s not going to be easy, and that\u0027s where I need your help. To build this world, I need time and (unfortunately) money, and as much as I have plenty of the former, I don\u0027t have anywhere near enough of the later. With your help and support, I can create and grow this vision the way I hope to, into something that truly is inspiring and fun for all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations to the project will go towards printing, creating and developing many ideas across multiple platforms. Whether it be paying for publishing e-book or physical copies, paying fees associated to appropriate animators, artists or coders who may assist in the creation of certain projects, or general upkeep of the \u003cem\u003eKartanym Productions\u003c/em\u003e brand and website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo give you an idea,\u00a0the following are examples of some (but not all) of the ideas currently being worked on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* A multi e-book series, starting with that very first idea entitled \u003cem\u003e\u0027Jacobs: Future Hero\u0027\u003c/em\u003e, in which our hero is a young teenager thrown into a world at war with an alien race and must face down this threat with the help of his son, who\u0027s memories were sent back through time as a warning for what was to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis series would initially be spread across 4 books, with two spinoffs to follow set within the same cast of characters (more on that later).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* The web series \u0027Mars\u0027. Currently in production on a very limited budget (which you can see via \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/marswebseries),\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/marswebseries),\u003c/a\u003e Mars tells the story of two adults within their blossoming online relationship, the hardships that come with it and the constant changes to the world around them. Season 2 is currently being prepped for launch soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCharacters, people and places within Mars will reappear and be referenced in other works, linking them all together into one. It exists both as a way of telling their own story, similar stories like their own and building a consistent world around them. I\u0027ll go into further detail on Mars soon, but check out the YouTube channel for our content so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Video game series \u0027Aegis\u0027 and \u0027Imaginacy\u0027, which I will share more about in the future. In short, similar themes, worlds and characters are at play within the two, though they are set within vastly different time frames.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth are envisioned as platform games, though Imaginacy is a more intimate puzzle platformer whilst Aegis is a large scale, 3D adventure title. These are long term goals that will no doubt require outside help in order to be achieved, though with the right help Patreon members can have a hand in their development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Graphic Novel franchise \u0027Blaster\u0027 (working title) is set in an alternate future created following a \u0027what if\u0027 event within Jacobs: Future Hero (i.e. if the Hero didn\u0027t win). In this world, everything has changed, though some would say for the better, as the entire male population is eradicated whilst the female of the species thrive with new found powers and abilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlaster\u0027s lead character finds herself the Queen of a newly created sport that mixes magic, weaponry and VR into a virtual playground of new stars, as the world around them continues to evolve under the lead of an all Female society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are just a handful of examples, the stories and mediums at play varied and unique. As time goes on they will evolve and grow into their own, yet still have links to each other in some way. With your help, they won\u0027t just exist in my head, but on the page and screen for all to share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs it a tall order? No, far from it. I\u0027ve set this goal as a long term project, starting with the publication of the first e-book and continuing the development of Mars. It\u0027s only a tall order if you let it control you, instead of you controlling your own \u0027destiny\u0027, as they say. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know what I need to do, I\u0027m confidant in my abilities to pull it off, and I honestly can\u0027t wait to share with you my stories and taking this long and wonderous journey with you all.\u003cbr\u003e"
