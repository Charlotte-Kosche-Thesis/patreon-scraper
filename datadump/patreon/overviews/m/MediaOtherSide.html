We need to continue our lives in the best way possible in the places we go. Most of the time, we are faced with having to work outside our fields as a waiter, construction worker, housekeeper and other sectors. We are not embarrassed by the work that we do however by forcing our own career into second plan, we are supporting the initial regime that led us into exile in the first place. When we keep silent, the class of people who are oppressed become completely mute.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who have gained experience in their careers eventually fall out of love with their job and become ignorant after having used up their knowledge. One of the main reasons for this is not being familiar with the language of the country in which we live, not because we aren\u2019t qualified journalists. Just as our careers have been threatened in the countries we are coming from, it is being limited in the way we perform it here as well. Therefore, in many countries individuals who support the regime, believe themselves to be the officials of that regime, stray from the actual purpose of journalism, take their own citizens for a fool, and completely try to hallow out the meaning of journalism occupy the media instead of specialized and capable journalists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to overcome these issues, by establishing our own platform we need to proclaim to the regimes that violate human rights that we are are still here and we will not be silenced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, in order to resolve the language barrier, each and every journalist will be able to find themselves room to publish anything on this platform, and will not be subjected to censoring. In doing so those who hallow out the true meaning of journalism as well as those who execute the regime by violating human rights, will continue to face true journalists.\u003cbr\u003e"
