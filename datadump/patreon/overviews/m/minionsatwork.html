    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\"Minions at Work\" \u003c/strong\u003eis a long-running web-comic exactly unlike all the other web comics. MAW isn\u0027t drawn, it\u0027s photo-illustrated using miniature sets, props, and 1/6th scale action figures, who all exist in a quirky meta-space in which their adventures are both \"real,\" and in which they have some awareness that they are action figures and that their lives are fiction. The fourth wall USUALLY stays intact, but on occasion gets broken. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter six years, the comic took a break for a while starting back in 2012. But after a major reformat (from single panel to full-page multipanel, and a to a greater reliance on continuing storylines) it has been back, weekly, for several years now. I did take a short break again early 2016 for a massive heart attack, a month in the hospital, and open-heart surgery, but managed to drag myself back to the computer within a few weeks of coming home. I\u0027m now doing great, untangling my tangled life, and excited about doing bigger, better, and hopefully eventually MORE comics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, in addition to my weekly webcomics, I\u0027m now doing exclusive added pages for the quarterly\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://pulphousemagazine.com/\"\u003e\"Pulphouse Fiction Magazine\"\u003c/a\u003e from WMG Publishing and editor Dean Wesley Smith. (You can see those too, with or without subscribing to the magazine. More on that in a bit.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut here\u0027s a little history:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Minions at Work,\"\u003c/strong\u003e the cult photo webcomic active weekly between 2006 and 2012 was NOT your usual webcomic. Originally started as a lark by action figure collector and national-best-selling author (in addition to his own original fiction and computer games for Sierra, he has also written authorized fiction for the worlds of \u003cstrong\u003eStar Trek, Conan, X-Men, Transformers, Mechwarrior/Battletech\u003c/strong\u003e and others). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.theminionsatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Minions-more-than-a-paradox.jpg?fit=1000%2C718\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeaturing the misadventures of a team of semi-competent, freelance minions-of-evil (we should mention that their first appearance predates the movie Minions of \u003cem\u003eDespicable Me\u003c/em\u003e by about three years), the comic was illustrated using photographs of customized 12\" action figures on increasingly elaborate miniature sets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6U0Ume346fA/VtrGZ3eHcyI/AAAAAAAASSY/rugnTtVJh1M/w1133-h821-no/box%2Bset-pit-IMG_5420.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012, serious family health issues and pressing deadlines caused me to put aside \u003cem\u003eMinions at Work. \u003c/em\u003eI intended to get back to it at some point, but I really wondered if anyone would notice. Producing Minions at Work had, by the end, involved a considerable investment of time, space, and money. Did anyone even notice I\u0027d gone?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.theminionsatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Minions-Dont-harsh-the-messenger.jpg?zoom=1.5\u0026amp;fit=1000%2C931\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTurns out they did. Fans tracked me down on Facebook and started saying things like, \"I sure miss \u003cem\u003eMinions at Work.\"\u003c/em\u003e \"Are you ever bringing the \u003cem\u003eMinions\u003c/em\u003e back?\" \"I loved the \u003cem\u003eMinions \u003c/em\u003eI wish you\u0027d do that again.\" Meanwhile, even though I\u0027d completely neglected the \u003cem\u003eMinions at Work\u003c/em\u003e site and hadn\u0027t promoted in years, the clicks kept pouring in, many of them funneling in through the popular site TVTropes.org where, unknown to me, some fan had linked several \u003cem\u003eMAW \u003c/em\u003ecartoons as examples of various tropes. And finally somebody said the important thing: \"Is there anything that \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e can do to help bring back \u003cem\u003eMinions at Work?\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.theminionsatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/unemployment-toon-1.jpg?zoom=1.5\u0026amp;fit=1444%2C1197\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eIf people wanted it that bad, maybe it \u003cem\u003ewas \u003c/em\u003etime to bring it back. And I really \u003cem\u003emissed \u003c/em\u003edoing \u003cem\u003eMinions at Work.\u003c/em\u003e I missed the fun of building the sets and props, I missed the characters I had built in my head, I missed the structure of that little, weekly, deadline. But after some consideration, I decided that if I brought Minions at Work back, I was going to do it differently. I was going to take the work seriously (or as seriously as you can take playing with your toys). I was going to change the structure to be able to tell actual stories, not just gags, and to more fully explore the characters and universe I had built up in my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first step was to move away from the single-panel format, and the exclusive use of unattributed captions for dialog. My model for \u003cem\u003eMAW \u003c/em\u003e1.0 had been Gary Larson\u0027s brilliant (and much missed) single panel comic, \u003cem\u003eThe Far Side. \u003c/em\u003eNot to compare my work to Larson\u0027s amazing run. That was simply the unobtainable excellence that I would at least strive in the direction of. But single panel cartoons are deceptively hard to do, in any circumstances, and even Larson often resorted to word balloons to sell his cartoons, and he had the advantage of actually being able to draw his characters mouths and expressions to clearly show who was talking in a given panel. I just had frozen-faced action figures, and had to hope that through gestures, framing, and dialog patterns, people would figure out who was talking.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also made a real effort not to \"cheat\" by using photo-editing software to modify or assemble my panels, or extend my tiny sets. I sometimes edited out supporting wires or stands on figures and props, hid a few seams or gaps in backdrops, or add an explosion of other special effects. There were exceptions, but I always felt guilty about it. \u003cem\u003eFor no reason! \u003c/em\u003eBecause ultimately, though people love the cheesy, \u003cem\u003eThunderbirds \u003c/em\u003eand I \u003cem\u003eJames Bond\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0inspired sets, and the sense of physicality that they provide, I realized that would mind those cheats, when necessary, if it made for better story, funnier gags, and the bigger world that my \u003cem\u003eMinions \u003c/em\u003edeserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo \u003cem\u003eMAW 2.0\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is multiple panels, with word balloons, much higher resolution, and stories that will usually be told in the equivalent of a comic book page at a time, often serialized over many pages if need be (though each page will hopefully have a stand-alone gag). When needed it will include miniature models and sets (smaller than my usual 1/6th scale), photo-editing for set extension, special effects, or to build \"connective material\" to tie together the 1/6th scenes. Here are a few \"prototype\" pages showing my early thoughts on how it would be put together (these are tests, and not intended to be great examples of my humor, especially the first two that are just random doodles):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.theminionsatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Test-cartoon-1.jpg?zoom=1.5\u0026amp;fit=1000%2C1464\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.theminionsatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Ninja-Spoilers.jpg?resize=768%2C994\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now we\u0027re full-on into the Minions at Work 2.0 format. Here are a couple of actual 2.0 comic pages:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.theminionsatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Clean-Break.jpg?zoom=1.25\u0026amp;fit=2550%2C3300\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.theminionsatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Disordered.jpg?zoom=1.25\u0026amp;fit=2550%2C3300\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the original Blogger site remains static at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.minionsatwork.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.MinionsatWork.com\u003c/a\u003e (mainly to keep those TVTropes links working as I slowly redirect them over), I\u0027ve set up a new WordPress based site at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theminionsatwork.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.TheMinionsatWork.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u00a0I\u0027ve reposted those original comic panels there with bonus behind-the-scenes content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.theminionsatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/minions-belt-tightening-makes-me-hungry.jpg?resize=768%2C583\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to be clear, contributions aren\u0027t required for the comic to continue, for the foreseeable future anyhow. I LIKE doing this, and as much as other work and life issues allow, I\u0027ll keep doing it. But it does influence the PRIORITY I place on doing it.\u00a0 If, through fan support, the comic were to start paying its own way, start generating even a small but steady income (as much or more as I\u0027m now making off the exclusive Pulphouse comics, for example), well, that would change things. That could make it a \u003cem\u003epriority \u003c/em\u003efor me, and give me a real incentive to put out new content faster, and the ability to make that content bigger and better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow much should you contribute? I can\u0027t tell you that. If you have an extra ten or twenty grand laying around, it would sure help add a dedicated \u003cem\u003eMinions at Work\u003c/em\u003e stage to that new building where I might be able to build sets bigger than a two by four foot workbench top! But as a starting point, how about contributing a buck (or more if you want!) a month? You probably lose that much change in your dryer or the couch-cushions already.\u00a0 There aren\u0027t a lot of contributor awards yet, but I do try to give contributors early access to comics when possible, exclusive behind-the-scenes stuff, and you\u0027ll get to see those exclusive Pulphouse comics are soon as they\u0027re published in the magazine rather than waiting at least a year like everyone else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you don\u0027t feel you can\u0027t afford or justify contributing, \u003cem\u003eI\u0027m totally okay with that!\u003c/em\u003e I still appreciate your reading the comics, making comments, and hopefully spreading the word about \u003cem\u003eMinions at Work\u003c/em\u003e to your friends, family, co-workers, classmates, and social media contacts! Every one of you out there is important to me, and I love just knowing you\u0027re there! (You are there, aren\u0027t you? I hear breathing!) \u00a0And if you can contribute \u003cem\u003eanything at all,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eto the cause, you are my hero!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 -- Your Minion Master, Steve\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.theminionsatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Big-Cheese.jpg?resize=768%2C618\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
