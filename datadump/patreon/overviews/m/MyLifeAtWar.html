It\u0027s a story about war, loss, capitalism, royalty, and mega-corporations.

He writes all the words.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMatt Materniak\u003c/strong\u003e - Professional illustrator and overworked amateur comic artist.

We\u0027ve been self-funding My Life at War for over four years and every year it gets harder to prioritize the comic with our actual paying work.

However, we\u0027re not always able to do that. We don\u0027t want to charge our fans for delays, so instead we felt the \u0027pay per page\u0027 model was more fair to everyone. If we really streamline our system we might even get up to more than 4 pages a month, but that\u0027s a ways off at the moment.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s us!
