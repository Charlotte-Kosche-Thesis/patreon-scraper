    "summary": "Hi. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy name is Sofie Hagen\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m a stand-up comedian. I am Danish and grew up in Denmark, which explains the accent. I moved to the UK to do comedy in 2013 and have lived here ever since. My first podcast was called \u003cstrong\u003eComedians Telling Stuff\u003c/strong\u003e and it ran for three years till July 2016, where it ended after a sublime\u003cem\u003e 9 seasons\u003c/em\u003e. My second podcast was a project called \u003cstrong\u003eThe Guilty Feminist\u003c/strong\u003e which I started with my friend Deborah Frances-White. I left that in September 2016, after which, I started The \u003cstrong\u003eMade of Human Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eMade of Human Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e, also called \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMohPod\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, is about \u003cem\u003econnection\u003c/em\u003e. I sit down with a lovely person and we talk about life. I want to find out how to cope with being an adult person. I want to find out how to deal with all of the confusing bits of life. All of the hurtful bits of life. I want to sit, for just an hour, with a great person and learn from them. And - if they have no idea how to \u0027\u003cem\u003eadult\u003c/em\u003e\u0027, then that will be absolutely okay - at least we will have an hour of feeling like we\u0027re \u003cstrong\u003enot the only ones\u003c/strong\u003e in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs most people are probably aware, it takes time and effort to create a \u003cstrong\u003epodcast\u003c/strong\u003e. Hours go into booking guests, finding spaces in which to record, meeting up and doing the actual interview, followed by \u003cstrong\u003ehours\u003c/strong\u003e of editing and sharing it on various platforms. Then there are the costs of recording devices, domains, \u003cstrong\u003epodcasting\u003c/strong\u003e platforms and the likes. This Patreon page is for you, as a listener, to support me in my doings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd I appreciate it a fucking lot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of love,\u003cbr\u003eSofie"
