    "summary": "Hello. So glad to see you well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re here, then odds are, you\u2019re well familiar with our\nmusic and entertainment magazine, mxdwn.com. Since 2001 we have dedicated\nourselves fully to trying to bring to you the best reviews and criticism, the\nmost informative news, and the most comprehensive features and information.\nWhen we began, entertainment journalism was an environment of extreme snark and\ncynicism. We found it to be mean spirited and close-minded, an unfitting\nrepresentation of what the vast majority of music fans actually listened to. We\nchose to believe in you, and the music that really mattered to you.  Our aim from the onset was to endeavor\nto bring you richer context, more insightful examination and an open-minded\napproach to content. We created mxdwn so we could focus on the best of all\ngenres, regardless of popularity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhile for many years we focused entirely on music, in 2012\nwe expanded our efforts into movies, games and television-related content. Since\nthen, we\u2019ve applied that same diverse, unremitting approach to\nfair-and-balanced coverage to those areas to great affect. mxdwn.com has grown\nfrom the home of \u201call that matters in music,\u201d to truly \u201call that matters in\nentertainment\u201d as a whole.  Yes,\nthe worlds of Daft Punk, Jack White and Faith No More now comingle with those\nof Uncharted, The Walking Dead, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Nintendo, Game\nof Thrones, the Oscars and much, much more.  You can call it geek culture combined or ultra fandom, but\nto us it is just servicing all that you love in pop culture and counter\nculture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd since we began in 2001, we did it all under the business\nmodel referred to as the \u201cgift economy.\u201d Yes, everything that mxdwn has ever\nbeen, has been free to all. It will remain that way for as long as it exists. We\nwill continue to provide mxdwn and its content to anyone who wants it, but the\nad-supported world of online magazines simply does not cut it. The revenue\ngenerated from ad sales and ad networks does not come close to the sales print\nmagazines of yesteryear could expect. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe want to do more. While our efforts are elaborate as is,\nwe want to do more. First, we want to shore up expenses to keep our operation\nrunning with regularity. Then, we want to better compensate our vast network of\ncontributors. If we can push past that, we\u2019d like to expand our efforts into\nmore detailed investigative reporting and eventually long-form features and\nvideo content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever enjoyed what we\u2019ve done, or relied upon our\nregular coverage and information, please consider participating in our Patreon\nhere. Help us do more for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor anyone that signs up, we have numerous tiers offered\nhere, but we\u2019re most proud to unveil a program we\u2019re calling mxdwn ADS FREE in\nthe $5 tier. Subscribers for this tier and all tiers above it in price will\nreceive a special login for mxdwn that will hide all banner and display advertisements.\nSo, if you can, join us here. As we progress we\u2019ll add more tiers and work to\nfind more ways to interact with you, the reader, to try to make mxdwn just a\nlittle more every single day all that matters \u003cem\u003eto you \u003c/em\u003ein entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd even if not, thanks for your time, interest and\nattention. It\u2019s our pleasure to give you more of what you\u2019re really interested\nin.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSincerely, \u003cbr\u003e\n\nRaymond Flotat\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEditor-in-Chief, mxdwn.com\u003cbr\u003e"
