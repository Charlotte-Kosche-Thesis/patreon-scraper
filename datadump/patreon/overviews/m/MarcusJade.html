    "summary": "My name is Marcus Jade and I write, produce, and play music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic is my calling. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much that my life has unfolded in such a way where I am able to express this in New York City.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt 15, I was gifted an electric guitar that has changed my focus to playing instrument as well as singing. This was something I had taken very studiously, having self taught myself around guitar. I was fascinated by it\u2019s sound and depth, and the capability to accompany myself.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter coming out of art school, unable to find a steady living situation, I worked menial and restaurant jobs, part time, seasonal, and crafted things to make an income for myself. Every spare moment that I had, I would write poetry and read books. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving saved up enough to move out of a small town in Indiana, I packed all my things and moved to Brooklyn in 2014 having only came to the city once, 10 years prior. I continued working restaurants and night shift jobs. After work, I would come home and play with my neighbors whom lived in the building and would play music until late hours. Having played guitar since I was a teenager, I was encouraged to take it seriously as I was told by those around me I had a natural gift to play. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided one night to play in front of a group of friends at a dinner party, and the response I received was surprising. My friends were happy to have heard me play and encouraged I keep at it. That night led to my first performance at Judson Memorial Church at NYU\u0027s campus. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI continued working jobs as well as playing shows at night. I made it routine to practice as consistently, conscientiously, and to play with passion. The more I practiced and shaped my skill set, I began to see results in the form of more shows and recognition. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never expected the first gig leading into another, and after a year and a half of playing, I would play at least 10 shows a month and travelling to surrounding cities. I never expected a kid like myself, growing up in Indianapolis, raised in a lower working class family, to be able to play in this city.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it has come to a point where I am an Independent musician, utilizing all the tools I have available to me through internet, technology, and a self sufficient personality. I have an opportunity to make a living doing what I love to do most. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic has the power to cure mental confusion, to build a common language and deconstruct barriers between people. I\u0027ve seen music played with people who couldn\u0027t speak the same language, but play in key, harmoniously. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work has been that. I\u0027ve played my story, and I\u0027ve brought together people who wouldn\u0027t have any other reason to. My music reflects an artist and the changing of the times. I wish to continue with the support gained from loyal followers and new friends."

By that time, he discovered he was drawn into and emerged in Indianapolis\u0027 eclectic music and art scene that found him at everything from house shows, underground and basement sets, to DIY venues. His appreciation of music allowed him to mesh with many outfits across genres, from Hip-Hop, to Punk, to Metal, to Zydeco, before settling into his own skin. This expression found him re-igniting his love and passion for blues music, writing and composing his own music. Currently living and jamming in Brooklyn, he has found a steady rhythm between offering his medicine at shoes across the New York City metro area and producing more songs.\u003cbr\u003e",
