    "summary": "I grew up listening to film soundtracks, singing along with Disney films, etc. And as I grew older I realized that I wanted to keep working in the field of film music. This is why I started Film Music Central: I wanted to create a place where anyone could come to find information on a film or a soundtrack that they liked and where they could share their thoughts on why they loved it.The blog has been running for almost 3 years and now I\u0027m hoping to grow it even bigger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges will help me keep the blog running by enabling me to keep up with the most recent films and soundtracks, as well as helping to pay to keep the website up and running. It will also allow me to invest in older soundtracks that are hard to find digitally so I can share the best of film music with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease feel free to check out the articles both here and on the blog at \u003ca href=\"http://www.filmmusiccentral.com\"\u003ewww.filmmusiccentral.com\u003c/a\u003e and consider becoming a patron today. All your support is greatly appreciated, I would not have gotten this far without you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a great day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecky\u003cbr\u003e"
