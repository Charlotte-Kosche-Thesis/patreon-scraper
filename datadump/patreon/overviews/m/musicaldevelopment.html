I\u2019m here on Patreon seeking support to create an interactive music and brain resource center with three components: 1) interactive activities for music and science education, 2) an interactive research and wellness publication, and 3) an interactive resource and support community for musicians and music lovers impacted by mental illness and other conditions of the brain. I have already been able to help hundreds of children and adults, individuals and families with my innovative approach to music education as an independent scholar and teacher locally in the Greater New Orleans Area and the Southeast United States. Now I need your help to share the many health and wellness benefits of music learning and music making with millions of people around the world online. Together, we can make musical development and wellness research, education, and outreach available and accessible to the people who need it most. Support this Patreon project now to help keep the healing power of music both alive and accessible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eAbout the Interactive Music and Brain Resource Center\u003c/u\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e (Coming Soon)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOur interactive research, learning and outreach centers online will provide access to innovative music and science education for millions of music lovers of all ages and abilities, and it will also open access to the many health and wellness benefits of music learning for millions of people who are suffering and their caregivers world wide. The interactive learning center will not only help kids and adults learn music, but they will learn about the brain and the benefits of music for the brain in a fun, engaging way. The interactive research publication will share scientific discoveries and research news about musical development and wellness in a multimedia format accessible to the general public. Finally, our resource and support community will provide a safe space for individuals and caregivers to share stories, make new friends, and get help. CMDW has already helped well over a thousand kids, adults, individuals and families through Miss April\u0027s music education, research and outreach initiatives in the Greater New Orleans Area and Southeast United States. With your support, we can reach millions of people around the world. We hope you will join us on this mission to improve understanding of musical development and to share the health and wellness benefits of music education online.

Music is a way of life and a source for healing and inspiration. Music is a means of remembering and communicating in the face of disease and disability. Music is a mode of self-expression when words and actions fail. Music is everything. For some, music is the only thing keeping them alive. You may already know that at least at least 1 in 4 adults and 1 in 5 children experience mental illness in a given year, and at least 50% of people will have a mental health condition at some point in life. Mental illness is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and suicide is the leading cause of death for people with mental illness. Unfortunately, at least 50% of people with mental health conditions never seek treatment, and the majority site cost as the number 1 reason. Millions of people are suffering right now, and as our population ages, millions of people become caregivers without enough support for themselves. In spite of these bleak statistics, music provides hope and healing. In addition to countless stories from individuals and families, music learning and music making have scientifically proven therapeutic benefits. When you support Musical Development and Wellness with Miss April, you help support our innovative research and teaching and make it possible for us to share our discoveries, learning activities, and help resources with the world. For millions of people around the who are suffering and their caregivers, especially for those who cannot afford traditional mental health treatment, you can help provide an alternative resource for healing and support through music. Follow and support this project on Patreon for updates on our progress. Together, we can share the healing power of music with the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Center for Musical Development and Wellness\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCMDW is an award-winning grassroots 501(c)3 nonprofit organization with a mission to understand and support mental health and wellness for musicians and music lovers of all ages and abilities through research, education, and outreach collaborations in the Greater New Orleans Area and the world online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSupport for Center for Musical Development and Wellness and Miss April\u2019s Musical Arts Studio comes from Music Teachers National Association, National Piano Foundation, The Ella Project, New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation, New Orleans Youth Education Center, SCORE New Orleans, TechSoup, Google, parents and alumni of Miss April\u0027s Musical Arts Studio, friends, family, and individuals like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for helping to keep the healing power of music alive!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027m an award-winning music educator, researcher, mental health advocate, and founder at the Center for Musical Development and Wellness, Inc (CMDW), the nonprofit home of Miss April\u0027s Musical Arts Studio.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eAbout Miss April (Me)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBorn into a musical family in which everyone learned an instrument, I experienced the many benefits of music first hand at a young age. Because of my personal experiences and family history with mental illnesses, developmental disorders, and suicide, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in the health professions. Because there were no existing training programs or courses near me that integrated music and wellness back in the 1990s and early 2000s when I first began my research, I earned degrees in both music and psychology and ultimately forged my own career path as an independent, interdisciplinary scholar and teacher.\u00a0I\u0027ve been teaching now for over 20 years, including classroom, community, and one-to-one settings. I\u0027ve also been a professional church musician just about my entire life since I was 12 years old! When I\u0027m not teaching, reading, writing, developing new lesson plans, arranging new music for my students, or presenting my work in public, I enjoy long walks and nature photography with my fiance at our neighborhood park and bird sanctuary. We also enjoy supporting our friends in their musical productions, catching up on our favorite shows and movies, and laughing out loud with our families.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eAbout Center for Musical Development and Wellness\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCMDW is an award-winning grassroots 501(c)3 nonprofit organization with a mission to understand and support mental health and wellness for musicians and music lovers of all ages and abilities through research, education, and outreach collaborations in the Greater New Orleans Area and the world online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSupport for Center for Musical Development and Wellness and Miss April\u2019s Musical Arts Studio comes from Music Teachers National Association, National Piano Foundation, The Ella Project, New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation, New Orleans Youth Education Center, SCORE New Orleans, TechSoup, Google, parents and alumni of Miss April\u0027s Musical Arts Studio, friends, family, and individuals like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for helping to keep the healing power of music alive!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
