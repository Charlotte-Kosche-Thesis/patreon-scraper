Finally in 2015, once the series was complete and the first edition of the book had sold out, MMM shared\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mymodernmet/videos/10154126556179299/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe film\u003c/a\u003e we had made about its creation. Nothing could have prepared me for the reaction it incurred. I was suddenly overwhelmed with thousands of requests for the book from all over the world as their post went viral and was viewed over 5 million times.
