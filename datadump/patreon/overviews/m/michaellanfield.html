My living expenses are extremely low, and all money is put back to helping animals and raising global consciousness. Any amount is greatly appreciated.

The heart is what contains \nhuman emotion, including love and compassion.

Why is this? \u003cem\u003eThe Lost Love \u003c/em\u003eexamines\n why we lost our innate love for all life, and what we can do to \nreawaken it within us, and cultivate that to the rest of the world.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout \u003cem\u003eThe Interconnectedness of Life\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Interconnectedness of Life explores humanities transformation from living by killing into living by loving. If we want to live in a more harmonious, loving and compassionate world amongst animals, the earth and one another we have to awaken to our true selves and realize the underlying reasons for the many human-made problems, that it is the animal foods on our plates and the solution to the problem which is to live vegan. Until we come to the realisation that nonhuman animals are not here for us, but rather here with us, and realise that we need to stop seeing them as property, there will never be peace and love on this earth. If the bloodshed towards innocent creatures prevails \u2013 wars, environmental devastation, world hunger, disease, and sickness are inevitable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eJourney\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Journey is an Amazon #1 best-selling eBook based on the ideas and teachings of Michael Lanfield, author of several books, including The Interconnectedness of Life and The Lost Love.

Each of our paths \nare intersected by challenges that test our abilities and capacities for\n empathy, compassion, and love.

Once we make the choice to live better today than we did \nyesterday our lives change. As The Lost Love alludes to the two main\n requirements for this transformation is moral imagination and emotional\n courage.

He also offers excellent references for further research. What I love the most about Michael\u2019s work, though, is that he goes to the heart of the solution for us all.

Michael has written a book that covers every facet of veganism. This book goes further than covering just the environmental, health, and ethical reasons for living a vegan lifestyle; in addition to those three well discussed pillars of veganism Michael covers other topics such as the spirituality of veganism, human rights, and even fruitarianism, a section that I particularly enjoyed. Michael breaks veganism down into its simplest form, and covers every aspect you could think of \u2013 and some that you didn\u2019t.
