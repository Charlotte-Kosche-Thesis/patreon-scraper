As a studio, Miyako Productions aims to work with \nmany cosplayers and photographers in the near future. We also develop \nsoftware and techniques that apply photography to video games, and video\n games to photography. We currently have two projects in the works. The \nfirst is a program that replicates common grids used on cameras as an \noverlay in video games universally. The program also provides an Image \nHistogram simulating the exposure of a camera in real-time. The second \nproject is a system to overlay real-time information from a car\u0027s \ncomputer onto a video feed, without losing the ability for the driver to\n connect and use their phone as a digital speedometer. Lastly, I will be\n participating in a number of photoshoots as a cosplayer, myself, as \nwell as a photographer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease check out http://miyako.pro or follow us on Facebook/Instagram @MiyakoProductions"
