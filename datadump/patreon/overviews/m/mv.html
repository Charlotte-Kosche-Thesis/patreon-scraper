Trust me, I have a list! With your help, I\u0027ll be able to spend less time finding ways to make ends meet, and much more time chipping away at that list of things I want to make!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon anyway?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPatreon is an online patronage site where you can pledge money to creators that you want to support. This keeps them from having to rely on external sources of income which take time away from creative pursuits, or those which compromise integrity, such as advertising. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI like it because it\u00a0creates a direct relationship between my biggest fans and my livelihood.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Support Me?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003eI currently spend 40+ hours a week working at a photo lab. This is not hard work, but it limits my ability to focus on work that really interests and fulfills me. I still make games and write in my spare time, but there are only so many hours in the day.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBy backing, you are doing two things. First, you are helping me to afford better equipment to produce my videos and games. And secondly, you are helping me get closer to my goal of doing this type of work full time. This would be a huge milestone for me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy essays and videos will always be free, as will many of my games. I will still make them even without your support. However, if you choose to pledge a little (or a lot), it could help me improve the work that I do and I will be beyond grateful. \u003cstrong\u003eEven if you can only give one dollar, it\u0027s still worth it to me.\u003c/strong\u003e Think about it, if you and 100 other people give one dollar, then that\u0027s 101 dollars!\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your consideration. :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo, How Does This Work?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eYou set a pledge amount and each month, I will receive the amount that you pledged, and you will receive the rewards that you select. Simple as that!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do You Get?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eYou get high-quality essays and video essays on games and game design. You\u0027ll also get games, probably puzzle games, when I finish them. I am also interested in doing some more presentations on puzzle game design and possibly other topics.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf you back at $1 or more, \u003c/strong\u003eyou will be notified through Patreon any time I put out a new game, essay, or video.\u00a0This is a great way to keep up with all the stuff that I do.\u00a0You\u0027ll also have access to any patron-only polls, and can help shape the way that this Patreon develops in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEven better, \n\u003cstrong\u003eif you back at $5 or more\u003c/strong\u003e, you\u0027ll get access to an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/18214019\" target=\"_blank\"\u003earchive of content\u003c/a\u003e which is completely backer exclusive!

As a little kid, I would tinker with things that I found and take them apart, often to the great dismay of my parents.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I discovered games at an early age, I immediately was transfixed.\u00a0Here was this world, rich and detailed, dancing up on the screen. I had a sense that there was something deep down, somehow alive, inside of the machine. There must be!\u00a0How else could it feel so real?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m not sure when, but at some point I put it together. Games were made by people! Perhaps I could make them too!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI spent a long time trying to make games like the ones I was playing. It was well beyond my capabilities, and resulted in little more than a pile of abandoned projects.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I got older, I became increasingly disenchanted with games. I never truly fell out of love with them, but they just seemed to have not grown up alongside me. It was something below the conscious level; I pried for deeper meaning perhaps.\u00a0I started to feel apologetic for games, loving them for their potential more than for what they were. They failed to nourish me emotionally or intellectually in the same ways that works from other mediums did.\u00a0Perhaps my father was right, maybe they were just for ten year old boys.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut things have begun to change. Yes, there are still several dozen blockbuster games each year with even emptier calories than the latest cartoon to receive the Michael Bay treatment. But bit by bit, smaller games by more risky creators have begun to push at the walls surrounding the current paradigm of games. It is impossible to tell how long this will last, or where it will go if it continues, but it has begun to be a beautiful and thought-provoking journey to follow the maturation of a 21st century art form.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI still try to make games. Bigger games in some ways, and smaller in others. The ideas are bigger, more important, but I have learned and am still learning my limitations.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMore often though, I write. I write about what games can be, and I write about what games are. Not in some romantic way though. I am no longer an apologist. Games can be beautiful, but more often than not they are ugly.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPart of me still wants everyone to love them though. To understand them the way that I do, the way that only someone who has grown up with them really can. Through my writing, I hope to communicate that love, along with the knowledge that I\u0027ve gained through a decade and a half of making games as a hobby.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn that sense, the ambition of my writing, much like that of my game design, continues to exceed my grasp. But it\u0027s a struggle. And I hope one day to reach them both.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
