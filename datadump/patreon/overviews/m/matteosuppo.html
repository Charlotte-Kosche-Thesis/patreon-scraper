    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Matteo Suppo, but you can call me triex (with the lowercase t, thank you).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do know me, you already know how awesome I am, so you can skip to the good stuff (just keep reading).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t, look left. No, the other left. Oh, come on, under my beautiful face! Read that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreat! Welcome to my Patreon page, my good person.\u00a0Here I will share with you my creations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey will be of two kinds: roleplaying games and trollplaying games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRoleplaying games\u003c/strong\u003e are pretty straightforward: there are players, there are rules. Players use the rules and bam! Here\u0027s a story! Who let it enter? Not me, I\u0027m innocent! I was just rolling dice!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrollplaying games\u003c/strong\u003e are a bit like roleplaying games, but they are less full fledged. They are experiments, or political statements, or microgames. Some of them may evolve into a full roleplaying game, or may give you an idea for your game, who knows? The name is a pun on roleplaying game and trolling, because I started out by making games that were satirical or that deceived the players in a way. They aren\u0027t anymore, but the name stuck because I\u0027m a sucker for puns. Eh!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway. This is what I\u0027m working on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRemember:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eGiant and terrible monsters attacks the Earth. Of course the only way to fight them is with Giant Robots. The only problem is that Monsters attack you mind and corrupt your memories. Will you let them taint with blood your past, or will you let them destroy what you care about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m kind of stuck in development hell for this one. I\u0027ll probably need to play it with someone to unstuck me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrey\u003c/strong\u003e: An immortal being that feeds on colors is forced to live eternity in a grey an immutable world. They will find someone who carry the rainbow with them. Will the immortal consume them to survive, or will they die to let the rainbow continue to shine?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the more ethereal of them. It\u0027s a bunch of ideas and I still have to tie them with a colored string. Did I mention I actually wanted to make \"eating cookies\" a mechanic for this game?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlpha\u003c/strong\u003e: You\u0027re a werewolf. You belong in a pack. Your alpha is dead. Shit. You deserve to be the next one, but so do you mates, and the territory must be protected. Will you claim your right to be the leader, or will you step back for someone more worthy?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNearly playable! There are cards and I just have to make a layout in order to print them for playtest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeathMate\u003c/strong\u003e: Death is trying to live as a human, for a bet, but she retained her supernatural abilities. Will she use them to gain an advantage on the chess board of her life?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the game I\u0027m playtesting right now, the one that\u0027s closer to be finished.

But it wouldn\u0027t be true: I\u0027m much more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a big ego, very big. And don\u0027t believe who says that size doesn\u0027t matter. I had to build myself an artificial modesty machine to keep my ego from going insane and start planning world domination. It\u0027s broken at the moment, by the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like games. I think they allow our mind to shape itself in new and different ways. I like playing and creating games. I used to be wary of it, because if there\u0027s one thing I cannot stand are amateurs. And then I realized there\u0027s only one way to stop being an amateur: take money from people to study and create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow inspiring!\u003cbr\u003e",
