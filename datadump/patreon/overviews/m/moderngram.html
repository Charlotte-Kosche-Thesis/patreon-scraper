    "summary": "I, Erica French, as Founder and Artistic Director of Moderngram have dreamt about this project for several years. I am so excited to finally be able to put into motion what I feel I was designed to do: Create, Move, and Connect. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am in a process of self discovery and change, and I feel that many people in today\u0027s ever constantly changing technological and cultural shifts, need to find ways to ground and connect. \u00a0In contrast to all the negativity of the world, we need to find ways to look each other in the eyes, and realize what is most important. Connection, truth, gratitude, and Love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we keep moving, we keep changing, we keep growing. I find utter joy in sharing these projects with other artists, to express, and in expressing, to connect to the parts of our humanity that is beyond survival - our self actualization; parts of us that make us feel alive, purposeful, to live with intention.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eModerngram portrays these concepts through Dancer for Camera Collaborations. I also like to use original music by musicians and songwriters who are equally as passionate...Movement is inseparable from sound. What we hear alters what we see. Perspective is often our platform how we move, what we believe, who we are.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eModerngram will release one video a month, and I hope they will inspire that you too, to keep moving, keep changing, being honest with your heart, and connect with those around you on a level that keeps us human, and fully alive. Often these films are how I am growing as a human too, so I do not try to hide the fact that there are imperfections, and inconsistencies. \u00a0You might see some real moments... I\u0027m not trying to hide, but to be honest. Connection can only happen through and honest lens.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only will there be short dance for camera projects released monthly but if you subscribe there will also be occasional blogs, behind the scenes shots and bloopers of course. ;)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy, and please help Moderngram and Contributing Collaborators grow!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(If Moderngram is able to raise $3000 by May, 2018,\u00a0local subscribers will gain a free front seat ticket to \"Boxes\" a full length live production on June 8th, 9th and10th, at The Bluebird, featuring some of Moderngram\u0027s most special artists and collaborators. Non-local subscribers will gain a free DVD of the event which will be captured by a paid professional videographer as a featured film. All Subscribers will gain a Moderngram branded apparel article to wear!)\u003cbr\u003e"
