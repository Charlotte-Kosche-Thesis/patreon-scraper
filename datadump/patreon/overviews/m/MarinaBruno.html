    "summary": "Howdy! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Marina Bruno \u0026amp; I\u2019m an independent filmmaker.\u00a0For the past 6 years of my life, I\u2019ve written, directed, produced \u0026amp; edited 11 short films and a feature film. And as most of you guys know, filmmaking isn\u2019t an easy or free endeavour. My parents and myself have been using money from our own pockets to fund all of these films, and I\u0027ve put all of my heart and soul into these projects. Literally.\u00a0I wake up, work on films, sleep, repeat. 24/7!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach of my films are available to watch on YouTube for free (and this includes my feature film, which I spent an entire year on)! Even though YouTube does pay for ads, the amount I make with that basically covers the price of coffee for my cast \u0026amp; crew. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so thankful for the insane amount of support people have been showing me, which has been the only reason why I keep going. I\u2019ve also started a 2nd YouTube channel about a year ago and since then have made over 70 YouTube videos and vlogs. This has become a full-time job for me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only down side to independent filmmaking \u0026amp; YouTubing is that it\u0027s hard to keep doing this (at the rate that I\u0027m going) and at the same time be able to have a 2nd job to be able to earn a sustainable income. So unfortunately, I\u0027m at a point in my life where I can no longer keep this up, and so I either need to make a living with this or put it all aside.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo I am asking for your help! If you like the work we make and want to contribute a little bit, you\u0027d be allowing me to continue down this path and words really couldn\u0027t describe how big of a help this would be for myself and my films! Plus I have many new big exciting projects ready to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExamples of what your contributions will go to is letting me finally being able to pay my cast and crew, pay for film festival fees, and letting me finally move to Los Angeles and represent female filmmakers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019ll also let me have more time to do cool things like meet ups with you guys, do giveaways and it\u2019ll let me fully immerse myself into this career as a filmmaker and YouTuber. Your contributions will make me work harder than ever to make the highest quality films. And if you can\u2019t contribute, don\u2019t think that you\u2019re supporting me any less! Seriously, just by you coming by and watching my films and videos is more than enough support. But if you do wanna help out a dreamer like me then I\u2019ll be forever grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love you regardless and appreciate all the support you\u0027ve been showing me. With that said, let\u0027s make more movies! :)\u003cbr\u003e"
