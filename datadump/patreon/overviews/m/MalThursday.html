     "about": "Mal\n Thursday was born November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas. He spent his \nchildhood five miles from the Canadian border in the frozen wastes of \nUpstate New York, relocating to Western Massachusetts in the early \u002780s \nfor his college years and another decade and a half of post-graduate \nhangover that included five years, two albums, and an EP as lead singer \nand organist with the Malarians; seven years and a couple of 45s \nfronting Mal Thursday and the Cheetahs; 15 years and 30-plus releases as\n CEO/Sole Proprietor of Chunk Records, with releases by Guided By \nVoices, Lyres, DMZ, Sebadoh, Silver Jews, Scud Mountain Boys, and New \nRadiant Storm King. Mal also had a\n celebrated run as host and programmer of the \"Bay State Cabaret\" at the\n Bay State Hotel in Northampton, Massachusetts, a legendary live music \nvenue of the mid-\u002790s.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn\n 1987, \"The Mal Thursday Show\" debuted on WMUA-FM in Amherst, Mass., \ninitiating an on-again, off-again career in radio and television, with \nstops at WRSI, WFCF, WSOS, WQXT, and WFBO. The show is now syndicated, \nwith its flagship station in London. In 2003, Thursday created  and co-produced (with music historian Jeff Lemlich) the syndicated radio series \u0027Florida Rocks Again!\u0027 \u2013 \n which later moved online, where it found an international audience as a\n podcast on the GaragePunk Pirate Radio Network. The show continues to \nair on Surf 97.3 Flagler Beach (streaming at \u003ca href=\"http://www.flaglerbeachradio.com\"\u003ewww.flaglerbeachradio.com\u003c/a\u003e).\n \u0027The Mal Thursday Show\u0027 was revived as a podcast in 2007, when Mal \nrelocated to Austin, Texas. In 2010, \u0027Mal Thursday\u0027s Texas Tyme \nMachine,\u0027 the Texan variation on the regional approach established by \n\u0027Florida Rocks Again!\u0027 was spun off as its own show, as well as a \nfloating concert series, presenting shows at such Austin venues as \nAntone\u0027s, Alamo Drafthouse, Doc\u0027s Backyard, Uncle Billy\u0027s, and The \nHighball.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMal\n returned to the stage when the Malarians re-assembled for the \"2010 \nReunion Tour of Route 9,\" sharing the stage with Lyres, The Coffin Lids,\n and Eugene Mirman. He continued to rock upon his return to Austin with \nthe Texas Garage Project, an all-star show band, and as Paul Jones in \nMalfred Mal, a Manfred Mann tribute act. \u003cbr\u003e\n2013  saw the long-delayed release of the 1992 \"It\u0027s All Going By Too Fast\" album from Mal Thursday and the Cheetahs,\n plus the digital re-reissue of the Malarians\u0027 1986 \u0027\"In The Cool Room\" \nalbum, the deluxe CD reissue of 1988\u0027s \"Know\" EP and the 1989 live \nrecording \"Finished in This Town,\" and the UK vinyl reissue of their \nprofane holiday classic \"A Message to Santa Claus\" on Dirty Water \nRecords. Also in the works: Mal\u0027s\n first solo record, \"Texas Crude.\" Mal\u0027s cover of the Moving Sidewalks\u0027 \n\"99th Floor\" from those sessions is included in a new compilation album \nfrom R\u00e1dio Momento 60, alongside such garage greats as The Electric Prunes, The Fuzztones, and The Headless Horsemen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMal lives in Austin. He has a son, LBJ, a daughter, Tuesday Ann-Margret, and two ex-wives.",
