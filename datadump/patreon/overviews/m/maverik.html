After a while I got somewhat stale with most games I came across and while having not much of a good to do, I decided it\u0027s finally time to try make something on my own. \u003cbr\u003e\nUntil just year ago I barely ever got into programming outside of occasional usage of the developer\u0027s tools (i.e. WC3editor or G.E.C.K), so eventually I decided to make a game, picked up twine-like engine, which I later switched to Godot and you can see the results of my efforts at this point. I still learning a lot in terms both programming and game design and I hope with time I will only get better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are my goals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been setting my mind to becoming a creator for pretty long time and I believe my skills regarding analysis and overall design are notable. Sadly, in our current world there\u0027s a harsh limitations on what you can do on your own and how much time you can spend on creation of something free as, at the very least, you have to have some way to pay for food.\u00a0That basically forces me to seek hope for some support even though I\u2019ve already spent over 3 months on developing Strive with only me and couple of proofreaders. I do not plan on limiting or paywalling the game,\u00a0because I believe that artificially restricting access to my content would be a disservice to everyone who enjoys my work, not to mention being a kinda shady business practice. The very latest versions may only be accessible to patrons, but each full release will be available, free of charge, to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should You support this project?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am currently making the game, and planning to continue on it regardless.Your support would show that you\u2019re interested in what I\u2019m doing and would like to see more of it. (Not to mention helping me pay my grocery bill)  I can\u0027t really draw, and my english writing is pretty terrible, given it\u0027s not my native language, but I think there\u2019s room in the world for a game where you capture monstergirls, put them to work and, of course, screw their brains out. Your contribution is directly sponsoring more content, in both art and writing pieces for this free to play game."
