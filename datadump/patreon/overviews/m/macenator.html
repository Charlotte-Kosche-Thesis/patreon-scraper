Taking the time to see what I\u0027m all about means the world to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eWhy am I doing this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLet me first say that to many, including family members, I am a little \"Crazy\" for perusing content creation as a living. But for the first time in my life I can 100% say that I\u0027m doing something that I love. This is the first time that I can work for 12 hrs on one project and feel refreshed and hungry for more. The first time that I can, on a regular basis get 4-5 hours of sleep a night and not be bogged down. And I have Content Creation to thank for all of that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eAny previous experience?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am self taught through and through. I always joked in the beginning of content creation that in order to become a Youtuber (without any prior experience in video editing/audio editing) you have to watch videos on how to become one. \u003cbr\u003eIve spent countless hours watching and reading reviews/tutorials on software, equipment, and computer specs in order to achieve what I\u0027ve done so far. I am always learning and growing my knowledge base. I live by the motto \"If you haven\u0027t learned something new today, you\u0027ve failed yourself\".\u00a0 I started out as a fan. Ive since changed that title to Creator. And YOU CAN TOO!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat is my goal?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy ultimate goal is to become a full time Content Creator. I have a long way to go, but the work put in and the donations that are received all goes straight back into creating the best possible content that I can provide y\u0027all with, whether that be as a career or a hobby. It is my goal to put smiles on your faces, brighten your mood on a gloomy day, and ultimately make you feel like you are in a community that cares. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWhat currently goes into making the weekday videos\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI currently work a full time job, with that comes the stresses of not only daily life, but also the need/desire to produce content 5 times a week. To achieve this without skipping a single scheduled upload there is a total of 40-60 hrs a week poured in recording, editing, scheduling, and photo editing my content. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
