I\u0027m a bookseller by day and an artist by night, with a dream of making art my full-time job. I studied illustration at the Maryland Institute College of Art from 2006 to 2010, but the world of freelance has never been my style. Instead, I find that my best work comes from roaming far and wide and seeking my own inspiration. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s how I started \u003cstrong\u003eMy Arm Can Fly\u003c/strong\u003e, the studio and shop where I create a variety of fantastic creatures out of wool, resin, and anything else that suits them! My art dolls are inspired by everything around me. That can mean nature, but it\u0027s also fantasy, toys and dolls, kitschy decorations, you name it. It\u0027s hard to explain, but easy to show--in the last two years I\u0027ve completed over 25 different creatures, and these are just a few of them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://myarmcanfly.net/patreon/FloxBanner.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eOn top of my own work, I\u0027m passionate about bringing art and crafting into everyone\u0027s lives. I want to use my creatures and techniques to help other people learn and grow into their own unique art. I offer tips on needle felting and design and all the advice you can stand in hopes of empowering other people to create. I hope that my Patreon can become a hub for those who want to make their creative ideas real, and with that in mind I\u0027ll be making my first detailed, full-length photo tutorials exclusively for this page.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://myarmcanfly.net/patreon/AroloBanner.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m using Patreon to bring more of my creatures and creations to life.\u003c/strong\u003e As a working artist, I pay for all materials out of my own pocket on top of the hours of work I put into each of my unique dolls. With your support, I can widen the scope of my work with new materials, new colors, and new ways to bring them out of my studio and into your life! I know that not everyone can afford to help me, and that\u0027s okay. I\u0027ll still provide the same updates and photos I\u0027ve been putting out for the last two years through Tumblr, Facebook, and Instagram. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you can help out, you\u0027ll gain access to even more behind-the-scenes updates and even have a hand in the process!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://myarmcanfly.net/patreon/SnakeBanner.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be looking to my Patreon supporters to vote on color schemes, sketches, and other ideas as I move forward.
