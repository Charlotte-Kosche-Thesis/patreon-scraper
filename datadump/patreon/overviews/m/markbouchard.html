I am currently pursuing a BA/MA in English Language \u0026amp; Literature/ Creative Writing at the University of Chicago, and as an independent student, work to pay tuition. Studying and working greatly cut in to the time that I believe would be better spent working on art and developing my craft. I have published a series of comic shorts, two full length chapbooks and an EP of poetry, two solo folk EPs, and have played trombone on two albums, one with Speaker for the Dead, and one with the Dirt Red Brass Band.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am working on three creative projects:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHELL, ON MY COUCH - (a graphic novel that serves as an exploration of everyday life as someone with mental illness through the lens of a superhero)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHymnal - a short chapbook of liturgical poems helping me cope with my Catholic upbringing, while praising those who have helped me become who I am today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheme Song - a folk ep of songs titled after various tv shows. Thematically, the ep is centered around anxiety, depression, breakups, and self-discovery.\u00a0",
