    "summary": "I have been working for a while on a project to get my webcomics started, I\u0027ve been creating illustrations and drawing a few of the characters for a few of years now, but now I am focusing on the whole story, designing each character and giving them solid appearances, rewriting their histories and information, and writing the story. All of this will lead up to the drawing of the comic, Where the Stars Fell, which will be the foundation for several other stories that take place in the same realm. These stories will all be documented as the Chronicles of Whitehaven. The Chronicles of Whitehaven will feature works from two main authors (myself and my fiance) and possibly others, however, here, I will only post the stories and creations I have contributed to The Chronicles, with permission from the authors of characters that are not my creation. These stories are based on fantasy roleplaying adventures in the realm known as Whitehaven.\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tA world illuminated solely moonlight is rocked when a young god awakens for the first time. The story focuses on the awakening of a god and the birth of his kin. We follow the lives of these young gods who are discovering their power and trying to maintain the balance of the natural world. Love sparks, and jealousy strikes; if maintaining the balance of Whitehaven wasn\u2019t difficult before, things are about to get complicated! What is the fate of the gods? Will Whitehaven be destroyed before it\u2019s had a chance to begin? Find out in Where the Stars Fell!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003eWhere the Stars fell is a creation/origin story on a species called \"brood\", which are basically half human, half dragon with very humanoid appearances. It also focuses on the beginning, end, and rebirth of Whitehaven by the Brood Gods. If this sounds interesting to you, You might want to consider a pledge or follow! I\u0027ll be offering all sorts of goodies to those that do!\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhere the Stars Fell is what I want to focus on first (since it is literally the beginning), but other stories involving other characters that exist in the same realm will crop up as well. I have a great many characters, and they all have stories to be told, and they are all connected to each other. I hope that you will look forward to seeing what I have to share!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I want to do with my life is be an artist; I want to illustrate the thoughts and stories that come to my mind, and most of all I want to inspire others to create. I want to inspire people to become artists of any kind and know that it isn\u0027t impossible to achieve your goals, and to realize that your imagination is a powerful thing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy ideas for rewards as I get more funding would be:\u003cbr\u003eMonthly Patron Request Streams\u003cbr\u003e\nPrints in various sizes\u003cbr\u003e\nsmall thank you sketches\u003cbr\u003e\npost cards\u003cbr\u003e\ncalendars\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n...and more as ideas and/or suggestions crop up!\u003cbr\u003e"

Unfortunately as Adobe updates it\u0027s apps, my computer is having a hard time keeping up; it\u0027s 6 years old and the processor isn\u0027t qualified to handle the workload that I tend to do. Currently I can\u0027t even open Illustrator CC. Getting a new computer will improve workflow and allow more content to be released, as I wont be restricted by the limitations of my old computer.",
