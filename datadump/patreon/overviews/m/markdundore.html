    "summary": "Hey there, everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a composer and multi-instrumentalist who\u0027s getting back into music as a professional vocation after years of putting it on the back burner as a hobby. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore attending college at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (BA in Music, Cum Laude, 2011), I realized that my personality wasn\u0027t suited to a career in classroom music education or solo performance...so what attracted me to music?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSitting in the back of the band playing the tuba, I had a whole lot of time to listen to the layers of music that surrounded me; the tone qualities and timbres of the instruments, and the lines and layers in a score. Standing in the middle of a choir, I thought about how the vocal lines interacted. I realized that I wanted to be the guy who put the lines in the score and the notes on the page. I wanted to be a composer! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving had theory training in high school, I spent my undergraduate years learning advanced concepts: counterpoint, post-tonal music, and orchestration. Most of my work was written for brass, and while some pieces were rejected for being too radical and some for being too conservative, I gained a reputation as someone who knew how to write instrumental and vocal parts correctly. Inspiration, however, was something I needed; one can learn to be a craftsman rather quickly, but it takes a much longer time, coupled with a reach into one\u0027s own soul, to develop into an ARTIST. I\u0027m still getting there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make a long story short, I moved back to Harrisburg after dropping out of graduate school, during which time I worked three jobs and played in several different musical ensembles, while having two chamber pieces published and recording two more. Currently, I work as a private instructor of piano and voice and participate in several local ensembles as a tuba player or vocalist. After some time, I realized that I needed to get my inspiration back and make music my full-time endeavor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like nothing more than to describe myself as a \"musician\u0027s musician,\" but I\u0027m just a guy who wants to create, pay his expenses, and make a living. Thank you for listening and contributing! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave fun!\u003cbr\u003e"
