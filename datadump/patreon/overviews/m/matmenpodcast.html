As we continue to grow, we need the help of our dedicated viewers. We are striving to create high quality content each and every week. In order to realize our dreams, we need your help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are asking for \u003cstrong\u003e$1 a show\u003c/strong\u003e, there are \u003cstrong\u003e4 shows a month\u003c/strong\u003e, bringing your monthly total to a $4. That\u2019s it! That little! That simple! I truly cannot think of anything I could buy for $1, that would be worth more than supporting my favorite show and doing my part to get rid of pesky ads.

That being said  Feel free to fund as much as you would like, and help get us to our goals even quicker! \u003cbr\u003e"
