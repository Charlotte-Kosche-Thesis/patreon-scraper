It\u0027s called \"Normal\", and I\u0027m quite excited about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt takes a lot of time to create a comic page- or at least it does for me, and like a lot of people, I\u0027m time-poor, what with family and work and all, and that\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I do and want to see more, more often, then you are the key to helping me achieve that. The more time I can devote to my creations instead of to my day job means more pages and more comic goodness! It also means more time for me to refine my craft, so the work gets even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I get more time, and you guys get great comics to enjoy! Win-win!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why not contribute? You can do so for as little as $1 a month. At the moment, I\u0027m creating about 1 page a week, but I want to be able to up this to a full 20 pages every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the day, the comics is still going to be free, and everyone can still enjoy them, but this kind of thing doesn\u0027t happen without $$, and those who do contribute will get bonus content and my everlasting gratitude :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd feel free to drop me a line too. I don\u0027t bite :)\u003cbr\u003e"
