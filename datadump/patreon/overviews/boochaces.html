    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRancho Relaxo is a 501(c)(3) animal rescue farm \nand organization. The rescue has been running since 2013 privately \u2013 \nand, in 2015, celebrated becoming an official tax exempt \nnonprofit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRancho Relaxo\u2019s sole mission is to help every animal \npossible and we will not stop until every animal is heard. To date, we \nhave rescued over 300 animals \u2013 large and small, all deserving of being \nfree of abuse and neglect.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInstagram: boochaces\u003cbr\u003eFacebook: facebook.com/ranchorelaxonj\u003cbr\u003eWeb: ranchorelaxonj.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\n name is Caitlin Cimini and I am the Founder and President of Rancho \nRelaxo. I want to bring you all back to the beginning, especially since \nsome of you have not been following our journey since day one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne\n day, in late September, years ago, I decided to rescue a mustang \u2013 who I\n named Halona (translated: beautiful choice) \u2013 from the United States \ngovernment on a whim with one of my fellow animal advocates, Amy. We \nwere diving headfirst into this \u2013 without really thinking about it, \nwhich was unlike the both of us. I suppose one would say that fate is \nnot held back by natural human instinct in most cases! I eventually \nbegan searching for a farm so Halona could live in my backyard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter\n looking at over 50 properties with no success, I decided to take a \nbreak from it all. That was when I figured I would start looking at \nhorses in need of rescue or adoption, so Halona would not be alone once I\n did find my perfect farm. I came across a beautiful gelding who was \nrescued from being sent to slaughter after being retired early from \nracing. I contacted his owner, Lisa, and drove out to see him shortly \nafter. I never wanted a Thoroughbred. Come on! Who seeks out a \nThoroughbred?! They are not easy keepers. I will leave it at that. My \nfellow horse people will understand this lingo! I introduced myself to \nJake, the Thoroughbred, by gently touching his muzzle and offering him a\n smile. He looked at me so deeply \u2013 there are no words to explain the \noverwhelming feeling I got in those three seconds. Without thinking, I \nsaid, \u201cI would love to give him a home. Please. Yes.\u201d Lisa laughed and \nsaid, \u201cGreat.\u201d I then explained to her that I was still in the process \nof buying a farm in the area and I might have to keep Jake with her a \ntad longer. \u201cWe can work out the details. You are looking for a farm? \nYou should buy mine!\u201d I looked around her property and laughed because I\n already knew it was out of my price range and I honestly thought she \nwas kidding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat evening, there was a makeshift real estate \nflyer e-mailed to me from Lisa \u2013 listing all of the attributes of her \nfarm and such. To make a very long story short, \u2026 I bought her farm and \nadopted her Thoroughbred.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter moving in and becoming acquainted\n with the farm life, I began learning more about slaughter bound horses \nand animals in general. I was then gifted three old hens as a \nhousewarming gift from my fantastic neighbors, Donna and Clarence, and \nlearned very quickly how nurturing and instinctual chickens were. From \nthere, I began helping with transports and networking for other rescues.\n I also began fostering kill shelter puppies and kittens before they \nlanded forever homes. My mission was clear the day I drove out to a \nman\u2019s home who had two potbellied piglets listed on Craigslist, headed \nto an auction \u2013 advertised as food for exotic animals. When I arrived, \nhis children were throwing rocks at the babies \u2013 laughing about it as if\n it were normal to behave that way toward innocent creatures. I realized\n that the only reason these pigs were going to end up in a better place \nwas because their owner was greedy and wanted to get more money for them\n through a private sale than through auction. I sobbed my entire ride \nhome, just thinking about how scared they were. That was it for me. \nAnimals needed a voice somehow \u2013 and I was going to be the one to give \nit to them \u2026 until the day I die. That was what I was going to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter\n a few years, hundreds of abuse and neglect cases, thousands of tears \nand millions of little heartbeats that will go on and on, Rancho Relaxo \nis a fully functioning animal advocacy nonprofit and every year we spend\n all of our efforts turning that volume up for anyone in earshot to hear\n their voices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning a non-profit organization is expensive! Property, utilities, maintenance, marketing, feed, vetting, farrier, fundraising, transport, animal care in general... it all adds up very quickly. The more donors who sign on to contribute monthly, the more long term decisions we can make and the quicker we can expand! We will be able to rescue so many more animals because of all of you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE, BEING THAT WE ARE A 501(c)(3).\n                    \u003cbr\u003e\n                    \n                                    \n                            Help spread the word!"
