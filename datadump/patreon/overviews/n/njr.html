I decided to provide a more accurate illustration of where we stand in the production process of the novel works. I\u0027ve been very, very hard at work this past year really hammering out the 1st novel and refining it. I\u0027ll be posting Act 1 up here for everyone to enjoy! So check out the updates as they come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the Ahn\u0027Dia Project Patreon! \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat is the Ahn\u0027Dia Project? A series of rapid-release novels set in a fictional world that has been painstakingly built over the past several years. Tired of investing into fantasy novels that take forever to be released and drone on endlessly before a conclusion? You\u2019re not alone. The Ahn\u2019Dia Project promises a series of books set within the same world and that have been thoroughly plotted well in advance of their writing. The goal is to create multiple arcs which may span several books but quickly reach a meaningful conclusion.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe World of Ahn\u2019Dia is huge and dynamic. Within it are countless stories and characters to explore. This Patreon was erected to help fund the lengthy production of these books. Creating dozens upon dozens of plot threads, characters, and backstories takes a very long time. But the Patreon is moving quickly and the difficult part of the production is almost complete. So please, join us and become a Patron.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSample Newsletter\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll of our Patrons receive an in-depth Newsletter providing details on how the Ahn\u2019Dia Project is progressing. \n\u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/J4Kyd2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFeel free to view our first newsletter\u003c/a\u003e to see what you\u2019ll get each month in your inbox.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Author\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWho are you supporting? My name is Jeremy. This year, I turn 33-years-old. I was born in state of Tennessee, just off-center within the United States. I am a college grad.\u00a0 Most of my writing experience is largely self taught. I took some college courses to help refine the overall tone of my writing. However, I have been doing more than just simply dabbling in writing. This is certainly no hobby for me, it is a strong passion in my life.\u00a0 If you have any questions, I insist that you take time to contact me. I made a special email just for Patreon Q\u0026amp;A:\u00a0 \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nnjrpatreon(\n\u003cstrong\u003e@\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e)GMAIL.com\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u00a0\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/nBIwAAp.png?1\" style=\"width: 277px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tA Humble Request\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the past several years, I have\nbeen producing my novel series. These works of literary fiction have been a\npermanent part of my life.\u00a0 I have put great effort into seeing them completed.\nBut the production process is not necessarily easy, nor is it very cost\neffective. Works of personal fiction do not merit much income until they have\nreached a publisher and even then, it takes months for a book to make it to the\nbookshelves. In due time, my novels will be submitted to a crowd funding website called \n\u003cstrong\u003eInkshare\u003c/strong\u003e, which will allow individuals\nto purchase the final book before it is printed in order to pay for its\nprinting and distribution costs.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, before a book can make it to\nthat stage, it must first be written and the characters must be fully fleshed out and understood. Works of epic fiction go through numerous stages of growth and development:\n\u003cem\u003eConception, Analyzation, World Building,\nCharacter Study, Writing, Editing \n\u003c/em\u003eand finally, \u003cem\u003ePrinting\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0 before it can reach the hands of its audience.\u00a0 At present,\nI have reached the \n\u003cstrong\u003eCharacter Study \u003c/strong\u003estage\nafter three long years of World Building. Sadly, the funds I have set aside to\nhelp me pay for this book\u2019s production are running low; so low in fact that\nI have opened a campaign in which patrons can support me and help me finish the\nfinal stages of my book.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is where the service \n\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e comes into play. In essence, you will be subscribing to the project, paying as\nlittle as \n\u003cstrong\u003e$1 a month\u003c/strong\u003e to help the Novels grow and succeed. In return for your\npatronage, you will receive a monthly newsletter updating you on the progress of\nthe novels, along with various tips and updates in the affairs of modern computers\nsimplified for easy reading.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGenerosity is yours alone to offer. There is no\nreason not to say no, but I would not think any less of you for declining\nthis invite. My purpose here is to make you aware of one of my passion projects and\nallowing you an opportunity to help in its growth. If you have any ideas on how\nI can further reward you for your potential patronage, please let me know. I will\nbe more than happy to discuss various options to compensate you in anyway that I can. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YZfjZJX.jpg?1\" style=\"width: 386px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrief Insight on the Project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSince I was 14-years-old, I have been\ndreaming of a particular idea. Since then, many stories have been flowing\nthrough my head \u2014 all of which centered upon a handful of common characters\nthat have grown with me throughout the years. The story I have always wanted to\ntell has gone through several evolutionary changes and developed as I matured and became more world aware. In 2009, I took a stab at writing the novel for the first\ntime. The novel was completed and another novel quickly followed it. But to my\ndismay, I realized that the writing was subpar, and the overall message was lost\nto the reader. I needed to go back to the drawing board once again.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMost people do not write that first novel they keep promising themselves they will. I have already written two novels and\nanalyzed where the errors were. I have devised a way to fix my errors\nand make the story have true and meaningful impact for the reader. In 2012, I\nbegan production on the world in which the novels would be set. I have\nwritten six full length history books that outline in depth the cultures,\npeoples, places and things which make up the universe I created in these stories. This vast undertaking took far\nlonger that I originally planned. But the work has been worth it and the series continues to grow.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe World Building is complete.\u00a0 Now I am at the final stage before the deepest and most meaningful writing can\nbegin, the \n\u003cstrong\u003eCharacter Study\u003c/strong\u003e. My latest book goes into extreme detail; analyzing each\ncharacter that will play a major role in the story \u2014 excluding only the main\ncharacter, Samina. The novel series is about exploring Samina\u2019s mind and character development, allowing the reader to experience her\njourney and growth: ultimately becoming invested in her success. The current\nwork studies characters featured in the novel that will not be given the same treatment as Samina. As supporting characters they will not be so closely examined, allowing the story to read more fluidly without overbearing exposition. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce the Character Study is complete,\nfull production on the re-write of the first novel will begin. My test\nreaders have assured me that the changes I have made thus far have made the work\nprofoundly enjoyable.\u00a0 They demand more. Using Patreon will allow me to focus extra\ntime and effort to the project so that it can be completed sooner.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEven More Details!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u201cUnderstand that you\nhave been shaped by external influences.

I also do not like bland dialogue and pointless exposition, or the\ncombination of the two. By building this world from the ground up, I have provided\nmyself with the tools to craft realistic characters, personalities and\nconversations.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWithin the pages of my work\nresides a deep and meaningful message. Through this message, I wish to relay\nmy own life experience and what I have learned to those who would follow\nme.
