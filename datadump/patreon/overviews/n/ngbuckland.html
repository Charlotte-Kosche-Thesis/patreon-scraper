    "summary": "Video games have always been a huge part of my life. They were introduced to me as a way to keep me busy and out of trouble as a kid. I remember spending hours and hours every day playing every game I could get my hands on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround my middle school years, my mother came home with Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock. Apparently, her work was holding a Guitar Hero tournament and bought the game so she could have a better edge at the game than her friends. (We\u0027re a rather competitive family) It was my first experience with rhythm gaming, and I fell in love with it instantly. I would always be playing it, playing the same songs over and over again to get better and better at the game so I could show my family and friends just how good I was at it. I never knew that this game would be the start of my musical career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to the present day, I follow a lot of YouTube musicians and quite frankly, they all inspire me and influence my own music as well. I initially always wanted to do covers of songs; most of the time I find that cover versions of most songs are actually way better than the original versions themselves. With that in mind, and remembering how this all started, I wanted to reinvent all of the music of the video games I grew up with, as a way to \"pay my respects\" to these classic video games that have changed my life forever.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to celebrate all the video games that have bettered mine, and even possibly your lives as well, by taking the music and reinventing it into something just as memorable as they always will be. After much time and consideration, I figured a Patreon site will help me immensely continue my progress as an upcoming musician, but also as a way to continue the work I do already.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
