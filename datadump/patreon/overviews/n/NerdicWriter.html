I started with writing\nabout characters in fan fiction setting and always reworked the worlds to fit\nideas I had for my characters to endure. This quickly turned into a love for\ncreation of original elements and I gained (for some strange reason) a\nfollowing of readers who always supported my stories and encouraged to\ncontinue. To me writing is much more than a hobby or distractions from\nlife it simply has become who I am. I can\u2019t look at anything, watch, listen, or\nfeel something (yeah I said feel) without getting an idea for a story or\ncharacter. I can\u2019t sleep unless I get these out of my head and after seeing the\nfruit of my labors whether it\u2019s the best or worst thing I\u2019ve written yet I feel\nhappy and smile regardless of how I feel about other things. It\u2019s who I am and\npart of my personality for better or worse.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese strange quirks and features of myself drew\nin some pretty supportive friends who wanted to know if I had an original idea\nof my own or thought about creating a story. I never really put too much\nthought, but it made me think and that\u2019s how MYTH came to be. My good friend\nand heavy supporter who is now the artist for MYTH always encourages me to\ncontinue with this project and the reason I am here now looking for help. Every\ncharacter and every event that will be seen in MYTH is my greatest creations\nyet and has the most effort and love in them to date. It is a part of me and\nthe pinnacle of my creations and I\u2019m eager to share it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile some people seem to think I was blessed with\nthe ability to think of interesting ideas and stories the one thing I truly\nlack which hinders my ability to make MYTH is drawing. I can\u2019t draw anything to\nsave my life. If you wish for me to draw a person it looks like I am lying on a\npolygraph test or tried to draw a circle during an earthquake. It simply wasn\u2019t\nsomething I was gifted with and for that it means I\u2019d need to seek out someone\nwho doesn\u2019t have this problem. So I chose my friend and supporter of MYTH to\nembark on this journey of creation with me. I can\u2019t expect him to take time\naway from his own job, commissions, and family for free so that unfortunately\nmeans I have to pay him to continue to produce chapters for you all to read and\nsee. All money and donations are going straight to the fees of getting a new\nchapter and away from my pockets. Truth be told I don\u2019t want to get paid from\nthis I just want to be able to continue to produce a story for you all to read.\nI want to hear you all comment and enjoy it. First thing is and always remains\nhaving a goal to create rather then profit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Pledge?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI tried to think about a good reason to convince\nyou to pledge towards this project. Something to truly make you entranced and\nalmost feel the need to put forth the money, but truth be told I can\u2019t think of\nsuch a statement. This is a dream of mine and a project that is so young in it\u2019s\nlife cycle, but it\u2019s something I truly believe everyone will enjoy. This story\nexplores what it means to put everything you have into something and force a\nfuture and outcome that you wish to have. Making the most out of your life\nwithout hesitation and that\u2019s what I have to do to make MYTH happen. Truth be\ntold I will continue to pay for MYTH whether it\u2019s slow but sure intervals of my\nown money, but with you pledging I can make them steady releases that you can\ncome back on a set date and sit and read the 50-60 pages of content both myself\nand Lariz have prepared for you. You aren\u2019t just helping me to create a story,\nyou are helping fund a story you get to read, helping someone pursue their\ndream, and of course I will use this to motivate myself to write an even better\nstory. You won\u2019t be reading it, you will be experiencing the fruit of not just\nmine and Lariz labor, but your support as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhether\nit\u2019s just a dollar or a hundred I truly thank anyone who supports and donates.\nEven aside from donation a simple spread of word is appreciated. Thanks for reading\nmy wall of text and hearing me out and I hope to create a story you all enjoy.\nFrom the deepest part of my sometimes questionably existing heart thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
