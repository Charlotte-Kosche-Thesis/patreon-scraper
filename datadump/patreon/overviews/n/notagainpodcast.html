    "summary": "Hey people, thanks for dropping by! Welcome to the Pateron page for the Not Again Podcast! I\u2019m Gary, the founder, editor, host and fan of the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot Again Podcast started in 1st of April 2017, which we all know is a date in the calendar. People invented it a long time ago. This is the place where every week for about an hour, I chat with people whom I think are pretty cool to have a conversation with. An hour is also the most people can tolerate me. They are usually stand-up comics, improv comedians, poets and musicians, but I do have all sorts of humans on as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did this podcast not just because it\u2019s the closest thing to my dream of having a radio show, but mostly because I just want to talk to someone. I want to uncover backstories and hopefully learn more about my guest each episode.  It can be something philosophical like \"What is life?\", to something downright silly like \"Ooh paper!\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this podcast thing is currently self-funded, and I would like to keep it ad free. But for that, I\u2019ll need people that are cool enough to cover some of the expenses for this podcast. If you don\u0027t, I\u2019m cool with that too. I guess this is where I give you the reasons why I needed the money. The money that I gain from this Pateron page will be going to various places such as: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Server Fees for Episodes\u003cbr\u003e2) Equipment (Microphones/Cables/ Digital Recorder)\u003cbr\u003e3) Travel (Public Transport/Cabs/Ubers) \u003cbr\u003e4) Definitely not alcohol or beer. Promise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for dropping by this Patreon page. Whether you toss a few coins my way or not (but please do!) and I hope you\u0027ll enjoy the podcast anyway.\u003cbr\u003e"
