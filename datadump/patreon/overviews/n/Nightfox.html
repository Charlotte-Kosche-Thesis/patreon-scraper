And that there are vampire fanged deer that occasionaly eat meat? Clouded leopards that can hunt upside down hanging on only their hind legs like monkeys and that there have been ancient elephants with 2 half trunks and 4 tusks?

We already have a publisher who wants to distribute the comic once it is finished. But they cannot afford to pay us a year salary to create it. This is where you come in. For every 15 dollar I can afford to spend one hour on this project instead of something else that does pay the bills. And I would love nothing more than work on this crazy, badass story.\u00a0Once the graphic novel is finished, a part of the profits will go to a charity to help protect the\u00a0jungles and wild life of our precious blue planet. So the epicness that exists for real in this comic will keep existing in real life. ^^\u003ca href=\"https://scontent-amt2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/1462890_10201881147686793_2080529949_n.jpg?oh=8fac67a6ac720afcef0098839ab6290a\u0026amp;oe=598C8010\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-amt2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/1462890_10201881147686793_2080529949_n.jpg?oh=8fac67a6ac720afcef0098839ab6290a\u0026amp;oe=598C8010\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://elsdeckers.com/onewebstatic/d38b3ef80a-flyer%20fawz%20front%20rgb%20logo.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201881147686793\u0026amp;set=a.1494697883862.68175.1126525304\u0026amp;type=3\u0026amp;theater\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
