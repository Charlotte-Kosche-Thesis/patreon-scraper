In addition, to doing all of these things I write short stories, poetry, shoot photography and teach digital filmmaking at a local university in Atlanta, GA.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/ClLwiK0tn_Y\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are we here together on this journey? \u003cbr\u003eBecause I want to share some of my never seen before work with you all AND continue to produce projects for the masses from a perspective not often seen in popular media.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s so different about my perspective?\u003cbr\u003eMy parents are Pan Africanists and I was raised in a household that practices a traditional belief system from the Yoruba in Nigeria, located in West Africa. My brothers and I all have African names and that combined with our dark complexions led people to believe that we were in fact from Africa, even though we were born in Cleveland, OH! We were often the outsiders... observing those around us and looking at things differently. We were often strangers in our own land but, because of our \"strangeness\" others embraced us and we have friends who\u0027ve become our family from around the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, have you ever met a Black woman who knows all the words to Enter the Sandman by Metallica and Lloraras by Oscar De Leon? Now you do! You cannot get a more unique perspective than that!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything else?\u003cbr\u003eYeah, you never know what you\u0027re going to get with me... a documentary about African Americans reclaiming their African spirituality or an hour long drama about the space between life and death. Your patronage will help me keep working and will ensure that the Black experience recognized by pop culture is a diverse one with many stories to share!"
