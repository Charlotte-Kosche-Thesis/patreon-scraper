We are constantly trying to improve both technically and content-wise to give you a podcast experience you enjoy and want to come back to each week. Before we say anything else, please know that our basic weekly show will ALWAYS be free. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also feel it\u0027s important for you to know that we\u0027ve invested a lot of our own money to bring you the content you\u0027ve enjoyed. There will always be equipment to buy and hosting to pay for. We also occasionally take classes or seminars on a variety of skills related to the show at our own expense. Some episodes will require travel and thus will incur all the related expenses. These are just a few of the costs we willingly pay. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t misunderstand us. We do this because we love it and we knew going in that podcasting is rarely a profitable venture. That\u0027s not our goal for this page. But help in continuing and improving the show will be very much appreciated. If you don\u0027t see the reward tiers listed in the sidebar, they are still in development but definitely on the way. We want to give something extra to those who generously help us out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, you can always become a supporter now and still qualify for the reward tiers when they\u0027re available. Just click that big red button that says \"Become a Patron\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you cannot afford monetary support, we totally understand and are still thrilled to have you as a listener, and we thank you all the same. Again, our main show will always be free. For those of you who do choose to pledge, we greatly thank you for your generosity! We look forward to providing rewards to all of our Patreon supporters.Yours truly,\u003cbr\u003eChris \u003cbr\u003e"

That doesn\u2019t restrict our topics to Star Trek and hyperdrives. Have you ever heard anyone referred to as a [insert hobby here]-geek/nerd? For example, sewing geeks, car geeks, tech geeks, etc. We want to talk about, and to, all of them as well as traditional geek fare, such as cosplay, sci-fi, fantasy, science, TV \u0026amp; movies, conventions, and fandom of all stripes. We\u2019re even hoping to eventually hit topics such as lifestyle design, music, voice acting, life hacks, health and fitness, and the proverbial \u201cmuch, much more\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will do our best to keep it light and entertaining, but we can\u2019t promise not to get serious once in a while. We definitely want to hear from you. If you have any questions or show ideas, send them to nerdblisspod@gmail.com or find us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram @nerdblisspod.\u003cbr\u003e",
