That is common in this industry, and thankfully people like you and millions of others make pursuing our passions possible by giving us the most important thing of all, your time.For that we thank everyone who has tuned in and listened to us throughout our start of this journey, and we can\u0027t wait to watch us and our community continue to grow and evolve as this is just the start!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... what do we currently do? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis all started from us getting together and deciding that we\u0027d love to get together once a week and share our thoughts on gaming at large, but also primarily PlayStation. We basically did this every weekend anyway, so why not record it? With that we started Triangle Squared: A PlayStation Podcast, our foray into podcasting and making content involving the thing we love so much, video games! While Triangle Squared is our starting point, the reason we created the Nartech Gaming umbrella is for us to eventually grow into more content revolving around gaming, while not necessarily restricting ourselves to PlayStation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur promise has always been to be honest and keep our word. We\u0027ve now done that for one year with our podcast, fulfilling our promise of never missing an episode and we intend to continue doing that for years to come. We look to carry this mentality forward as we begin to branch out and evolve this idea into even more, and our thankful for those who want to join us, or support us in any way possible. Whether it is your time, your kindness, or your hard earned money, we want to make sure you feel like you are getting your worth out of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you join us in continuing this crazy dream!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNAR/TECH Gaming\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
