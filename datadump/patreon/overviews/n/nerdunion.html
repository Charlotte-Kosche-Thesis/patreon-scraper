    "summary": "Nerd Union started as a group of friends hanging out in college. As we grew up, moved away, and got real jobs, we decided to come back together for a podcast in June 2014. That podcast, regardless of how bad and rambling it was, grew into our website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nerdunion.us/\"\u003eNerd Union\u003c/a\u003e (www.nerdunion.us). \u00a0Discussing what is happening in the geek-o-sphere is our passion. We like to prod and examine, dissect, and discuss what goes on with the things we love be they movies, TV shows, comics, video, or tabletop games. But more importantly, we feel like it\u0027s a underserved segment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI imagine right now you\u0027re saying, \"Hold up, nerdy things like comics have become mainstays of Hollywood. How is that underserved.\" To that, I say yes, it is.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason is because nerd culture has been co-opted by advertisers and movie studios in order to sell to a broader demographic. They push shows like Big Bang Theory, or have their resident weird geek do their tech support on a show full of normals. The delightful weirdness of the comics gets watered down for mass audience appeal, and video games are becoming the most reductive of mediums. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to challenge that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to provide unflitered content that\u0027s not watered down by mass appeal, and we want to provide true reviews. If a video game is garbage we will tell you, not because they aren\u0027t paying us to tell you it\u0027s great, but because it\u0027s true. Mainly, we want to talk about things that no one else discusses, because that interests us, and we think it\u0027ll interest you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Coverage\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe, of course, do reviews of TV shows and movies that are of interest to our readers (which will include tent-poles), but we focus on gaming. We review board games that you may have never heard of, or cover a video game in an honest way. We discuss tips and strategies on how to play those games. We also discuss fan films, and talk to their creators, as well as discussing nerd culture in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Podcasts\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe are also constructing a podcast network. We are in the process of building a studio that we hope to renovate into a video studio as well. Currently planned is the continuation of our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/state-of-the-nerd-union/id1161114388?mt=2\"\u003eState of the Nerd Union\u003c/a\u003e podcast, a new history podcast called \"American Legends\" focused on telling the narrative history behind the first seven US Presidents, a Star Trek fan podcast called \"Red Shirt Rejects,\" and a Nashville, TN based radio show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill You Have Rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe do intend on having some rewards, but we don\u0027t plan on being super rewards heavy. We want you support us because you want to, not because you want a sweet backpack. We plan on doing game giveaways (both video and board games), and will look into adding more in the future. This will be an added perk of donating, and everyone will be eligible. We will notify everyone before and after a drawing. We will also add more perks as we have money to as well. We do, after all, want to thank those that support us with more than just great content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore specifically, by donating you\u0027ll get more access to us. If you donate on the highest tier we will collaborate with you on coverage and see what interests you, and how we would pursue it. We will also host a livestream for those who donate above the minimum threshold. Think about it as our own AMA, where you can discuss with us what we think about the news of the day, or even how to start your own podcast, site, business, book, whatever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe want to make this our full time gig. We will continue to produce and create because it\u0027s our passion, but the more that\u0027s donated means the more productive we can be. Specifically, we are currently pouring our own money into the site, and unless you\u0027re a behemoth site churning millions of clicks a month, you\u0027re not making money off ads. That being said, I don\u0027t want us to make money off ads either. Ads endanger journalistic integrity, and also provide a bad user experience. That being said, we have real costs. Here are some of them to give you an idea:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The site has to be on something somewhere right? We have to pay for that. You also have to host to podcasts somewhere else as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmail:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0we have to pay every month for our emails, because as a journalist, if i email the press office of a big game developer, they aren\u0027t going to give me the time of day if it ends with @gmail.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaxes: \u003c/strong\u003ejust in case you get sued by someone for something you said in an article, if you do that as in individual you\u0027re putting your house and home at stake. So we are a corporation to protect our personal assets. That also means paying the government what they require in taxes and fees. These actually far exceed any other cost currently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTravel\u003c/strong\u003e: unlike other sites, we cover conventions in person. The cost of hotels, gas, and food is real when these things are hours away from home.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriters:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0our writers are volunteers who cut time out of their own days to write about their passions for free. They pay for the games they review, and they get no money in return. We would love to be able to cover their cost, or at a very minimum be able to pay them a fraction of what their worth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
