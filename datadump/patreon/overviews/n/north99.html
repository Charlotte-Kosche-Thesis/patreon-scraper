You have probably heard of The Rebel, which reaches millions of people every month with their toxic right-wing ideology. But there are dozens of other radical right-wing groups online that are trying to do to Canada what Trump and Breitbart did to America. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd right now, progressives are doing very little to oppose these groups. Take a look at how the top right-wing online groups stack up against the leading progressives ones (as of October 2017): \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.north99.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Far-right-numbers-1024x343.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s not even close. And that\u0027s scary. Why? \n\u003cstrong\u003eBecause (according to Abacus Research), 51% of Canadians get their news from onlien sources, and 21% of Canadians report Facebook is their primary source of news, just a few points behind TV. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn YouTube it\u0027s even worse. Rebel Media has more subscribers than any mainstream media news outlet in Canada. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.north99.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/YouTube-Subcribers-1024x647.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYou might think it\u0027s not a big deal. But a poll by Abacus Data showed that Canadians get 51% of their news from online sources, versus 20% for TV. That\u0027s really scary...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRebel Media and other far-right groups like them are winning and progressive groups are doing nothing about it. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd if we let them spread their message unopposed, they WILL bring Trump-style right-wing politics to Canada.
