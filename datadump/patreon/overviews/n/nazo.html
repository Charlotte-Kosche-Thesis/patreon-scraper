    "summary": "My name is Nazo Zakkak, and I write Orthodox Christian hymns.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA little bit about me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI was a Jazz pianist during my undergrad days and performed all over the States (including New York, which was a dream come true) as well as at some international music festivals. I received my MFA in Integrated Composition, Improvisation, and Technology from UC Irvine...which is an absolutely fantastic program that I cannot recommend enough. During my school days I played in a lot of different bands in genres ranging from Classical to Hip Hop, Drum \u0027n\u0027 Bass to Doom Metal, Noise music to Ambient music. But a huge shift had taken over my life and my attention turned towards something else...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I got into Orthodox Hymnography:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI suffered a serious hand injury during a recording session in 2010 which only got worse with time. Shorty thereafter, while my piano technique was deteriorating, I was involved in a car accident that injured my left ear and seriously affected my hearing for about a year (the effects of this injury still persist). All this to say I was forced out of performing by these events and took a job at a music publishing company. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing musically inactive was one of the hardest phases of my life, but it was during this time I read through some amazing Russian Orthodox choral scores and was encouraged by a dear friend to try my hand at arranging a chant-line for a Great Doxology. So long story short, I brushed up on my Counterpoint, maniacally studied Rachmaninoff\u0027s choral works, and harmonized my first hymn which ended up being directed by Maestro Vladimir Gorbik and released on a CD by St. Vladimir\u0027s Seminary Press.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.svspress.com/their-proclamation-selections-from-vespers-and-matins-of-the-feast-of-sts-peter-and-paul/\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAfter that, things just took off. I received requests from monasteries and churches to write hymns for them, to lead masterclasses, and from church and professional choirs to perform and record my music. In early 2017, I released an album, \u003cem\u003eLuxari,\u003c/em\u003e highlighting some of the best work of this period; this can be found here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/nazozakkak1\"\u003ehttps://store.cdbaby.com/cd/nazozakkak1\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eI currently direct the choir at St. Anthony the Great Antiochian Orthodox Church in San Diego, California.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the purpose?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy aim in writing Orthodox Christian hymns is twofold:\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo Serve\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. I seek to provide the best music that I can in service of our Church and our Faith. This means that, with enough support, I\u0027ll have 4-part, 2-part, and unison arrangements of every hymn to accommodate as many choirs/chanters as possible. None of this music is meant to uproot any of the beautiful, essential music of our Byzantine, Russian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, and Romanian Orthodox traditions; rather, by studying these traditions and researching the liturgics of the services, I hope to write music that is inspired by these traditions and supplements them.\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eTo Inspire. \u003c/i\u003eThe biggest takeaway from this whole experience has been learning how passionate, powerful, and salvific the hymns of our Church are! I am most joyful when someone tells me how they finally \"get\" the meaning of a hymn. At this time, with the help of God, I am fully concentrating on composing Orthodox hymns; it is my joy and passion to write music for the Orthodox community. \u003cem\u003eYour financial support enables me to compose hymns full time, which I intend to do as long as God provides the means and the strength. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, if my music encourages you to try your own hand at writing a hymn, or composing a new prayer, or even if it just gets stuck in your head a bit, I pray that you continue to run with that and share that joy with others! To God alone be all glory!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this service work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou have a chance to officially support an artist! Here\u0027s how Patreon works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, you commit to donate however much $ you\u0027d like. You get charged this amount each time I publish a work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027ll go off and write a hymn, and when it\u0027s good and ready, I\u0027ll publish it, you get charged for however much you chose to donate, Patreon takes 10%, and you\u0027ve just helped me introduce a new hymn to the world! I post each newly composed hymn on my website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.nazozakkak.com\"\u003ewww.nazozakkak.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s to stop me from publishing a thousand times and bankrupting you, you ask? Not to worry! \u003cu\u003ePatreon lets you choose how many times you\u0027re OK with being charged per month.\u003c/u\u003e Also, writing a hymn takes a \u003cem\u003elong \u003c/em\u003etime. Trust me, I have the utmost care for detail and attention in my hymns, so there\u0027s no way I\u0027m going to send them out before they\u0027re repeatedly tested and reviewed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we get enough Patrons, I\u0027ll also be making professional recordings of each hymn I write! These recordings will include each SATB part recorded separately so that singers can easily follow along and learn their part. Check out the Goals on the left for details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want specifics! What exactly will you be writing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe priority is to compose music for the Troparia of Major Feasts, then of Major Saints, then the music of specific services (Matins, Vespers, Liturgy of Presanctified Gifts, etc). I\u0027ll always keep you informed of current hymns I\u0027m working on. \u003cem\u003eYou can also request I work on a specific piece! \u003c/em\u003eCheck out the different Tiers of Rewards on the right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be arranging each hymn to fit the official text given by both the OCA and the Antiochian Archdiocese of North America.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have more questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDon\u0027t hesitate to contact me! I\u0027m incredibly passionate about Orthodox Christian music and am more than happy to answer your questions. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne final note:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for taking the time to view this page! Whether you choose to give, $1, $5, or more, (or even if you chose to give nothing!) I thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read this page. I ask that above all, you say a quick prayer for me when you think of it. Writing this music continues to be a beautiful challenge; I am incredibly honored that there has been such a positive response to this music, and at the same time, I\u0027m humbled by the sheer amount of work needed to fulfill my goals. Above all else, a little prayer would be greatly appreciated. May all our work be for the glory of God alone!\u003cbr\u003e"
