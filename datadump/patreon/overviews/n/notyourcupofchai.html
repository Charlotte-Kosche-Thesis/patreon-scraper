Ali, and we are making this podcast as a labour of love. \u2764\ufe0f\u00a0 We think that there are too few voices of women of colour out there. So, we decided to make our voices heard. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are inspired by independent media, journalists, writers, artists, and we hope to inspire others through our journey and our work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot Your Cup of Chai is a platform that we\u2019ve created for ourselves, and to help boost voices of people of colour, immigrants, queer and LGBT and lots of other people from around the world. We couldn\u2019t be happier to share all of our work and passion with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started this podcast to highlight issues that are important and ongoing. Specifically, issues related to feminism, politics, socio-cultural norms, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHosting a podcast costs money, as does hosting a website, professional software and equipment, design work, and marketing - all things that we are planning to do over time to grow our audience. That doesn\u2019t even include the hours we spend planning and organizing each episode, editing the content, and putting out something that we\u2019re both proud of. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019d love to have your support. We are women who both work full time while trying to create quality content in this podcast that serves, informs, and delights leftists, progressives, and social justice advocates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever much you can spare, whether it\u2019s $1, $3, $5 or $20 per month will  help us continue to produce quality content as we grow our audience. We\u2019d love to remove the financial burden of hosting the podcast, and any contribution towards that is like a ray of sunshine to us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u2019t support us financially, we totally understand - and are incredibly grateful that you\u2019re taking time out of your day to listen to what we have to say. Your time is the most valuable thing we\u2019ve ever been gifted with - so thank you! Please do share our work with your friends, family, online followers - that\u0027s another way for you to support us and we would be very thankful. We\u0027d love to know about where you shared our work too! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~ \u003cstrong\u003eA little bit more about your hosts \u003c/strong\u003e~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKiran is a graduate of Anthropology and Sexuality Studies. She was born and raised in Pakistan, and has spent about an equal number of years living in Pakistan, in the United States, and in Canada. Working as a designer and communications consultant by day, Kiran has been an activist in many different worlds including women\u2019s rights around the world, LGBTQ rights, religious freedom and secularism, and anti imperialism and social justice.

She was born in England but has lived in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Coventry. Yes, surviving  Coventry is worth pointing out.
