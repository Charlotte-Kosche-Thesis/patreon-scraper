I\u0027m just one giant nerd if we want to get down to it. I\u0027ve been into art for many years, beginning from elementary school, but now I am finally giving myself the opportunity to expand and broaden my horizons with my creativity! Thank y\u0027all so much for helping me as an artist and as a person! I can\u0027t thank y\u0027all enough!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e_____________________________________________________________________________\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Da4u8v_U8AEHQyH.jpg:large\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE WORLD OF ANIME AND HENTAI\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI obviously can\u0027t state that I\u0027ve been watching hentai all my life, but anime has been a huge staple since I remember watching stuff like Sailor Moon, Robotech, Voltron, and Dragonball Z when I was young. There was just something about Japanese animation that really drew me in, whether it be the intense action scenes, heavy storylines, or just something fun and ridiculous. For legal purposes, I was exposed to hentai on my 18th birthday. *wink wink* I mean, sex is pretty cool, right? It\u0027s the same thing, but a different kind of \"action\" than what I was currently watching. Loved watching series like Cool Devices, Bible Black, New Angel, and whatever fan-art I could find on the internet. So viewing all these different art styles inspired me to make my own art and it has been pretty rad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eECCHI CLUB\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBeing a content creator has been a majority of my life once I hit adulthood. I originally started off by providing online entertainment through the means of podcasting and streaming, but I\u0027ve rekindled my love for art and creating content for those who share the same likes and loves as I do. I want to create a community for those who love anime, hentai, wrestling, or a combination of those three things called the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/ecchiclub\"\u003eECCHI CLUB\u003c/a\u003e!

Pledging to one of the many tiers will help out with the struggle of adult life (bills, payments, food, etc.), and help me create more time to make content for everyone! In turn, I\u0027m providing some neat perks as my way of saying thank you for supporting me financially as I spread lewd across the universe!

I\u0027ve started my community being on Twitch and creating friendships, and that is one of the reasons why I provide artwork for streams by doing overlays, panels, avatars, emotes, stuff like that. On top of doing stream graphics, I also draw fan-art and original characters for commissions.
