    "summary": "Hi, I am a disabled American artist \u00a0and fashion designer. My patreon funds will be used for funding my independent fashion label, painting supplies, sculpture supplies, art show submission fees, and for printing my visual art on fabric. Due to chronic physical diseases my hands can\u0027t make everything so I need help so i can afford to use 3d printing, laser cutting, and textile printing to help me create more mass produced art that can be shared with more people. 6 months ago I had brain surgery to remove a scary brain tumor but i am trying my best to turn my tragedy into a triumph. My fashion label is called the Church of Vanity. The Church of Vanity has been published in Vogue Italia and in the Daily Mail UK. Some celebrities have loaned our custom fashion pieces including Madonna and Lady Gaga. As a designer I strive to push fashion as an art-form and \u00a0mix the handmade with evolving technology. \u00a0The motto of my brand is \"Dress like your soul is naked\". I see myself as a fairy-godmother helping others embrace their uniqueness while transforming them into their dream vision of themselves. My style would best be described as avant-garde fairy tale princess with a dark glam rock edge. My biggest inspirations are the ancient past, magic, fairy-tales, and the future. All of my textiles first start out as a drawing or a painting by me. \u00a0I am all about innovation and evolution. \u00a0As a painter I tend to use gouache and or acrylic paint. I love working on large canvases and I coat most of my paintings in thick glossy layers of resin. My drawings are mostly done with colored pencils. \u00a0As a student I studied at and graduated from \u00a0Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston. My main passions are fashion, film making, painting and sculpture. I use art as a form of healing and as an escape from my physical disabilities."

     "about": "Nefertara is a disabled American artist and fashion designer. In 2011 Nefertara founded the fashion label the Church of Vanity. Her designs have been in  Vogue Italia, Faint magazine, Revelation magazine, New York Post, Paper Magazine, Art Tour International and worn by Lady Gaga, Madonna, Tokyo Diva, Kayvon Zand, the Daughters of Devotion, Anda Volley, Ang Kerfoot, and Boudoir Queen.  She was born and raised on a horse farm in New England. In 2007 Nefertara received a BFA degree from Massachusetts College of Art \u0026amp; Design. During her time at Mass Art she studied abroad in both Egypt and in Italy.  In 2007 she directed the feature length movie \"Sound-bytes\". After years of alternative modeling she bridged to fashion blogging. Buzznet.com was Nefertara\u0027s blogging site of choice for years. On buzznet she amassed several thousand followers mainly young girls who followed her original fashion art creations. After some extensive surgery from Crohns disease she was allowed to focus on art full time.  In 2011 Nefertara moved to Cape Cod, Massachusetts and created a myriad of art pieces in her secret mermaid grotto. Also, Nefertara spent several years as a club kid hosting avant garde and gothic parties in both Boston \u0026amp; New York City.  Currently, Nefertara continues to show her original art in New York City and in Boston. She does commission paintings and fashion pieces. In 2015 she was diagnosed with a brain tumor and despite her ill health continues to create art.",
