Not everyone has the same dream lifestyle, and ours seems to change often, however currently we enjoy full-time traveling through Mexico in our RV with our 4 kids and 2 dogs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://nomadtogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_4836.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve been digital nomads since 2014, but of course it didn\u0027t start smoothly and we have been faced many challenges along the journey.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBack in the day, we discovered a lack of support for full time traveling families. The struggles of culture shock, the thought of raising kids in a community that doesn\u2019t speak English, the support for families who aren\u0027t expats just wasn\u0027t there.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe had no place to ask questions. We were seeking people who have done this before, what are the tips, the advice, the possible pitfalls in what they were doing?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://nomadtogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_6368.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that\u0027s when we created Nomad Together to help and\u00a0support other families committed to pursuing their dream lifestyle. \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://2k7k22h9n1l3e4kkezs6zjcd-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Nomad-Together-Podcast-300x300.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSome may want to travel full time as a family, some may want to travel part time as a family, some don\u0027t wish to travel at all but desire to live where they want without being held back by jobs or their children\u0027s education. There are many inspiring stories out there, but the practical advice, the how to, the what next, the best practices, etc. That didn\u0027t exist until we created the Nomad Together Podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe now have over 50 episodes packed with actionable advice, insight, and encouragement of how to make this happen and how to address some things on the road you may have not thought of before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://nomadtogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_4001.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen you look at all the reasons we do this podcast one stands out. The fact that as we encourage more families to live their dream lifestyle we are impacting a whole generation. Imagine what these kids in these families will be like as adults. Imagine what their world-views will be and imagine how whole they will be by having their parents around and involved more in their day to day lives. By supporting NomadTogether you are in essence supporting all of the kids in this movement. Helping their parents to choose a better life for their kids.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eIt\u0027s now time to level up!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe podcast audience has grown, and now we\u0027re ready to launch this insider\u0027s community. This is a place to get the additional content that isn\u0027t quite ready for prime time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou see there\u0027s just too much going on to get all the great content out on a weekly podcast. Instead we\u0027d like to invite you to the insiders community where we will post member-only content. And yes it will be audio content but we may expand to written content as well!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://nomadtogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_5583.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur inside members (hopefully that\u0027ll be you shortly!) will receive more regular updates from us, you\u0027ll get more personal insights and you\u0027ll get the parts of interviews that go too long for the podcast or are significantly different from the topic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor example we recently recorded an episode on volunteering overseas, after the episode I asked the guest to speak on what it takes to make money travel blogging and it was a great short conversation that is perfect for our insider community (it\u0027s one of our first updates here!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you join us in the insider community we have plenty of rewards (check them out on the right hand side of the screen) and you\u0027ll be a part of an exclusive community that is helping spread knowledge and tools to this growing movement.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo is this Kickstarter?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eNope!\u003cbr\u003e\nKickstarter is about a one-time fundraising to get to the next level in creation or a product.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is for folks like us who put out (creative) content on a regular schedule, in our case (almost) weekly. (Hey, We are living a travel lifestyle and sometimes that gets in the way of making awesome podcasts!). So when you make a pledge here it can be a one time pledge but 99% of the pledges are per podcast episode. So if we skip a week, you don\u0027t get charged!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://nomadtogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_6222.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eAren\u0027t you just trying to get rich off of this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSure that\u0027d be awesome, we love getting on the Mic and love producing these podcasts for you, but let\u0027s be honest here. We have over 1,000 subscribers to the show, but to make a great show we have an editor and now a transcription service plus hosting and staff, it currently costs us $150-$300 per episode to produce and that\u0027s not factoring in our time. So until we get to the $300/episode pledge we\u0027re just talking about digging out of a hole, there\u0027s no profit here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003ePodcasts are free!! Why should I contribute?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile it\u0027s true that the NomadTogether podcast will always remain free, it is not true that it costs us nothing to produce it (see the point above!) And so I look at it this way, I LOVE paying for Netflix, I love what netflix is doing and I love the content I get from netflix. I also LOVE that it\u0027s ad free. I watch YouTube videos, and I suffer through the ads, but it ruins my experience and sometimes the ads don\u0027t interest me etc. Plus the content creators now are just working to get ad revenue. So we\u0027d rather not be another podcast with ads. Sure we could offset some of our costs, and some people do get rich podcasting with advertisements. However, with our audience Ads don\u0027t fit, and frankly they ruin the experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://nomadtogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_5774.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nInstead we want to offer you something more! We want to invite you to be a part of the NomadTogether Insiders community where you\u0027ll get more content, more information, and more insights (everything you receive from the podcast plus more!!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo you should contribute if you value what we\u0027re doing, if you value the content we\u0027ve been producing, and if you want us to keep going while you get exclusive Patreon insider updates (see the levels at the right)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat are your goals? What\u0027s the future for the Nomad Together Podcast?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell right now we\u0027re shooting for $200-$300 per podcast episode. It\u0027s actually not that much money, we only need 60 people to pledge $5 per episode. But that will get the ball rolling and help us produce great content to enable more families to choose location independence. Our goals beyond that are listed at the left. But in reality the focus for us is to give the secrets away, to help families find the events, the support, the tips and information they need to live this lifestyle or to live their dream lifestyle. \u00a0Who knows, maybe even some big \u0027meet-up and learn from each other\u0027 events may be in the cards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://nomadtogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_6011.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuestions?
