If you\u0027re reading this either you heard about me from somewhere or you like poetry and stumbled here on accident. Either way, Welcome! Please take a look around. I am a writer of all things but mostly I work on poetry. This is unfortunately not a big money maker. This is why you have found my wonderful Patreon. If you feel interested I would love your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently a student in Colorado where I am finishing my Bachelor\u0027s Degree in Creative Writing. Writing is currently my only job. I have an internship with OUTFRONT Magazine which is amazing but I work for college credit. I go to school full time which means marketing my writing falls to the wayside. That\u0027s where you guys come in. Together we can not only get my poetry to readers who want it (you) but we can also help a struggling author (me) pay his bills! So, what do you say? Shall we create something together?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t forget that this is a per-poem Patreon! If I get a big enough following I can change it to monthly however until such a time you can set a monthly limit for your payments. I will be aiming for at least two poems a month, at most four. Do not let my productivity put you in the hole, though! I will still love you and you will still get your much deserved rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me to survive being a poet so my words can help you survive the harder stuff, like global warming (those poor penguins). Thank you! Love you all!"
