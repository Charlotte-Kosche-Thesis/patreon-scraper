As of July 1st, I\u0027ve quit my day job and started full time writer life. Let\u0027s see how this goes!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m N. K. Jemisin, and I need time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m an author of \n\u003ca href=\"http://nkjemisin.com/bibliography/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003escience fiction and fantasy novels and short stories\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve been nominated for the Nebula and Hugo so many times that I\u0027m starting to lose count. I\u0027ve won the Locus Award and the Romantic Times Reviewers\u0027 Choice Award and I\u0027m currently on \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/100-notable-books-of-2015.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe New York Times Notable Books list\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve published six novels so far -- \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19161852-the-fifth-season\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe most recent one\u003c/a\u003e came out in August 2015, the seventh is forthcoming in August 2016, and the eighth is due out sometime next year (hopefully August 2017). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s the problem, though: I have a full time day job, and a writing career. Unfortunately the writing career -- like any small business -- has become more than full time over the years.\u00a0 Between travel, constant meetings, affiliated side-gigs, and promotion (e.g. interviews, speaking engagements, signings), I\u0027d say it takes up about 50-60 hours per week.\u00a0 The day job is 40 hours. There are 160 hours in a week.\u00a0 You do the math. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love my day job... but I\u0027m getting tired. Working 9-7 most days doesn\u0027t leave me with a lot of energy to write at the end of it, though I do anyway because that\u0027s how you finish a book a year. Doing this forces me to choose between competing needs, however:\u00a0 write, or get some stress-relieving exercise? Write, or research home health care agencies for my mother?\u00a0 Write, or do book promo work like blog posts or interviews? Lately I haven\u0027t been able to choose \"write\" as much as I should, so I\u0027m behind schedule on book 3 of the Broken Earth trilogy.\u00a0 But really, the time crunch is taking a toll on every part of my life.\u00a0 I can\u0027t remember the\n last time I took a real, non-working vacation. I don\u0027t watch much TV anymore.\u00a0 (I make time for Steven Universe and \u003ca href=\"http://www.cnn.com/shows/united-shades-of-america\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy cousin\u0027s show\u003c/a\u003e. But that\u0027s it.)\u00a0 I\u0027m not as healthy as I should be.\u00a0 I\u0027ve also been losing sleep worrying about my two aging parents who live 1200 miles apart, and who both have had serious health issues in the last few years. I\u0027m an only child.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDon\u0027t worry; I\u0027ve got a good therapist.\u00a0 But something\u0027s got to give. And I\u0027ve reluctantly concluded that it\u0027s time I devoted myself wholly to one career.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://nkjemisin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/so-why.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWriting income is inherently unstable. It arrives in dribbles and dollops, at unpredictable times.\u00a0 Will I make the same money this year as last year? No way to know in advance. Will I make enough to \nafford health insurance?  Possibly. Will the next check show up in time for me to \npay monthly rent? Probably not.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is why I\u0027ve a) kept the day job, and b) accepted contracts to cover my novel writing. The contracts have meant more predictable money -- an advance fee on signing, another on delivery/acceptance, another on publication. The problem is that this nice predictable money comes with deadlines, which force me to sacrifice the more spontaneous parts of writing life in order to hit those targets. For example, I love writing short stories; used to do six or seven\n per year. Now I\u0027m lucky if I have time to write just one. This is also why I only do reviews for the New York Times every other month; I can\u0027t guarantee I\u0027ll have enough time to \n\u003cem\u003eread\u003c/em\u003e every month. I\u0027ve had to turn \ndow\n\u003cimg src=\"http://nkjemisin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/meandatwood.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003en any number of really amazing pop-up opportunities -- convention guest of honor appearances, a\n TED talk, prestigious anthology solicitations, a writing-in-residence appointment, a chance to do a book series in collaboration with a \nHollywood director... \nbecause there just. Isn\u0027t. Time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd here\u0027s the clincher:\u00a0 writing requires reflection -- a room of one\u0027s own, in both the physical and psychological sense. I don\u0027t travel to other planets to get my ideas; I meet people and go places and experience real life, and distill that into my tales. If all I\u0027m doing with my life is working and sleeping and stressing out over how I\u0027m going to get everything done... well. Eventually that\u0027s going to take a toll on the quality and complexity of my writing. I don\u0027t want that to happen. If you\u0027ve read this far, I\u0027m guessing you don\u0027t, either.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://nkjemisin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/so-what.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTime. Specifically, I want people to invest in my writing business so that I can be more productive. Here are the things I\u0027d like to accomplish in the forseeable future:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFinish book 3 of the Broken Earth trilogy on time;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWrite a lot more short stories, and possibly put together a short story collection (or two!);\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWrite more side-stories set in the Inheritance, Dreamblood, and Broken Earth \u0027verses, just for kicks;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGet started on my next novel project, for which I\u0027ve already written \u003ca href=\"http://nkjemisin.com/2011/12/carving-a-new-world/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea proof-of-concept story\u003c/a\u003e;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSleep regularly. Eat better. Go biking and hiking and swimming more often. Breathe. All of these things will help me write.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://nkjemisin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/how-would.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to quit my day job. An extra 40 hours/week will make a big difference for my writing productivity. I can do this, safely, if I find another way to earn $2000/month. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://nkjemisin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/why-2k.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy rent is \n\u003cstrong\u003e$1600/month\u003c/strong\u003e -- yes, I know. This is reasonable for NYC, though; if you\u0027re unfamiliar with the area, take a look at \u003ca href=\"http://streeteasy.com/for-rent/crown-heights\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etypical rental prices in my neighborhood\u003c/a\u003e. I can\u0027t leave NYC because my father\u0027s here, and I wouldn\u0027t want to anyway, because being here is how I\u0027ve networked my way into a number of useful writing-career opportunities.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe last time I was unemployed, I got health insurance through the Freelancers\u0027 Union for \n\u003cstrong\u003e$400/month\u003c/strong\u003e. (The Author\u0027s Guild was worse, if you\u0027re wondering.) I\u0027m older now, so the premium might be higher; conversely, it\u0027s possible that with the ACA I can do better than $400.\u00a0 For now, that\u0027s the figure I\u0027m working with.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that\u0027s it. I\u0027m not look\n\u003cimg height=\"327\" src=\"http://nkjemisin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ozzynogood.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\" width=\"324\"\u003eing to replace my day job income; $2000/month will be a hefty pay cut, actually. I just want the most \"monthly\" portions of my life covered. The rest -- utilities, food, MTA card since I don\u0027t have a car, helping out my parents -- I think I can take care of from my writing income.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile patronage is building, I\u0027ll provide monthly content, but at some point if it becomes clear that we won\u0027t reach $2000/month minimum, I\u0027ll fulfill that month\u0027s content and then cancel the Patreon. (The goal is to make my life easier, after all!)\u00a0 If this Patreon earns \n\u003cem\u003emore than\u003c/em\u003e $2000/month, however, I\u0027ll incrementally add fun perks.\u00a0 Like what?

Still, my drafts are pretty clean.\u00a0 You\u0027ll see what I share with my writing group. Some of these things I\u0027ll go on to publish -- but given the usual vagaries of publication, they\u0027ll come out in their final form months or years later. Some will be things just for patrons.
