    "summary": "Greetings! First, let me thank you for taking the time to visit my Patreon in the first place and for even considering whether it is worth your while. For those who have already actually become patrons of this Patreon, you are greatly appreciated. I hope I can maintain your confidence in days to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t know much about me as a content-creator or wonder why I have launched this Patreon among other efforts, the introductory video on this page should answer those questions and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince you are already reading, let\u0027s get straight to the good stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting this Patreon, you will be helping me to keep my various projects alive, whether those are text, audio, video, or otherwise. I wouldn\u0027t want to ask for your support in doing so without offering something in return, however, so let\u0027s check out what kind of rewards and other goodies this Patreon effort offers that are above and beyond the content you will be helping to perpetuate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, the very existence of this Patreon is kicking off a new series of videos that will be posted both here and on my YouTube channel, which will provide \u003cem\u003emonthly \u003c/em\u003estatus updates on my various projects, whether directly related to any resources the Patreon is meant to help secure or otherwise, so you have a one-stop-source for all updates instead of needing to check various sites or Facebook pages. The first reward tier is simple and straightforward. For just \u003cstrong\u003e$1.00 per month\u003c/strong\u003e, your name will be included in the \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon thanks\u003c/strong\u003e portion of the credits for those monthly updates (both here and on YouTube, so others can witness your pro-active support). Your name will also be included on a special \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon supporter thanks page\u003c/strong\u003e in the next edition of \u003cem\u003eA Saga on Home Video: A Fan\u0027s Guide to U.S. Star Wars Home Video Releases \u003c/em\u003e(release date TBD but most likely after the home video release of \u003cem\u003eStar Wars: Episode IX\u003c/em\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second reward tier starts at \u003cstrong\u003e$5.00 per month\u003c/strong\u003e. This earns you the thanks credits from the $1.00 tier but also starts getting you new content I am producing that is \u003cem\u003eexclusive\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to this Patreon. This \u003cstrong\u003eexclusive content \u003c/strong\u003eis huge series of \u003cstrong\u003eMP3 audio commentaries \u003c/strong\u003ethat I record while viewing various \u003cem\u003eStar Wars \u003c/em\u003eproductions, which you can then play while you watch, just like a DVD or Blu-ray commentary track. These will begin with \u003cem\u003eThe Clone Wars\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0in chronological order, but it is my intent for this content library to grow to also include \u003cem\u003eRebels\u003c/em\u003e, the \u003cem\u003eEwok\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0telemovies, and more. A minimum of \u003cem\u003etwo new episodes\u003c/em\u003e in this commentary series will be released \u003cem\u003eeach month\u003c/em\u003e, sometimes more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third reward tier kicks off at \u003cstrong\u003e$10.00 per month\u003c/strong\u003e. At this tier, you still get the thanks credits and audio commentaries of the two previous tiers, but you also gain access to a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly Patreon-exclusive Q\u0026amp;A video\u003c/strong\u003e where I will answer pretty much any submitted questions that won\u0027t put my career or marriage in jeopardy. This video is not only exclusive to Patreon supporters (so you will not be fighting a horde of others to get your questions answered) but also guaranteed \u003cem\u003emonthly \u003c/em\u003e(unless there are no questions asked, which is unlikely), which is a bit of a departure from how my YouTube vlog handles regular Q\u0026amp;A videos that are often months apart and must cull questions, which tends to leave some out for time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond those tiers, I am also answering the requests of many fans by setting a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly goal\u003c/strong\u003e for us to reach. If supporters of this Patreon can reach a threshold of \u003cstrong\u003e$500 per month\u003c/strong\u003e, my long-dormant video series \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFrom the Star Wars Library\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0will be resurrected\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0on YouTube to continue where it left off with at least one episode per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoreover, I am offering Patreon supporters of \u003cem\u003eany \u003c/em\u003etier an opportunity to purchase a \u003cstrong\u003esigned copy\u00a0of \u003cem\u003eA Saga on Home Video\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Supporters can contact me for details, but the process is fairly simple. I will purchase a copy of the book and have it sent to me. I will sign it (personalized or otherwise, based on your request), then mail it out to you. The total cost to you would be \u003cstrong\u003e$20.00\u003c/strong\u003e if in the U.S., which covers the cost of the book, bubble mailer, and postage. (This may vary for international locations.) For details, simply contact me at \u003cem\u003enathan@starwarsfanworks.com\u003c/em\u003e for specifics. Be sure to mention that you are a Patreon supporter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, thank you for your interest in my works and this Patreon. Your support makes these kinds of projects possible, and I am grateful for the opportunity to give something back in return for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003eNathan P.
