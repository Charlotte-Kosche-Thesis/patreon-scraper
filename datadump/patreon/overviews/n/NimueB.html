    "summary": "Thanks to Patreon support, I\u0027m able to spend time every month writing poetry and developing a new fiction project. I\u0027ve been able to invest more time in making videos as well. Thank you. It\u0027s been a really validating process, and has stopped me from sliding into despair and giving up on creative work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years now I\u0027ve been blogging every day at \u003ca href=\"http://www.druidlife.wordpress.com\"\u003ewww.druidlife.wordpress.com\u003c/a\u003e - something I do for love. I\u0027m the author of graphic novel series Hopeless Maine, and over at \u003ca href=\"http://www.hopelessmaine.com/\"\u003ewww.hopelessmaine.com\u003c/a\u003e Tom Brown and I are\u00a0building a creative community to let people play and experiment in the world of Hopeless. I\u0027ve got an urban fantasy novel going up as audio episodes at bandcamp - you can listen for free on the site. \u003ca href=\"https://nimuebrown.bandcamp.com/\"\u003ehttps://nimuebrown.bandcamp.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve written books, and dabble in all kinds of creative things. I\u0027ve had modest success being published, but honestly, the industry is not healthy at the moment, and like most creative people, i struggle. I know there are plenty of people who like what I do, but up until now there\u0027s been no good space in which I could make that work for all of us. If you\u0027ve been with me on this journey, I thank you. I can\u0027t write without people to write for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write poetry, flash fiction, short stories, novels, graphic novels as well as non-fiction. I sometimes write songs and chants, I\u0027m a crafter, and a dabbler and a performer. I get bored easily so I can\u0027t keep churning out the same things. I\u0027m interested in all kinds of speculative fiction, disinclined to sit in a genre, and perfectly aware that these are not things that publishers are keen to hear from writers. this is exactloy what not to do if you want to be easy to market. I\u0027m also tired of this mad situation where poetry and short fiction are pretty much considered unpublishable. So, time to do something different...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not going to create lots of levels for people, partly because I don\u0027t want access to what I make being dependent on being able to throw lots of money my way. So my goals are going to be about putting more in the mix for everyone, as I can afford the time to do more. I see it as being more like putting the hat out when busking than seeking \u00a0a few wealthy sponsors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
