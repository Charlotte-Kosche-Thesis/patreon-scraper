    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Ness Io. I make music and art, and I need your help to keep going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/nyi8kalbu4njzqf/softbluehalo_selfie_sm.png?raw=1\" style=\"width: 438px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve not heard my work, I recently released an album called \u003ca href=\"https://nessiokain.bandcamp.com/album/soft-blue-halo\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSoft Blue Halo,\u003c/a\u003e and you can listen to it in full on bandcamp. It\u0027s also available on iTunes, Apple\u0027s streaming music service, Amazon, Spotify, Tidal, Google Play, and everywhere else you might think of. Even more recently, I also donated some music to the zine \u003ca href=\"https://thatwronglove.itch.io/transgirlilluminati\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTrans Girl Illuminati\u003c/a\u003e -- maybe some of you are familiar with my work for that reason! (If not, you might want to check it out; the money goes toward a good cause, and it\u0027s the only way to get my 3-track Fake Stars EP.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently working on my next solo album, but this would be made much easier and more pleasant if I had some money to purchase new audio equipment. My studio headphones are more or less falling apart at this point, and my speakers have been very old and dead for a good while already so I generally don\u0027t get to use them at all anymore. However, I can\u0027t afford the quality, durable replacements that will get me through the oncoming years because, since I recently lost my primary source of income, paying even for regular expenses has become difficult. (For instance, I can\u0027t afford medical insurance, so I purchase all my prescriptions for hormone replacement therapy out of pocket. This gets pretty pricey as you might imagine.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to pre-release my next album one track at a time through this Patreon. Everyone who supports me for at least $5 a month will get to have one new song to download every month! No one else will be able to listen to this album until all of the tracks are finished and released. I will also be providing at least one update per month where I talk about my progress, process, and any other personal feelings, which will come either in the form of a blog post or a video. Some of these posts may also provide annotations for the lyrics from my previous solo album or other music I\u0027ve already released.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving your financial help here on Patreon will allow me to produce more work and to get it to your eyes and ears faster than I would be able to without this foundation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/cyltad4s9zzdbpt/musicmusiccomputersmusic.png?raw=1\" style=\"width: 438px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic isn\u0027t all that I do, though! As you may have guessed from my album covers, I also do some visual art! Supporting me at the $10 level means you will have access not only to the tracks form my new album but to \u003cstrong\u003eall\u003c/strong\u003e the work I create before anyone else gets to see it. (You may even get to have some things no one else gets to see at all!) This includes high-resolution versions of any art I finish in that month, as well as any additional writing, videos, and all other music I make that is unrelated to my new album. Further writing beyond my normal updates is pretty likely, by the way -- I\u0027ve written before for \u003ca href=\"http://meminsf.silverstringmedia.com/author/ness-kain/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMemory Insufficient\u003c/a\u003e, and last year I gave \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5X5Cu6swng\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea talk at GaymerX\u003c/a\u003e. There are a lot of topics I\u0027m passionate about, and I\u0027ll try to give early thoughts on a regular basis to y\u0027all who support at this increased level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/da8da04a3188bc83c177aedb1c4a120c/tumblr_o6xvpvQIwm1sflsn1o1_1280.png\" style=\"width: 404px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, for $20 \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e get to choose one topic you\u0027d like me to cover or one question you\u0027d like answered in that month\u0027s update (which doesn\u0027t have to have anything to do with my music or art at all if you don\u0027t want it to!). It would be really neat to address these in video form, so if I get a few supporters at this level, video updates for everyone are a lot more likely!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I will be able to make my next album every bit as special as the last was, and I\u0027ll have the opportunity to create all kinds of other interesting things along the way. I\u0027m really looking forward to sharing my future progress with you all. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
