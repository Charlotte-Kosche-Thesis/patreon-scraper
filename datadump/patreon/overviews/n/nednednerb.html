Thank you for contributing or considering it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become a patron to my art, you will surely change lives, because I know I\u0027ve already changed lives so far. I\u0027ve reached more than 600 thousand views on my YouTube page, and my most often viewed videos relate to Schizophrenia. They are usually educational, awareness raising content or somewhat more creative representations, some produced when I was more in the middle of symptoms of psychosis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I\u0027ve received countless feedback, questions, and thank you\u0027s on my YouTube comments, often people who describe they\u0027ve gained insights or found solidarity with what I present. People want me to make more videos, and I want to make more videos. Making money on YouTube is very very slow going for me, so I am hopeful Patreon may bring me some appreciated support. If I made more money on the regular, I would be healthier and have more time and strength to create and promote more educational content, which can increase the difference I am making, which is a positive difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have questions, please ask!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProviding food and\nsupplies to artists comes highly recommended! Especially today on the\nInternet, it is sometimes not in the nature of the art form to sell\nartworks individually, and that\u0027s where Patreon and you have a power to uplift me.\u003cbr\u003e"
