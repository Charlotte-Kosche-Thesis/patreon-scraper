It started with a drawing of a Ring-wraith holding a cup of coffee in that classic pose the boss makes in the movie \"Office Space,\" saying \"If you could catch Baggins, it\u0027d be greaaaaaat.\" Also, he\u0027s going to need you to come in on Saturday.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis started a series of little drawings that I used (as the office administrator) as illustrations for signs \u00a0and e-mails, to interject some humor into \"Please make more coffee when you empty the coffee pot,\" \"The elevator is broken,\" and \"Out of Order\".\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/8a7e93ce80ff5f02034645688f7e1192/tumblr_onaddpmuEO1qcnpgso1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of them \u2014 predictably, when you work at a game studio \u2014 became intra-office memes. Unpredictably, at least to me, people \u003cstrong\u003ereally loved them\u003c/strong\u003e. I made a number of them that were basically customizable response images and I\u0027m happy that they live on in people\u0027s hearts, minds, chat channels and hard drives.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://78.media.tumblr.com/35c5d48fcff5a6d60dbd18347a430b8a/tumblr_olz3crTaVV1vkbyd2o1_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI still enjoy making them and am expanding\u00a0the idea into an entire series of illustrations that I call \"Office Wraiths,\" because \"Nazg\u00fbl Doing Everyday Stuff\" isn\u0027t catchy. Some of them have a more \"dogs playing poker\" feel to them (see: Nazg\u00fbl Brunch above), others are very straightforward jokes and others are Lord of the Rings references.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhere\u0027s This All Going, Then?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are two ways I can go with the series; the first is my initial thought to produce a couple a month and perhaps make a book of them. However, it occurred to me that perhaps this idea is better suited for a webcomic/periodical, and it\u0027s a matter of if I had more time to draw wraiths doing funny stuff, rather than making money). And that is where Patreon comes in, I\u0027m told \u2014 what if I could make money FOR drawing wraiths?!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://78.media.tumblr.com/231017d7729701842168972e8932291b/tumblr_olvtd5VK5j1vkbyd2o5_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the moment I have the rewards and payment structured as a per creation setup, although if I expand the idea into a webcomic and produce content related to it on a more frequent basis, it would probably make more sense to change to a monthly structure. I would like to, at some point, expand beyond \"just drawing wraiths\" and have regularly scheduled discussions or Q\u0026amp;A sessions about design or Tolkien in general.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eAnything Else?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/af4b2a039d51e7986fbdce8fbe9f1d3a/tumblr_oxyp9gJya71qcnpgso2_r2_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t just draw Nazg\u00fbl!

They tend to go to people who play and run role-playing games (like Dungeons and Dragons, or free-form LARP type games) and writers, although I am still more than happy to create non-fantasy artwork (including logos and typography!).
