    "summary": "We are two guys with an unhealthy interest in the paranormal and obscure. Our podcast explores some of the most unexplainable parts of history, focusing on what we know about these events and what we struggle to understand. Our research sets us apart, as we are not satisfied to bring you just hearsay and rumor, but rather trying the find the TRUTH of everything we cover! We publish new episodes as often as we can, usually weekly, and hope to cover a variety of topics that will interest everyone, from the true believer to the most die-hard skeptic. We would love your support on this journey, and to be able to bring you the quality content that you deserve!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll be honest. We\u0027re a little uncomfortable asking for money from our fans. We waited this long into our journey to even think about asking until we had a real reason, and as cheesy as it is, we found it this last week. This podcast is a labor of love. We put a combined total of at least 30 hours a week into this, in addition to working our day jobs and not becoming weird hermits. Between researching, recording, and producing, not to mention promoting, we spend more time on this than we do almost any other endeavor in our life, besides our actual jobs. Don\u0027t get us wrong. We want to be doing this. We\u0027ve had so much fun so far and look forward to a long and exciting journey on this trip with you. In fact, it\u0027s because we love this process and love our fans that we\u0027re starting this page. We want to give you the very best. That means upgrading our hosting to be able to provide more, higher quality content. It means expanding our research library, to bring you stories you\u0027ve never heard of before, or making you reimagine ones you think you know by heart. It\u0027ll allow us to invest in better recording equipment, to provide better quality in our recording. If you look at our first goal, it\u0027s only 100 dollars. We\u0027re trying our best to provide you with bang for your buck, giving you at least 1 hour of content for every 1 dollar you pledge. That\u0027s a heck of a deal in our eyes, but it\u0027s even more than that. It\u0027s a heck of an offering. If you choose to patronize our little show, you will have our undying gratitude, and we will promise to do all we can to be worth the money you choose to give. Thank you so much for your support. We could never thank you enough."
