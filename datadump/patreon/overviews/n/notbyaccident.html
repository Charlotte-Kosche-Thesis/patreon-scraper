I was single and had hoped I\u2019d find myself in a happy, healthy relationship with someone who wanted to embark on parenthood with me. That didn\u2019t happen and didn\u2019t look like it was about to, so I had to take action before it was too late.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been using my audio recorder like a sketchbook or a camera for the past six years, capturing important moments and conversations on my path to single motherhood, and during my daughter Astrid\u0027s early years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe twenty episodes that make up Season 1 are available wherever you listen to podcasts and at \u003ca href=\"http://www.notbyaccident.net\"\u003ewww.notbyaccident.net.\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI could use your help as I get to work on Season 2!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing an episode every two weeks is a full time job for me, but it doesn\u0027t pay like one. The advertising revenue is really just pocket money. I burned through my savings, sponged off family and friends and maxed out the credit card in the year it took to produce Season 1. It was worth it for me, I\u0027m proud of what I made, but I can\u0027t do it again. We need more money to pay the bills. If the series is worth something to you, I\u0027d be so grateful for your support to help me continue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNot By Accident\u003c/em\u003e is for Astrid, and for people like her. It\u2019s for anyone who\u2019s had to go beyond a passionate encounter to pursue their dream of having a baby. It\u2019s for women struggling with the momentous decision, some way along the journey or living as a fully-fledged \u2018single mother by choice\u2019 or \u2018choice mom\u2019 like me. It\u2019s for those trying to understand decisions and actions being taken by someone they love. It\u2019s for all the wonderful unconventional families who make the world a much more interesting place, and for all the wonderful people who accept and support us.\u003cbr\u003e"
