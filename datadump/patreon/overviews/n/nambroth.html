I\u0027ve been making visual art for as long as I can remember, and have been sharing it online since 1997.

You can see in the \"Featured Tags\" about how much of each I typically share! Both fantasy and wildlife art have been life-long passions of mine.

Personal projects especially tend to suffer. If you are able to help, I\u0027d love to put more time into pulling the images out of my head and into existence!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n I also enjoy painting artworks of endangered species to raise awareness, promote education, and conservation...\u00a0 and I try to donate to appropriate charities that work to save these wonderful animals, plants, and habitats. In the past I\u0027ve created artwork and donated to groups working to help. The Peregrine Fund, World Parrot Trust, and Kakapo Recovery are a few of the groups I regularly donate to, as well as donating work to other conservation groups such as Ducks Unlimited, and various local charities.\nCreating art for conservation \ndoes not result in income, so when people support me on Patreon, I am granted the privilege to finance such artworks that I am not intending to see a monetary return on.\u003cbr\u003eI also enjoy working on \u003ca href=\"http://www.fws.gov/duckstamps/Info/Stamps/stampinfo.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003educk stamp\u003c/a\u003e competition paintings, which are special non-postage stamps that fund wetland conservation! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, I had the immense honor of \u003ca href=\"http://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?ID=9402C4A8-F8C6-94FF-4EE8E2389A7CBCC9\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewinning the Federal Duck Stamp competition\u003c/a\u003e. This is a competition among some of the best waterfowl artists in the United States, and is akin to winning an Oscar or \"the Superbowl of Wildlife Art\". The Federal Duck Stamp sales go directly toward conservation, and to date have preserved over 6.5 million acres of wildlife habitat! Special thanks goes out to Patreon patron Chelsea Howe, who helped me get together the entry fee.

How does this work?\u003c/h4\u003e\nPatreon is a platform that allows anyone to become a patron of the arts. This is a stuffy way of saying that here we have a streamlined way for you to support an artist directly.\u003cstrong\u003e Think of it sort of as an ongoing, online tip jar\u003c/strong\u003e; if you like an artist\u0027s work, and can\u0027t afford or don\u0027t want to necessarily \u003cem\u003ebuy \u003c/em\u003ethe artwork regularly, but still want to support them in some way? This is a great way to do it. It\u0027s a nod of your head, saying, \"Hey, I like what you do, thanks for sharing, here\u0027s some support so you can keep going.\" It\u0027s all totally optional, and you can quit doing it at any time. When you pledge, you will be charged only once per month, and you can cancel when you want. \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can read more in the FAQ here\u003c/a\u003e if you have questions about how the money part works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to support you, but I\u0027d prefer to have something to show for it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eThat\u0027s totally reasonable!

Personal artworks are not done on commission and can be a bit risky for a full-time artist, because there is no guarantee that I will ever see a return on it. While I hardly create art just for the money, the financial reality of the world means that I must make ends meet if I wish to continue making art as a full time career. When I am supported by folks like you, it gives me a little more time to make things that might or might not earn me any money, and that is a beautiful thing!\nI often make personal artwork for habitat and animal conservation issues (see above), so that I can spread the love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://featherdust.com/mergswithawardsmall.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\tMy painting of Hooded Mergansers at a duck stamp competition.
