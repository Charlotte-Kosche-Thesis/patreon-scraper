I am a self-taught artist but I\u0027ve had many inspirations to be where I am today. I graduated high school in May of 2017 and now I must start making adult decisions in life like what college I want to go to, what future job I want to have (though I have a pretty good idea), where I\u0027d like to live and if I need a car etc... It\u0027s always been my passion since I was about 4 years old to draw. What I love to draw and express are my feelings through are mostly cats, animals in general. My feelings when I draw are found deep down in myself, and may sometimes take days, weeks, months, or even years to truly get ahold of certain feelings. Which in turn means that I won\u0027t be spewing out artwork continuously. It\u0027s normally hard for me to express myself, but when I get to drawing I love every second of it. I mostly just specialize in Cats. My passion for cats mostly comes from my love for the Warriors series, by Erin Hunter. A book series that I am really connected to in a way most people don\u0027t tend to understand. But it\u0027s not just about the book series, I love to draw cats to express my feelings because I can see all the ways cats express their own feelings. Since cats share all the same feelings dogs do, they have to express it somehow. And I see when they do, it\u0027s normally through the tail, the fur, the ears, and the eyes. All key features to focus on in my artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(195, 214, 155);\"\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(195, 214, 155);\"\u003e~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Commissions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to draw art for people, and I do draw more than just cats or at least I try to. So if anyone would like a commission, note it will cost you money since drawing specific things for people is kinda difficult, time-consuming, and I always try to put a lot of effort into a product that someone is paying for, so that also means time. Please be sure to provide a detailed description of what you want and if you have a picture reference\u00a0of what you may want, please provide that too. Keep in mind that anything drawn will be drawn in my own art style and not in any specified art style. Also if you have any issues with it when it is done, we\u0027ll have to work things out... but please contact me in private if you can about the situation or calmly state it on my wall. We should all be loving and caring and understanding of one another\u0027s situation so if I ever need time before I make the art you want, please know that it may be because of something personal going on in my life. I am just starting out in life officially as a graduated young adult, so there are still many bumps ahead and much for me to learn and get better on. Thank You in advance for understanding everything and I hope to get the chance to draw a commission for you.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(195, 214, 155);\"\u003e~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(195, 214, 155);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e~Thank You~\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://diysolarpanelsv.com/images/paw-prints-clipart-green-35.png\" style=\"width: 81px;\"\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
