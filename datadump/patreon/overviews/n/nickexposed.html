My name is \n\u003cstrong\u003eNick Mayo\u003c/strong\u003e. I am predominantly a bnw fine art photographer, currently based out of Grand Rapids, Michigan. I host this wonderful community we call Nick Exposed, both on YouTube and Instagram. I am husband to Emily Mayo, who is also an amazingly \u003cem\u003efine\u003c/em\u003e artist (excuse my husband jokes).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1377/8263/files/What_is_Nick_Exposed_large.jpg?v=1523758022\"\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nOver the past year, I have been creating weekly\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ead free\u003c/strong\u003e videos for the analog and fine art photography community, sharing successes and failures that I have experienced in my own fine art career and creative process. I wanted to be vulnerable in sharing these experiences with others, and more importantly opening the conversation for the community to engage in and add to the conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe community is by far the most important factor to the channel.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e These videos wouldn\u0027t exist if it wasn\u0027t for your wonderful interaction in the comments and livestream conversations, as well as financial support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1377/8263/files/How_I_make_money_large.jpg?v=1523758014\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe videos are written, produced, filmed and edited by me alone. \n\u003cstrong\u003eI have refused to put ads on the videos, and intend to keep it this way.\u003c/strong\u003e With that being said, my income from this channels comes in a couple ways. First as you have most likely gathered by now: through Patreon pledges. This is a consistent stable form of income for the content, in which I get to interact with you on a more personal and intentional level. Second, through affiliate links on the videos. When I mention products I know and support, I will include Amazon, B\u0026amp;H or other affiliate links when possible. These bring in a very small commission without adding any extra financial responsibility to the purchaser. Third, I generate income from my products. These include zine and print sales, as well as merchandise from my analog photography centered apparel line Two Stops Apparel (https://twostopsapparel.com).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1377/8263/files/Thank_You_large.jpg?v=1523758033\"\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\nThe content, and community engagement \n\u003cstrong\u003ewould not be possible without your help.\u003c/strong\u003e Like I mentioned above, Patrons are a large part of making all of this possible. I feel an enormous responsibility to deliver genuine, engaging videos and conversations to them -- to you-- and I work endlessly to do so. I want this community to be something special, and to be something you continue to look forward to each and every week. I continue to challenge myself in adding as much value as I can to our community. Thank you so much for your help!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
