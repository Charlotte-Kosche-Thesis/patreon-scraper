    "summary": "Journal of Things is a documentary web series on topics ranging from science to spirituality, and films to philosophy. The aim of this series is to introduce its viewers to reality altering concepts, philosophies and technologies and further explore our conditionings and maybe even challenge our worldview.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fmaa3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/24176821_514821372221256_7888967233019785055_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=95ad20704234720cf26df6b6f3e12913\u0026amp;oe=5B36D34F\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am Sudharsanan Sampath, creator of the YouTube channel, Northern Diaries Digital Media and the web series Journal of Things. I have many incredible things planned for this channel and for this series. I have plans for creating other web series\u0027 similar to Journal of Things, invite scholars and guests and host podcasts, publish short films and feature films. In fact, I am currently working on a psychological thriller feature film called The Shadow World.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fmaa3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17342545_398669330503128_1179138468381958515_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=8d1ddbdc5ed5120c5db7816378627707\u0026amp;oe=5B32AC90\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love producing videos and films for the Northern Diaries YouTube channel and I greatly enjoy creating Journal of Things. But it does take a lot of time and effort to make one of these episodes. From researching, writing, narrating to sourcing and shooting clips, editing, sound designing, and adding motion graphic touches, it takes at least 2 weeks, if not more, to produce one episode. So far, I haven\u0027t earned anything from this endeavour and I made every video out of incredible passion for storytelling. But in order to continue producing these videos and improving its quality, I rely on Patreon. Your donation will help me to invest in better editing software and free up my schedule to focus more on delivering great content for this channel. So, if you liked Journal of Things and are expecting to see more content similar to that, please consider donating. You can donate anywhere from $1 per video and up. If you are not in a position to donate, another incredible help would be to spread the word about this channel to your like minded friends and on your social media pages. I cannot do this without you. When I see the positive comments, read messages from people about how much they like Journal of Things, it motivates me to keep telling great stories, create more and constantly work on improving the quality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, thank you for checking out this page, watching my videos and supporting me.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e"
