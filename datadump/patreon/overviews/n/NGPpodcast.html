We have been making weekly podcasts since September 2015. Every episode is devoted to a different game that is at least fifteen years old. It can be any genre and on any console. It can be a game that is overwhelmingly loved OR a game that is universally hated. Each week\u0027s game is randomly selected from our ever-growing listener-generated\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/RetroMasterList\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRetro Master List\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eWhy have a Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eWe do what we do for you for free. That will never change. However, after a year of producing weekly content for our dedicated listeners, we have decided to bring you on board and to have you partner with us in our future endeavors. All three of us hold full-time jobs unrelated to the podcast. It\u0027s not necessarily within our goals to quit our day jobs and do NGP full-time in the future, but your generous donations will make it so that we can reasonably dedicate more time to this project and produce far more content than we are currently able to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have short-term and long-term goals that include things like video-casts, First Plays, bonus episodes, high-profile guests, content creator collaborations, NGP merchandise, Twitch streams, and much more.\u00a0It is with your support that we can make these dreams become reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eA special note from NGP:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eFrom day one we wanted to create a podcast that the three of us would enjoy listening to. We had no intentions of getting rich or famous. We had no false expectations that this thing would become an overnight success. We just wanted to translate our love for video games into a more substantial format that we could share with people like us. And then you stepped in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you have just stumbled across this page and this is our first meeting. Hello.\u003cbr\u003eOthers of you have been with us for the last year, faithfully listening to each episode and regularly sending in personal commentary or even taking the time to write kind messages showing your approval of the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor every single one of you, we want to sincerely say thank you. Thank you for listening to a single episode. Thank you for suggesting games to be added to our ever-growing list of games. Thank you for telling your friend about the NGP podcast. Thank you for tweeting us and retweeting us. Thank you for submitting commentary over a great game or even a crappy game that you played along with us.
