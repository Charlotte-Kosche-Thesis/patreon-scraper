    "summary": "Nintendo Prime is a dream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m Nathanial Rumphol-Janc and Nintendo Prime is a culmination of a lifetime of experience. It isn\u0027t just a place to find Nintendo news, discussion, and original thoughts. We don\u0027t just review games and Nintendo related products... or create engaging video content. Rather, Nintendo Prime is a community built out of what I know how to do best - talking about and creating content around Nintendo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor nearly 20 years of my life I have been creating and running sites dedicated to Nintendo. Starting with Zelda Domain back in 1998, I eventually became Editor-in-Chief of Zelda Informer from June 16th, 2008 when the site had a mere couple hundred hits and no social media presence at all until April 30th, 2017, where the site hauled in 40,000+ every day with a social media following that collectively crawled awfully close to 1 million strong. Along the way I founded MetroidWiki.org and co-founded a general gaming news site in Gamnesia.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I am proud of where I have been and what I have accomplished along with the people I have met and worked with on that journey, I am excited to begin a new chapter bringing together my wealth of experience into a new focused Nintendo community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt Nintendo Prime, my goal is to be a do everything entity. We aren\u0027t just going to report news and create original editorial content, nor are we solely going to create a podcast either. Rather, I want to venture into everything it means to be a Nintendo fan. So sure, we\u0027ll cover news. Yes, we\u0027ll have original editorial content. Oh and a podcast? You betcha. We also want to dive deep into creating engaging daily video content. But on top of all of that, what interest me most is creating a conversation around all of those things. Engaging conversations that provide depth and perspectives from multiple viewpoints, both myself as a veteran Nintendo fan and industry insider, to my best friend in this world Eric Mohr, a relative outsider who is getting back into Nintendo for really the first time in nearly 20 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur team will be ever expanding and while only myself will be doing this work full time, with your support we\u0027ll be able to expand what we do and eventually be able to bring on other full time members to the team, allowing us to do even more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am by no means an expert at everything of course. I am an amateur video editor at best, and while I plan to improve over time, I make due with my limited skillset to create content I hope you all will care about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, where can you find all this great content? Here\u0027s a rundown.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDaily news: \u003ca href=\"http://www.nintendoprime.net\"\u003ehttp://www.nintendoprime.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDaily video content: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc0qpQO6y4aB4IaZtLCZMXg\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/c/NintendoPrimeYT\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePodcast:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.nintendoprime.net/category/podcast/\"\u003ehttps://www.nintendoprime.net/category/podcast/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eForums:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://forums.nintendoprime.net/\"\u003ehttp://forums.nintendoprime.net/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLivestreams:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/nintendoprimetv\"\u003ehttps://www.twitch.tv/nintendoprimet\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
