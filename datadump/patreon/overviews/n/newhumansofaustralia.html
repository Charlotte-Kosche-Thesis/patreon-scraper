I believe we are living in a time when it is becoming more and more important to tell these stories - the difficulties refugees overcome and what they contribute - in order to celebrate multiculturalism, and to make new arrivals feel welcome on our shores.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince its inception in late 2015, NHOA has rapidly become one of the most powerful platforms for social change in Australia. With over 100 000 followers, each story reaches between 200 000 and 500 000 people, and some stories have had a reach of over 1 000 000.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year, the first New Humans of Australia book was published, which was able to reach many more readers who don\u0027t engage with digital content. The book is also now in a number of high school libraries and has been used as a teaching tool in many classrooms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a recent survey, over 70% of participants said they felt more sympathetic and empathetic towards migrants and refugees after engaging with the New Humans of Australia project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that supports creative people to do their jobs by providing them with a regular, steady income from patrons (that\u0027s you!). You provide\u00a0a monthly pledge of your choice, starting from only $1 per month, and this can be cancelled at any time if your circumstances change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning New Humans of Australia is a big job. I do all the interviews and write the stories, co-ordinate the volunteer photographers, maintain and monitor the social media sites, promote and market the stories, and work with external organisations to find the best people to interview.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout the support I receive from my patrons, there\u0027s no way I\u0027d be able to do this project. I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart, especially those who have been with me from the start. But I have just quit my job to focus on doing New Humans of Australia full time. This will mean that I can produce more stories, connect with more media and open up more online platforms in order to reach my goal of connecting 10 times more Australians with these stories in the next 12 months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result, I now need much more financial support. Could that be from you?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s my reward if I become a Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther than the satisfaction of knowing you are contributing to something really special, all patrons receive stories directly to email, which means you will never miss a story again. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will also be recognised as an official patron on the New Humans of Australia website.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons who pledge $10 per month or more will automatically receive a free copy of the inspirational NHOA coffee table book, valued at $29.99!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease join me.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nTogether we can change Australia\u0027s conversation about refugees.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith many thanks,\u003cbr\u003eNicola (Founder)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e*\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://patreon.com/\"\u003ePatreon.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eis in US dollars.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n*\u003cem\u003e10% of all pledges cover the admin costs of Patreon and Paypal.
