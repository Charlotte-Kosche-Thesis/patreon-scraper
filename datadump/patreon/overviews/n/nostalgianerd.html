    "summary": "Hi there, I\u0027m Nostalgia Nerd (aka Peter Leigh) and I\u0027m driven by nostalgic memories of computers and games gone by. So much so, that I packed in my traditional job and decided to make videos every single week on Youtube. Mainly these videos are seeded by my personal memories, and include experimentation and in depth documentaries about hardware, software and games. But my passion extends to understanding the backgrounds and workings of these wonderful machines and documenting them the best I can, for all to enjoy, both present and future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also play games throughout the week (Twitch \u0026amp; Youtube), commentate on old gaming shows and do anything else I feel inspired to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos do take a lot of time and a lot of work to make, so if you wish to support me, it is hugely appreciated. The channel (and indeed, my life) \u00a0just wouldn\u0027t be possible without it. Your contributions allow me to spend more time working on videos every week, to create more in depth, varied and generally better content, and that\u0027s truly what I\u0027m passionate about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, I offer various \"bribes\", as shown on the right and endless gratitude from the very pit of my nostalgia filled heart.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll supporters receive exclusive videos and advert free early access.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve tried to offer as many varied incentives that I can to make my Patreon channel a real community in itself.
