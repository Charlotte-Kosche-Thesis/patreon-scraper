    "summary": "Netheril: Age of Magic is a persistent world roleplaying server that is using the Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition; our world is set in in the Golden Age of the Netheril Empire.\u003cbr\u003e1652NY marks the beginning of Netheril\u2019s Golden Age, when the nation was at the very pinnacle of its power, and the beginning of our story. Netheril began lifting one enclave into the sky per year. Soon, dozens of these magnificent monoliths of magic rode the air currents or moved in orbital patterns around the loosely defined borders of the Netheril empire. Each archwizard who created his enclave heeded Ioulaum\u2019s example, setting up his or her own laws and guidelines that the enclave\u2019s residents had to follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTaking advantage of the resource-rich area around Hadrian, the Lady Valstiir moved her enclave just within sight of the port trading city and declared herself the protector of the lands and people of the area. This is where our story begins. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you support the Archmage and her efforts, and try to get into the high ranks of the prestigious Arcanists Guild? Do you fight her at every corner, and stick to your ways of the natural order? Do you take advantage of the magicless masses below the Archmages enclave and exploit their newly established trade routes? The world is ready to see how you will write your character.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eNetheril Age of Magic boasts over 50 scripted quests, with a functioning instancing system.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe have at launch over a dozen custom spells, that can shape your characters casting style.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCantrips of all classes are free to cast.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe have a trio of great Noble Factions dripping with intrigue and mystery. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOther Factions, such as guards, Natural defenders, and barbarians can also be joined.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNetheril has a custom Reputation System that allows your efforts to positively (or negatively) affect the world.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe have over a hundred gorgeous areas, made with some of the best community content available.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"

     "about": "Currently, we are in the early stages of beta testing where we continue to add new custom content and stress test the existing systems. We hope that over the next week we can roll into an active beta stage where Roleplay will be enforced, content will continue to be rolled out during this time but there may still be the occasional bug. Characters that are made now, will not be wiped and you will be able to continue playing them past the beta stage. \u003cbr\u003eLevel Range: It will be possible to go from levels 2-13 and most of the players would sit around this level however it is possible to get to level 20 which will be the soft-cap. Progressing past level 20 will require player and DM support and generally will only be achieved by those characters who are renowned and champions of the world. \u003cbr\u003eSystems: Netheril has a few unique systems with the plans to continue to develop more as we continue the content rollout. We feature a fully instanced quest system which allows players and their parties to delve into the darkest dungeons and save the fair maiden. A travel system for boats and airships where you may face off against pirates who board your boat or creatures who crash upon the decks. A death system that has the option to subdue your foe, a reputation system where your actions influence your standing within the city and surrounding lands, these are but a few we have on offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpell Changes:\u003c/strong\u003e On the next update we plan to roll out some changes to the spells these will include name changes to represent various mages during the Netheril era too new spells. These will all be listed on our forums when we roll them out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSetting: \u003c/strong\u003eThis server is based around what the Netherese dubbed \"The Golden Age\" 1852 marks the beginning of Netheril\u0027s Golden Age when the nation was at the very pinnacle of its power. Our setting is focused mainly on the Floating Enclave dubbed \"Valstiir\" named after the Lady Archwizard that created it.\u003cbr\u003eCommon knowledge to all inhabitants of the City is that Lady Valstiir was gifted a vision by a mysterious oracle known as the \"Terraseer\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Seer spoke of a rich and prosperous land to the west, its earth filled with countless precious gems, forests and rivers and snow-topped mountains teeming with life and natural resources, ripe for the taking. The Archwizard council after much disagreement came to the conclusion that their newest of Archwizards, Lady Valstiir, and her city must follow this oracle\u0027s guidance and go to these blossoming lands where it now resides over the land-based city of Hadrian.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere you can find more information: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDiscord: \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/Uq9EA69\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/Uq9EA69\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eForums: \u003ca href=\"https://netheril.net/\"\u003ehttps://netheril.net\u003c/a\u003e",
