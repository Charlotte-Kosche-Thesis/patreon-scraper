    "summary": "I have been a broadcaster on Twitch for almost a year and a half now, offering nightly entertainment Thursday- Sunday to people of all ages. I play multiple different platforms and consider myself to be a variety streamer. From my streams, I create YouTube videos so people can relive some of the more exciting moments of my broadcast. Some of them are funny, some are awesome and others can be very weird and random(but no less amazing:). I also am a musician. I love to make musical covers on piano and guitar.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have recently gotten into cosplay. I\u0027ve technically always been into it, but never had the funds to follow after this dream. As most of you know, it can be a very expensive hobby/job. Because I don\u0027t have the ability or craftmanship to make my own cosplays, I purchase different pieces from the internet and put them together. Hooray! I hold a lot of respect for those that can make their own costumes and hope that I can put together something just as brilliant. I plan to visit conventions with these cosplays to show them off and to meet some of my followers. Hope to see you there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a person that does lots of different things. I mainly broadcast video games but I have continued to branch out into other aspects of the gaming community. If you wish to become a patron to help me do so, then I greatly appreciate it and hope you love the rewards for doing so. No matter what you do, you are a part of my community and that makes you special. Thanks so much for taking the time to come to my page and for believing in me!"
