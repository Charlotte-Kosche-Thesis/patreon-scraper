We are Dylan \u0027Jarenth\u0027 Schouten and Justin \u0027Ninjustin\u0027 Hall, and we play, write, and talk about video games on our website, \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.ninja-blues.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNinja Blues\u003c/a\u003e. Seeing as though you\u0027re here, you\u0027re \u003cem\u003eprobably\u003c/em\u003e familiar with it? But if you\u0027re not... well, very happy to make your acquaintance this way! Maybe you\u0027ll want to check out Ninja Blues before reading any further? \u003ca href=\"http://www.ninja-blues.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHere\u0027s that link again!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAlright, now that we\u0027re all definitely on the same page here:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe backstory\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe two of us, Jarenth and Ninjustin, have been playing on and writing for Ninja Blues since January 2014. Coming off of separate hobby projects -- one den for ninjas and the games they play, and one blue screen that was \n\u003cem\u003eobjectively pretty rad\u003c/em\u003e -- it was only natural that we\u0027d continue writing in a hobby capacity at first. We both really enjoy writing about video games, you guys! Plus, even though we\u0027ve both been friends for years, there was always that \u003cem\u003etiny\u003c/em\u003e chance that our personalities would horribly clash and explode into a giant Internet fireball, taking the website and everything with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat fireball-clash didn\u0027t actually happen, obviously, and Ninja Blues has been rolling along quite happily for some time now. The stuff that we\u0027ve produced in that time includes:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n- Jarenth\u0027s regular indie game review column, \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.ninja-blues.com/category/indie-wonderland/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIndie Wonderland\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Ninjustin\u0027s irregular games-that-he-likes column, \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.ninja-blues.com/category/talk-of-the-ninja/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTalk of the Ninja\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Jarenth and Ninjustin\u0027s games podcast slash ramble-a-thon, \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.ninja-blues.com/category/discourse-dojo/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDiscourse Dojo\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n- A variety of \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.ninja-blues.com/lets-play-overview-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLet\u0027s Plays\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSuffice it to say our first year of 2014 has been a pretty productive and relatively successful year, by our standards. And we\u0027d enjoy nothing more than to continue doing this well into 2015 and beyond.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027d also like to earn some money, though.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLike so many other regular \u0027hobby\u0027 content creators, the introduction and rapid spreading success of Patreon has paved opportunities for monetization for us that didn\u0027t exist before. Rather than mess around with annoying Google ads or PayPal donation buttons, we can just... well, do this! Patreon is an excellent system for allowing fans of incidental content creators to express their ongoing support in the most hassle-free way possible, and we\u0027ve honestly been letting it lie fallow for far too long.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe here and now\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, here\u0027s the nitty-gritty:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNinja Blues is going to continue running as it does regardless of how \u0027well\u0027 we do on Patreon, here. This website is a hobby project for us, a labor of love, and we wouldn\u0027t have been doing it for as long as we have if it wasn\u0027t for the sheer fun we get out of playing and writing about games. This is not a \u0027we\u0027re in trouble and need financial support to stay afloat\u0027 kind of Patreon.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat said: there \n\u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e costs involved in running Ninja Blues. Website hosting, domain name, bandwidth. Buying video games, obviously. But also buying hardware, and support software, and subscriptions to streaming services, and whatnot. None of it is really big enough to sink us, but we\u0027d be lying if we said we wouldn\u0027t like to get rid of those costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s also things we\u0027d like to do for and with Ninja Blues that \n\u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e currently very impractical from a financial standpoint. Hardware upgrades, for one. Doing anything related to console games, which requires expensive gaming consoles. Conference visits. Hell, the two of us live on opposite sides of the world, as you can see in our profile. We\u0027d \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e to fly up and down to hang out together and do co-located live streaming, but... well, you know. Plane tickets be pricey, yo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd finally... honestly, we\u0027d just really like to make some money off of this. Being able to turn Ninja Blues into the kind of venture that can support us, partially or (heaven forbid) would be an amazing validation of the kind of work we\u0027ve been putting into it. It\u0027s a bit of a pipe dream, for our relatively small publication, but hey. Dream big.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that\u0027s more or less where we are, readers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLike many other regular content creators, we don\u0027t really have anything to \u0027sell\u0027 or to reward you with. You\u0027ll notice we only have the one backing tier, the one-dollar-minimum, because that\u0027s just a handy way of doing business. It gets you our gratitude, mostly, and we\u0027ll be putting up a \u0027Patrons of Ninja Blues\u0027 page on the site to celebrate your generosity. Patreon is also a handy platform for distributing polls, articles, and streaming links, but we have no intention of gating anything off to people who support us. Ninja Blues is now, and will always be, open to anyone willing to pay us a visit.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMake no mistake, though: when we say your support gets you our gratitude, we mean \n\u003cem\u003egratitude\u003c/em\u003e. Seriously, snacks and drinks are on either of us next time you\u0027re in the neighbourhood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe future\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSimilar to reward levels, we\u0027ve made a conscious decision to steer away from milestone goals, too. There are two reasons for this:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.\u003c/strong\u003e As much as we\u0027d both love to work on Ninja Blues only and forever, the reality of the situation is that both Jarenth and Ninjustin currently have day jobs. As such, we\u0027re not really comfortable with promising \u0027more Ninja Blues content\u0027 as possible reward tiers. Not just yet. What happens if we make wild promises, we reach the backing total, and then we find we can\u0027t live up to the hype?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.\u003c/strong\u003e Setting enumerated milestone goals with concrete money amounts attached to them gives off the implication that we have any kind if idea what kind of response to expect here. We don\u0027t. And setting arbitrary milestone that end up being either far higher or far lower than the support we get makes us look either ungrateful or clueless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, while we\u0027re not \n\u003cem\u003eformalizing\u003c/em\u003e anything, we \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e obviously thought about the things that Patreon money would allow us to do. To wit:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n- If we manage to get \u0027only\u0027 a couple dozen dollars per month, something like\u00a0\u20ac50, that basically solves our monetary upkeep forever and always. This kind of money would be enough to pay for website upkeep and keep us supplied with reasonably-priced video games, basically ensuring that Ninja Blues keeps running as it does now with a minimum of fuss.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- If we get backed into early three figures, around\u00a0\u20ac100, \u20ac200 a month, we can comfortably start expanding our range of activities. Hardware upgrades, professional software, and console purchases become realistic prospects around this time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- If the gravy train keeps rolling even further, into the\u00a0\u20ac500s and beyond, we can start taking Ninja Blues into the \n\u003cem\u003ereal world\u003c/em\u003e. Specifically, money like this would make it feasible for us to actually pay for trans-Atlantic air fare, allowing us to hang out in person on a semi-regular basis. This is also the level at which we\u0027ll probably start going stark raving mad.\u003cbr\u003e\n- And finally, if we manage to get into \n\u003cem\u003efour\u003c/em\u003e figures -- like I said, we like to dream big -- things start getting \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e interesting. Remember that thing about both of us having day jobs? Around this level of backing, it would actually become possible for Ninjustin to phase out his full-time day job into part-time work, or to even quit his day job altogether, effectively working on Ninja Blues full-time. There\u0027s no telling this far ahead what the consequences of this would be, but... guys, it\u0027ll probably be sweet. Don\u0027t you think it\u0027d be sweet? We should totally try to get us backed at this level, \u003cem\u003ejust to see what would happen\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe wrap-up\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn conclusion:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe love Ninja Blues. We enjoy everything related to Ninja Blues. We\u0027d like nothing more than to do more with Ninja Blues than ever before, and we\u0027d really, incredibly appreciate the financial support of anyone who\u0027s as keen to see this as we are. Seriously, every little bit helps. Every dollar we receive is like a precious gift to us.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNinja Blues will remain as free and open to everyone in the future as it is right now. So if you\u0027re a reader, but you can\u0027t support us financially or you don\u0027t want to, that\u0027s alright too! We\u0027re grateful for your readership and patronage, no matter what shape it takes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCome 2015, we\u0027re kicking Ninja Blues into the highest gear your continued support will allow. Thanks for being there with us, every single one of you. Let\u0027s see how good we can get.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n- Jarenth\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Ninjustin\n\u003cbr\u003e"
