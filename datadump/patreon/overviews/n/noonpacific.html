    "summary": "Noon Pacific is a platform to break new artists, built for the community by the community. Listeners receive a curated 10-song mixtape three times a week at noon (pacific time), making it the simplest way to discover new music and an amazing way to give new artists some serious exposure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver 350,000 people enjoy our free 5-star apps for iOS, Android and the web \u2014 making NP one of the most trafficked independent music services available.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blog.patreon.com/noon-pacific-record-label/\"\u003eHear what Patreon themselves had to say about us\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Purpose\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome the most trusted source of new music for 10 million people by 2019.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Vision\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreate a platform that supports emerging artists by providing services, tools, and a built-in fanbase. Modeled as a cooperative, everyone involved is working for mutual benefit \u2014 the artists, the fans and Noon Pacific all contribute to release the best new music, with value flowing back to everyone who helps along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor the Artist\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen a song is signed to Noon Pacific Records, artists are introduced to the community of patrons and their PR costs are covered in order to help get the track heard by as many blogs, playlisters and fans as possible. Most importantly, they\u2019ll have real fans who are committed to sharing their song with anyone who will listen \u2014 a built-in support system from Day 1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more we can streamline the process of releasing music for the artist, the more music they can make \u2014 and that makes the world a better place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTransparency breeds trust, and trust is everything when it comes to quality curation. The major labels will forever try to buy their way into your music library, a truly backwards model. We have the opportunity to build artists from the ground up, with a community of fans, and utilize the Noon Pacific apps to build the most popular playlist in the world. At our current size, we\u2019re able to drive anywhere from 20,000-150,000+ plays per song, depending on what position in the mixtape it is, and engagement that week. If we scale this platform to millions of listeners, these mixtapes get extremely impactful pretty quickly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor the Fan (YOU!)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a supporter of the Noon Pacific record label means you\u0027re able to make a real impact on emerging artists \u2014 by way of the Noon Pacific Artist Fund. The more supporters we have, the more money we\u0027re able to pay towards each single we release and offer up more services. Things like PR, video creation, photo shoots, vinyl pressings, etc. As a supporter, you\u0027ll get monthly reports on where your money was spent and know you played a valuable part of each release on our label.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor Noon Pacific \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Artist Fund will provide a launchpad for artist\u2019s careers around the world. A multi-faceted lifestyle brand and software company that will deliver the most popular and influential playlists (\u0026amp; singles) on a regular basis. We\u2019ll launch a Noon Pacific festival showcasing the year\u2019s best new artists and host monthly showcases in cities across the world, all organized through a democratized fanbase. We aim to forever remain a source of trust and transparency in the music industry \u2014 where fans know they can come for the best new music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackground\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began Noon Pacific in 2012 with the goal of helping some close friends find new music. Soon I built my first website, Noon Pacific 1.0, to fix the music discovery experience online, making it easier and more beautiful through good design and thoughtful experiences. The website quickly turned into a much larger side-project after being featured on Hacker News, Lifehacker, and USA Today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter about a year of the website\u2019s success, my co-founder, Alex Givens (a fan and dedicated listener) approached me about a dedicated iOS app. Currently the two of us comprise the core Noon Pacific team, and we are fortunate to be surrounded by incredible fans who have contributed countless hours over the years building apps, putting on events, and sending us songs we absolutely had to hear. After the iOS and Android apps launched we saw a surge of listeners and more features in The New York Times and Popular Mechanics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring these past 5 years, Alex and I held down freelance design \u0026amp; development jobs to pay the bills, but we always knew there was endless potential if we put our full efforts into it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here today \u2014 gathering support from our listeners, moving the industry forward in a way that supports the artist first \u0026amp; foremost, and helping you find the best new music.  We\u2019ve learned a lot in these past couple years, but two things have remained true:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Noon Pacific is a 50+ year art project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNoon Pacific is not a traditional business that expects to sell out to a corporation. We have passionate listeners and we have talented artists, and we try to treat them all with the respect they deserve. With these forces combined we have the power to change the industry and do things our way for a long time. We are committed to good design and building a quality product inside and out. This is our north star and allows us to focus on what matters for listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Noon Pacific must be self-sustaining\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile freelancing is fun, it\u2019s nowhere near as cool as helping artists and making a living doing so. We want to make this our livelihood and create the coolest brand in the world with your help. Your support goes directly to helping us work on this full time and provide the artists with a tool to accelerate their careers.\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve never placed advertisements (violates our \u201cgood design\u201d philosophy) on NP and with your support, we promise to remain committed to that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Your Money Goes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support us with $5/month, here\u2019s a rough breakdown of how this money is used.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBreakdown of $5 monthly support:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtist Promotion \u0026amp; Content\u2014 $3.70 (74%)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWebsite Hosting \u0026amp; Services \u2014 $.25 (5%)\u003cbr\u003eEvents \u2014 $0.25 (10%)\u003cbr\u003eStripe Processing Fee \u2014 $.59 (5.9%)\u003cbr\u003eProfit \u2014 $.21 (4.1%)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFunding Goals \u0026amp; Why They\u2019re Important\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1,000/mo\u003c/strong\u003e \u2014 A solid foundation for us to start building the community.
