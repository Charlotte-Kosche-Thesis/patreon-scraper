He was my first interview in which became the start of many more. I always have this team human spirit and admire the people who meet me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image-store.slidesharecdn.com/c19ca170-2c80-43a7-987f-a06831237586-original.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is one of me and Simon Chan, Oleg and Pete Head, where later I interviewed Simon Chan on his Team human views and how to bring the community and human values together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image-store.slidesharecdn.com/a90790d2-5de2-4b0d-b2b9-fa2855116e94-original.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started my journey, part of my path is to help others be more inspired. And the other part is to interview great experts to inspire others in the knowledge I like to share.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e12 months ago I did just that. To, interview the greatest people from top-tier companies, and share this knowledge with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut not only that, to help people who feel helpless or down to show there are people who listen and want to help you be your better self.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFrom this, a team human movement occurred, with me, Simon Chan, Brett S Cody, Karl Nainani, Oleg and many others to help inspire others. You may know them on LinkedIn. (Almost 15 people joined this movement)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThese great people helped to share a team human spirit. A movement to help inspire people, so we can carry on inspiring others for those who are less fortunate than us or for those who need a little bit of cheering up and share insights to make the world a better place. (Through pictures, posts and inspirational texts)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI decided to continue to share this movement to inspire people with some of the posts I write daily.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo therefore I created this Patreon crowdfunding page, to help get support in what I like to do which is help people become better in themselves and know that they are not alone when it comes to facing failure, as well as share great interviews to my audience to suffice more real-life content that is happening in the digital industry. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMental breakdown is the biggest cause in the US and UK and even all parts of the world. Almost half will have mental health issues by 2050 and this is set to grow even further. (Sad Right)! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs I devotedly care about this I decided to inspire others in the posts I write and share. I want to help everyone as much as possible in sharing my interviews whether for professional support, job support, coaching support or inspire people in the posts I share that they are not alone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWith my posts I share, is a vision. A vision to appeal to people with the content I write that\u0027s what they want to hear. That is what they want to know. That is what they want to think! No matter how hard their day has been. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYour support keeps me inspiring to help others and write content for the better good of society and carry on me delivering these inspirations to people. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSome will know I started this journey from 0 and now grew to\u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nazareth-qarbozian-02a53b22/\"\u003e 20,000 followers\u003c/a\u003e. Some will know that I have interviewed great experts from Sony, Inc, Accenture, PWC and soon the Co-Founder of LinkedIn and was featured in Forbes. But some will know that I share compelling posts for the greatest good for all and also help the helpless feel inspired whether if that is brightening up their day, or something they want to hear that can give out positive emotions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI basically help all people be inspired and get inspired! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat is why I set up this page but also the failure that I faced in my past.....\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTo be a Team Human player in doing just that! Helping people.....\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution helps me do it. Your contribution helps to join the movement. And your contribution keeps me driving forward to write these inspirational posts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThink about this at the end of the day? If someone is feeling helpless or down wouldn\u0027t you want to brighten up their day? I do....... And that is why I set up this movement. That is why I care. That is why I work hard to interview great people to share knowledge and post every day to also help inspire people as well. (Even if it is just a post)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTo help show life is fair with the meaningful content that I share to touch their lives. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTo help them know I doing something and can help them get on with their day.
