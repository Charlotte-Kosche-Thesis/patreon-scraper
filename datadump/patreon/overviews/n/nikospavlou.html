Also at the same time I will be in much better position to pursue my career in teaching and sound engineering!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the tutorials will be also available on the following online university platforms:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUdemy:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.udemy.com/user/nikos-pavlou/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.udemy.com/user/nikos-pavlou/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSkillshare:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://skillshare.com/nikospavlou/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://skillshare.com/nikospavlou/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeachable:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sound-engineering.teachable.com/courses/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://sound-engineering.teachable.com/courses/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso make sure you check out my website and follow me on the following social media:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOfficial Website: \u003ca href=\"http://nikospavlou.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://nikospavlou.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/NikosPavlou/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/c/NikosPavlou/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook: \u003ca href=\"https://facebook.com/nikospavloupage/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://facebook.com/nikospavloupage/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter: \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/nikospavloutwit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://twitter.com/nikospavloutwit\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nikospavlouinst/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/nikospavlouinst/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAnd of course don\u0027t forget to subscribe to my mailing list:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/npmailing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.tinyurl.com/npmailing\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil the first tutorial and full course will be live (in about 2 or 3 months), take care!\u003cbr\u003e"
