    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eHello there!\u003c/h3\u003eMy passion is to enable Free, Secure, and Safe communications and connections between people and groups of people. I\u0027m contributing lots of my time to Free Software projects:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m a developer of\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://gnunet.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGNUnet\u003c/a\u003e, a distributed network and a GNU project. For GNUnet I work continuously on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://gnunet.org/git/gnunet.git/log/doc\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edocumentation\u003c/a\u003e, packaging (GNU Guix, Gentoo,...) system integration (infotropique OS,...), the build system, low level application support (I\u0027m the maintainer of gnURL), and more.\u003cbr\u003e\nI am contributing to many projects beyond GNUnet, like for example\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://gnu.org/s/guix\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGNU Guix\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u0027m working on the first design for infotropique OS.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOccasionally I write about my work on my web log,\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://n0.is\" target=\"_blank\"\u003en0.is\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe work I do takes a lot of time and energy. Mostly time, as many of my projects are either open-ended or taking a very long time to finish.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFinancial support through donations is more rare than it should be in Free Software, so if you support me I will feel happy - even (and especially!) about 1 USD donations. What matters is that you express your support.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you need some more hard facts for why I\u0027m asking for donations, here are some examples:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAt least once a year I need to buy a new harddrive or replace some parts of machines I work with. As a student I don\u0027t have a high monetary safety net. Your support ensures that I will be able to continue to work. Think of it as an investment in results you get otherwise without payment.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI run a git repository server, offering all my work outside of Guix. I have to pay monthly bills for it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eMy experimental substitutes and offloading server is falling apart. It would be really good if I could invest money in a decent server, be it hosted at home (electricity bill, bad upload speed) or in a data center (high bandwidth, high specs, high costs).\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFor further experimentation and support of more platforms with infotropique OS - once we are getting there - I will need to invest in various types of hardware.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAlmost all my computers broke down last year, so I had to invest 500\u20ac in a new one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBeyond Patreon,\u003c/h3\u003e\nyou will soon be able to hire me for specific jobs (you already can, I just need to write a detailed page about it), outside of Patreon.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so very much for supporting me.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will feed Streuner (the cat living with us) an extra delicious treat in your \nhonor!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHeader Image: BeagleBoneBlack Picture by Nils Gillmann, CC-BY-NC 4.0 international licensed."
