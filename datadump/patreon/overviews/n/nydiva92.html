    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eMy name is D and I am also known both on youtube and instagram as \"nydiva92\". I am an independent artist and an indie comic developer. I am currently working on a comic series entitled, \"Confessions of an Invisible Nubian Queen.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe series has inspired a lot of other creations, such as my \"We Run This\" canvas painting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/TDREqJI.jpg?1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began this comic series to encourage unity within the black race, to provide a positive message to the world, and to re-assure EVERYONE that we do in fact inhabit a lot of the same struggles. We have a lot more in common than we think. So to empower my black women and to also display a positive image of black women, I created these weekly posts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy First Comic strip was inspired by a story a teacher told me about a student in their class crying because a little boy broke up with her on Valentine\u0027s day because she was too dark and her mom took her braids out and so he also discovered that her hair was \"too nappy\"... and so began my confession to young black women everywhere who find themselves in this troubling circumstance:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ci4f35wl.png?1\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eConfession #1: You cannot assign your self worth to someone else\u0027s opinion. As long as YOU think that you\u0027re beautiful, then you\u0027re beautiful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so the concept began and continued to grow with one motive in mind: To allow young girls the opportunity to see themselves as beautiful despite their differences.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/52XMOCZl.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConfession # 8: All people can grow long hair. Fact\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe quality of my comics have definitely gotten better as time has progressed and with practice makes perfect. With your contributions I will not only be able to create, post, and do give away\u0027s more frequently, but also the quality of my art will only get better and better.\u003c/div\u003e"

Although as black women we have made a tremendous amount of improvement within our own race by motivating each other through organizations such as, Black Girls Rock. We\u0027ve created an entire movement through the natural hair community. Still, however, we have young black girls, as well as older black girls who feel as though they are not beautiful simply because of their skin pigmentation. My goal is to bring unity and confidence within our race. I am creating a comic series that simply takes you through some of the daily struggles of a black woman as well as exposing many of the misconceptions out there about black women. All the comic strips that I have created are either based on my own true events or the true stories shared to me by others. We are all running the same race here and not one of us is alone.",
