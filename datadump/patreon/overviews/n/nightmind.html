Upgrades to equipment, programs, and resources will be easily made, providing higher quality videos and uploads in many regards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Night Mind Creators Fund will be a month-by-month buildup of money to support new creators and awesome new projects. Constant updates on what this aspect of the Patreon is going towards will be posted unless there\u0027s a top-secret project in the works. All attempts will be made to get \u0027backstage treatment\u0027 for projects supported, so we can see what\u0027s going on during production and gain some extra materials. We\u0027re not just giving new creators who\u0027ve earned it a major spotlight--we\u0027re getting on set and making sure they have the tools they need to make awesome art happen.\u003cbr\u003e",
