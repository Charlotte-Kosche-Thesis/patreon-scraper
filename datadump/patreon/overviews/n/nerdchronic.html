    "summary": "Hey everyone, \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by. We\u0027ve been wanting to put a podcast together for sometime now but due to life getting in the way, and the costs of producing something we could really be proud of, our plans have been foiled in the past. But we\u0027ve committed now! We\u0027ll be putting out an episode of the NerdChronic: NerdCast every single week, and have plans for other shows as well, so if you find yourself enjoying the show please show your support.. or don\u0027t. If you\u0027re reading this you\u0027re at least moderately interested in supporting us, so mull it over, figure out if supporting us something you really want to do, and if it\u0027s not, no hard feelings. Enjoy the show either way!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe subjects we\u0027ll typically cover are movies, television, comics, and a variety of other mostly nerdy topics that more likely than not will end up in random ramblings... also, be prepared for random ramblings. That said, If you feel like that\u0027s for you, then great! Welcome to the fold. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eEven a buck can help us out, and know that each and every dollar we receive will be greatly appreciated, and put right back into an effort of creating a quality show (and hopefully more in the future) for our listeners. It\u2019ll also allow us to dedicate more hours towards creating more content, which in the future, may be something we can share with our patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re on Twitter, and Facebook, and Instagram all @NerdChronic and on Reddit at www.reddit.com/nerdchronic.\u00a0Also, check us out on \u003ca href=\"http://NerdChronic.com\"\u003eNerdChronic.com\u003c/a\u003e where we\u2019ll post our episodes, articles that we\u2019ve written for the show, and other content we\u2019ve created. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time. That\u2019s it for now. Catch you on the flipside! (the flipside in this case I think are your headphones\u2026 this is not confirmed it\u2019s just\u2014 oh! almost turned into one of those random ramblings I warned you about.)\u003cbr\u003e"
