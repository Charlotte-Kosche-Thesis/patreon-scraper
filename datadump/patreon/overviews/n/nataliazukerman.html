    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eCheap trick with the talking dog video. I know. Sorry. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003el made my first record in 2001 on 2\" tape. Analog.\u003c/strong\u003e I had no idea what I was doing and relied on my growing folk community to tell me how to tour, promote, make a website, print out mapquest directions (we had to do that back then!), and send postcards in the (snail) mail about upcoming shows! Also, that digital was the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou could say the music industry has changed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI toured constantly from 2005-2015 but for the last few years, I\u0027ve been painting more and more and touring less and less. I\u0027m still making and recording music (and doing \u003cem\u003esome \u003c/em\u003etouring too!) but gone are the days of getting into my car alone and driving all over this wild and weary country. I\u0027m loving the integration of music and art in my life and am so grateful that I\u0027ve found ways to \"piece it all together,\" as my multi-talented, multi-careered mama would say.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also really love being HOME. As a child of touring musicians, I always said I could pack a bag before I could walk. Turns out having a schedule, a partner, a dog, friends I can see more than once a year...it feels real good. But I also want to keep sharing the work I\u0027m doing. So when I heard about Patreon, I got excited. Ok. That\u0027s a lie. I felt dread and fear at the thought of \"asking for support.\" But now I\u0027m excited because I\u0027m thinking about it differently- it\u0027s a way to connect with fans and friends and a way to share the art that I\u0027m already creating!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO WHAT AM I MAKING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mostly paint portraits and commissioned illustrations, paintings and murals but I\u0027ve also started doing a lot of painting and drawing about issues I care deeply about- water conservation, the environment, immigration... to name a few! I\u0027ve also been doing a ton of writing and recording- songs, but also \u003cstrong\u003esoundscapes\u003c/strong\u003e: multi-instrumental, multi-layered musical musings. I\u0027d love to share them with YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon and why use it?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003ePatreon is all about art and artists. They cut out the middleman to get the work straight to YOU. This is a way to keep in touch with you and for you to give me feedback on my work, to be involved in my process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n- As a patron, \u003cstrong\u003eyou decide\u003c/strong\u003e how much you\u0027d like to contribute per song, drawing, video etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n- You set a monthly limit. For example:\u00a0you want to pledge $5 per song but set a \u201cmonthly cap\u201d of $10. That way, you only pay $10/month total, even if I post 300 songs. (Realistically, I imagine I\u0027ll be making up to\u003cstrong\u003e 2\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ereleases per month -you probably don\u0027t want to hear the other 298!\u003c/strong\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I\u0027m going to be offering:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n- \u003cstrong\u003eAll pledge levels = total access.  \u003c/strong\u003eWhether you give $1/song or $100 (\u003cem\u003eWho\u003c/em\u003e are you!? Can I make you dinner?). I want you all to have it all.\u003cbr\u003e\n- Songs will be shared via .wav \u0026amp; mp3 download links OR a video that will be shared only with you on my youtube page!\u003cbr\u003e- Images will be hi res downloadable, printable originals. You can also always commission something special!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJust so you know:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSome of this content will be available in other places and/or may turn into longer or full-length projects. But this is where you\u0027ll hear and see it first- like a constant studio visit with me to see and hear what I\u0027m up to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLast but not least (you\u0027re still reading? Thank you!)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t thank you enough for the support you\u0027ve shown me through the years. You\u0027ve followed me through all my artistic endeavors, incarnations and wacky haircuts. Now I\u0027m asking you to become a Patr(e)on and ride this next ride with me- let\u0027s see where it all goes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love and gratitude\u003cbr\u003eNatalia"
