    "summary": "Not Your Mama\u0027s Gamer was created as a hub for \u003cstrong\u003einformed critical analysis, persistent original content, timely cultural engagement, and offering a space for the amplification of diverse voices in games\u003c/strong\u003e. We are \u003cstrong\u003escholars\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eindustry professionals\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eenthusiasts\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003efeminists\u003c/strong\u003e; we love games, technology, digital communities, and geek culture, and we want to engage with all of it in new and interesting ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn other words, we\u0027re not your mama\u0027s gaming site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we do produce news and reviews, along with a biweekly podcast, we\u0027re also unpacking games from critical perspectives, and we\u0027d like to be able to expand on that, creating critical Let\u0027s Plays, investigative reports, videos, and other original content. This is why we desperately need your support: we are professors and graduate students; we are parents; we are professionals with day jobs and overtime and dozens of other responsibilities to juggle. For four years, we have worked as an all-volunteer team, and we\u0027ve rendered our passion to the page with unfailing regularity. Financial support, however, will help us reach new heights, by allowing us to contract feature writers and purchase new equipment necessary for the kind of exciting multimodal content we have planned. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith your help, we can put more time and energy into expanding Not Your Mama\u0027s Gamer and work toward a unique hub of dynamic original content. \u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027re performing the change we want to see, and if you\u0027re here, \u003cstrong\u003ewe would bet you want to see it, too. \u003c/strong\u003eHelp us turn our dreams into reality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor many creators on Patreon, the ultimate goal is to quit their day jobs and do the work full time. We can\u0027t do that; our work is part of what makes us stand out amongst other gaming sites, and even if we could? We wouldn\u0027t want to. For us, the goal is simply the freedom and support to do more of what we love. If you want to see it, help us get there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon operates much like a subscription service, allowing you to tip us a small amount every month ($1 or more) \nusing a credit card or PayPal. Your account won\u0027t be charged until the\n end of the month. You can cancel your pledge any time, for any reason, and we\u0027ll still be here, doing what we do, but every dollar counts as we continue to grow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(And you can move outside our recommended levels; they\u0027re just recommended. Give what you want!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for listening. Thank you for thinking of us. Thank you for your continued support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
