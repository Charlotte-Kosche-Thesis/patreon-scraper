You\u0027ve found your way to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always had a bit of a weird mind, and making animations is the best way to let the crazy out. After doing stuff in Garry\u0027s Mod for so long, I finally decided to move to Source Filmmaker (SFM), where my crazy animations reach a whole new level. Oh, and I make pictures with SFM as well, because that\u0027s also a thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also make gameplay videos and do live streams over on Twitch as well, because the art of animation and model posing is a timely process, so it\u0027s fun to do something else to let off some steam.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what brings me to Patreon? Well, I\u0027ve actually been around on Patreon since the early days, back when I didn\u0027t have every MCN tripping over themselves trying to sign me up. However, the recent \"Adpocolypse\" has hit me just as hard as everyone else, so I felt it was time to give this old page a bit of an update, a brand new banner and some much needed TLC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me here, you not only allow me to keep making crazy animation pieces and adventurous gameplay videos, but you also help me keep the one job I\u0027m actually good at!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, how about it new comer? Care to help a creative YouTuber out? You\u0027ll get some nice goodies out of it!"
