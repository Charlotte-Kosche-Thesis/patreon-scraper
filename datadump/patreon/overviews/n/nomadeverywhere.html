So many of you have already expressed interest in supporting the channel, I am totally flattered, and I would like to give you that opportunity!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon campaign is simple - to reduce my dependence on other sources of revenue. To create a more direct relationship between myself, the creator of Nomad Everywhere content, and you, the viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I get paid by through my web design and finding other jobs along the road.\u00a0 I don\u0027t want to run ads as a revenue source, because I really don\u0027t like ads.\u00a0 I really really don\u0027t like ads.\u00a0 I use adblock and would recommend the same to anyone else, so it feels wrong to make you watch them for my profit. Under that model, someone tries to sell things to my audience before every video they watch. That doesn\u0027t sit right with me. I would much rather have my income come directly from the people who enjoy my content and purchase services I offer, rather than some company trying to take advantage of our time spent together each day.\u00a0 I would much rather you not get more ads pushed down your throat on my channel, we already have more than enough of that going on in our daily lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I would like to do, is expand the types of content I am able to offer, and use the additional income to help the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAd-free content is what I would like to offer everyone. No one trying to get between you and I every day as I share what I\u0027ve created for you.\u00a0 That is my pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor Patrons, as direct supporters of the content being created, I want to hear your ideas when planning trips and creating content for the channel! Through the Patron-only feed, we\u0027ll discuss upcoming ideas and I\u0027ll take all your feedback into consideration when creating new content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for all your wonderful support thus far, and I look forward to taking this next leap into a brave new world of ad-free content with you all!"
