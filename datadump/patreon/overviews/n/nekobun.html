Whether you found me via Twitch,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wetalkgames.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWe Talk Games\u003c/a\u003e, some of the other podcasts I\u0027ve guested on, YouTube, or whatever else, there\u0027s a good chance I\u0027m the \u0027bun you\u0027re looking for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ewhatchu do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGamestuff, mostly. In order of priority/frequency, here\u0027s a listy-loo:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLivestreaming\u003c/strong\u003e - I\u0027m live on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitch.tv/nekobun\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy Twitch channel\u003c/a\u003e every night that I can manage to squeeze in a couple hours between work, recording, and real life. Hours can be odd, but I try to show up. I play a variety of stuff on account of having too many games. Regular features include 2spoopsdays (horror games of... varying quality), Trifursdays (Zelda games, all the Zelda games), and Sunday Night STO (Star Trek Online, checking updates and doing Foundry missions).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYouTube\u003c/strong\u003e - My\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/nekobun\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e is home to the archives for most of my streams, with both short highlights of fun times and longer episodes cut from full playthroughs. I also upload a fair amount of non-stream video edited to various degrees, where I highlight games that get overlooked, fresh game demos, and playthroughs of some game formats that wouldn\u0027t stream so well.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003edat it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot entirely. I\u0027ve got some other projects simmering or on the back burner as well, including:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaking Games\u003c/strong\u003e - I have a (very) sparse\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://nekobun.itch.io\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epage over on itch.io\u003c/a\u003e, but I\u0027ve got some more ideas in the work for Twine, and I\u0027m trying to learn some new tools to work on other projects and expand my horizons.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt\u003c/strong\u003e - I used to draw a lot, and I\u0027m trying to revive that skill to be at least amusingly passable, if not professional grade. I\u0027m also dabbling in pixel art due to the game-making thing, which is soon going to start spilling over into...\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCrafting\u003c/strong\u003e - I know too many people do this, but I\u0027ve got ideas for fusion (Perler) bead projects that are more than just the typical \"slap together a popular character sprite\" formula. I\u0027ve also got a list of cosplay and other sewing projects beginning to stack up as ideas are flowing again.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ewhere\u0027s patronage go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eBills \u003c/b\u003e- Thanks to capitalism and this need for thing called food, the main priority for funds is survival. Both for me and my cat, Llyan, who occasionally guest-appears on stream (at least in the form of me asking what the hell she\u0027s doing).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImprovements\u003c/strong\u003e - Your support helps me find time to learn how to better use the tools I have at hand to hone my craft, and to upgrade to better software and equipment as necessary. The more time I have thanks to your support, the better things will get.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncreased Output\u003c/strong\u003e - The other thing that comes with more time is more production. More videos, longer streams, and additional whatever else I happen to be working on.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGiving Back\u003c/strong\u003e - This goes for both giving back to the community and supporters, and to the world at large. Once things are otherwise stable, a chunk of funding will be regularly funneled into things like game keys and other things for giveaways, and into supporting charity through events or through impromptu donations.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ewat we get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, there\u0027s already the content listed above, but you can also peep the reward tier list to see what other benefits are possible. It\u0027ll be evolving continuously as this mishmash of projects keeps growing and going somewhere, so check back now and then. I\u0027m still working on Patron-exclusive content ideas in particular, but as mentioned above, even the open stuff will increase in frequency as things improve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne big thing I\u0027d like to do is go ad-free on YouTube and anywhere else; as things progress, I\u0027ll be dialing back the ad options I employ for videos. As it stands, I already refuse to use those annoying pop-over ones you have to close manually when they appear on the lower bits of the video."
