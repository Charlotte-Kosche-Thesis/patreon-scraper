In my late college years and my subsequent years as a high school English teacher in Brooklyn, NY, my dad and I performed under the name \u201cDirt Road Sweetheart\u201d at folk halls in Jersey and dive bars in Brooklyn.  Our repertoire had some original songs, but mostly consisted of tight-harmony duets (Louvin Brothers, Everly Brothers, Blue Sky Boys, Tim and Molly O\u2019Brien, Emmylou and Graham) and traditional songs we got from the Carter Family, Ollabell Reid, Doc Watson, etc...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When I decided to make the move to Nashville and pursue my dream of being a full-time musician, Dad and I felt that we had better make a record of how we sounded after all those years of performing together.  We recorded our first album, \u201cI Heard the Bluebirds Sing\u201d during the summer of 2008 at Cabin Studios in Leesburg, VA with Les Thompson of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band behind the controls, and a month later I packed my minivan and drove to Nashville. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s been almost 10 years since we recorded that debut album, and through those years, dad and I have continued to make music together.  We put 14 songs on our first record and there are SO many more songs that I love singing with my dad and wanted to capture.  So, I enlisted Neilson Hubbard to engineer and produce this collection for us. (Neilson also produced Champion.) \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We wanted this record to have a live, and homey feel, so Neilson set up all his gear in my living room, at our home here outside of Nashville.  We recorded 17 songs in 3 days and I think 16 of them will make the record.  We\u2019re titling this album, \u201cRose of My Heart\u201d after my favorite song that dad and I sing together. I hope you enjoy this collection my friends.  It certainly is special to me.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY BECOME A PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Here on Patreon, your support allows me to make more music, and when you subscribe, you\u2019ll only be charged when I post new content.
