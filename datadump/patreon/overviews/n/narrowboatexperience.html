In winter. With our two cats Munchkin and Alice (you may be familiar with their work on YouTube).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are amazed that people are interested in following our journey and really appreciate the views, comments and the extra support when people buy Anna\u0026#8217;s artwork. For anyone wishing to show support in another way, we have set up Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDon\u0026#8217;t worry, all of the content we post on YouTube and our website will continue to be free. You don\u0026#8217;t \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e to become a Patreon to view this content. Please don\u0026#8217;t feel pressured to spend money you don\u0026#8217;t have. However, if you do wish to sign up, thats great too. Our aim is to do more travel (whilst keeping the cats in the manor they have become accustomed) and produce more videos to entertain you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s good to note: \u003c/strong\u003ePledges are per month - this means that if we go on a posting spree (16 days of Summer anyone??) then you won\u0026#8217;t get charged for each release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are some rewards listed at the side of the page (but you can also choose your own amount). We will post some \u0026#8220;unseen\u0026#8221; footage - a little bit of sunshine to brighten your day. And knowing us, we might run an ad-hoc giveaway should Anna have a productive day at her easel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks for reading and for following us. We are looking forward to some more adventures in 2017 and would love to continue to bring you along for the ride. \u003cbr\u003e"
