    "summary": "Hello all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince October of 2011, No-Budget Nightmares has been shining a light on the best (and worst) of SOV, no-budget and ultra low-budget cinema. During that time I\u0027ve reviewed dozens of films, interviewed a ton of directors, actors and writers and Moe Porne and I have released nearly 60 episodes of the No-Budget Nightmares podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s always been a labor of love, and it will continue to be.. We\u0027ve always been able to make-do with our limited technology and get these reviews out to you. But lately the quality of the episodes has become a tad inconsistent, and that\u0027s been hurting us. We want to be able to bring you regularly scheduled content - two episodes a month, a review a week, and VIDEO CONTENT - and that\u0027s just not going to happen with our current extremely limited budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp us improve the show! Every cent donated will go right back into hosting, equipment and software. You\u0027ll be helping us create more content, and we\u0027ll continue to create an environment for fans to interact with No-Budget directors. And US!"
