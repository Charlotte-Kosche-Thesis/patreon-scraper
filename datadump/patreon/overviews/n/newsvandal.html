    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://newsvandal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Group-36.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe RUNDOWN began in 2012 as my response to getting fired by a\nnews aggregator that made a lot of money by simply cutting and pasting articles\nonto its website. Someone else did the work and we just took it. This simple\nact of \u201cstealing\u201d stories wasn\u0027t just an ethical problem for those of us\ndoing the cutting and pasting. It also denied the authors, reporters and news\noutlets the one and only thing that really matters in the wild west of the\ninternet \u2026 and that\u0027s clicks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf someone was\nreading a great investigative piece or a sharp op-ed on this pirating website \u2026\nthat meant they weren\u0027t reading it at the source. And that meant the\noriginating source didn\u0027t get those all-important clicks and that, in\nturn, meant they couldn\u0027t get their well-earned share of the internet\u0027s\noften paltry ad revenue pie. And they desperately need that revenue to FUND\ntheir reporting, to PAY good opinion writers and, perhaps most glaringly, to\nshoulder the high costs often associated with investigative journalism. So, we\nwere stealing more than stories. We were stealing the traffic that should\u0027ve\nbeen their just reward for investing in good journalism.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNot\nsurprisingly, my tumultuous, trouble-making time at the \u201cpirate site\u201d was\nshort. But I also knew that the basic premise was sound. People wanted and\nneeded a curated source of news that turned each day\u2019s surging \u201cfire hose\u201d of\ninformation into a manageable, drinkable stream. The key was to do it ethically\nand to make certain that those who actually did the work got the clicks \u2026 so\nthey had an incentive to do more good work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that\u2019s why I\nstarted the RUNDOWN.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow you know why\nI stack the unaltered headlines over the exposed URLs. At first, it was only\nmeant to direct people to the ORIGINAL SOURCE \u2026 instead of driving traffic to a\nwebsite I owned and could thereby profit from by using that traffic to sell\nads. Rather, the RUNDOWN guides you to the source of each story.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI quickly\nrealized that the exposed URLs also functioned as an expanding catalog of\nwebsites and a de facto roadmap of differing sources that had differing takes\non the same story. Readers who skim the headlines see the full range of sources\nand viewpoints available out there on the interwebs. For an obsessed curator\n(like Your Friendly Neighborhood Newsvandal) this also presented an opportunity\nto use the headlines to tell a bigger story\u2014a \u201cmeta-story\u201d\u2014that, if you just\nread them in order, gives you a macro-level narrative look at the newscycle.\nYou might even find joke in there, too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u2019s the\ntrick, BTW. Just read the headlines through from top to bottom and you\u2019ll get a\ngood \u201ccheat sheet\u201d sense of what\u2019s happening. Then go back and dive deeply into\nthe stories that grab you. Or just click as you go. Either way, I believe the\nRUNDOWN does something unique \u2026 it consistently presents you with stories and\nviewpoints you\u2019d not otherwise find inside one the web\u0027s algorithmically\ngenerated echo chambers. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u2019s been\nover six years since I started this effort. The RUNDOWN has been recently\nredesigned and, thanks to the contributions of my patrons, it is finally\nsmartphone-friendly and easily accessible through MailChimp. And, yes, that\nbrings me around to something I suck at \u2026 and that\u2019s asking for support. Trust\nme, it all helps \u2026 even if it\u0027s two or five bucks per month here on \u003ca href=\"https://newsvandal.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=15a14ef5fbdec40eb0032a960\u0026amp;id=d36e294e32\u0026amp;e=390988a330\"\u003ePatreon\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOr, if you\u0027d prefer ... you can go check out some of my hyper-linked,\nlong-form journalism over at \u003ca href=\"http://newsvandal.com/\"\u003eNewsvandal.com\u003c/a\u003e and then drop a\ntip in my PayPal tip jar. And if you can\u0027t afford to do either of those things? No worries.\nThe RUNDOWN will not retreat behind a paywall. It\u0027s important to me that it\nstays accessible to all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven more importantly, I\u0027m planning to expand Newsvandal\u0027s offerings in the coming months. So, stay tuned and thanks again for your time and support. \u2013 JP\u003cbr\u003e"

JP\u0027s culls and curates the Newsvandal RUNDOWN from hundreds of sources around the world and the web. Each source gets an exposed hyperlink so you can see who is saying what to whom.
