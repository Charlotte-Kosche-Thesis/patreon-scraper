I loved the process of reaching into the unknown blank void and feeling around for what wanted to come forth. It was work\u2014 it required effort, and it was play \u2014 it required letting go. Exactly like writing this book.  From the world of design, I was called more deeply into the human role of apprehending the patterns behind the visible world and found transpersonal psychology, ecopsychology and eventually contemporary wilderness rites of passage. I realized I had fallen in love not only with design, but with the Bigger Design of it all. From here, I get excited about human capacity and potential, about our design and its place in the Big Picture. The deeper you go in learning about design and the principles and processes behind it, the more mystical it becomes. Ultimately, because learning design is learning to see with different eyes, it will lead you to the Big Fundamental Truths of (BFT) of the human experience, of being a self-reflective, conscious creature apprehending Creation. This book is a call for each of us in these times of upheaval and change to widen our ordinary perspective to include what has become invisible to us \u2014 the aware and vibratingly alive natural world from which we evolved.
