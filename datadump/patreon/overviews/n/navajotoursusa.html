In our Navajo clan story,\u00a0Changing Woman gave a cane made of black jet to the Mud Clan people and with this gift, the Hashtl\u0027ishnii Clan became skilled and creative people. Today, they are rug weavers, crafts people, and farmers. Changing Woman gave them the porcupine, called dahsa\u0301ni\u0301, as their symbol of protection.
