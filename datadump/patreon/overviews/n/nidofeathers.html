    "summary": "Hey, I\u0027m feathers! I love writing, I love fanfiction, and I love to write fanfiction for you. Especially when it involves \u003cem\u003eLove Live! School Idol Project\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn just over three months I wrote one of if not the most popular fan story on Archive of Our Own in the \u003cem\u003eLove Live! School Idol Project\u003c/em\u003e section (in terms of hits, at least). I want to continue to create stories along that same vein for everyone in our growing fandom to enjoy at the blistering pace I\u0027ve set for myself, and challenge myself to create better quality content as I progress. I am lucky enough that I have an editor (Pages, aka @I8Pages on twitter) who is universally knowledgeable about both the series and my horrendous punctuation, who works at the pace I\u0027ve set without complaint. He began helping me after Chapter 13 and worked with me for a few solid hours on the finale of \u003cem\u003eLove Novels \u003c/em\u003eso that I could publish it on April 19th - a significant day for Maki\u0027s fans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe plans to continue helping me throughout all three of my currently in-progress stories, and I\u0027d like to be able to compensate him in some way, as well as try to support myself a little through my writing. It can be tiring, however enjoyable it may be, so anything you might want to contribute is both helpful and encouraging. Of course, you are also free to continue reading my work without paying a dime - it is going to be written for you regardless, so please enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside of writing I work a regular full-time office job (where most of my writing is done. Not the greatest environment) on top of being a freelance illustrator. I also travel quite often to Love Live! related events, and you can follow those adventures on my twitter. In a less busy future, I\u0027d like to be able to branch out into illustration on top of writing, and perhaps ease myself out of my aforementioned office job. Maybe Patreon can help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have decided to try out being paid per chapter, so when I am not producing content for any reason, you are not paying me anything. For reference in terms of how much you\u0027d be paying per month, I generally update once a week after starting a story, twice if I\u0027m exceptionally productive. In the future I may expand writing reward tiers based on how successful this is. I warn you in advance though, I don\u0027t feel incredibly confident in writing anything that isn\u0027t NicoMaki, or that doesn\u0027t heavily focus on either of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to read this, and I hope you can continue to enjoy my writing in the future.\u003cbr\u003e"
