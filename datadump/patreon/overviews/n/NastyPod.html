    "summary": "WE ARE THE FUTURE.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, we are actually three 30 year-old dudes who like talking about baseball, studying baseball, and giving people advice on baseball. Along the way we also like to attempt to get people to laugh at least a little, and provide some joy in their exciting, adrenaline-fueled lives! We hope you like our product, and we hope we can give everyone something to look forward to week to week with our random, meaningless banter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the truth of the matter remains that this is hard work. To put out a high-quality product requires the technical expertise, equipment, and time and energy to do it. And that\u0027s only the technical aspect of it. To be able to give real advice, advice that you could largely get from a number of other sources requires sharp minds, lots of reading, trend analysis, and constant time and effort to understand what can best help you as a fantasy player or baseball fan. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why are we special? In an sea of talking heads offering baseball advice we need to prove to you that we are worthy of your attention. We do this in three ways:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Quality. We expect to put out a podcast that sounds good on a technical level and let\u0027s you know that you\u0027re dealing with a professional product. Quality also stands for the type of advice and information you\u0027re going to receive from us as analysts. Nathan has written for sites like Big Guy Fantasy Sports (BGFS), Fantistics, and now THE leader in dynasty baseball; Fantrax. Ron is working towards his Master\u0027s degree and has written for BGFS, and Fantistics, and Van\u0027s educational background in journalism has given him many opportunities including writing for untold sports websites including the aforementioned BGFS and of course, now at Fantrax. These are three dedicated, lifelong baseball fans who want to talk about baseball, learn about it, and share what they know with others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Experience. The NastyCast is now entering it\u0027s FIFTH year of existence. This is a blessing not many people expected when the trio of Nate, Joe, and Jesse began by weekly talking loudly in their accents and making fart noises. But through the evolution of the show Nate has brought on Van of his own former podcasting gigs and former radio work, and Ron from the swamps of Florida to really up the ante and bring some great baseball knowledge and draft/trade/owning expertise it takes to succeed in this demanding industry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Fun. Most importantly, we are in this to have fun. If we don\u0027t get a single Patreon and our listenership dwindles to nothing, then guess what? We don\u0027t care. We\u0027re going to keep doing this. This represents a passion for the three of us and if it wasn\u0027t, we wouldn\u0027t be taking away our precious free time from our families or cats to do it. We\u0027re here to have fun, make Thicc Boi jokes, and hopefully give someone somewhere a good time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd even if you can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to donate money, that\u0027s perfectly fine. We want you to know that as our listeners you are something special to us, and that we appreciate each and every one of you. Except you Barry. You\u0027re the worst."
