    "summary": "I am Nikita Nelin. I see strange creatures all the time. They\u0027re everywhere I look, big and small, and they are what connects everything we name. They are stories. I\u0027m a storyteller. A storyteller\u0027s job is to invite the performance of these creatures through some tangible abstraction or other. Thus, art. My tangible abstraction is language. I\u0027ve had some success in my time with my tangible abstraction. I received the Sean O\u0027Faolian prize for fiction, the Summer Literary Seminars prize for nonfiction, and was a finalist for the Restless Books Immigrant prize, and others. None of these prizes directly addressed the creatures but would not exist without them. I\u0027ve published stories, essays, journalism, and poetry. What else am I that will make you take notice? Here are some of \u0027my\u0027 creatures. I am a former \"at-risk\" youth who has done work through Yale Press and Columbia University; an immigrant who has won awards in a second language; a high-school dropout who has taught college. I read tarot, am trained in statistical analysis (though I never use it), and often I listen to Leonard Cohen as I write. I love New York but live in Seattle. I have joined the \"circus\" twice, the first time caravanning across Europe as a refugee with my mother, and the second time ending up in the middle of the Nevada desert and building huge art. There is no separation between my writing and my life -- both are products of bewilderment and awe, both are made real by those creatures.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of them can be found\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://nikitanelin.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0But I\u00a0want to show you more of these creatures. Help me share them with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Projects:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1) The Retinue (Novel)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"\u003cem\u003eThe Retinue\u003c/em\u003e is a contemporary reframing of Mikhail Bulgakov\u2019s \u003cem\u003eMaster and Margarita. \u003c/em\u003eStaged between November 7th, 2016, and January 21st, 2017, and structured as a road-trip narrative where Woland (the devil) and his retinue of \u2018others\u2019 tour America in James Carville\u0027s stolen winnebago, it is a near realtime reflection on the complexes and projections animating modern American society. Margarita is re-envisioned as the Master, and one of Woland\u2019s assassins \u2014 an orphan from a war ravaged Eastern European nation \u2014 as her twin flame. The plot takes us from New Orleans, to El Paso, to Las Vegas, to the Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota, and the Pacific Northwest. The journey considers America\u2019s politics, cultural mythos, and mysticism. Less singularly satire than the original, \u003cem\u003eThe Retinue\u003c/em\u003e seeks to confront America\u2019s addiction to shaming and polarized mindset while still adhering to the governing principle of the original \u2014 to depict a world on the cusp between the magic and the mundane. The primary story is informed by Margarita\u2019s dreams, revealing the true nature of the Persian poet Rumi\u0027s relationship with the visitor Shams.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2) The Fifth Season (Immigrant Memoir)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\"The Fifth Season\u003c/em\u003e follows Nikita and his mother Natasha\u2019s flight from the crumbling Soviet Union in November of 1989, three days before the Berlin Wall collapses, as they trek across Europe carrying everything they own: four suitcases, a broken samovar, the nebulous idea of a better life, fragmented memories of everyone they left, and the all encompassing desire for an adventure. They are part of the last great wave of the Soviet Jewry migration and they are thrown into a world of awe, criminality, foreignness, anti-Semitism, and the wretched paranoia of their fellow refugees. They traverse what their Jewish community titles \u0027the passage of guilt,\u0027 through the mountains of Austria and into Italy. Once arriving to Rome\u2014 designated as the central sorting station for the formerly Soviet refugees \u2014 they are told to wait indefinitely until their asylum status is confirmed. Nikita and Natasha find themselves on a never-ending search for boarding rooms, work, food, tree branches for a wood burning stove, and community. They begin to seek their own private lives. Lulled by the Europe of her dreams, Natasha enters a romance with an Italian man, which threatens her son\u2019s obsession with going \u0027to the end of the line\u0027\u2014 to America. Nikita is drawn to the lurid offerings of refugee life: Russian bazaars, squeegee-punk and late night scavenging enterprises, hooliganism, and the nihilistic attitudes of the men with the \u0027eat-prey eyes.\u0027 Nikita\u2019s and Natasha\u2019s understanding of their history is soon challenged by the true nature of their reasons for fleeing, and their dreams for the future begin to conflict, ultimately testing the most precious possession they carry: their love for each other.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n3) Cover Letters (Interviews)\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently 44 million americans are facing student debt, which amounts to 1.5 trillion dollars. Many of these borrowers will never crawl out from under this number. But we already know this. For many this is a deep personal burden, one theoretically \u0027shared\u0027 but rarely talked about with others. I am interested in the cost of this debt, primarily these questions; what choices are people making because of their debt? What dreams do they not pursue? What do we compromise as individuals and as a society? And, how are we contributing to the design of a false work agreement? The issue of student debt signals to a breach of the social contract.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor years I have been writing cover letters for myself and others. I first interview the subject, inquiring of their professional goals and sometimes their personal goals and the hopes that had initially launched them in the professional track. Often, by this point, the personal dreams have already been significantly compromised. This became a creative project when I\u00a0began creating alternatives to the accepted cover letter form, one that acknowledges the real motivation behind the cover letter. The structure is simple; the professional voice devolves into the personal, thus signaling its awareness of a broken social contract. Cover Letters, revealing the human behind the cover.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition, I write poetry and voice driven\u00a0vignettes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
