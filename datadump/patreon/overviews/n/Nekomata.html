    "summary": "I\u0027ve been working on Pokemon: Rising Shadows for over five years. Over 200 pages have been made thus far and while I have no intents of halting updates, it\u0027d be great to get some extra funds to help with life and other things so I can work worry free!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso while working on PRS, I\u0027ve been working on an original comic: Nightfall! While Nightfall hasn\u0027t officially launched, I\u0027ve been heavy in the concept and world-building stage. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons will receive special access to both PRS/Nightfall concept art, full-resolution PRS pages and art, and other special goodies that I won\u0027t share anywhere else! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nClick \n\u003ca href=\"http://risingshadows.smackjeeves.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e to go to the main PRS site!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBelow is\u00a0 information on some of the rewards being offered. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eConcept Art and Doodles\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eAll Patrons will have access to view various art that I do that would normally never get posted, such as random/rough doodles and concepts that I would usually deem to spoiler-y or rough for formal upload on DeviantArt. This includes sketches/concepts for my other projects- not just PRS!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eMonthly Request Streams\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery month I will do a stream for patreon users to request doodles/sketches of various things. The stream will last for at least 2-4 hours- sometimes longer if I can manage it. I will try to schedule the streams in advance so that people can plan around the streams. Typically, they will fall on a weekend.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile the streams will be open to the public, patrons will get priority to make requests on what I draw. While I\u0027m open to drawing most things, I only ask that NSFW content not be requested. Other than that- ask away! If I\u0027m particularly happy with a doodle/sketch, I might color it in!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eEarly Access to PRS Pages / Full Res Art\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI will post PRS pages early here for the patrons. However, sometimes I might be running low on buffer and will be unable to post the pages early. I will do my absolute best to maintain a steady buffer to avoid this. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEarly access to the PRS pages includes any previews / WIP shots I post. I typically share the odd panel or two on the PRS forums- but some previews will be patron exclusive- particularly ones that involve a large portion of the page or may be slightly more spoiler-y than the usual sneak-peaks.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eIn addition to getting the pages early, Patrons of the $10 tier and higher will get to see them in their full 2,216px \u00d7 3,324px glory! Patrons of the $25 tier can request access to the High Res version of any non-commission artwork I do. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eDesktop Background\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Twice a month I\u0027ll put together a desktop background for all patrons of the $5 tier and up. The background may come from PRS pages, random art, etc.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eMonthly Postcards\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eEvery month I\u0027ll be printing out a batch of postcards to send to my wonderful supporters! It\u0027s a simple gift- but it certainly can be fun to get things in the mail! Each postcard will be signed by me with a short thank you message. Patrons of a certain tier and up may request little doodles on their cards.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach month I\u0027ll be drawing a different image for the postcards to keep things interesting. Patrons of a certain tier and up will have some say on what the image is as I\u0027ll be posting a monthly poll to decide.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons who join in and have missed out on previous cards may request receiving and older print instead of the current monthly if I have any left in stock. The amount of each I print will vary depending no the number of patrons- so stock may be limited. Once I\u0027m out of stock of one card, I will not print anymore.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eTime Lapse Videos\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI will sometimes record my screen as I work on art. Whenever I do, I\u0027ll put together the recording/s into a video and speed it up so that people can see my art process sped up. Some videos will be public but many- especially those of commissions or other more serious work- will be patron exclusive. Any and all streams I do get recorded as well- those are the most likely to be public.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eDoodle/Sketch Requests\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons of the $15 tier and up get an extra request each month. This works the same as the request streams except that you may choose to start a new sketch or finish a previous sketch (regardless of it\u0027s current stage). Patrons of the $25 tier may request a full sketch. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote that the requests follow the same rules as request streams.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAny and all file, including, but not limited to, images, videos, PSDs, and PDFs are for personal use.
