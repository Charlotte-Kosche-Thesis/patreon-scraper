Several other titles have been featured, and many more will be enjoyed in the time to come. Currently on the future title list are: Kingdoms and Castles, Oxygen Not Included, Transport Fever, and King under the Mountain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo become part of this noble endeavor, there are several funding/reward tiers from which to choose, or simply do your own thing and donate as you are led, accepting or ignoring the reward tiers. Those wishing to make a one-time donation for a specific project or purchase may simply\u00a0set up a monthly subscription then cancel when the desired funds are charged.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunds raised through appreciative Patrons will be used to purchase\u00a0video editing software and\u00a0new games used\u00a0to record future video series,\u00a0maintain or replace computer equipment, or for specific purposes requested by individual donors. Later funding goals involve supplementing income lost by spending so many hours creating entertainment content instead of putting that time into my family business. The more funds come in, the more future flexibility for time to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWatch the sample video to see an example of what these funds will continue to support. Thanks much!\u003cbr\u003e"
