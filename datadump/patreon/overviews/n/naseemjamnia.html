    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eEXCITING NOVEMBER 2017 ANNOUNCEMENT: \u003c/strong\u003eAll patrons will get my questionable first draft of the novel I\u0027m writing for NaNoWriMo! $1/mo gets you access to unedited daily pages, Q\u0026amp;A about the process, and an accountability buddy if you\u0027re also joining in!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi Patreon! I\u0027m Naseem. I\u0027m here to write stories that center marginalized voices, whether through narrative nonfiction, novels/short stories, or my monthly reflection series on growing pains (as a person in this world and as a feminist) called the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tinyletter.com/naseem\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTuesday Telegrams\u003c/a\u003e. My true love is fiction, and I want to be a full-time novelist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp until December of 2016, I was a neuroscientist working on the models of neuropsychiatric disorders. I was a PhD student at UPenn, sneaking in bits of writing when I could. As of January 2017, I\u0027m a full-time freelancer, doing whatever odd-jobs I can to make ends meet. Which, lately, hasn\u0027t been much, because depression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027ve always been a writer, and I\u0027m here to tell the hard stories. I\u0027m here to uplift marginalized voices. As a queer, non-binary, disabled (shockingly, mental illness is disabling!), Persian, Muslim, child-to-immigrants, I think about my pale skinned/white-, cis-, and abled- passing privileges all the time. I want my voice to be heard, but more importantly, I want to tell your stories. So that\u0027s why I\u0027m here: writing to tell the stories people are afraid to tell, and to center the voices that are usually ignored.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does this work? \u003c/strong\u003eOnce a month, Patreon will charge you whatever amount you choose. I decided to do a monthly campaign so you know exactly how much you\u0027re paying. I write a lot\u2014I work on novels, send out (now monthly)\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tinyletter.com/naseem\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enewsletters/blogs\u003c/a\u003e, and freelance (although I\u0027ve been doing less of that in past months).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first big goal is to make $1400/month (to cover taxes, too), which will cover all major expenses while my partner is in graduate school without pulling from our savings. I would like to eventually have a living wage from my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support me? \u003c/strong\u003eSupporting queer, trans, Muslim artists in the U.S. right now makes a difference. (And Black artists. That\u0027s not an afterthought; it\u0027s just that I\u0027m the first three identities and not the fourth.) We\u0027re in a political era that threatens many of our lives. I live in daily fear for my family, who doesn\u0027t pass as American as well as I do. If you want to make a difference, support artists in this time. I don\u0027t shy away from politics in my work, and I especially think about intersectionality. I will ALWAYS fight for the people our system tries to oppress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso: my video does need to be updated, as I still identified as a woman when I made it. Yes, I was designated female at birth. No, I no longer identify as a woman. But I find it \u003cem\u003eso funny \u003c/em\u003eand it features a cat that is no longer in my life, because she went missing :(\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
