    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Jamie, and I strive to live an artful life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live an alternative \"lifestyle\", these ways are as integral to me as the blood in my veins.\u003cbr\u003eWho I am:\u003cbr\u003ein high school I was the mother hen of the outcast group. Nearly all of my time was spent in the art labs. I was the only girl allowed to accompany boys into the total darkness dark room to help them process their film, I got the keys to the lab when the teacher was out. I thrived in that classroom.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy my childhood was very rough, my adulthood has it\u0027s own struggles. I counter years of abuse with the creation or displaying of something beautiful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy most successful creation is my teen-aged gender neutral, bi-sexual child whom I refer to as the AK (awesome kid).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I put my life and my soul into my work. I strive for beauty and grace in the chaos of life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat i do:\u003cbr\u003eMy area of expertise is photography. I started shooting in high school long before Photoshop and digital cameras were as popular in homes as wifi. I shot film, I built pinhole cameras and I developed both prints and negatives on my own. It took me a very long time (probably too long) to make the transition to digital photography and really, did I? I still shoot film photography when I can. I feel that digital photography is a valuable tool, but I do not rely on it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring my time as a college student I found my passion in alternative processes. I spent hours and hours hauling stacks of frames loaded with cyanotype, van dyke, and gum dichromate toned papers and fabrics up and down the elevator and in and out of the sunlight day after day coating toning exposing washing and setting image after image, after image on top of image on top of image.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am drawn to contrast, both physical and metaphorical and it is evident in my art. I am drawn to that which is generally discarded from our thoughts, and I find beauty in devastation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat i need:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help to be able to continue to produce my art. I am rooted to my home town until the AK graduates high school; but the area we live in is very conservative (we live in a pocket of the Bible Belt) and while many gallery owners have appreciated my work, most refuse to go against the grain and show it. The one time an owner took a chance on me he had to move two of my images to less overt walls before opening night, and I was complained to about how inappropriate the exhibit was. \"Why couldn\u0027t I just make pretty pictures?\" Seriously, that was said. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a single parent working two jobs trying to make enough money to keep a roof over our heads and still make my art. I can\u0027t apply for art shows without money. I can\u0027t make prints to sell without money. I don\u0027t want a hand out, I want patrons, investors, like minded people who want art to thrive. People that will cherish my art. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChemicals\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0potassium ferricyanide powder $25 /bottle\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0ferric ammonium citrate powder $50 /bottle\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0van dyke powder kit $45 /bottle\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0toners (wine tannins, green tea, oolong tea, peroxide, ammonia, coffee...yes coffee)\u003cbr\u003epaper $24/ booklet\u003cbr\u003efabric\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0Silk $5/yard\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0canvas $3/yard\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0cotton $20/bag of rags\u003cbr\u003ePictorico ohp transparency film $17 /packet of 20 \u00a08.5 x 11.5 sheets\u003cbr\u003ePrinter ink $45/package of all colors\u003cbr\u003eChemical disposal (price unknown)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003edeveloper chemicals $45/ gallon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCoffee...all the coffee\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow it works:\u003cbr\u003eYou set an amount to contribute, this could be anything from $1 up. I upload pictures, and at the end of the month your account is charged. If I create more than one image a month you will only be charged up to what your monthly maximum is set at. I give all of my patrons special rewards for helping me create. I also have patron only images of works in progress, or works fresh from the wash.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease only give what you can, as a struggling artist I am all too familiar with the soul crushing stress of financial debt. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney is not the only gift a person has to give; \u00a0there is so much you can do for me without giving \u00a0me a dime. I need help finding venues,\u00a0you can always spread the word,\u00a0help me find patrons, find fairs, contests, and conventions. I do shoot weddings, portraits, and commercial photographs too (if it pays my bills, I can do it...)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Make sure to set your monthly maximum so if I have a good run of images I don\u0027t drain your resources.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd Thank you, without your patronage, my art would not be possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
