Thanks for visiting my Patreon page! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI launched \u003ca href=\"http://nursekeithshow.libsyn.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Nurse Keith Show\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e in January of 2015 in order to offer high-quality audio content to nurses and healthcare professionals seeking expert advice geared towards advancing and elevating their careers. In its first year, the show reached listeners on six continents, and nurses have responded with praise and appreciation for the advice they glean, and many audience members tune in again and again. Some listeners say they love having me between their ears as they commute to work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing a podcast is time-consuming, and there are a number of regular expenses, including production and editing, podcast hosting, and promotion. And as more episodes are added, hosting costs increase. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to take \u003cem\u003eThe Nurse Keith Show\u003c/em\u003e to the next level, improve production, and reach more and more nurses with the message that their careers matter. Some potential ideas include: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Freeing up more of my time to create content by being able to pay my producer/editor to take care of time-consuming tasks that keep me from recording more episodes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Eventually launching a second podcast focusing on nurse entrepreneurship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) Buying Facebook and Google ads in order to reach more listeners in the U.S. and beyond. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4) Taking\u003cem\u003e The Nurse Keith Show \u003c/em\u003eon the road to nursing schools and conferences. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5) More ideas that are still just percolating.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d be very grateful if you\u0027d like to support me in my effort to support you and your fellow nurses!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much! \u003cbr\u003e"
