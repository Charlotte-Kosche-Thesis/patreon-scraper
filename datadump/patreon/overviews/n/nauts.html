I make computer music from my home studio(bedroom) in Los Angeles CA. I\u0027ve been writing and producing music for 10 years now(That\u0027s 70 dog years!). I\u0027m also fascinated with outer space and work in the rocket industry on the side. This gig heavily influences my art. My creations span from melodic deep house, heavy industrial techno, too wacky experimental odd time signature post pop, and everything else. All of my work is completely original, aside from a few mangled samples here and there, almost all of my sounds are either built from the ground up or recorded in-field(Maybe from a stroll through the park, or maybe even some strange alien space machinery).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0If you just so happen to love electronic music(like myself) and are looking for something different, you might just be in the right place. My goal here is to bring a quality memorable experience to fellow music lovers like myself who want something more than just a cool Spotify playlist or the next hit EDM track. So what exactly will that entail you might ask? Unlimited high quality downloads of any albums, EPs, or exclusive music content I\u0027ve created and publish through this site as part of the basic subscription package.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0But that\u0027s only the beginning, based on how much you are willing to contribute and how much you enjoy my work, you could have access to live streamed sessions, videos detailing my process, my equipment, breaking down my setup as well as general information on how my instruments work and their limitless potential all within the near foreseeable future. And If you produce music yourself, I\u0027ll even release sample packs and tools I\u0027ve created to give you that unique edge you\u0027ve been looking for. So again, I welcome you, and look forward to our journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eNauts"
