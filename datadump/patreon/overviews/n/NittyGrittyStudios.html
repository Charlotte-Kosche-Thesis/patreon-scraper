A decent video essay can make you notice something about a film or TV show you\u0027ve never noticed before but a GREAT video essay can illuminate for you something new about the world-- or even yourself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eUsing video and sound; music and images; text, narration, animation and a myriad of other resources Video Essays are at their best finely crafted pieces of filmmaking unto themselves-- and in being so require just as much hard work, dedication and resources to create as a film does.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/h4\u003eMy name is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3234488/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRyan \"Charlie\" Charles\u003c/a\u003e from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ryancharlesngs.wixsite.com/ryan-charles-editor/nitty-gritty-blog-film-tv-movie-top\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNITTY GRITTY STUDIOS\u003c/a\u003e and I want to make more video essays!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am a filmmaker and editor currently living in NYC and studying at the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/schools/mediaarts/schools/feirstein.php\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFeirstein Graduate School of Cinema\u003c/a\u003e getting my masters in Post-Production (but don\u0027t hold that against me).
