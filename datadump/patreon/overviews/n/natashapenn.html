     "about": "A mixture between science fiction and fantasy, futuristic and post-apocalyptic, Life \u0026amp; Death is a series following several individuals as they make their way into adulthood in a human world with otherworldly potential.\n   I have been working on this story from the time I was fourteen years old. It\u0027s gone through numerous changes throughout the years, but it\u0027s premise stays the same:\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 This is the Story of Life \u0026amp; Death.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Long ago, when the Earth was young and the stars shone by the trillions, humans knew of the existence of Spirits. They did not fear their otherworldly friends, for they only descended from the heavens in times of crisis. The valiant Spirits from above would go above and beyond, risk life and limb for the humans. Eventually the humans would wreak far too much havoc for the loving Spirits to handle, and after a few millennia of running to their rescue, the Spirits left humans to their own devices.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 There were two classes of Spirits; Royal Spirits and Warriors. As with humans, there were prejudices the Spirits of either class held against those of the other, and this led to many battles in the stars. As it happens, certain celestial bodies only held certain classes of Spirits:\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Warriors from the Nations of Mars, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto and the Sun;\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Royals from Kingdoms of Venus, Jupiter and Saturn;\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 And a mixture of both Royals and Warriors from the Grand Covens of Mercury and the single Earth Moon.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Alliances had to be made in order to keep the peace. Naturally, the Head Matriarch of Uranus wrangled the Head Chiefs of Neptune and Pluto into an alliance, as the three Nations resided to the far side of the system. The King of Jupiter easily negotiated a treaty with the King of Saturn and Queen of Venus, as they were the only Kingdoms in the system. Being the closest Nations in the system, the Head Chief of the Sun and the Head Chief of Mars created their own alliance as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Initially the Grand Covens wanted nothing to do with one another, let alone their neighbors; but as the skirmishes grew closer to home the High Priestess of the Moon sought out to unite the system as a whole. She made allies with the High Priest of Mercury; the Head Chiefs of Mars and the Sun; the Head Matriarch of Uranus; all three Kingdoms in the center of the system; she even impressed the Head Chief of Neptune with her efforts, eventually leading to their own alliance.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 The High Priestess\u0027 determination led the others to slowly rethink their prejudices. The King of Saturn and the Head Matriarch of Uranus paved the way to peace with the first alliance between a Kingdom and a Warrior Nation. Then came the alliances between the Queen of Venus and the head Chiefs of Mars and Neptune. The Head Matriarch of Uranus made an alliance with the Head Chief of the Sun, who became allied with the King of Jupiter, who became allies with the Head Chief of Mars allied with the nations of the outer system. The High Priest of Mercury even made an ally of the King of Saturn.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 There was one leader who would not branch outside of his comfort and make an alliance with the Kingdoms or Covens--the Head Chief of Pluto held fast to his belief that peace needed chaos in order to maintain the balance of the system. With all the battles at an end, and the entire system would become much closer to widespread chaos. When the other Nations ignored his ravings, the Head Chief of Pluto isolated his Warriors from the rest of the system. He grew mad, obsessing over the possible disasters that would undoubtedly result from this era of peace.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 With the next generation came nothing but hope and promise; in a time where most of the system was allied, the leaders had no reason to fear for the well being of their offspring. The system rejoiced at the existence of new youth, and the children traveled the system and trained in preparation of the positions of power they were expected to inherit. Two youths who were especially close were the son of the Head Chief of the Sun and the daughter of the High Priestess of the Moon. Born only minutes apart, the two Spirits shared many traditions; celebrations of birth, training, and they even preferred to travel together as opposed to traveling with the Coven and Tribe they were designated to lead. Though their parents had talks of betrothal, the High Priestess of the Moon and the Head Chief of the Sun came to the same conclusion. The only way to properly prepare the two Spirits for leadership is to separate them for a time. Doing their best to keep in touch, the best friends parted ways. The endearing Priestess spent her time traveling through the three Kingdoms, and the resolved Chief chose to learn more about the other Warrior Nations.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Years passed before the Priestess and Chief were summoned from their travels to meet their parents in the Nation of the Sun. The Spirits\u0027 friendship resumed as if it had never ended, and at this their parents announced that the two would be bound as soul mates for all the system to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 The Chief understood this as his duty to his father, the Head Chief, as well as his duty to the Warriors in the Tribes that spanned their large Nation. Putting aside his concerns, he agreed to the bond. After all, who better to be bound to for all of eternity than his best and oldest comrade?\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 However, the Priestess was furious. She denied the bond,  declaring that she would only be bound to her truest love, and that the Chief was not him. Then the Priestess fled the Nation, heading back to the Kingdoms.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 This shocked the High Priestess and the Head Chief, but the Chief himself was the most appalled. In all their shared letters she had never confided in him this secret, and the Chief wondered what else the Priestess could be hiding. Steadfast on fulfilling his duties and fixated on unlocking the secrets his friend kept, the Warrior charged after the young Royal.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 It was three days before the Chief caught up with the Priestess in the sea of asteroids between the Nation of Mars and the Kingdom of Jupiter... And a fortnight until either of the Spirits was heard from again. When their squads had found them, they were near death and battling with everything at their disposal. Using their signature weapons and special abilities, the Spirits continued their long and seemingly endless battle as their friends and subordinates watched in horror, unable to put an end to the bloodshed.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 When the King of Jupiter sent in the Prince and his Court, the Head Chief of the Sun took this as an act of war and ordered that the Court be destroyed. The Kingdoms responded to the Solar head Chief\u0027s threat in kind, and the Nations came to the aid of their ally. Even the Head Chief of Pluto, who gave no mercy to Royals.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 And so commenced a large-scale war the likes of which had never been seen before. The conflict became so abhorrent that the Head Chief of Pluto allowed his Warriors to terrorize Earth in order to distract Royals away from the battle that started it all. In response, Royals came to the aid of humans. Skirmishes erupted throughout the world for humans to witness, but in a time long after the Spirits had been forgotten the humans created new names for these awesome and fearful creatures from above. The Royals who came to their name were dubbed Angels, and the Warriors were labeled Demons for the actions of a few.\u003cbr\u003e  After months of combat, the Priestess and Chief were finally separated and banished to Earth by their leaders. They were told before being escorted off-world that they would live and die as mortal humans, and would need to achieve the awakening of their souls before they could seek each other out. Time moves more slowly in the heavens, as it is almost nonexistent; eight human generations had come and gone on Earth within a year in the sky, and the two Spirits still had not awakened and found one another. Desperate to see their children, the High Priestess of the Moon and the Head Chief of the Sun sent in the members of the Coven and Tribe the banished Priestess and Chief respectively led.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Another year and more human generations passed, the two Spirits still hadn\u0027t recovered their memories or their friendship. In hopes of aiding their colleagues, the heirs from the rest of the system and their squads volunteered to join the Priestess and Chief on Earth. They were;\u003cbr\u003e  The Priest of Mercury and his Coven;\u003cbr\u003e  The Princess of Venus and the Princes of Jupiter and Saturn, and their Courts;\u003cbr\u003e  And the Matriarchs of Mars and Uranus and the Chief of Neptune, and their Tribes.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 The youths and their subordinates rushed to Earth, and there they have remained for centuries. Walking among humans, unseen and unaware of their true potential for most of their lifetimes. The few times they awakened, they gathered their groups and searched for the Chief and Priestess, but with minimal success.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Until now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow my \u003ca href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flifeanddeath662.wordpress.com%2F\u0026amp;h=ATMP83Y1FpxtA7DeJF4jutZ1I8BHafFO1yvqkxMEmI35EaDOYZoauyXyotjpvdCENUsYvqZ3GL6ejK1nrfHUc6IWIuHVIsZ96SM4zj9wLyq5GloZ7Fxgr4Xey-rHXeCjqYVyCBWb62eb_A\"\u003eBLOG\u003c/a\u003e for new chapters!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClick \u003ca href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patreon.com%2Fnatashapenn\u0026amp;h=ATOgK3kTTiga1Qh-WCnJxd3eik15ZRBO1KUbHybnaOpyGZDUi0HLkv-GP2uZ8B2xWYTaMxKv_4EITnED54yrcesMgOccHqlso5NCqzDawMVgfnjbr8UAFGqTxMEjMlLBXcMUtn1pYFBq6w\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e for extra chapters, custom stories, character and group bios, \u0026amp; more!\u003cbr\u003e",
