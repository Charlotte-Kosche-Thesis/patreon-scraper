    "summary": "Everything had\nbeen just fine. Michelle had a part-time job and a quiet school life in\nNew York City. Life had been normal until her parents divorced and her life\nwent to Hell in a hand basket. She\u2019d been forced to leave that life to live in\nJapan with her mother.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOnce in Japan,\nshe discovers that there is a reason so many Japanese cartoons involved magical\ngirls fighting evil forces from another universe\u2014it can actually happen. This\ntime it\u2019s real and she\u2019s at the heart of it all as the leader of the Guardian Valkyrie in what is shaping up to be an all-out war against the Dark\nDragons\u2026assuming she doesn\u2019t get herself killed first.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThere are just\ntwo more problems to make the whole mess complete. One: The Dark Dragons know\nwhat they\u2019re doing while Michelle and the other five Guardians\u2026well,\nthey\u2019re still learning the basics.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eTwo: She still had to get used to the school uniforms.\u003cbr\u003e_________________________\u003cbr\u003eIf that sounds like an interesting story, then consider throwing a dollar or two my way and support the production of this comic and the artist behind it (Y\u0027know...me. :D ). The more support for it I get here, the more frequently I can produce the pages and get them up here for you to read!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is also the platform where I\u0027ll be putting my other original works up for some support (and boy, howdy, have I got a plethora of ideas!), so the comic will be liberally interspersed with the occasional single image illustration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will also find \"Behind the Scenes\" type posts (I don\u0027t do videos just now, sorry) that I do along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for me...well, I\u0027m basically a small-time illustrator. I do what I do because I enjoy it. There are frustrations aplenty, but the challenge is what make it fun and worth the effort in the end, and there\u0027s really nothing else I want to do with my life. I\u0027m also solidly introverted, so if I don\u0027t do a whole lot of interaction...that\u0027s why. It is...the way of things. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
