    "summary": "As a musician in 2003, I discovered there were few platforms to market my music, aside from the traditional methods of hanging flyers, passing out free CDs (yes, they were still a thing) and publishing shows in the local rag. After months of thumbing through newspapers and finding my (and my friends) shows waaaay in the back, cramped in a corner, obscured by ads for oil changes and Old Countey Buffet, I decided we needed a local print magazine focused on our entertainment community. I wanted to hear from the venues and artists, wanted a place to find shows easily, and see those beautiful flyers printed in color, huge on the pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to throw my hat in the ring and make my vision a reality. I sold almost everything I own (I was 23, so it wasn\u2019t much!), bought a small computer and put my first magazine together using text edit (crazy, right?) and the kind assistance from our local printing company. In my first issue I saw content that made me smile...huge flyers, local music information, articles about the artists, and the live shows were listed right in the middle! I continued this process every month for almost a year before I was introduced to Quark, making layout quite a bit easier. I LOVED what I was doing! Playing my music, producing my own magazine that was designed to help other artists and meeting new people along the way. \u00a0It was through my magazine and music I was offered the opportunity to host a radio show on our local community radio station. I discovered this was the perfect creative platform to spread the word about local musicians and their art! It was at this point I began to experiment with different voices and developing characters around them. Within this 3 year show, Dave \u0026amp; Angus were born. These snarky, lovable characters developed over time and and were received well by our community. Well....not the WHOLE community! Ha!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward 15 years-\u003cbr\u003eTime marched on, technology grew, as did my business, and I discovered podcasting. This sparked a new idea...why couldn\u2019t Dave \u0026amp; Angus have their own online show? I sat down and fumbled my way through a few podcasts. Before I knew it, these characters had more than 50 shows recorded and I started posting them. I found the boys could talk about anything from the weather, politics, our local pot hole problem and, of course, our entertainment community. Our followers seem to dig these two cats and now look forward to new content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy next vision is focused on animating these characters. This requires a much larger investment, as I will need new computers and funding for the animators. Although I tried to learn this art form on my own, I quickly realized where my limitations were and I decided to leave that to the professionals! Kudos to all you animators...you\u2019re the shit! \u00a0With the support of our community it is my hope that we can bring these characters to life. I have included a short video introducing everyone to the characters behind the scenes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
