Ralf Pickart, a.k.a. the Webcam Guy, built NS Webcams from 25 cameras in 2009 to more than 75 panoramic webcams across Nova Scotia.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eContrary to popular belief, Nova Scotia Webcams is not supported by the provincial government. Some of our webcams are sponsored by local businesses however the majority are not funded except through some advertising on our website. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEven with the 75 cameras we currently have, there are many other regions in Nova Scotia that deserve their own webcams. We have a few ideas (along the Eastern Shore, parts of Cape Breton or on the Northumberland Shore) but we also want to know where you would like to see a webcam. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have started a Patreon campaign to give our fans and regular users an opportunity to partner with us to support their favourite webcams and the work we do. You can also participate in growing our webcam presence in Atlantic Canada. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have two main funding goals:\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe would like to grow our webcam presence by installing and supporting several new Patreon-funded cameras.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEventually, we would would like to hire a software programmer to improve the website, develop mobile apps and help maintain our back-end systems.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eYour \"Patreon dollars\" will go towards necessary expenses such as new camera equipment, installation costs, software development, server infrastructure and web traffic fees. And of course a steady supply of coffee and pizza.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon\u00a0accepts all major credit cards and Paypal. All pledges are going to be converted into US Dollars. You may want to keep the exchange rate in mind when you are pledging.\u003cbr\u003e"
