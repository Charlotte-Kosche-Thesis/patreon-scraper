    "summary": "Hello there! Thanks for checking out my Patreon page. \u003cbr\u003eYou rock for even entertaining the possibility of offering your support toward my work + art.\u003cbr\u003eSeriously. \u003cstrong\u003eYou are amazing.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you don\u0027t know who I am: \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m Nissa, a photographer and artist \u003c/strong\u003eliving in the San Francisco Bay Area. I\u0027m the co-founder of Page + Pixel (a design and packaging service for the craft publishing industry) and in April, I\u0027m launching a new photography brand focused around new babies, new mamas and birth. I\u0027ve also been known to create photography and art for musicians as well as the occasional fine art photo series. Basically, photography is my lifeblood. It\u0027s how I make my living and how I express myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m at a stage in life where I need to ask for help -I\u0027m an artist who has recently become a Mom and left her full-time job to go back in to business for herself. This transition has been incredibly difficult - more than I imagined it would. \u00a0I\u0027ve got a wonderful husband and co-parent who works hard all week. We\u0027re struggling in the difficult economic climate here in the Bay Area and finding a quality support system while raising our son (we live 2,000 miles away from our family) has been disappointing. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve been questioning the idea of giving up my business\u003c/strong\u003e - but that feels like, well, \u003cem\u003egiving up.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0So instead, I\u0027m going to push harder in a few new ways. That brings me here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is twofold. I don\u0027t like asking for help - and using this platform, I can offer you things of value to support. Second, I\u0027m hoping that the goals I\u0027ve set for myself here will be a wonderful exercise in creativity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, here I go! \u003cstrong\u003ePlease consider becoming a Patron so I can give you cool stuff in return for your support.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 I\u0027ll be offering a weekly video chat about photography, photo critiques and mentoring sessions, Photoshop and Lightroom actions + presets developed my me, as well as physical art such as prints and hardbound books. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m going to look to YOU, my wonderful Patrons, to help shape that content.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eWhat are you looking for? What do you need help with? How can I help you\u003c/em\u003e?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll pledge $$ currently will go toward my expenses and will keep my family supported and my business running. I\u0027ll be creating some milestone goals once I get the hang of Patreon, because I think it\u0027s important to see where your support is going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to consider becoming a Patron!\u003cbr\u003eIt means the world to me that you even read this far.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eUntil our next video chat -\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
