    "summary": "Thank-you for visiting my patreon page. If you enjoy reading NewsScope, find it insightful, informative, and educational, consider supporting it by becoming a patron. Think of it a voluntary subscription, one that acknowledges astrology\u2019s deeper value than Sun sign fluff. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m Michael O\u2019Reilly,\nand have been writing the NewsScope column under the name Michael Wolfstar\nsince 1997. I could use your support to ensure that NewsScope continues to be\npublished. NewsScope is the longest running weekly (non-Sun Sign) astrology\ncolumn on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo help finance NewsScope and its home, NeptuneCafe, I have\nposted google ads, and that has helped keep this educational, insightful, and enjoyable site up and running. But mostly, writing NewsScope and\nupdating NeptuneCafe every week is an unpaid labor of love. I support myself\nthrough other means, and make the time to write three astrological blurbs each\nweek. Readers continue to tell me how much they appreciate all that I do, and\nthat keeps me going. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHelping NewsScope become self-sustaining is supporting the kind of astrology that metaphysically describes our interconnected universe, rather than the pervasive Sun sign, ego-massaging fluff that passes for astrology. I would like to keep the material here available for free to the general public, but that means relying on generous supporters like you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne option would be to send out NewsScope on a paid subscription basis\nonly, which (I\u0027m advised) would be the best way to continue writing this weekly blog. But there may be another and perhaps even better option. What would help\nme focus on my craft is having patrons who support NewsScope because they know that\nthis is authentic astrology, the kind that can improve the astrological community\u0027s standing in mainstream society.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nReaders have suggested that Patreon is a better\nway to support the site than by sending it out to subscribers only. So I\u2019m\ntrying it! The way Patreon works is a reader can donate whatever they want per\nmonth and the donation is recurring each month after that. So anything, from\n$5/month up, is hugely helpful to the cause. Consider it a\nvoluntary subscription if you like, one that acknowledges astrology\u2019s deeper\nvalue than the Sun sign entertainment blogs that saturate the web.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
