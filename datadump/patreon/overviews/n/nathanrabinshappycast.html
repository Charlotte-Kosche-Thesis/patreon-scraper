    "summary": "Hello! Welcome to the Patreon page for Nathan Rabin\u0027s Happy Cast, the official podcast of Nathan Rabin\u0027s Happy Place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a podcasting super-fan for years now. I helped introduce podcast coverage at \u003cem\u003eThe A.V Club \u003c/em\u003eduring the \"pre-failure\" stage of my career and currently write a column on great podcasts called Pod-Canon for Splitsider.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always wanted to do my own podcast but was held back by fear. FEAR! I have allowed fear to rule my life. NO LONGER!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I corralled my pal Clint Worthington into being the co-host of Nathan Rabin\u0027s Happy Cast. Now at this point you may have some questions, that I will attempt to answer here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How often will the podcast run?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eRight now we\u0027re thinking every two weeks. It\u0027s a lot of time and work and planning and coordination, so we want to make it as manageable as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What\u0027s the podcast going to be like?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eThe podcast is going to be very directly linked to the website, so I\u0027ll be talking about a lot of the stuff I write about for Nathan Rabin\u0027s Happy Place. I\u0027m also a huge fan of bad movie podcasts like \u003cem\u003eThe Flop House \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eWe Hate Movies, \u003c/em\u003eas is Clint, so we\u0027ll definitely be talking in a hopefully humorous fashion about bad/failed movies. Oh, and Control Nathan Rabin will be spun-off into a completely new, wholly audio feature \"Control Nathan and Clint\" where patrons have a chance to choose between which of two bad movies Clint and I will have to see and discuss.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Don\u0027t you already have a Patreon page?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eYes, I do, and without it, I would not be able to continue to make a living as a writer or to be able to devote as\u00a0much time and energy to the site as I am now. I consequently am pretty damn fond of Patreon, and crowd-funding,\u00a0which is why I decided to use it for the podcast spin-off.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What if I already\u00a0pledge money to the other page? Are you\u00a0trying to weasel even more money out of me, you greedy monster?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eYou do not have to give me a dime for either Patreon pages. I am incredibly grateful for any money I receive here and strive to justify your faith and belief in me. Nathan Rabin\u0027s Happy Cast is very much rooted in Nathan Rabin\u0027s Happy Place but it\u0027s also its own thing and the more money we raise for this, the more time and energy we\u0027ll be able to put into it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What will happen to the money I pledge?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eIt will be split evenly between myself and Clint, my co-host. Clint edits the podcast, he puts everything together and perhaps most importantly, he listens to me drone on and on. Surely he deserves to be compensated for such work. Heck, the man deserves hazard pay for willingly choosing to spend time talking to me. I can literally the number of people willing to do that on one finger: it\u0027s just Clint.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Will you read my screenplay?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, and that\u0027s kind of a weird question.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: If I pay you a thousand dollars will you read my screenplay?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eYes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Be honest,\u00a0you\u0027re going to spend all this money on \"Booger Sugar\", right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, and I\u0027m not sure I like the way this conversation is headed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: So you\u0027re\u00a0getting money for \"booger sugar\" out of this. What do I get?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, you\u0027re making what\u0027s hopefully going to be a great podcast possible but also rewards such as being able to vote on \"Control Nathan and Clint\" polls to determine what movie Clint and I have to watch, then talk about. You\u0027ll also have access to \"The Cutting Room Floor\", which will be full of outtakes accessible only to patrons. You\u0027ll also have that warm, life-affirming feeling that comes with helping something awesome.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027ve discovered that the more money you raise, the more time and energy I\u0027m able to put into work, and this is both incredibly rewarding and pretty time and labor and planning intensive, and Patreon can help make this an important and hopefully self-sustaining part of the business rather than an expensive hobby.\u00a0",
