Maybe some new pen and paper RPG has me excited and I want to bring it some more attention; or maybe I just got through a really good novel and I want to show it a little love, who knows?! My interests are vast and I don\u0027t believe I could bring you a \"focused\" channel as some other YouTubers might... But that\u0027s okay! I want discussions in comments, subreddits and even twitter. I\u0027m here to celebrate the things I find interesting and build them up for all to enjoy."

With this goal met though, I\u0027ll be able to ensure I can make my usual schedule and even plan more stream time.

From here, I\u0027ll start finding smaller Patreons that I can give around 5% of my own earnings. And, of course, as more goals are met I\u0027ll start support more and more.
