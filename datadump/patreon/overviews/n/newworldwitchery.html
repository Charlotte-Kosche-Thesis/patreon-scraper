We\u0027ve been producing material since 2010, and in 2015 we\u0027re still going strong! Producing a\u00a0monthly show and an informational site with nearly 200 individual entries (over 450,000 words) has become much more than a hobby, however, and we need your help! Thus, we\u0027ve launched ourselves into the brave new world of Patreon and fan-supported content. We hope to use the funds we generate through this endeavor to offer more of the material you love, expand upon our current projects (like the website and in-person events \u0026amp; classes), and launch new projects as well (such as books, additional podcasts, and new digital content). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll be offering lots of options to our supporters, and adding some new venues for interacting with us. We hope to be able to use patron support to dedicate ourselves more fully to the show and the site, as well as our fans! We know it\u0027s a lot to ask to make a commitment to us, and we appreciate it immensely, so please know that your support goes to build content for a community of people interested in folk magic and American witchcraft, just like you (and us)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever you choose to be a part of New World Witchery, thank you! We have had a wonderful time growing this project over the past half-decade, and we can\u0027t wait to see where you help us take it in the future!\u003cbr\u003e"
