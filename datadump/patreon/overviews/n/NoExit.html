We are proud to be the only performing arts group in Indianapolis that presents physical, interdisciplinary, site-responsive work. Each production meets three basic criteria serving as the pillars of our company\u0027s mission: 1) the recognition of location, socio-political atmosphere, and/or historic or cultural significance in relation to our work; 2) our awareness of the active engagement and/or physical presence of our audiences in our work; and 3) the creation of work wholly imagined by Indiana- or Indianapolis-based artists and practitioners. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are proud of the fact that we pay every artist who participates in our projects and it is our goal to raise artists stipends by at least 5% annually. We believe a world-class city requires a vibrant artistic community and providing a living wage is vital to create a safe and sustainable environment for our artists and creators. We are artistic leaders in our communities and it is our responsibility to foster the continued growth of Indiana- and Indianapolis-based artists by providing a support structure for risk taking and innovation.",
