    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eNo Dragons Press: A HIGH FANTASY Adventure\u003c/em\u003e is a bonkers stoner fantasy romp of multidimensional proportions---and it\u0027s now available as a weekly podcast!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach week, a new episode brings you another chapter of action-packed, poignantly heartfelt adventure in a mysterious (yet somehow familiar) world. We follow Addie, Tristan, Duc, and the rest of the gang as they try to find their way back home, and I add my own observations and updates on the story\u0027s development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are two reasons the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nodragonspress.com/podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHIGH FANTASY Fiction Podcast\u003c/a\u003e exists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003eknew \u003c/em\u003eI had something amazing, witty, heartfelt, and real.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIncidentally, I knew this because I started it as a quick one-off novella, something to clear my head after a particularly frustrating plot issue in what I thought was my main series. Oh, the lies we tell ourselves---I was\u00a0so captivated with the story that it got away from me pretty much entirely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(The series now consists of a planned five books, five novellas, and a whole lot of room for expansion. Buckle up!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second reason the No Dragons Press podcast exists is, of course, to expand my outreach for the story beyond simply publishing it---but my motives there aren\u0027t quite what you might think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to show as many people as possible how normal marijuana is.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Yep, that\u0027s that \"\u003cem\u003ehigh\u003c/em\u003e\" in \"high fantasy.\")\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story comes first, of course---but maybe that\u0027s precisely the point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetween the burnouts and the medically prescribed, there\u0027s everybody else, and a lot of them are smoking weed: Your neighbor. Your coworkers. The grad students, the grandparents, the servers. Every human outside the jazz club and the rock show, but a lot of them at the library, the grocery story---and the small literary press down the street.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNormalization leads to legalization, and legalization is an important economic, social, global, and human rights issue.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ePlenty more on that later, I promise, because there\u0027s plenty more to say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut not everyone has access to real live cannabis users in their lives to learn from, and the typical TV \"stoner\" is about as stereotypical as the \"reefer madness\" propaganda of the Roosevelt administration. What\u0027s an open-minded, law-abiding citizen to do?\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMeet Addie. She\u0027s a bartender, a graphic designer, and, like so many of us, a lot more capable than she thinks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe has to be, or she\u0027ll never make it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe may smoke a possibly shocking amount of marijuana, but once you get to know her, you\u0027ll think of that as the detail it is, just a part of her, like your friend\u0027s penchant for karaoke or your mom\u0027s yoga classes---a simple preference, a personality trait. Something that shouldn\u0027t concern you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt may or may not be for you, but it just isn\u0027t that big of a deal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is increasingly important in today\u0027s complex world that we see each other as people, and this is a place where everyone is celebrated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn No Dragons Press, bonkers shit happens regularly, lumberjacks emerge from closets, terrifying electronic basement experiments are always a good distraction from unsolved literary mysteries and douchey not-quite-ex boyfriends, and there\u0027s always someone around to smoke you up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also a place you shouldn\u0027t get too comfortable in.\u003cbr\u003e"
