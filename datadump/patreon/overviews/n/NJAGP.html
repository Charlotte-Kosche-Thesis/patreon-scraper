    "summary": "Hello Not Just Another Gaming Podcast Fans and Fanatics!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to Not Just Another Patreon Page! Okay, in THIS instance, we can see why it would be just another Patreon page. But it\u0027s NOT, because this one lets you show your support to us! Awesome right? You bet! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeriously though, In the past 4 years we have been working hard to keep our content current and most of all to keep it fun and entertaining. Well, that is the easy part. The hard part is the time involved in recording, editing, and posting the show as well as maintaining the shows feed and website, and the fees associated with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 we ran a straight up fund raiser with very good success. We were looking for only $360 to cover our hosting cost for the entire year, and that was all. Every dollar over that we spent on you, the fantastic lieteners, in the form of free NJAGP dice and shipping some fabulous prizes! Because of the successful fund raiser, we only had one sponsor during the year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, for years and years, we have preached that NJAGP is NOT a podcast that wants donations to help fund trips to conventions, including hotel accommodations, flight and travel cost, food cost, and event cost. We have never once used a dollar of donated monies to buy games or gaming accessories and we have never spent any monies on personal, non podcast or gaming items or goods. Buying a new $1500 computer, Flying to Essen Germany or having more merchandise than Walt Disney are not things that will help make NJAGP a better podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe would love to see the podcast reach year 5, and even year 10. With time being the most precious gift of all, because it is so hard to come by, that has been our gift to you, our listeners, Since February 2011 . Patreon offers a way for you to show your thanks by supporting us for every episode we release. It is a way to help us continue to afford our yearly hosting fees while not having to search out for sponsorship\u0027s. (We will do no more than 20 episodes per year, 2 maximum per month, through Patreon.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are hoping that Patreon will be a platform that will help us expand our show into new areas, provide an outlet to receive better feedback from you, and inspire us through your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccept our sincere gratitude for any support you give, whether it be as a Patreon, or just by listening and telling others about our show. Thank You!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Jim, Jeff, \u0026amp; Matt\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
