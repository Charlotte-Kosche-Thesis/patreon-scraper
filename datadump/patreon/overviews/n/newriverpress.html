    "summary": "New River Press was founded in 2016 by artist Robert Montgomery and poet Greta Bellamancina, the first poet-led poetry press founded in London for decades.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe exist to publish (and pay for) the best new \u0027page poetry\u0027 by emerging poets and radical voices. Our youngest poet, Rosalind Jana, is 21. She was recently highly recommended for the Forward Prize for Poetry, and blogs at \u003ca href=\"http://www.rosalindjana.com\"\u003ewww.rosalindjana.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur oldest, the late Heathcote Williams, died this year at 75. He is a counter-cultural icon that we are proud to have published the final book by. He exerts an increasing influence on poets today. His work was previously ignored by traditional publishers uncomfortable by his radical politics - with recent book length take downs of The Windsors and Boris Johnson - but today he has achieved posthumous recognition as one of the great polemic English poets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn it\u0027s first year we have published eight books, including 6 solo collections and a survey of new feminist poetry. We plan to publish half a dozen more before the year is up, and a dozen next year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current economy of poetry publishing makes it impossible to live as a poet without major external support. We plan to emulate the indie record label model- \u00a0New River Press is\u00a0run as a close collective of poets, where the poets get a much larger percentage of royalties on their books than most traditional publishers offer, and the poets are much closer to the design, printing, and production process. Some of our publications blur the boundaries between books and artist\u0027s multiples/signed and numbered limited editions. Ultimately we\u0027re experimenting with ways that poets can actually earn money from their craft. This is one of those ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that poets can see the future of poetry, and they can innovate it in publishing. We see a publishing industry devoting its resources to historical poetry. We want to create oxygen and support for contemporary poets, particularly with a focus on poets whose main medium is page poetry. We feel a lot has been done to help the spoken word scene, but page poets are still struggling to survive. New River is new oxygen for new poetry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
