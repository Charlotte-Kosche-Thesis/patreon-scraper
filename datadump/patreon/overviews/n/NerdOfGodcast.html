Our basic need is to pay for online storage space, to create an ideal recording environment (we are thankful for what we have, but there are humble upgrades we would appreciate) and to create promotional materials for outreach brand awareness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditional goals are to attend Comic-book, Collectible, Sci-Fi and Anime conventions to reach a larger group of people and share the love and light of Christ to a community often associated with darkness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration, and may God bless both the gift and the giver!\u003cbr\u003e"

It\u0027s always interesting to see how the timeless truth of the Bible is reflected in culture, and never before has culture been so influenced by things once considered \"nerdy.\" At the Nerd of God.cast, we embrace both sides of this discussion, and live on the edge of where Christ-culture and nerd-culture find sweet, sweet two-player co-op. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show is hosted by 20-year youth ministry veteran and nerd-before-it-was-cool Tony Talavera. He\u0027s joined by a cast of smart, funny geeks who bring to life whatever topic is on the table. Shows are released weekly, and made available through iTunes, Soundcloud, and other ad-free streaming platforms.\u003cbr\u003e",
