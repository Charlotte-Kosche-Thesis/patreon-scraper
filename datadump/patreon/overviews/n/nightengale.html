Here you will find tips, tricks, tutorials, fabric choice guidance, pattern construction guidance, access to special videos such as recordings of panels I run at conventions and video tutorials, group and one on one text and video chats, q\u0026amp;a sessions, live streams of my work process, work space organization ideas, iconographs, annotated photos, and much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i68.tinypic.com/2guflfc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2008, on an impulse and an instinct, I quit the office job that was crushing my soul and started my own sewing business, Nightengale Needles.\u00a0Eight years later, I have the good fortune and tenacity that lets me make my passion my livelihood; Nightengale Needles remains my full-time job. I\u0027ve even been able to add my fianc\u00e9s Trey and Simon to the mix. I sell my fleecy goods and geekery at anime, gaming, pony, and furry conventions from Boston to Atlanta, all up and down the Eastern side of the USA.

I believe that nobody has to live without joy. That whether it\u0027s in your job or your hobbies or your collectibles, joy and warmth of the heart are essential to living a fulfilled and forward-facing life. I hope that some of my little offerings can bring that warmth into your home, whether it\u0027s a scoodie wrapped warm around your shoulders or a plushie perched happily on your shelf.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything I do is handmade, never outsourced to factories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make a particular focus on offering LGBT+ PRIDE\u00a0themed items, because some people, myself among them, need more support and hugs when facing the world than others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Team\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/j8ioub.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the right we have my partner in business and love, Trey Yacek. Trey is the secondary seamster of the team, taking over the more basic plush designs so I can focus on the more elaborate ones as well as detailed commissions and intense product design. A growing talent themself, they\u0027ve also branched out into product design themselves, responsible entirely for many of our most recent pillow and Loafling designs. In addition to product design and craft, Trey also manages my convention schedule and inventory numbers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the left we have Simon Yacek, Trey\u0027s husband and also my partner in both love and business. Simon primarily handles my social media, keeping my fans and clients updated on what\u0027s going on with our products and convention schedule. He does all my web design, photography, and graphic design and editing, while assisting Trey with inventory management and keeping me on task. Besides his digital work, Simon is also a crafter in his own right, creating our one of a kind flower crowns and moving forward into cross stitch and hand embroidery.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
