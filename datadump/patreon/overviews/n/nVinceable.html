    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The reason I decided to start writing on Patreon, was because of\u00a0 a recommendation from Matt Shaw, the executive editor of \u0027Speak Up Magazine\" out of Charlotte, NC.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been writing for Speak Up for over a year.\u00a0 It\u0027s a 501c3 non profit that allows a voice for the voiceless.\u00a0 I was also in a documentary film titled, \"Something You Can Call Home\" that was filmed in Wilmington, NC in 2014.\u00a0 It\u0027s a film by Rebecca Kenyon and Mote of Dust Films out of London, U.K.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I\u0027m an alcoholic.\u00a0 I\u0027m not an active alcoholic.\u00a0 Many of my future posts will certainly include segments about what a devastating beast this disease is.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I\u0027ve never been married and have no children.\u00a0 I love having the ability to \u0027up and go\u0027 at the drop of a hat. I just came from Sarasota, FL in late August to Beckley, WV and will be going to Asheville, NC on November 16th, this coming Thursday.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\u0027m tired.\u00a0 I\u0027m tired of drinking and I\u0027m tired of living on the streets.\u00a0 I\u0027m just tired of being tired.\u00a0 I want to live - not just exist.\u00a0 I\u0027ve found that writing is therapy for me.\u00a0 Expressing myself on Patreon is like \u0027Therapy 2.0\u0027\u00a0 One day when I was really, really depressed I decided to pull out one of my journals and make a gratitude list.\u00a0 It was like a Gomer Pyle \u0027SHAZAAM\u0027 moment.\u00a0 My depression disappeared and a smile was upon my face.\u00a0 Zoloft had no effect.\u00a0 Celexa had no effect.\u00a0 The gratitude list was like a miracle cure.\u00a0 I\u0027ve found throughout my life since that day that it\u0027s all about perspective.\u00a0 I can find with little effort the good in people, places, and things.\u00a0 Obstacles are only obstacles. They\u0027re not barriers. I don\u0027t go around them anymore.\u00a0 I find a way through them.\u00a0 And I\u0027ve had many.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hopefully Patreon and my desire to help myself will enable me to carry on a productive meaningful life and also help others understand what homelessness is REALLY like.\u00a0 I will write not only about my life but also about others and what they are going through.\u00a0 Thank you for lending an ear, sometimes that means more than money.\u00a0 One of the problems with communication is that most people don\u0027t listen to understand, they listen to reply."
