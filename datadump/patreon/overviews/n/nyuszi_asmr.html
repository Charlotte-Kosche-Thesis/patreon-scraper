    "summary": "Hello everyone! I am Nyuszi Asmr and I create ASMR videos on Youtube. Being my patreon means that you can help me improve my equipment to make better videos, with better quality sounds, and helping me to afford the cost of different materials that I will need (from things to make roleplays to others like new microphones, software, lithting...) I would really like to let my channel grow, to join the ASMR community and to share with other people my point of view about this form of relaxation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWhat is ASMR?\u003c/div\u003eAutonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) signifies the subjective experience of \u0027low-grade euphoria\u0027 characterized by \u0027a combination of positive feelings, relaxation, and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin\u0027. It typically begins \u0027on the scalp\u0027 before moving \u0027down the spine\u0027 to the base of the neck, sometimes spreading \u0027to the back, arms and legs as intensity increases\u0027, most commonly triggered by specific acoustic and visual stimuli including the content of some digital videos, and less commonly by intentional attentional control.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe sensation\u003c/div\u003eThe subjective experience, sensation, and perceptual phenomenon now widely identified by the term \u0027autonomous sensory meridian response\u0027 is described by some of those susceptible to it as \u0027akin to a mild electrical current...or the carbonated bubbles in a glass of champagne\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe triggers\u003c/div\u003eASMR is usually precipitated by stimuli referred to as \u0027triggers\u0027.\u003cbr\u003eASMR triggers, which are most commonly acoustic and visual, may be encountered through the interpersonal interactions of daily life. Additionally, ASMR is often triggered by exposure to specific audio and video. Such media may be especially made with the specific purpose of triggering ASMR, or originally created for other purposes and later discovered to be effective as a trigger of the experience.\u003cbr\u003eExposure to stimuli that can trigger ASMR, as reported by those who experience it, include the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eListening to a softly spoken or whispering voice\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eListening to quiet, repetitive sounds resulting from someone engaging in a mundane task such as turning the pages of a book\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWatching somebody attentively execute a mundane task such as folding towels\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReceiving altruistic tender personal attention\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eFurthermore, watching and listening to an audiovisual recording of a person performing or simulating the above actions and producing their consequent and accompanying sounds is sufficient to trigger ASMR for the majority of those who report susceptibility to the experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhispering triggers\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003ePsychologists Nick Davis and Emma Barrat discovered that whispering was an effective trigger for 75% of the 475 subjects who took part in an experiment to investigate the nature of ASMR; and that statistic is reflected in the popularity of intentional ASMR videos that comprise someone speaking in a whispered voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAcoustic triggers\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eMany of those who experience ASMR report that some specific non-vocal ambient noises are also effective triggers of ASMR, including those produced by fingers scratching or tapping a surface, the crinkling and crumpling of a flexible material such as paper, writing and a person or animal eating. Many intentional ASMR videos posted to YouTube capture a single person performing these actions and their subsequent sounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePersonal attention role play triggers\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIn addition to the effectiveness of specific acoustic stimuli, many subjects report that ASMR is triggered by the receipt of tender personal attention, often comprising combined physical touch and vocal expression, such as when having their hair cut, nails painted, ears cleaned, or back massaged, whilst the service provider speaks quietly to the recipient. Furthermore, many of those who have experienced ASMR during these and other comparable encounters with a service provider report that watching an \u0027ASMRtist\u0027 simulate the provision of such personal attention, acting directly to camera as if the viewer were the recipient of a simulated service, is sufficient to trigger it.\u003cbr\u003ePsychologists Nick Davis and Emma Barrat discovered that personal attention was an effective trigger for 69% of the 475 subjects who participated in a study conducted a Swansea University, second in popularity only to whispering.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eClinical role play triggers\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAmong the category of intentional ASMR videos that simulate the provision of personal attention is a subcategory of those specifically depicting the \u0027ASMRtist\u0027 providing clinical or medical services, including routine general medical examinations. The creators of these videos make no claims to the reality of what is depicted, and the viewer is intended to be aware that they are watching and listening to a simulation, performed by an actor. Nonetheless, many subjects attribute therapeutic outcomes to these and other categories of intentional ASMR videos, and there are volumnious anecdotal reports of their effectiveness in inducing sleep for those susceptible to insomnia, and assuaging a range of symptoms including those associated with depression, axiety, and panic attacks.\u003cbr\u003eIn the first peer-reviewed article on ASMR, published in Perspectives in Biology during the summer of 2013, Nitin Ahuja then a medical student at the University of Virginia, invited conjecture on whether the receipt of simulated medical attention might have some tangible therapeutic value for the recipient, comparing the purported positive outcome of clinical role play ASMR videos with the themes of the novel Love in the Ruins by author and physician Walker Percy, published in 1971.\u003cbr\u003eThe story follows Dr. Tom More, a psychiatrist living in a dystopian future who develops a device called the Ontological Lapsometer that when traced across the scalp of a patient, detects the neurochemical correlates to a range of disturbances. In the course of the novel, More admits that the \u0027mere application of his device\u0027 to a patient\u0027s body \u0027results in the partial relief of his symptoms.\u0027\u003cbr\u003eAhuja alleges that through the character of Tom More, as depicted in Love in the Ruins, Percy \u0027displays an intuitive understanding of the diagnostic act as a form of therapy unto itself\u0027. Ahuja asks whether similarly, the receipt of simulated personal clinical attention by an actor in an ASMR video might afford the listener and viewer some relief.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
