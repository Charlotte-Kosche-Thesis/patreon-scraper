    "summary": "Thanks to all of you for joining me on Patreon. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Nathan Ivey Show\u0027s move to independence began in February 2016. \u00a0\u00a0Since launching, the show has been recognized as one of Cincinnati\u0027s top podcasts by Cincinnati Magazine. \u00a0While covering the RNC 2016 in Cleveland, I was featured on NewsOne Now delivering commentary about the election cycle. \u00a0Currently the show has 5k subscribers and the audience grows everyday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e After nearly 20 years behind the microphone, having made successful transitions from public talk radio to commercial talk radio and now internet talk radio, I have the experience, the talent and the connections to push this project to success. For those of you who have been following my journey in talk radio, I\u0027ve proven to you what I can do. \u00a0For those of you who are unaware, just know that this is the beginning of a new chapter. This is my pitch to get you on board with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIndependent/alternative media is essential to our system to work effectively for everyone. \u00a0Cincinnati, much like many parts of the country, needs an alternative media source. \u00a0In a city of, just over, 300k residents where nearly 45% are African-American, there is only one station which offers talk radio to the African-American audience, and none where you can hear progressive voices. \u00a0I offer both. Building upon the success of my morning show, I want to create a new media platform of live shows and podcasts. \u00a0A platform based in the city of Cincinnati, focused on Cincinnati issues with an audience that extends beyound the Queen City\u0027s borders.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 HOW CAN YOU HELP?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t do this without you...literally. The best way for me to do this, is to be beholden to no one but my fans and supporters. \u00a0The show is successful to this point, because of you. Your clicks, shares, comments and calls have lifted me to this position. I am humbled and honored that so many people enjoy the type of show that I provide. I\u0027m asking you to support me a little more. This is just the beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eBecoming a Patron means making a monthly contribution towards the show. The content remains free and you get rewarded for your level of contribution.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of $1250.00 not only enables me to update and maintain my current studio, but it will also allow me to realize my vision of a new studio where fans can stop by and news makers can drop in to discuss the issues of the day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Keep this in mind, The Nathan Ivey Show is a daily two-hour talk show. \u00a0I\u0027m delivering original content to you every weekday. \u00a0Listeners have expressed interest in expanding the broadcast time of the show. and I want to accommodate those requests. But to do so, I need your support. \u00a0I would like the show to be a multi-media format, with live broadcasts on YouTube. Reaching this goal will make these things possible. \u00a0The goal will enable me to update and maintain my website and Internet presence. \u00a0Your support will fund a marketing campaign to let people in Cincinnati, and beyond, know about the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI took the show to the RNC 2016 in Cleveland, Ohio this year and delivered what some have called ,\"the best independent media coverage of the entire convention\". I took you inside the protests, the convention hall and I even broadcast live from the convention floor while, now President Trump, was on the stage.  I gave you the kind of fearless journalism and commentary that you can only get from independent media. \u00a0want to do more. Your support will give me the flexibility to take the show on the road and broadcast from events in real time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue to provide high quality, fearless, audio edutainment, free from the control of anyone but my fans and my self. \u00a0 This is just the beginning, I am excited about what comes next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for visiting my Patreon page and reading my pitch,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Nathan\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
