I\u0027m a 22 year old transgender student currently enrolled at Rosebud School of the Arts in their 3 year Mentorship Acting Program.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share my art with you!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting this page you get inside views on my studies as well as everything I produce outside of school, as well as the knowledge that you\u0027re helping an emerging artist put food on his table.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs we all know: college is expensive, it\u0027s challenging, and it causes the person going through it to grow and change as they learn about their strengths, weaknesses and passions. So, I\u0027m documenting my experience going through this unique journey as I grow into the artist I want to be (Or find myself to be, as the case may be).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis Patreon doubles as a way to get my art to you (my... fans?) and a personal journal of my experiences here at this school.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have passion for many art styles, including\u00a0my clay pendants and sculptures that I create and sell,\u00a0my photography and videography that, while still new, are a huge part of my life now that I\u0027m in Rosebud. This page features some of each of my art styles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe creation of art fuels me. I want my work to be such that it speaks without words, and lights fires of thought, love, and growth in those who witness it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a huge journey in front of me and I know I can\u0027t get through it alone. So this is me inviting you along this road: Let\u0027s go on this adventure together!\u003cbr\u003e"
