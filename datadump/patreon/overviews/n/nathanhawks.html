    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eFirst off, thanks for reading!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0In brief, I\u0027m a professional vagabond with a self-signed doctorate in hard knocks. I\u0027ve followed cyberpunk to its natural conclusion (I\u0027m a heavily damaged IT-industry survivor turned hopeless drifter). Now I need to bring those experiences and perspectives back from the fringe and sell them to you, if you\u0027re buying...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSo, Here\u0027s the Deal (v\u003cdel\u003e1\u003c/del\u003e)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cdel\u003eThrow me a few bucks a month, I\u0027ll write one piece of short fiction per month. Throw in a few more, you\u0027ll see it a week sooner. Double that, and you\u0027ll be able to listen to it instead of reading it (or while reading it, or whatever\u0027s your fancy).\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWarning:\u003cbr\u003e The existing tiers are going to be deleted and restructured; \u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t really \"gone live\" yet.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eProblem:\u003c/em\u003e I have too many ideas and not enough energy. \u003cem\u003eSolution:\u003c/em\u003e I will work on whatever I want, whenever I want. \u003cem\u003eProblem:\u003c/em\u003e I need you to be able to get what you want out of that. \u003cem\u003eSolution:\u003c/em\u003e I will structure it for your benefit somehow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow are the current direction of thoughts and plans. This Patreon page is now openly \u003cstrong\u003eUnder Reconstruction\u003c/strong\u003e. But, remember these words:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\"Going Somewhere With This, Trust Me On That\"\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been working (often back-burner, but always hot) on an interconnected story multiverse since I was a teenager. I wanted to be old enough before I debuted with it that I wouldn\u0027t ever outgrow anything I published. Now it\u0027s a sprawling group of settings and themes expressing my thoughts on cosmology, human history, and the deep future, and a lament on the human condition, all intended as a place to show off my own conception of heroism. Despite it being science fantasy on many key levels, I still respect it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s just ... it\u0027s too big to approach as a single unit or series anymore, or even as a single kind of project. Here I think is where Patreon is going to save my butt. I can just publish everything; you can just support what you like or what you can afford to support. That means I can launch multiple comics on whatever schedule; as well as separate reward tiers for extra media, such as official art-pages covering elements of lore. Basically if I just do whatever I want, keep it organized, and offer you the chance to support me a-la-carte, everyone should be happy until I start overproducing and you find yourself buying a page of a comic every day. Oops. Maybe this plan isn\u0027t off the drawing board yet after all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat seems to make the most sense, beyond communicating with my one patron as to the status (done!) and updating matters here (done!), is to start doing stuff, and then come back to finish this page. So that\u0027s what\u0027s going to happen. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLike any new thing involving money, this is secretly a public beta; once I\u0027m giving you output, you\u0027re officially all paying to be my test animals. So, thanks again!\u003cbr\u003e"
