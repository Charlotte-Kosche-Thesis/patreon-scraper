Who started his journey into the world of comic creation In October 2015!. I was always the class clown / comedic relief in my friend group so this really just seemed like the natural progression. I have always loved humour, it has always seemed to come to me!\u00a0 To me, Humour is the ultimate feeling/experience. It is one of the only things in our world that naturally rejects bias. Through humour any one, regardless of religion, colour or sexual preference can connect and share an experience as blissful as laughter.Laughter is purity, it is the embodiment of happiness. A life full of laughter is a life full of smiles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page will help me push myself even further into the world of comic / animation design. Allowing me to allocate more time to my lifes one true calling. This will be shown via style refinement and even more animation projects :) I currently do 6 comics a week so if I can get this Patron Financed I\u0027ll be able to do at-least 8 per week or keep it at 6 and do 1 animation every week :D At the $100 amount I can take one day off work a month which gives me a full 12 hours + to do whatever I need to with. I know it seems small but in 12 hours I can get a lot of Hilarious content done :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be releasing a joke book containing thousands of original jokes written by myself. This book will also contain all comics and even a bit of a personal views about life. +$5 support of this Patreon will get a special mention in my book and a free copy on release.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating to this you are not just making more comics accessible, YOU are making someone\u0027s dream come true. I can\u0027t describe how joyous it makes me to bring laughter into the world of others. This Patreon will slowly help me make that more and more of a career! \u0026lt;3 Even the smallest of donations can help the largest amounts :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo anyone that\u0027s been a long standing fan, or has stood by me through all of this. Thank you so much. Every ounce of support you offer helps me in ways I cannot begin to describe \u0026lt;3 I used to wake up feeling as dull and distant from my reality but these comics, my page, really everything art related. Has helped reconnect to the happiness I held as a child. They are restoring my child like wonder and in turn I am destroying yours (am sorry about the fairly odd parents comics). I want to thank all of you for helping me achieve this. I hope to bring you many MANY MAAAANNYYY more good times \u0026lt;3 and promise that I will ALWAYS try my best. rain or shine, the NEST will live on \u0026lt;3!\u003cbr\u003e"

YOu will INSTEAD get me to draw literally Anything you want ( THERE IS A SLIGHT LIMIT, NO ILLEGAL THINGS PLZ )\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis drawing will be in my refined art style and I\u0027ll actually spend a large amount of time on it! Making sure it looks neato Mos-fucking-SQuito\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe drawing will be signed, with a thank you note, and you will Have a special shoutout on my page in the form of a sketch of yourself as one of my characters :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n++ All previous rewards ( Excluding the $20 tier reward! )\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0*UPDATE* - once every 3 months, I will do a contest for submitting an idea and it being made into a comic! being in this teir consecutively will allow you 5 VOTES and suggestions each time the contest is on (The winner will 100% be chosen at random but the more votes you have the likier you are to get selected ofc)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n**You MUST be in the reward teir for 2 months before I will draw your request, drawing in the intense style takes a lot of time and I need to know you\u0027ll stick around for it \u0026lt;3! This process of creation takes a LONG time (15 hours+) so even though you may just want to pay $200 upfront, that is more so a deposit for all the work. the actual cost I would usually charge is a lot more than $200 for this level of work \u0026lt;3 \u00a0(Although we will definitely discuss the ideas Before the drawing starts \u0026lt;3! ) \u00a0",
