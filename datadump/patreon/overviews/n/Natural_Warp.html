     "about": "I was born in the autumn of \u201976 somewhere in between the forests and meadows of Belgium as George Hoeylaerts. I started studying arts at the age of 9 and in the year 2000 I graduated in the Fine Arts - Graphics Design \u0026amp; Visual Arts. By then I learned how to use a wide spectrum of mediums and could express my visions into my creations.\u003cbr\u003eSo going from experimental photography, paintbrush (screen, oil, and acrylic), into welding \u0026amp; sculpting and after that jumping into the world of digital creativity was completely random and pure fun. This was my way to try and send some playfulness out into the world by creating many paintings, installations, and sculptures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e15 years later \u2013 after all this time searching and experiencing completely different styles and techniques, a healing dream led me to the more psychedelic approach I\u2019m handling nowadays.\u003cbr\u003eMy new Nindo \u2013 my new style of art - immediately found great success within it\u2019s first year of being released in Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Portugal and only a few years later it started traveling around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile on the outside it was a sudden change, I can trace this external change to an event that encouraged change on the inside as well. I guess it was after attending a lecture done by Android Jones in the land of BOOM in Portugal in 2008. The lecture included the Dreamcatcher project, an online dream-diary community with room for visual support that went online shortly after that summer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot that the world of dreams, psychedelics, and spirituality was new to me, not at all \u2026 but the Boomland does something to a man, especially the first time.  Being plunged into the psytrance world from the age of 20 really impacted me in a positive way and helped to shape me into who I am today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was enormously lucky to have been able to grow up in a family where my spiritual search was triggered at the age of 12 and having constant support in my pursuit of happiness was the perfect compliment to the genes I inherited from my mother\u2019s side. My great-grand-mother was a woman who had friends in the library enabling her to read spiritual books from the \u201cblack\u201d list, a privilege we barely understand in the age of numerous self-help books like The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle, now available in every bookshop around the corner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u2019t want to dig too far into my reading journey but I can highlight some influential pieces.\u003cbr\u003eIt all started with several of my mother\u2019s books including Erich von D\u00e4niken at the age of 12 and when I turned 16, Sophie\u2019s World pushed me a little bit further. By my 18th revolution around the sun Carlos Castaneda, Lobsang Rampa and Richard Bach helped me to open another piece of the world on a completely different level. By then the tone was set and we all know the path that follows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a visual way - as a kid - I was totally triggered by the natural and colorful approach of Antoni Gaudi, the dark side of H.R. Giger, and the surreal world of Salvador Dali. The curly world of the Jugendstil and Art Nouveau also influenced me a lot. Later, I was inspired by Android Jones, Alex Grey, and numerous other psychedelic / visionary artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, even more important as an influence in why and what I create - try to express myself in this world - is the dreamworld. A world that sometimes feels like it\u2019s on the inner side of my being \u2026 but at the same time feels like it surrounds me. Like all of us I guess I had dreams of the cosmos, interactions with monsters, extraterrestrials and inner-demons. Some of them really had a firm grip on my life, for example the one that jolted me with the power of lightning in kindergarten.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was 4 years old and ill, a simple fever I think, but I had to lie on a stretcher. Maybe half awake \u2026 in that vision I found myself floating in space, total darkness, hearing voices speak to me, they felt like teachers from another world. No idea what they said, but my perception of time and space was so unbalanced to the extreme \u2026 it wrapped me in total fear. Everything kept speeding up and slowing down, sizes went from nano to macro, sound pitched from high to low, up and down, all happened really fast and slow at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut now, in the year 2017 I would ask you this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you ever stared into a field of grass for as long as you could without blinking during a summer day?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, if I do this, I\u2019ve started to see beautiful patterns and a multitude of layers and fractals. I would recommend this to anyone since it is such an innocent and very meditative way to spend your time. To me it feels as if a constant waterfall of joy and pure liveliness that jumps out of the image, one that before I simply viewed as \"the normal world.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy latest work is the result of an attempt to translate these never-ending depths that are hiding mere millimeters behind the curtain of our everyday perception of reality. It is an attempt to build a bridge between any concept observable in this world and the unimaginable world of dreams behind it on the other side. To simulate a panorama over a landscape that stretches over countless of inter-dimensional facets of reality, a wonderful view we could only dream of to perceive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is an invitation to the mind of the observer to, even if for just a moment, feel the fractal nature of the now, to inspire awe for the multi-layered details whirling into the architecture of the moment, to try and connect with it\u2019s deep design within and to dive into that overwhelming experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy flirting with basic geometry and mixing it into semi-controlled random brushstrokes I enable myself to spawn multiple shapes at once and arrange them onto hundreds of layers spread over thousands and thousands of pixels while pushing the limits of my machine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou surely can imagine this makes me feel like I am playing with pure light and hyper-chaotic phenomena such as crystal growth or galaxy formation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA pure state of meditation, seeing things unfold before my eyes and balancing on the waves of light.\u003cbr\u003e",
