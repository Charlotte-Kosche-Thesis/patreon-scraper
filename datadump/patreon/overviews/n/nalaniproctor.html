    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to my Patreon! My name is Nalani Proctor. By day, I teach young and old the basics of music making. By night, I do my very best to write and sing songs. I also love to paint, write poetry, cook, and be crafty. I am, however, not the best at social media, or putting out new content regularly. And so, this will be an experiment, a test of sorts, for bringing me out of my internet shell. Your support of my art will allow me not only validation, but the ability to continue creating; to continue the path of the artist. Thank you for your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017, I used this as my platform to complete a 52 week challenge of writing a new song every Friday, plus performing a cover on Mondays, and putting out a craft on Wednesdays.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI had a goal of raising $1000 through all my musical endeavors for charities, and I was able to meet that goal. In December, I also embarked on a 30 day challenge of writing a new short song every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2018, I\u0027m taking a step back. I pushed and pushed and pushed last year, but this year, I\u0027m hoping to really pare down and focus on just a few projects. One, being the completion of my next solo album that I started two summers ago. I\u0027ll post updates here, but I will only post new songs once a month, or every other month, when I\u0027m able. I\u0027ve changed my patronage system to \"per thing\" versus the \"per month\" it was last year.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll still be donating to charities with the help of my music. My main charity choices are Planned Parenthood, The Humane Society, NAMI, and St. Louis Legal Fund.\u003cbr\u003e"
