    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello Nash Holos fans. \u0412\u0456\u0442\u0430\u044e! Welcome to my Patreon page.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA very warm Thank You!! for coming to this page, and for showing an interest in\nsupporting this radio show and podcast.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you also for showing an interest in supporting my ongoing efforts to\nbring Ukrainian programming to English-speakers who have lost or never had the ability\nto understand the Ukrainian language, as well as to those who have the great good\nfortune to understand both. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough the show and podcast have been free these past years (well, almost\nthree decades) I hope that you will consider donating monthly to support the\nshow going forward. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease allow me to explain why this is important. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat it has taken to get here\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThe show began in 1990 on CJVB Vancouver with me and two other volunteer\nhosts, under the auspices of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, BC Provincial\nCouncil. In 1996 we parted ways for personal reasons as well as changes in\nstation management. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2000 another radio station, CHMB Vancouver, approached me to revive the show. My previous two\nco-hosts declined to join me but gave their blessing to carry on the show\u2019s\nlegacy. As well, this go round there was no sponsor either. Fortunately, over the years I\nmanaged to get just enough income from advertisers and sponsors to pay for recording\nequipment, software, bank fees, and website hosting for the podcast (which launched\nin 2001). And even occasionally to put a bit of food on the table.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut it is far from a livable wage. Nor does it allow me any luxuries like\nequipment upgrades, travel, or hiring help. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMoving forward \u2013 or not\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFunding the show out of my own pocket was my own choice and I have no\nregrets. However, after almost 30 years, retirement beckons! I am not getting\nany younger and I can\u2019t continue the status quo for much longer. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat is why I have launched this Patreon page. Before I hang up my mic, I would\nlike to give Nash Holos listeners the opportunity to keep the show going, and ensure\nits perpetuity for future generations. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt has been my dream since day one to make this show a viable commercial venture\nthat can rival the most professional of entertainment and information shows out\nthere. I never accepted the \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d that said there is \u201cno\naudience\u201d for this kind of programming, and it just stood to reason that it\nwould not be worth the expense promoting. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI proved the critics wrong about the audience bit. Yay! But, promotion is\nexpensive. So is professional-grade equipment and hired help. Way too expensive\nfor my meagre personal resources. (And contrary to what some may think, what with international syndication and all, they are meagre. As the saying goes, glory don\u0027t buy groceries.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is where Nash Holos listeners come in. My dream is (and always has been) to\nsail off into the sunset after passing the torch to a crew of dedicated, paid\nprofessionals who will take the show to heights that neither I nor you could imagine. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut first things first. I would dearly love to purchase a Shure SMB7 microphone\nand a proper studio boom arm to hang it on. That is the type of microphone used by\nmany radio stations, including CHLY in Nanaimo. I love that microphone. Also, I\nneed two (one for a guest). Also, I need to upgrade the website, and set up a\nproper home studio with good sound absorption, high-speed computer, desk, etc. Then\nI would like to hire an assistant or at least outsource some tasks that I have\nbeen struggling with. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo you see how it goes. My first goal is to upgrade the website. The second is a\ntoss-up between new equipment (e.g. mics) or hiring casual help to take care of\ntasks I have been struggling with (e.g. technical and IT). Also I would love to\nhave enough income to be able to travel or send someone on location to festivals\nand other cultural events to enhance and enrich your listening experience. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePlease contribute\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery little bit helps. Even $1 a month, from enough patrons, can work magic.\nSo if you have more friends than money, please encourage them to sign up as\nwell. \ud83d\ude0a \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the coming weeks I will be tweaking the rewards levels (and possibly my goals).\nActually, I could use your help with that. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat would you like to see in terms of rewards? Swag, like mugs, tee shirts,\nmouse pads, key chains, etc.? Exclusive content (audio, print, or both)? Access to me personally\nvia Skype chats or whatever? (I can\u2019t\nimagine why, but you never know!) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor now, because it\u2019s Christmas and we all have seasonal celebrating to do, I\nam just going to carry on doing the shows and posting them on the website, as I\nhave been doing since 2001. But early in the New Year I will be back to add\nsome rewards and I hope to incorporate some of your suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you again for listening to the show, downloading the podcast, and coming\nto this Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
