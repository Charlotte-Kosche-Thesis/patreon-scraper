Whenever I\u0027m not putting said creative skills to work, I\u0027m very much your average nerdy dude, indulging my pop-culture addictions with movies, music, games, comics, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me and my works at the following sites:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://n8dogg5k.blogspot.com/\"\u003eBlog\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://n8dogg5k.deviantart.com\"\u003eDeviantart\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/n8dogg5k\"\u003ePicarto\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-577940555\"\u003eSoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/N8Dogg5k_Art\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, I just want to say \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e all for coming to this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s always been a goal of mine to one day claim that I\u0027m able to not just do my art and fiction for a living, but that I will do so in front of a captivated audience. In order to grow that goal into a viable reality, I require fans, and funding. That\u0027s where all you gorgeous, gracious folks come into the equation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to try and play it safe here by starting out this journey slow and small. While you can certainly look forward to such bits as bi-weekly art-streams, a few internet radio shows, some written/recorded reviews of media, and the occasional piece of fiction, everything I do will come as I am able to get/make the time to create it. As I continue to build things out \u003cem\u003e(with a little time, luck, and effort)\u003c/em\u003e I would like to add/accomplish more ambitious projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally \u003cem\u003e(and perhaps most importantly)\u003c/em\u003e this site is nothing more than a tip-jar for those who like what they see, read, or hear, and are willing to part with some coin. Any works I create will not be hidden behind a pay-wall, so those seeking some kind of rewards are probably going to be disappointed. That doesn\u0027t mean though that I won\u0027t be open to taking on a request from donators, as few matters are ever absolutely set in stone with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the same, I hope you enjoy all of my efforts, and I look forward to being able to entertain you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2606 Now Let\u0027s Rock \u2606\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
