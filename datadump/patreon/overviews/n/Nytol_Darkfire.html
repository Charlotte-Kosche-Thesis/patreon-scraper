I chose per update because this I choose to be my job, and as with the real world if I don\u0027t work (update) I won\u0027t get paid. I plan on updating once a week with some weeks having two updates. I will not be\u00a0 posting every little detail as it\u0027s own update, instead I will be collecting my work for the week into a single weekly update.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome, join me, and play my games.\u003cbr\u003e"
