    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello everyone. My name is Justin, better known online as \"nerdSlayer\". I started regularly uploading on Youtube just a bit over 1 year ago. Since then, we have had tremendous growth, and my\u00a0 Death of a Game series has budded into our flagship series. But we do more than just Death of a Game, we do editorials on a number of subjects, as well as just about anything concerning video games. I consider myself an investigative video game journalist, and strive day to day to tell the story, the full story of whatever subject I cover.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not in this to be popular, especially not with those in the industry. I realize my analytical and critical pieces will certainly ruffle feathers. But as long as I can hold myself to my standard of being as true as much as we can possibly be, and having the facts to back up my opinions I can rest easy. I think that is something that really sets me apart in content production, we focus on telling a story of why games fail and go into details such as financials, interviews, articles, and etc.\u003cstrong\u003e I am a video game journalist, which means I will NOT sacrifice my integrity or ethics for a paycheck\u003c/strong\u003e. Unlike most channels, we heavily focus on the nitty and gritty details. These details are what make the death of a game series so in-depth!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn order to be able to continue to do that\u003c/strong\u003e, and do it at a better capacity I need your help in funding our channel. We don\u0027t have paid content, and won\u0027t ever. If I want to make Youtube a full time career, a career that replaces my current fulltime career (construction management) I need your help to reach that goal. I have a number of goals set on our Patreon, that when reached will greatly improve the quality and quantity of our content. Youtube ad revenue is inconsistent, it\u0027s not exactly something I can live on day to day, especially not currently. Patreon is great because it has easily identifiable goals, goals you can hold me to delivering on. It also keeps me from ever having to rely on $ from publishers or developers, aka PAID CONTENT which in most if not all cases we are against.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith your help, no matter if its $1 or more, I can make this dream of being a video game journalist full time REAL.\u003c/strong\u003e The ultimate goal of the channel, is to travel to all gaming events, give speeches, do things like meetups and have interviews/hands on with particular games or companies. You can always trust that I will ask the hard questions, the questions that matter. We want a production studio, to treat our Death of a Game series (and future series) as a fully produced show. I also want to start including developer interviews, to ask them directly why they think their game failed. This production studio would also be where we film our eventual podcast, where we will have guests, call-ins, and the lot. We would also have a fully functional merchandise shop, that will only have merchandise I myself would wear and endorse.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am incredibly ambitious, and absolutely believe all of this is obtainable. I thank you for taking the time to read all of this, and thank you for enjoying my content and hope you will continue to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Justin \"nerdSlayer\".\u003c/strong\u003e"
