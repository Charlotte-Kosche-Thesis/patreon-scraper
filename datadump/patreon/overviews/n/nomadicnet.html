After I got things set up though it worked so well I had to share it with friends. \u00a0Now I am to the point of needing to upgrade hardware and incurring other additional costs to be able to support it. I want to be able to continue offering it to others but in order to do so I need a little help. \u00a0So if you are willing to throw a little my way to keep the LEDs blinking and the hard drives spinning then look to the right for the various donation levels.\u00a0 Anything and everything is greatly appreciated.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe things that have to be said.....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything you decide to give is purely a donation. \u00a0You are not paying for a service of any kind. I have been currently using this platform for about 2 years but that does not mean it couldn\u0027t go away tomorrow. \u00a0I do not provide any guarantee\u00a0any up-time and do not provide any support. All money will go to covering monthly costs, upkeep, and upgrades. \u00a0As a thanks for this support I offer some additional features that my hobby provides for your entertainment based off the donation level you choose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again!\u003c/div\u003e"
