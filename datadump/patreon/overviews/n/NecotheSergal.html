I\u0027m Neco the Sergal, I make Horror Let\u0027s Plays and other silly videos on Youtube during my free time. Thank you for visiting my page here! This is a work in construction as I try to grow accustomed to the idea of even having a Patreon page as, admittedly, of my 3+ years on Youtube? I originally was against the idea of Patreon - I stated numerous times that I didn\u0027t want to take any money or accept any gifts from people as if that\u0027s what I\u0027m making videos for, the only reason I wanted to make videos was because I want to entertain people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSkip to now and I feel as though many have convinced me to create one, there are various reasons why there was a change of heart. A big part of it is not being financially steady. Another would be the many kind Fluffscribers that I have that essentially requested that I at least let them contribute back to me in some way for all my effort. I caved in to that request (And it took 3 years of being bugged!) but with the understanding that whatever I possibly earn from Patreon will only go towards Youtube-related things - any and all contributions will go towards that goal, and the growth of my channel and nothing more. As I edit this page I will likely create a video showing my plans, showing a graph of where I\u0027d be spending any contributions, my dreams and plans will be revealed where I show you all what I dream of creating as I advance my position and place in Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time, stay warm and fluffy!"
