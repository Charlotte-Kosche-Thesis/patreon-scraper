I intend to do this\nby opening a teaching art studio in London, Ontario which will make art\naccessible to the public in ways a traditional gallery cannot.  My teaching would be inclusive of people living with mentally and physically disabilities, as well as anyone who has never painted a\npicture before \u2013 because I believe that art is inherently therapeutic.  My dream is to open a storefront gallery and\nteaching space, and so I\u2019m asking for your help.  Every bit helps.  All proceeds from Patreon will be going\ntowards opening a wheelchair accessible storefront location downtown.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a lifelong artist, painting in acrylics, and I have always shared what I know. I perform, demonstrating my painting \u0027live\u0027 at events like fundraisers, weddings and corporate events. I love sharing the mysterious creative process with both art fans and new viewers alike. I enjoy finding out a student\u0027s artistic goals and adapting their lessons to get them there. Creating, sharing, teaching, learning: I love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI paint in support of local charities like the \u003cem\u003eLondon Childrens\u0027 Museum, \u003c/em\u003e and teach acrylic painting to artists with disabilities at\u00a0\u003cem\u003ePossibilities in Paint \u003c/em\u003eand\u003cem\u003e Participation House. \u003c/em\u003eIt was through working with these charities that I realized the great need for more inclusive art instruction in London. And how much I love teaching and sharing my passion for art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will help me as I establish a wheelchair accessible teaching studio and art gallery, so I can share my passion for painting with people in downtown London. All of my Patreon contributions go towards opening and running an art space where I will be able to paint, teach and sell art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wholeheartedly thank you for your support in helping me achieve this dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "\u003ch2\u003eSymbolic Expressionism  \u0026amp;  Abstract Landscapes\u003c/h2\u003eI like to leave a lot up to what the materials do naturally; when paint scumbles over a broken surface, how unmixed colours blend in the eye, or the way different viscosities of paint flow and scrape over gesso.  I enjoy it when it\u2019s apparent to the viewer what I\u0027ve done - when the viewer can see my process in the paint. I am exploring the language of Landscape in an \u0027\u003cem\u003ea la prima\u003c/em\u003e\u0027 style to create abstract expressionist paintings that feel like places. I work quickly to preserve the spontaneity of the strokes. I don\u0027t usually use photo references and when I do I don\u0027t look often. The paintings are often unplanned. I strive to paint, not my own vision, but the best painting possible out of what is already on the canvas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always painted, drawn and created. However, it was playing in David Bolduc\u0027s studio with his son, Chris, which inspired me to become an artist; to be a painter. After highschool, I attended The Art Centre in downtown Toronto, just blocks from where I grew up in the Annex. After Ten years of full-time work as a graphic designer in Toronto\u0027s fashion industry, I looked for a change. I now live with my partner Jen in Wortley Village in London, Ontario, where I paint, perform and teach. I am very glad that I moved to London ... but I also love visiting Toronto whenever I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to establish a wheelchair accessible, storefront teaching studio and art gallery in downtown London. I hope you will help me achieve my vision; sharing my passion for art with everyone. Bringing the art of painting to the masses with no one left out.\u003cbr\u003e",
