Each report shows how each team is doing overall and with specific players on the ice. It also shows the impact each player is having on their team depending on which teammates they are on the ice with, and which opposing players they are playing against.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery game also gets a preview that compares how the two teams playing have performed so far that season, in the last 25 games and in the last 10 games. These previews provide all of the graphs, charts and breakdowns for each team\u0027s roster in one convenient place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe season tables offer data for an entire season for teams and players, with filters to customize what part of the season is displayed. Team stats can be filtered by home or away, different game situations (ie: 5 on 5 or power play), if the team is leading or trailing, and to only include results from the last few games, or within a date range. Player stats can also be filtered by player position, and by minimum time played.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach player also gets a detailed report showing both individual and on-ice results since the 2009-2010 NHL season. Breakdowns of each player\u0027s performance with or without specific teammates and against specific opponents are available for each season. A game-by-game log and a detailed breakdown of what teammates they scored points with are also provided.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges will help cover the cost of both resources and time that keep Natural Stat Trick running. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
