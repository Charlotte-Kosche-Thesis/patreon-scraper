    "summary": "Hi Patrons! I am a Native American musician. I take inspiration from everywhere (nothing is exempt) and I produce everything myself. Thank you for coming to my page to support my music. I look forward to bringing you lots of content and for an awesome adventure into music and life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born here in the United States in the Choctaw Nation Indian Reservation in Oklahoma. I went to a public school like most children in this region but afterwards I looked into going to college. After some time of studying at home and learning all I could about what I wanted to do, I decided to take another path, into music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic has always been a huge part of native culture and I wanted to make my artistry be an extension of that. I love all music wherever it comes from because it\u0027s an expression of who we are as human beings. On top of being a musician I\u0027ve invested some time into film making as well. Putting these two skills together to make something new is my main goal. We have so many stories to tell but there has a been a lack of new ways to tell that story until now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s what my mission is for my music. Bring people together no matter where they come from and find culture and humanity wherever it makes it homes. My name is Marvin Noah, a Native American and citizen of planet Earth. Thanks for joining me on this journey."

Although record sales and notoriety are important aspects of the business, I plan to make music based on my own background and to give non-native Americans a good perspective into Native life in the US.",
