Casting has taken a backseat with the end of WCS premier league this year, and so I\u0027ve had a lot more time to put towards making content. Patreon serves as a way for the StarCraft community to support my VoD content that frankly hasn\u0027t gotten the attention it deserves since it\u0027s hard to justify putting as much time towards. Supporting me through this page is supporting my production of Tutorials, Community Feedback response videos, cold cast SC2 matches, and other content that is NOT ported directly over from my Twitch channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to see more prepared content that isn\u0027t cluttered with Twitchalerts or overlays, and more educational content, then this is the place to throw your silver dollars at me. Much love \u0026lt;3"
