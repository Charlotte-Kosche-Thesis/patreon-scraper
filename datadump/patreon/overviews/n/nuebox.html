    "summary": "[nueBOX] is a residency program for emerging performance and media installation artists.  We push the artist outside of the BOX, and bring the community inside.  The program provides a selected group of talented artists with a place to rehearse, develop media installations, discuss works-in-progress, and showcase new work. In our first year we have supported 12 resident artists, and provided a performance venue for over 30 artists. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike traditional visual arts galleries or performance venues that provide space to showcase a final product, we focus on the process, and aim to provide opportunities for idea development and iteration.  The program exposes the making of art by emphasizing discussion and observation of the creative process in a way that involves, educates, and informs both the artist and the community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are several things that [nueBOX] provides local emerging artists that other arts organizations do not offer in Phoenix.  The most important of provisions include an inexpensive, clean, and safe space for exhibition, workshop, rehearsal, and performance.  Further, we provide artists with opportunities to receive valuable feedback through-out the creation of a new work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[nueBOX] is seeking funding in order to grow as an organization. \u00a0With your support, [nueBOX] plans to increase the amount of artists it serves, create programs to support artists after they complete their residency at [nueBOX], help make the making of art more affordable for artists, and bring in artists from outside of Phoenix to work with locals. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration of [nueBOX] and your contribution to building a stronger artist community in Phoenix.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours Truly,\u003cbr\u003eJulie Akerly and Matthew Mosher\u003cbr\u003e(Co-Founders of [nueBOX])\u003cbr\u003eFor more information, visit our website (\u003ca href=\"http://www.nuebox.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.nuebox.org\u003c/a\u003e) or e-mail us (\u003cu\u003einfo.at.nuebox.org\u003c/u\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
