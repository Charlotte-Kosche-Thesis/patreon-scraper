    "summary": "Nelson and Dynan are two visual artists with a mission: painting the animals in their Accidental Animal Rescue Center. Ana Nelson and Phil Dynan have been painting together for over 20 years in a remote area of Northern California. About 18 years ago people suddenly started leaving animals at the site of their country art studio. First it was cats, then dogs, then a llama, a donkey, goats, chickens and sheep. The two artists were baffled at first - just paying the vet and food bills became a burden as the number of animals being left increased. After the second year they started painting portraits of their \"guest animals\" - and VOILA!- the portraits became popular on notecards, paintings and even murals in a nearby town. Now, with around 50 animals, they are still painting portraits and also commissions for local pet owners and ranchers. The two artists have a busy day - every day - feeding and caring for the animals - and painting. Even though the economy seems slightly better and fewer\"drop-offs\" are occurring, new animals arrive regularly. Ana and Phil are hoping that Patreon will serve at least two purposes - (1) generate income for feeding and caring of the animals; and (2) reward their patrons with art in the form of cards and prints or even commissioned paintings."
