If you contribute money to Patreon, these are the things that will directly improve the quality of my videos:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Between recording content and working on my dissertation, I do not have the time or skill to edit videos as professionally as I would like, so I would like to hire an editor who can edit my videos. \u00a0This will improve the quality of my videos greatly. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e2. \u00a0I would like to hire a graphic designer to make new channel art and logo.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been going with the same one for almost three years now.\u003cbr\u003e3. \u00a0I would like to take steps to better soundproof my office/recording studio, further improving the sound in my videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI want to stress that I love creating content for you guys, and I will continue to\ndo so regardless of donations.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e  However,\nwith donations I feel the content on my channel would improve greatly!  Once various thresholds on donations are\nreached, I will be able to make specific improvements to my channel so you will\nsee your money put back into it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOn top of helping me, you also get some sweet perks as\npatron of my channel!  No matter what\namount you donate, you gain access to my Patreon stream, where you can have a\ndirect hand in shaping the content I produce through regular polls. \u00a0 There are also various other rewards for being a patron that you can see here!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
