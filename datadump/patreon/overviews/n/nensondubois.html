My main focus is finding unused music, hidden levels, gameplay modes, and debugging functions including menus previously unhinged, left intact inside the game\u0027s code only intended to have been accessed by the designers during the development stages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Additional activities include playing guitar, composing songs using trackers and MML variants (though I haven;t actually composed a new song in years), I also write code in a wide range of computer programming languages, translating videogames and soundtracks from Japanese to English. Here is a more concise rundown of my efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI admittedly also rant about horrible things that happen for no reason, but not on this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLet\u0027s Play videos showing off impressive and unusual game features play a small role in my creative treasures!
