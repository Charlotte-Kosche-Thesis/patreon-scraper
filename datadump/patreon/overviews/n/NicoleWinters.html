The Canadian Children\u0027s Book Centre\u0027s spring 2014 magazine edition named TT FULL THROTTLE in their annual issue of Best Books for Kids \u0026amp; Teens and I would love to write more thrilling action-adventure books that take place at actual race tracks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut why? And why support me in my goal? Well, as a kid,\u00a0I was a reluctant reader. (I had dyslexia which went undiagnosed until years after graduating high school.) So how did I end up becoming an author? When I was twelve I was assigned S.E. Hinton\u0027s The Outsiders. I had read it in one day \u2013 an incredible feat for someone who wasn\u0027t into books. I asked myself where had the time gone? Why did these characters resonate with\nme for days after? Although I didn\u2019t know how to articulate it then, what I had\nunderstood was that the right kind of story could ensnare the\nimagination, reluctant reader or not.\u00a0That experience sent me on a mission\nto seek out more stories that could provide the same intense thrill (horror,\nnonfiction, autobiographies, etc.).\u00a0I\u0027m thrilled to have found my way through the reluctant reader maze and ended up falling in love with literature. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I can reach\u00a0one child who thinks reading is a waste of time and inspire them to search out more books it would mean the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e"
