Making videos takes a lot of time and money that is sometimes hard to come by. That\u0027s where you amazing people can use Patreon. You pick a support tier (you can see them below) and decide how much you\u0027d like to donate in return for special rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do your donations go?\u003c/strong\u003e Your patron donation will come directly to me and will go right back into the making of my music. Your support will help me compensate friends who have helped with recording and filming along the way, upgrade my gear to make better videos for you, and hopefully travel more so I can perform live in a city or a town near you! The plan right now is to make a video about every two weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the music\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jamie and I write music under the name \"Jamie O\". I began recording music a few years ago with my friend Robert English in a band called \"Nowhere Again.\" Since then I have hitchhiked across the U.S. and Europe, playing music in many ways, shapes, and forms along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to write songs that tap into the root of being human, whether it be about life, death, love, etc., and remind myself and my listeners that life is a very short, precious thing, so make sure you pursue what you love doing whenever possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have found that what I love is writing and performing music, and being able to share that music with other people I meet. With your help I can continue to do just that and share my songs with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf my music and message resonate with you, and you are willing and able to become a patron, I would really appreciate your support so I can make more content in the future and keep you in the loop!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for taking the time to read through and listen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love and take care,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJamie\u003cbr\u003e"
