    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eOK, so this is a bit awkward for us, because we\u0027ve never asked y\u0027all to support us financially. But, seriously, the expenses are piling up and stressing us out. We\u0027re asking you to support us financially.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eYou probably know @NashSevereWx and NashSevereWx.com is run by three locals who live/work in Nashville/Davidson Co and Williamson Co. We\u0027re all married, we have full time jobs (no, this isn\u0027t our job!), and, yes, we all have kids (Will has the most). It\u0027s been our pleasure to cover the weather where we live, swim, eat hot chicken, work, go to concerts, study, play soccer, worship, sit in traffic....you know, Nashville things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOver the past 8 months, this operation has been getting very expensive\u003c/strong\u003e. Several years ago, we didn\u0027t really know the $1,500 we spent on weather software were \"start up costs.\" We are weather nerds. We would have bought that stuff anyway. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs we\u0027ve grown, so have our annual expenses.\u003c/strong\u003e We totaled it up. Just the weather stuff has cost over $1,600 a year for several years running. That does not include computers, internet, and hardware. Most of that money is spent on weather data and website fees, hosting, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThen we had the web crisis. \u003c/strong\u003eWe are not web guys. Our site went down a few times in 2016, and we didn\u0027t know how to fix it, but we muscled through it. The real web crisis came in early February, and we have resolved \"never again.\" The problem: a basic web host cannot handle all our traffic. To fix the problem, we hired a web professional to upgrade our host to handle all our traffic and otherwise make the page better. \u003cem\u003eThis going to be expensive\u003c/em\u003e, likely doubling our current annual expenses, and it\u0027s stretching our ability to pay for it ourselves. We\u0027ve recently committed to pay $87 per month just to host the site, to make sure it doesn\u0027t crash when we need it to work the most. This does not include the guy we hired to make sure it\u0027s done right and done well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027ve put off upgrading and trying new things because it\u0027s been too expensive.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0We believe in what we are doing. There\u0027s more we can do, but we\u0027ve hesitated to do it because, well, cool stuff costs money. Beyond the leap of faith we\u0027ve made with the website, we\u0027d like to put up a better radar for the website, which will run $50/month; it\u0027ll serve y\u0027all better than what we\u0027re paying for now. Professional quality software to produce screenshare and other videos would enhance our coverage during severe weather events. We would like to support our partners in neighboring counties by getting them the same software we use. We\u0027d love to install and support local web cams across both counties so we could see the hail, or God forbid, a tornado -- social science says people respond to photos videos better than radar data. I\u0027d love to purchase a road sensor for the winter rather than extrapolate from the closest one in Franklin, Kentucky. When our computers go down, we\u0027d like to buy new ones, without having to sit down and figure out how to make it work in the family budget. \u003cem\u003eBut mostly, we need to pay for the web upgrade without having to sit down and find room for it in three family budgets\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re growing like crazy.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eFrom January 2015 to August 2016, NashSevereWx.com saw 332,000 users with 2.4 million page views. During that time, @NashSevereWx had 140 million impressions. In December 2016, we passed 100,000 followers; we average between 4,000 and 5,000 new Twitter followers every month. Over the past 6 months, we\u0027ve averaged 244,000 profile views of our Twitter account; we think these are people \"following\" the Twitter feed at \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/NashSevereWx\"\u003ewww.twitter.com/NashSevereWx\u003c/a\u003e without actually signing up for Twitter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most frequent question we get from family and friends has \"are you making money off this?\" The answer is \"no,\" for years we\u0027ve been (and we are not complaining about this!) running it at a loss. Some of you know we\u0027ve had a Donate button hidden on our website, which some of you found -- you know who you are and y\u0027all are awesome -- but we never promoted it. We\u0027ve funded this mostly with our money and 100% with our time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past year, our needs have increased, our costs have risen, and our ideas for improvement delayed by a lack of funds. We\u0027ve looked at other options. Google AdSense is distracting and uncool. Advertisers approached us, but we have not wanted to answer to a boss (advertisers are bosses, y\u0027all) for when we tweet or post a hilarious gif or a sad reference to Prince\u0027s passing (purple rain) or when I decide to tweet in haiku just because I know my English teacher is watching. Media outlets have very graciously approached us, but that has not seemed to be the right move or the right time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, yeah, we are asking for your financial support. \u003c/strong\u003eBecause our costs recur, we need your support to recur.\u00a0If you\u0027re not in a place to support us, that\u0027s cool. We get it. We just want to serve the community the best way we know how. We aren\u0027t asking for financial help so we can quit our jobs to run @NashSevereWx and NashSevereWx.com. We aren\u0027t buying leather sofas and beer with it, either. We want to get better. We want this to work when y\u0027all need it to work. We have the right people in place. We would like for it to not kill us financially. If you like what we\u0027ve been up to and you\u0027d like to be part of making it better, please help us out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, y\u0027all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
