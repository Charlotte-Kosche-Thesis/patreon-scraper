You might know me \nfrom one of the websites I contribute to: \n\u003ca href=\"http://yainterrobang.com\"\u003eYA Interrobang\u003c/a\u003e, a YA news \nwebsite I founded several years ago; \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/teen/author/nicolebrinkley/\"\u003ethe Barnes \u0026amp; Noble Teen blog\u003c/a\u003e, where I make lists\n for days; and soon, \n\u003ca href=\"http://lgbtqreads.com/\"\u003eLGBTQ Reads\u003c/a\u003e, where I\u0027ll be hosting a column talking\n to queer sci-fi and fantasy authors.

Welcome to my Patreon!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon is a monthly subscription service that allows you to support creators that you love. Money pledged will be automatically charged to you on the first of each month. This allows creators to focus on making things you love and allowing you to become their patron and support system. Creators couldn\u0027t do it without you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\n support me? \u003c/strong\u003eBecoming one of my Patrons will ensure that I can\n spend more time doing what I love: talking about books. Booksellers \nnotoriously don\u0027t make a lot of money, and I\u0027d like to continue to \neducate authors and other booksellers, readers and bloggers on how \npublishing works and how to best make use of your digital space to \npromote the books you love\u2014while,\n of course, shamelessly recommending the books I love. I don\u0027t think \ninformation and education about publishing should be restricted to those\n who can afford to attend publishing programs in New York City or who \ncan worm their way into the right crowd, and this will allow me to \ncontinue to share knowledge without draining my own resources to do so. \n(\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/nebrinkley/status/963380003328192512\"\u003eLike how Barnes \u0026amp; Noble is important to the publishing industry.\u003c/a\u003e) \nEverybody wins!\n\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eBut\n what will you do with the money? \n\t\t\u003c/strong\u003eAlmost everything I make \nhere on Patreon will go towards paying my bills and buying groceries\u2014ensuring\n that I have the energy and time to continue to share my knowledge for \nfree on the Internet. Covering the overhead of Internet, web hosting, \nand things I need to buy to keep everything functional will take an \nimmense weight off my shoulders. (And I thank you for that in advance!) \nEventually, it will allow me to freelance less and invest more time in \nprojects, including my own writing and official classes to help authors \nor bloggers. I\u0027ll also be able to support other people on Patreon I \nreally admire. It\u0027s a never-ending chain of support!\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\n perks do Patrons have?\n\t\t\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m trying a grand experiment where \nPatrons who enjoy what I do around the Internet can continue to support \nwhat I do without any additional content\u2014we\u0027ll see if you like it!\n Patrons will get an additional short essay every month that isn\u0027t \nelsewhere, likely about how publishing works or could be improved in \nsome capacity. Patrons will also get the first shot to ask me to talk \nabout or research a topic they\u0027re interested in to write and learn \nabout.
