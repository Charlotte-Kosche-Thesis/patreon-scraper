However, at the same time, you\u0027re not locked into paying any more than you might wish to. I did consider some of these other options, but I don\u0027t want the amount of time and effort I put into this dictated by the amount of money I receive. Rather, I want to develop something awesome that hopefully people will like regardless, without features being \u0027hidden\u0027 or \u0027reserved\u0027 behind a pay level or pay wall. You get to decide if you want to be my patron, month to month, and even if you don\u0027t want to everything that gets built here will eventually be publicly available. What your money is saying is that you not only approve of what I\u0027m doing, but like it enough that you\u0027re willing to support it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWHAT IS THE GAME?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNenimma (subtitle pending) is an open-world, still-image and text, adult survival game. You are the survivor of a spaceship crash, trapped in a strange world shaped by mysterious forces that seem to obey uncanny rules and patterns. Forces you\u0027ll need to comprehend to stand a hope of getting home: assuming you aren\u0027t captured by one of the natives first!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDevelopment began in December 2014, with initial concept and world-building that serves as the backbone to guide the game\u0027s direction. It will be built using an external engine platform, both to speed development, allow for plugins, and provide additional options. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce complete, the game will be published as a desktop stand alone for both Windows and Linux. A Mac port is a possibility, but would take further investigation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWHAT MAKES NENIMMA DIFFERENT?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA lot of things! Especially if we get enough funds. But let\u0027s ignore that for the moment and focus on the core issues.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNenimma (born from the name of a Goddess of Fertility) was designed to be a survival game with an adult focus, where the player will need to balance issues such as their own health and well-being, hunger, and \u0027base\u0027 urges against the resources you need with survival, your goal of trying to find your downed ship, and your attractiveness to the native inhabitants.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe game is being designed to focus initially on much more submissive content, with the submission being on the end of the player. It\u0027s also designed to do so in such a way that the player can still retain their own agency, and so shouldn\u0027t be forced into content that they find unenjoyable in any fashion. Content for more dominant personalities is something that we\u0027d like to add to the game, but is not being given priority and will be added secondarily.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe game will feature a wide range of sexual content, some of which may appeal more or less to different players. We\u0027re working on a way of making certain kinks toggle-able, and will have more kinks then. For now, the game will/is likely to contain the following as major themes:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCorruption/Submission\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDom/sub Tendencies, to various degrees\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExotic sexual partners (nothing so plain as a elf or human here)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFemale/Female \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHerm/Female \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImpregnation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOral Sex\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlayer Capture/Abduction\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVaginal Sex\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso in the works and planned, but (for now) to a lesser degree of focus: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnal Sex \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBestiality\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExtensive Underwater Content\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGiantess\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHerm/Herm\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMale/Female\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMale/Herm\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTransformation of both body measurements, and form.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(Male/Male content is also a possibility, although not currently planned)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile one might find other things besides, there are a limited number of things a person will never find within Nenimma. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn Nenimma, one will never find the following in any sexual content:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGore\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eScat\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0027Water\u0027play\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWHY DONATE?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile the game will be made regardless, your support will both help it progress and improve the quality of the final product.
