    "summary": "The original film concept that brought me to the world of online scicomm and skeptical activism: \u003cem\u003e\"Science Moms\" is a film that will give a voice to the science-minded moms - the women who are too often drowned out by the fear mongers, the shamers, and the CelebMoms. Through interviews with \"science moms\" who are on the front lines of this struggle, and using fun, informative graphics, we\u2019ll dissect the bogus claims of these celebrities one by one and explain in simple language what the science really shows about GMOs, vaccines, homeopathy, and any of these topics that are often in the headlines, yet even more often are misunderstood. And we\u2019ll talk to a behavioral psychologist who will illuminate the science behind why people believe weird things. We can\u2019t change everyone\u2019s minds, but we can make our voices heard. One mom at a time.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a couple years of work, Science Moms has been released into the wild (well, skeptic conferences and places like that, plus the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sciencemomsdoc.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einternet\u003c/a\u003e), and I want to be able to get as many eyes on this film as possible. So here I am on Patreon, trying to help fund my little dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd because making a science-based parenting documentary wasn\u0027t enough... While working on the film, I also ventured into the wonderful world of podcasting, and have been producing and co-hosting\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blogtalkradio.com/scienceenthusiastpodcast\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Science Enthusiast Podcast\u003c/a\u003e with my BFF Dan Broadbent for over a year. I\u0027ve come to cherish the conversations had and connections made as a result of this show, and will begin doing a spinoff podcast project under the tSE umbrella. (Because I need another excuse to have interesting conversations about things that might not pertain to the regular content of our show.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this is a longwinded way to say, \"I love creating content and spreading good ideas, and would love a little monetary support for the time it takes to do these things.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove y\u0027all,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNatalie"
