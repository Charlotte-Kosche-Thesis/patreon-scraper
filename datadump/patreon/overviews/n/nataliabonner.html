     "about": "Natalia Whiting Bonner has enjoyed piecing quilt tops for more than twenty years. She learned how to quilt on her conventional home machine. She felt good about it, but decided that if she really wanted to take her quilting to the next level, she needed to invest in a longarm machine. In 2007, when she was pregnant with her daughter, she got the crazy idea to quit her job as a dental assistant and become a longarm quilter. Without really knowing what a longarm machine was, she spent a day at a longarm dealer\u2019s shop and walked out after purchasing a Gammill machine. Natalia\u2019s passion for quilting and being creative has grown each day since.\u003cbr\u003eWhether it\u2019s working on an intense show quilt or a simple baby quilt, Natalia has become a real quilting addict. She teaches at quilt guilds and shows, including Road to California and QuiltCon East, and has filmed TV shows with Nancy Zieman and Jodie Davis. She has won numerous awards for her work and has been featured on Moda Bake Shop, in \u003cem\u003eQuiltmaker Magazine\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eAmerican Patchwork \u0026amp; Quilting Magazine,\u003c/em\u003e and in books such as \u003cem\u003eFresh Fabric Treats\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eModern Blocks\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eSweet Celebrations with the Moda Bake Shop Chefs, Modern Quilts From the Blogging Universe. \u003c/em\u003eNatalia is the author of\u003cem\u003e Beginner\u0027s Guide to Free-Motion \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eQuilting,\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e Next Steps in Machine Quilting \u003c/em\u003eand\u003cem\u003e Visual Guide to Free-Motion Quilting Feathers\u003c/em\u003e co-author of\u003cem\u003e Modern One-Block Quilts \u0026amp; Cabin Fever:20 Modern Log Cabin Quilts.Natalia is a Gammill Quilt Artist and Craftsy Instructor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e",
