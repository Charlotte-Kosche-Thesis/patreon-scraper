By day I am an enterprise software engineer - by night I\u0027m a tinkerer, artist, and musician.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been interested in video games, and especially creating them from a young age. I cut my teeth on fan-games as a young developer, and I\u0027ve made\u00a0endless tech demos, released a few mobile arcade titles, and participated in a few very fun game jams. But what I\u0027ve always dreamed of and never done is to pull off a full-length, story-driven adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is what we\u0027re building here, with\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSong of Asirra. \u003c/strong\u003eIt will be a side-scrolling action adventure game. I hope that it will stand on its own as a unique piece of work, but for an idea of my inspirations think Metroid and The Legend of Zelda. I was particularly inspired by the ambitious design departure of\u00a0\u003cem\u003eZelda II: Adventure of Link, \u003c/em\u003eand think that if modern game-design principals were applied to it that it could be an all-time great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I created this Patreon,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSong of Asirra \u003c/strong\u003ehad about half a year of development done, at a slow \"free time\" pace. Since earning the support of my incredible Patrons, I have increased my output significantly and made amazing progress. By supporting this Patreon, you and your friends and your extended family can help me build an engaged community around the game\u0027s development. Your support will keep me engaged and excited, and your dollars will keep me accountable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am dedicated to developing, completing, and shipping \u003cstrong\u003eSong of Asirra. \u003c/strong\u003eJoin this community and come along for the adventure!"
