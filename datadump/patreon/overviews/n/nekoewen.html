    "summary": "My name is Ewen Cluney. (\u201cEwen\u201d is pronounced like \u201cAaron.\u201d)\nIn the world of tabletop gaming I\u2019m best known as the translator of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.maidrpg.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMaid: The Role-Playing Game\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://starlinepublishing.com/our-games/golden-sky-stories/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGolden Sky Stories\u003c/a\u003e, and I think some\npeople may know me as the designer of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://asmadigames.com/detail_channela.php\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eChannel A\u003c/a\u003e, the anime pitch party game. I\u2019ve hit a turning point in my creative\npursuits. I\u2019m getting things published, and a few people are even coming to me,\nasking me to create things for them. In the past I\u2019ve started a lot of\npromising projects and ultimately left them unfinished, and I want to be better\nabout realizing my creative ambitions. I want Patreon to be a tool to help me\ndo that, and if you choose to support me I want you to keep me honest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI enjoy all different sorts of stories and games, but my own\nworks tend to have a certain bright, shiny aesthetic that I think makes my\nworks stand out a bit in the world of tabletop games. I do sometimes make\nthings with darker themes, but even then I tend towards a clean look. I\u2019m a\nprofessional translator, and anime and other Japanese media have had a huge\ninfluence on me. Not \u003cem\u003eeverything\u003c/em\u003e I do\nis anime-inspired, but it informs more of my works than not. Aside from simply\nbeing something I like, anime is underrepresented in tabletop games, so that I\nfind it very easy to come up with anime-inspired concepts that no one\u2019s yet\nexplored. Where there are many excellent games drawing on, say, the works of\nH.P. Lovecraft or J.R.R. Tolkien, anime and other Japanese media basically\nrepresent a wide-open undiscovered country for game designers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Kinds of Games?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn terms of the kinds of games I make, my core emphasis is\nof course tabletop role-playing games, but I also dabble in card games and\ninteractive fiction. For RPGs my design influences are far-ranging, and my\ngames can be mechanistic or freeform or anything in between depending on what\ngrabs me and what works for the subject matter I want to pursue. My card games\nhave so far been skewed towards party games, and I\u2019m still in the process of\nfeeling my way towards designing other kinds of board/card games. Interactive\nfiction is something I\u2019m just getting into, and I want to explore the form\nthrough Twine and a few other avenues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m on a kick of designing small, mostly anime-inspired RPGs. My first game released through Patreon was\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/149660/Fullmetal-President-White-House-Mecha-Chaos\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFullmetal President\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0and I\u0027m currently working on about half a dozen others. Watch\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://yarukizerogames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e and the Activity section of this page to see what\u0027s coming up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Often?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to put out a new game every 1-2 months. Real-life circumstances may result in me doing less than that, but I\u0027m not planning to do more than 1 per month at most. If spending too much on patronage is a concern, remember that Patreon does let you put caps on your contributions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Am I Paying For?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWriting RPG material is \u201cfree\u201d in the sense that I don\u2019t\nhave to pay for stuff like art supplies or computer hardware, but there are a\nfew specific things the money would go towards. It varies quite a bit from one\nproject to the next, but I do actually spend a fair amount of money on research\nat times. \u003cem\u003eRaspberry Heaven\u003c/em\u003e was\nresponsible for me having a pretty ridiculous collection of 4-panel manga for\nexample, and for \u003cem\u003eFaerie Skies\u003c/em\u003e I ended\nup re-watching \u003cem\u003eLabyrinth\u003c/em\u003e for the\nfirst time in ages and buying half a dozen books on fairies. It\u2019ll also let me\ncommission artwork and layout, rather than just doing the best I can with stock\nart and MS Word. Moreover, it\u2019ll help me make ends meet.\u003cbr\u003e"
