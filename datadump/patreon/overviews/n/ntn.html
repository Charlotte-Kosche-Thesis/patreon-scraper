    "summary": "In 2009 the DawgHouse was born to address a huge hole in local radio: no one was serving the large and growing population of motorcycling enthusiasts. The weekly show was successful beyond our imagination. But after a format flip a narrow-minded programming director at the FM radio station we were on felt that motorcycling and motorcycle racing wasn\u0027t a sport and we were relegated to an AM station. Suddenly our fans could no longer hear the show, so we told the AM station to stuff it and went to the Internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFive years and hundreds of thousands of listeners later\u00a0 from around the world prove leaving traditional radio was the right move. The only problem is that success hasn\u0027t lead to financial gain. In fact it\u0027s costing us hundreds of dollars a month. We want to expand our offerings and do as much as we can for our loyal followers, but for that we need to defray some of the cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll continue to do the show no matter what...and it\u0027ll always be free, but your help could be the difference between growing our content, serving more listeners and adding video content or having to eat our young. Do you want that on your head?\u003cbr\u003e"
