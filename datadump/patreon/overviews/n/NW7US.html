My FCC-assigned call sign is \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eNW7US\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e - - hence the use of my call sign in the channel\u0027s title.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I am on the high frequencies (or, \u003cem\u003eHF\u003c/em\u003e, another way of reference to the shortwave radio spectrum, which is from 3 MHz to 30 MHz), I often transmit and receive digital radio modes such as JT65A, JT9, and Olivia.\u00a0 These are digital communications modes that enable radio hobbyists to transmit using very low power on shortwave radio (an operation known as \u003cem\u003eQRP\u003c/em\u003e, or \u003cem\u003eLow-Power Radio Telecommunications\u003c/em\u003e). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also enjoy communicating on the radio using\u00a0International Morse Code, modulating a radio transmitter \u003cem\u003econtinuous wave\u003c/em\u003e with my antique straight key that turns on and off the radio in the long and short key-downs that make up the Morse code language.\u00a0 This mode of Morse-code signaling is known as \u003cem\u003eCW\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes, I use voice communications on the HF amateur radio allocations, and on some VHF and UHF allocations. The acronym VHF stands for Very High Frequency, while UHF stands for Ultra-high Frequency.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my life, I have been involved in computer sciences and telecommunications. Software engineering, hardware and networking, and systems engineering have all been part of my job at one time or another. I\u0027ve been a radio DJ, an emergency communications director, dispatcher, US Army communications Signal Corps member, and have filled a variety of other capacities in communications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI first discovered shortwave radio communications during the early years of the 1970s.  Within the first year of exploring the unique signals on the high frequencies, I discovered the WWV time station out of Boulder, Colorado.\u00a0 That station transmitted the time, every second of every hour of every day.\u00a0 One feature of WWV is an hourly solar and terrestrial bulletin. Hearing those bulletins that reported how many sunspots were visible on the Sun, and other information, triggered my life-long passion for space weather and radio propagation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI became a Signal Corps soldier in 1985.\u00a0 During my US Army service I received several Army Achievement Medals for exceptional performance in my unit\u0027s communications mission. Part of my effort was \u003cbr\u003eestablishing a standard operating procedure (SOP) manual.\u00a0 Using this, I helped train fellow soldiers on proper and effective communications process and skill. I also actively participated with the engineering of successful trans-European communications circuits during my tour of duty in Germany.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter my service in the US Army, I was ready to get an amateur radio license.  My Novice ticket arrived early in 1990, so I began daily sessions filled with Morse code conversations on shortwave (a two-way radio communications session is also known as a \u003cem\u003eQSO\u003c/em\u003e) that resulted in my first DX contact. The term \u003cem\u003eDX\u003c/em\u003e typically refers to a QSO between people located in different countries. Since then, I\u0027ve progressed to the Amateur Extra ham radio license (having taken the Morse-code element of my test session, years ago).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been involved in AM and FM radio broadcasting, emergency communications, professionally as a 911 dispatcher, and as a volunteer in various capacities including being the Washington State Army MARS Director. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI authored and administer the first, longest-running space weather and radio propagation website, and one of the most popular Facebook space weather and radio propagation page\u00a0(See the Space Weather and Radio Propagation Facebook Page).\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also professionally involved in software programming, computer systems engineering, and related activities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, I became a recipient of the YASME Excellence Award for my \"sustained education of the amateur community regarding propagation, solar and geomagnetic physics.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2001, I monthly write about radio propagation and space weather in various magazines (such as CQ Amateur Radio Magazine and The Spectrum Monitor). I have been published as a contributor to an ARRL publication on QRP communication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year, I started as a contributing editor in the RadioUser (UK) Magazine.\u00a0 I write a monthly column in which I explore space weather, geophysical science, and radio propagation. The column covers news and science in a balanced approach without getting academic. The column enables readers to gain a working knowledge in a way that encourages effective radio communications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy long background in space weather exploration and radio communications provides a foundation on which I create each edition of the column. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAGAIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR FINANCIAL SUPPORT!\u00a0 IT IS APPRECIATED.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e73 (best regards),\u003cbr\u003eTomas Hood, NW7US\u003cbr\u003e"
