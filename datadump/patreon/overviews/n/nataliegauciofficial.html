    "summary": "Hi Fellow Supporters and Fans,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Natalie Gauci. I am a singer-songwriter and performer. I won Australian Idol in 2007. For me now, it\u0027s about reaching people, getting in touch with my old fans and reconnecting with them. It\u0027s about reaching new fans as well and as many people as possible with my music. I have been making music for over 10 years and I have always dreamed of taking my music to the next level! I have been on quite a journey and it\u0027s now time to make a change. When I say, change, I mean, expanding my vision. I wrote a song called Free Falling, and sang it at The Australian Idol Audition, which is kinda strange considering it\u0027s a show where you sing covers!! For weeks, I was hoping that there would be an originals night on the show, just so I could sing my song live on National TV! But..no.. they cancelled it. I ended up winning the 5th series, which was one of the best achievements of my life, and then went on to do a national tour with my band after singing with Lionel Richie at the Sydney Opera House.. released an Album that was recorded in 3 days, as well as a single called \"Here I am\". I experienced success and fame very quickly. I became even more of a wild child and started writing lots of music. Free Falling was always in the back of my mind and I was praying I would be allowed to have this song on my album.. but no.. it seemed just to get ignored. Which made me even more stubborn and more determined to release it!! I decided enough is enough, I\u0027m going my own way.. I became depressed and lost my confidents. I wanted to give fans, the real me!! All of me..and my creativity.. not just the packaged bits that make money. So I went on my own journey to find truth. I just had a feeling there was something more out there for me. I wanted to regain my confidents as well. After 4 years of travelling, soul searching, loads of songwriting and recording.. I gained enough courage to release my EP - Free Falling and this was recently, 1st March 2016.. yes a few weeks ago! I have decided to let go of the past and free myself of all worries and pains. And you\u0027re thinking - what worries and pains??? Well.. in life, if we as people hold in all our pains and stresses they come out in other ways. Over the last four years I have written music that has healed me and got me through some really hard times. And I am now going to release them to the world as EP\u0027s all the way through this year of 2016 and let go of the past. I wrote and produced this music myself and it was a massive learning experience for me. I didn\u0027t have anyone telling me what to do, how to do it or when to do it.. it was done all on my own terms. It was also, some of the best experiences of my life. I learnt a lot about what is important to me, fundamentally, to maintain integrity and follow my heart. Through love, loss, truth, pain, joy, bliss and seeing life through completely different set of eyes. Having the experience of winning a reality TV show and what it feels like to then make the decision to walk away, choose the harder road. It is now time to tell the story. You could say I was resisting my destiny..Through music and visuals, and of course my VLOGS - Bed Time Stories I reveal it all. I believe this music has a place in the world, for your inspiration, your soul and spirit. It is unique. It\u0027s creative, Wild and Free! Pledge to me today and be part of this amazing journey!! with your help we will reach people all over the world because I will be working to independently promote these EP\u0027s through social media, youtube and even create Merchandise! I am not the kind of person to rely on just this funding as a means of income for my music promotion. I work hard as a music teacher and I have also just started building my own Singing and Music Academy, where I share all my knowledge and Experience to the younger generations. I love teaching it brings me so much joy, just as singing does, to see others smile and feel happy is my greatest joy and gift that I give to people. With your help , we will be creating a better world with good vibrations.\u00a0"

     "description": "I have been selected to perform my Single - Free Falling, in LA at COAST 2 COAST , Sunday March 27th. I am currently based in the UK and I am asking for help to raise funds to pay for my return flight so I can have the opportunity to perform in front of Music Industry and Producers (who work with the likes of Rhianna and Nikki Minaj). So far I have self funded this project and released the EP independently, March 1st, would open so many doors for the music to be heard on a global scale. The first prize is a PR campaign around the single and in invitation to the perform in Miami. We have to move fast and we don\u0027t have much time.. this all came about very fast!! I had fans and people voting for me on Face Book and Twitter throughout the week and had no idea that I would get through!! It\u0027s a wonderful surprise and I am SUPER excited!! Really look forward to your help and involvement!!",
