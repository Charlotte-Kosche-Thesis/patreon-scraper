    "summary": "Nothing is the story of Charles Hill, a confessed murderer who turns himself in after two high-profile killings. Locked in an interrogation room with a psychiatrist and a detective, Charles is asked to reveal the location of his victims\u0027 bodies. But before Charles tells the police what they want to know, he first has to tell them his side of the story, a story he needs them to believe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing is based upon the novel by Andrew Mitchell (that\u0027s me!), and is written, produced, and financed entirely by me. I\u0027ve been lucky enough to find some amazing voice actors who worked for practically nothing on the first episode, but with support from patrons like you, I\u0027ll be able to keep them on board and pay them more for helping my dream of making this podcast come true. There are many characters to come, so finding more talented voice actors to bring those characters to life is crucial.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery donation helps cover production costs and actor\u0027s fees, as well as helping ensure that the story of Nothing will continue to be told until the very end.\u00a0"
