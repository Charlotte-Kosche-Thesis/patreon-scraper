    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m so happy you\u0027ve found your way to me. Thank you for the delight of your attention, and the honor of your patronage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Neve K. Mazique-Bianco and I am a lover of organic exquisiteness in all its difficult forms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love bodies. I love the shapes they make, the space they take up, the way their movements change the fabric of time and the geography of the earth. I\u0027m an artist, scientist, activist, and spiritual happening maker in increasingly equal measure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my desire, with my choreography, performance art, writing, witchcraft, research and teaching, to help create a society and a world in which disabled bodies, trans bodies, bodies of color, femme bodies, animal bodies, all bodies high and low, are celebrated and protected in their beauty, autonomy, diversity, and never have to fear their disregard, harm, extinction, erasure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live and work in Seattle, and the land and the people here provide me with plenty of encouragement and inspiration. However, cost of living here is high, and for a Black, queer, female, gender nonconforming, disabled (arthrogryposis, scoliosis, and PTSD) self employed artist surviving on slim SSI payments and a hustling lifestyle, supporting the work I make and the heart I house is challenging. With just $1,500 a month from you, my patrons, my community, I could afford to pay my rent every month, purchase necessary equipment for my filmmaking and personal/medical care, and book accessible studio time. Studio time is essential not only to the creation of my dance works, but also to lessening my chronic pain and teaching me truths about the most accessible paths for my body to take.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDancing, and it\u0027s sisters, poetry and music, are like breathing to me. But breathing isn\u0027t always easy. You need room to breathe. You need support. You need clean air. You need space. Sometimes, you need to practice breathing deeply. Sometimes you need assistance to breathe. When you do this, when you get this help, you find that that headache or fear you thought you\u0027d always have begins to melt away. Being able to dance and make art as much as I want to does this for my body heart and mind. It gives my body to me so that I can give my body to the world. I would love to help you breathe, to bring ease and joy to my people in the world. Will you help me breathe?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow me on Twitter and Instagram: @nevebebad\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpcoming Shows/Workshops/Classes: \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/204360396821297/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhat Will Your Body Say When It\u0027s Free?
