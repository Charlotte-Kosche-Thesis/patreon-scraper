    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are Rob\nand Mel and we live in the glorious Fens in the East of England on a smallholding\nwith our eclectic menagerie and our jewellery teaching studio where we make\njewellery and design other giftware and accessories - many, strangely enough,\nanimal themed!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur friends\nsuggested we should try using Patreon to help fund the upkeep of some of our\nmenagerie. We didn\u0027t exactly mean to end up with quite so many animals but\napparently we are those approachable and understanding people that get handed\nunwanted bunnies and poorly ducks!! \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe talk\nabout our animals a lot online, on social media, posting many photos. They all\nhave personalities, some have developed reputations and quite often I will\nrecount the conversations we have with them - translating their side of it into\nEnglish of course! As a result this furred and feathered band have gained quite\na few fans and their stories, always told with humour, are followed by our\nfriends around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.pcomputing.co.uk/merlynstudio/coco%20+%20boo.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis was a\nfairly recent revelation to us, as was how much these often silly stories mean to\npeople. It has now become a regular occurrence to have a friend or friend of a\nfriend tell us that they were having a bad day until the latest tale of Smiffy\nthe demon goose, the bane of all Fenland delivery drivers, came across their\nway and made them laugh. It has kinda become an animal soap opera and people\nfollow our journey, celebrating the highs with us and sharing our grief at the\nlows. Many of them have confided they find our determination and perseverance\nto keep going even in the tough times a distraction from their own hardships\nand bleak days. Indeed more than one friend has found our stories, detailing our little disabled ducks and their rehabilitation, have encouraged them through their own physiotherapy and recuperation!\u003cbr\u003eAnd when you\nfinally meet up with a guy you haven\u0027t seen for 6 years and his first question\nis \"how are the baby bunnies??\" you know you never really lost touch! As for the story of Daffers a little duck who came to us not properly formed down her right hand side, with no right eye and a stumpy wing and leg, well that one made it into the Best Man\u0027s speech when Rob and I got married - remember it\u0027s only funny because it\u0027s TRUE!! \u00a0(One of the many stories that will be included in our newsletters for Patrons!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.pcomputing.co.uk/merlynstudio/smiffy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife can be difficult, responsibilities\nhard work and we manage 70 animals in not really enough space which means\nto keep them all happy and healthy we have to work twice as hard - mucking out everyone\nevery day, refilling ponds every day and supplementing their diet with greens\nand tomatoes for the ducks for example, huge amounts of hay for the ponies and rabbits or readigrass for the guinea pigs when they don\u0027t have access to grazing, of which we have very little at the moment. It costs more in time, in effort and of course in money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBUT these\nguys have become part of our family, they all have names, personalities and a\nstory to tell which we happily share online to hopefully raise a few smiles. We\nface even the toughest times with humour and we have found much to our delight\nthat our animals and their antics are followed avidly and have come to mean\nalmost as much to other people as they do to us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.pcomputing.co.uk/merlynstudio/moo%20b+w.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe are using\nPatreon to expand this audience for our menagerie\u0027s antics and hopefully raise\na little funding to help support our feed bills, and put something towards\nconverting the second stable block, extending enclosures and fencing the extra\nland we are renting to give the ponies and other livestock more space. Anyone\nwho supports us will get exclusive access to our posts, newsletters and other\nstuff that gives people an insider\u0027s view of the animals and farm life! Trust\nme it\u0027s never boring!! \u003cbr\u003eBecome a Patron and you might be among the first people\nto find out the Siamese has gone all Alien again on the Mastiff\u0027s face and has\nhad to be unhooked from his muzzle!! Or that the Shetland has got stuck in the wet room again!! Or that yet another unwanted little soul has been found on the doorstep..............\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo at the\nmoment we run the smallholding mainly as a sanctuary for unwanted, rescue or\nspecial need animals. We also run our business onsite - Merlyn Studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.merlynstudio.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.merlynstudio.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e We teach\njewellery making classes (we are an Accredited Training Centre for PMC,\nPrecious Metal Clay) and Mel is also a qualified silversmith. We make our own\njewellery lines and sell these mainly online and have also developed a range of\ngifts and accessories many based on our own animals on the farm. We are also the\nhome to Furever Footprints - silver keepsake jewellery, all handmade by us with\nan exact miniaturised copy of your animals paw, foot or hoof print stamped into\na pure silver pendant or other jewellery item.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.pcomputing.co.uk/merlynstudio/14333574_10153693942841574_2148514499080032189_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur students like to wander around the farm on the lunch break or after classes and meet the animals and of course our door is always open to our friends and their families. Several of the children who have come to visit are home educated or have special educational needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur\nultimate aim, our dream I guess, is to have a bigger place with more land that we can open up for\nexperience days for kids like this and even offer camping weekends with craft\ncourses, and the chance to learn practical farm or maintenance skills for both kids\nand parents or individuals! To offer a safe haven for people to visit, to learn new skills, experience new things and recharge themselves in a calming and cathartic environment. \u00a0And of course continue to care for all our menagerie and enrich their lives to the best of our abilities! I would love to give all of them more space and create things like trails for the ponies so their grazing mimics a more natural nomadic pattern and safe \u0027warrens\u0027 or at least places for the bunnies to dig so natural behaviours can be fulfilled for example.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it stands we currently have: 5 ponies - 3 Registered Exmoors, 1 Appaloosa and 1 Miniature Shetland (all but one of these is a rescue)\u003cbr\u003e2 dogs - both Mastiff Crosses, both from the RSPCA\u003cbr\u003e5 cats - 1 Siamese, 1 Maine Coon, 2 Black + White Jellicles and 1 Black kitten \u00a0(3 of these are rescues)\u003cbr\u003e9 House Rabbits - all rescued / rehomed to us or born here including the soon to be famous Timmy Twelvebellies (Mel is currently writing The Tales of Timmy Twelvebellies: a reluctant rabbit hero!\u0027 with a hope of getting it published and through it raising awareness of the needs of these complicated little creatures!)\u003cbr\u003e6 Guinea Pigs - all rescued or rehomed to us\u003cbr\u003e7 ornamental ducks - 2 boys 5 girls various breeds including Mandarins\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e15 domestic ducks - 7 boys, 8 girls, various breeds most rescues including the 3 \u0027Marx Brothers\u0027\u003cbr\u003e12 chickens - 3 boys, 9 girls various breeds, several rescues especially Harold!\u003cbr\u003e8 geese - 3 boys, 5 girls including our 3 beautiful Sebastopols\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.pcomputing.co.uk/merlynstudio/Gav%20+%20Stace.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also have 5 kids between us - 1 boy, 4 girls, 3 of whom are all growed up and the other 2 who live with us on the farm. We refer to the offspring as \u0027The Number System\u0027 and as the name suggests we tend to refer to them by their number - Number 1 being the eldest obviously, Number 3 being the boy child etc etc\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNumber 4 in particular is a gifted rider and has worked very hard with the ponies, her little Exmoor mare in particular who she has transformed from a feral, quite frankly aggressive almost wild animal to a sweet pony. Working with rescue animals we have stepped away from traditional pressure / release or other harsher or confrontational training methods with the horses. We now use positive reinforcement with the ponies and actually clicker train them with great success! We no longer believe it\u0027s okay to hit and whip horses - when faced with a nervous and frightened animal we don\u0027t think trying to force it into the behaviour you require, is the best way forward. We try to listen to our ponies and give them time so the behaviour they offer us is because they want to and because they trust us, rather than because they are forced to or do it out of fear.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow are a couple of stories and descriptions about one or two of our creatures to give you some idea of the characters we have on the farm and give you a taster of what you will get in our newsletters and posts if you decide to become a patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHarold\u0027s Story\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.pcomputing.co.uk/merlynstudio/harold%20card.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing\nwith a lot of livestock is the boys for the most part have no value ..... sorry\nto break it to you guys but when it comes to ducks and geese the boys are the\nones most likely to be served up in a pancake or with bread sauce! This is why\nour male / female ratio is pretty even, especially with our ducks. A case in\npoint is Harold our frizzled Serama cockerel. I went to the poultry and small\nanimal auction and I wasn\u0027t in the mind to buy a cockerel - at that point we\ndidn\u0027t have any and had planned to keep it that way but the usual guys were\nthere buying poultry for restaurants and for halal meat. Cockerels are\ngenerally unwanted for anything other than meat and go for no more than 50p each but when I walked past\nHarold he fixed a beady eye on me and for such a tiny bird he had a massive\npersonality. Too much personality to be made into curry! I sent Number 4 to the car to grab a carrier for the 2 Old English\nGame hens I had just bought and yess obviously I bid on Harold - a whole \u00a31.50\nit cost me to take him away. His breeder came up to me afterwards, I think\nrelieved someone who was a hobby farmer and not interested in him for meat had\nbought him, and told me his name was Harold. We put Harold in The Borough of\nRoyal Henfield with our 3 little pekin pullets and our 2 big Buff Orpington\nhens Polly and Peck. Harold took one look at the 2 larger ladies decided that\nhe liked what he saw and spent most of the afternoon chasing them around\nhanging onto their tail feathers and hoping for a leg up! Harold spent his\nnights squashed in between the 2 large ginger ladies happier than a pig in mud.\nWe lost Polly October 5th 2016 - she had struggled over the summer in the hot\nweather to lay properly shelled eggs, no doubt the reason she was sold on.\nDespite supplements and a careful diet we think one may have ruptured inside her, causing the infection that killed her. By the time she showed any signs of\ndiscomfort it was too advanced for the antibiotics to have any effect and we\ncouldn\u0027t save her. Thank the lord for Harold though!! Polly and Peck had been\ninseparable so without him we would have had a very lonely hen. He still\ncuddles up with her at night in Orpington Grange and now the little Pekins Tic,\nTac and Toe are mature they get a lot of attention from him during the day too,\nespecially Toe who he seems quite keen on! The Serama is originally from\nMalaysia and is the smallest breed of chicken in the world. Harold though has\nthe biggest personality. He was pretty scruffy and lice ridden when he arrived\nbut a few baths and a decent diet later he is the most handsome little chap -\nand he knows it! Like all of the animals he has a home for life with us and we\nare looking forward to next year and seeing whether Harold and the ladies of\nEnfield actually manage to produce any babies!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always talk to the animals and sometimes I imagine what they say back. Even though 3 of the ponies are Exmoors they still all have very different personalities, the conversation below kinda illustrates this! Our 5 ponies are as follows: Buddy the Exmoor (the Gelding), Penny the Exmoor (the Mare), Pixie the Exmoor (Baby Pony) and also Lulu the Shetland and Misty the Appaloosa (the Younger Mare). Here is what happened when the 3 Exies met prospective farm sitters for the first time......\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Farm Sitters Conversation:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.pcomputing.co.uk/merlynstudio/10488035_10152188633776574_1368057509189706968_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBaby Pony: Hello complete stranger - yesss of course you can put\nmy head collar on - I love you!!

Like little Dee the duck who was so emaciated when she came to us and had very bent legs and couldn\u0027t support her own weight. Her legs have never straightened completely and her feet still kinda overlap when she walks but after lots of food and physio the videos of her waddling around the garden are just brilliant to see. This duck will follow you anywhere for a tomato and quite often will breakfast in the kitchen with the dogs!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully this has given you a taster of some of the characters we look after here, hopefully some of you will decide to become patrons and keep up to date with our animal adventures at New Hope farm!!

It also equates to one monthly insurance payment for one of the ponies to cover vets bills in case they get sick! We would never have found out what was wrong with Misty without insurance paying for the bone scan so it cannot be underestimated how important this amount can be!! As a thank you you get access to our Patron only posts, our monthly newsletter with photos and stories from the farm, and if you give us your address and birthday a little Birthday thank you from all the menagerie!! PLUS you guys will get exclusive discounts on our products and access to exclusive New Hope Merchandise!

On top of all the other stuff you get a thank you gift after your first month, AND you get to be more involved - we will be asking anyone who pledges $50 or more for name suggestions for any new babies born, or for new arrivals, names for animal houses and to pick which animal we focus on in the next newsletter!!
