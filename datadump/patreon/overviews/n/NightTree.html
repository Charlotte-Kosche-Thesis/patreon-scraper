Night Tree are thrilled to welcome you to our Patreon page.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne morning in September of 2016, six people craved a musical session. The six of us soon found ourselves in a dimly lit practice room at the New England Conservatory, instruments in hand. After an extended set consisting of a tune from Sweden that expanded and stretched between us, weaving in and out of improvisatory moments, we realized that we had discovered an incredible energy and sound potential between us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are unique, not only for our abnormal instrumentation of two fiddles, cello, accordion, saxophone, percussion, and the occasional viola and mandolin, but for our collective representation and incorporation of traditions from Irish, Classical, Swedish, Jazz, Klezmer, and Afro-Cuban music. Each of our personalities is given a spot to emerge with fiery improvisation, individual compositions, and a pristine ear.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur music has taken us across the Northeast- through the Blue Ridge Mountains in Asheville, North Carolina, all the way up to the clear waters of Maine and the lush farmlands of Naples, New York.\u00a0 Our music has brought us to the New World Festival in Vermont, NERFA Conference in Connecticut, and most recently Folk Alliance International in Kansas City, Missouri. We will venture through Indiana, Chicago, and St.Louis next month in March and make our \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eInternational\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e debut in Sweden this July.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Together, we have met wonderful people who have so graciously welcomed us to their homes and performance spaces with open arms, followed by many magical nights of the joyous experience of live music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, we are performing, touring, traveling, rehearsing, writing, communicating, thinking, and engaging with the people we perform for who we meet along the road. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, we reach out to you, whom without we would not be where we are at this moment, and ask for your support on this journey to help us continue to bring our music around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are looking at funding our sophomore album (to be recorded May 22-May 30 2018 at MilkBoy Recording Studio in Philadelphia produced by Seamus Egan). The more funding we receive, the more we will be able to accept gigs outside the US and pay for plane tickets to travel overseas (Mckinley would so love to buy a seat for her cello when we travel so it doesn\u0027t get thrown around under the plane!).\u00a0 We are forever grateful for you and your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for being a part of the Night Tree journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith much joy \u0026amp; gratitude,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eJulian\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003eZach\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eLily\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(146, 205, 220);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eChris\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eSunniva\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eMckinley\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pjL2GQAkvXA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VJ_qm5HHWdg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cOne of the most exciting roots-based music groups to emerge from the New England Conservatory in many years.

The group, all students at NEC, were named the Conservatory\u2019s WildCard Honors Ensemble for 2016-2017. Awards for this title included a sponsorship from NEC, a headlining performance at the historic Jordan Hall, and a year of working with Winifred Horan, fiddler and co-founder of Irish super-band, SOLAS. \u003cem\u003eNight Tree\u003c/em\u003e released their debut album on September 1st of this year, produced by S\u00e9amus Egan, another founding member of SOLAS. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTOP New Albums + Songs of Sept 2017:\u003cbr\u003eNo. 6 \u2014 Night Tree / \u201cNight Tree\u201d, \u201cWish On The Wind\u201d,\u003cbr\u003e\u201cFoWrist\u201d, \u201cI Feel A Rumblin\u201d (Out of 70 New Albums).\u003cbr\u003eTOP Artist of Sept 2017:\u003cbr\u003eNo. 9 \u2014 Night Tree (Out of 40 Artists)\u003cbr\u003eTOP New Songs of Sept 2017:\u003cbr\u003eNo. 15 \u2014 \u201cWish On The Wind\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese six conservatory-trained musicians have absorbed genres from across the globe. \u003cem\u003eNight Tree\u003c/em\u003e is unique, not only for its abnormal instrumentation of two fiddles, cello, accordion, saxophone, percussion,  and the occasional viola and mandolin, but for their collective representation and incorporation of traditions from Irish, Classical, Swedish, Jazz, Klezmer, and Afro-Cuban music.
