There are many themes that I want to add and develop, transformation, sex change, submission, etc. Also, I want\u00a0the game to have lots items and clothes to customize the main character.\u003cbr\u003eAlthough a great part of the game is text-based, my main hobby is drawing and, the game is meant to have illustrations for most passages and all the characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are some of the inspirations for the game?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want the game to have an epic feeling and look, like in Final Fantasy and Shadow of the Colossus, and also the enemy design to have the mystery and uniqueness that beings from Silent Hill and H.P. Lovecraft have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Why should I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s the best way to assure that the game keeps improving, also it\u0027s a great motivation and helps me to focus my free time on developing the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd what do I get for it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support apart from making the game development quicker, it would allow me to spend more resources on improving my art, which means greater quality content for the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou also get my most sincere gratitude for supporting me on this journey of becoming a better artist and for allowing me to do what I truly want to do in life.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
