My lineage includes pirates \u0026amp; detectives and I revel in solving impossible problems. I\u0027ve never had a favorite color and have a little trouble following rules. My best creative tools are an insatiable curiosity and a\u00a0compulsive need to test the bounds of possibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eI\u0027m an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy background is in visual art, but currently\u00a0find myself in an immersive practice, which means my whole\u00a0existence is one big art project and it\u2019s difficult for me to know where my edges are. I am the founding artist of the NOMAD Art Bus which exists with the mission of giving all people access to art programming. I spend my days navigating the territory between art supplies and air brakes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eI\u0027m on a mission.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had no premonition that I\u0027d be walking (driving?) this path back when I was working my way through art school, but when funding cuts started pulling art programming from schools in my area I responded by building an art room inside a bus and taking to the streets so that everyone could have art class again. It\u0027s my biggest, most impossible project yet, but it works because I have lots of help; I\u0027m humbled to have other teaching artists and advocates on board joining the movement with me. At the end of the day I can\u2019t seem to\u00a0separate myself from this curious and creative practice, and that is what keeps me driven.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI could use your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI want to keep doing this. I\u0027ve been at it full time for over four years now and the Art Bus group has grown quite a bit since our 2014 launch. We work hard and have gained a lot of momentum; and it\u0027s not slowing down anytime soon. We get some funding to do the work -- to cover some art supplies and fuel -- and we\u0027re \u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e working on matching funds to our programs, but there are still gaps. If you become a patron it will help with those gaps to keep this whole thing rolling. Take a look at the patron levels to see if there\u0027s one that works for you...and spread the word. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
