To our continued\nshock and awe, the web series won\u2019t die, no matter how much money we squander on painfully obvious, mid-nineties CGI effects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow, with support from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.escapistmagazine.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Escapist\u003c/a\u003e, we\u2019re able to continue\nto create episodes of \u003cem\u003eNatural 20 \u003c/em\u003efor you to enjoy! Unfortunately, their support\nonly goes so far, and I\u2019m finding it harder and harder to rob local pharmacies\nin what newspapers are calling \u201cThe Baffling Case of the Lipitor Bandit\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLook, here\u0027s the skinny: we\u0027ve got enough funds to make \u003cem\u003eNatural 20\u003c/em\u003e episodes, and it\u0027s always going to get put online to be viewed for free. We are painfully grateful that you would watch the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut. Many of the people who work to make it (myself included) do so entirely unpaid, which means, essentially, it\u0027s unsustainable. By the end of our current contract, I will have written 150 pages of \u003cem\u003eNatural 20\u003c/em\u003e. Both of the producers put in hours of scheduling with flakey people like me, filing paperwork with cutthroat and painfully attractive actor unions, and perform many jobs that, by rights, shouldn\u0027t be theirs. Yet we put in this effort because we love D\u0026amp;D;, and if you would like to support the creation of quality entertainment then please consider sponsoring the show. Every dollar increases the quality of the material, and makes the enormous effort it takes to bring this to the small screen that much easier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat creatures have birthed this monstrosity?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJack Delaney is a comedy writer who lives in Los Angeles, and sounds like a walking cliche.
