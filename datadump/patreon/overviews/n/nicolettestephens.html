Autobiographies are the bane of my existence, and I tend to talk in circles around them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince that would waste your time, and mine, allow me to be blunt: I\u0027m a writer. I want to write fiction.

Changing the focus of my Patreon page to encourage me to write what I would like to write every single day: fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFantasy, romance, horror, flash, mystery, historical, sci-fi. Name it, I\u0027ll try it. If you become a patron, I\u0027ll even accept requests or prompts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like a sample of my work before signing up as a patron, please take a look at \u003cem\u003eJozi Flash 2017\u003c/em\u003e, which is a free download of 80 flash fiction stories, written by 10 authors, across 8 genres. I\u0027m rather proud of the anthology, as I organised, contributed to, edited and published it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can download it from my blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://chasingdreamspublishing.wordpress.com/book-releases/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChasing Dreams Publishing\u003c/a\u003e. (2016\u0027s anthology is also there, and it acted as the learning curve for the production of 2017, so feel free to enjoy that too.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really hope you\u0027ll consider becoming a Patron, and thank you very much for allowing me a platform in which to tell my stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
