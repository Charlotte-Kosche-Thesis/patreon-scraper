Relying on advertising helps with some costs, but as we advance more and more, the amount of advertising we would need to fulfill our goal of spreading the love of collecting comics and toys becomes more than a site could handle and remain uncluttered, not to mention free of influence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve seen the comics news websites that essentially run articles that function as little more than PR for publishers. We don\u0027t want to become that. We want to offer honest critiques of our hobbies, the producers of that product and genuine conversation around our shared hobby. We also want to be able to cover as much as possible for you, our readers and friends. Your patronage will help us do that."
