    "summary": "Welcome to the Graveyard! I\u0027m a horror writer, with high hopes of getting one of my numerous novels published. I have nine manuscripts total that I am constantly editing. I also have a website (https://www.nickronomicon.com)\u00a0where I post chapters of ongoing novels and parts of ongoing serial stories. I also post the occasional one-shot that is meant to be a fun bit of horror and humor. I do poetry (mostly Haikus) and link indie horror movies off of youtube to highlight people who, like me, are giving it their all to make this world a little bit scarier than we found it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, I suppose because it\u0027ll get me to write better. I need an income as much as any man and people paying me to write will hurry things along. Patrons will get to see (and review) my never before seen novels one chapter at a time, as well as a number of stories that I don\u0027t post for personal reasons. You\u0027ll also get access to blog posts where I explain how I write and general news that interests me. I\u0027m a Buddhist and a political activist so I have a lot to say, and with a degree in History I have a way to back it up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlright, fine, so how much do you need exactly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike one of my humble characters said: \"A little will go a long way...\" I won\u0027t finish that quote as it pertains to torture, so... yeah. But seriously, a dollar or three a month will result in bills being paid, food getting put on the table, and me writing stories faster. If I get enough I\u0027ll even be able to pay artists to add to my stories!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how do I know you\u0027re good?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eExcellent question! I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m good, but many other people think so. I have over twenty-six publications to my name, not counting the two years I spent as a columnist for Dark Eclipse Magazine. I have numerous stories under review for other publications and have traded e-mails with some friendly agents. I may not be the second coming of Stephen King, but I plan to have my books populate the bookshelves of people all over the world!\u00a0\u003cdiv\u003eHell, I\u0027ve had a book signing where people actually showed up to get copies signed! How many writers can claim that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so you\u0027re \"Good\". What will I get as a Patron that nobody else gets?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, that depends on how much you donate. Like I said, everyone who donates, at least, a dollar will get access to rare-to-find or never-before-seen stories! Those that donate more will be able to partake in polls to see which stories will be updated the following week, and some will even be able to request a story to be written for them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReally? All\u00a0that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I plan on serving those willing to pay me as well as I can!\u003c/div\u003e"
