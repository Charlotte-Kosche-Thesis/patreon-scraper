    "summary": "We are creating something that will change the culture around \u201cexclusive\u201d fan communities. Eventually we would like to branch out to other fan communities, but as of right now the comic book community is plenty large enough to begin with. Our goal is to make it more inclusive, supportive, and non-judgmental.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are creating something that will allow newcomers a way to learn without being accused of not being a true fan or being excluded because they disagree with something about a character or storyline. Most major comic book characters have been running for decades and their stories have made some drastic changes over the years. It can be overwhelming to jump into a story that has been developed, told and adapted for decades. It is no surprise why some newcomers find comics difficult to get into, or why comic readers that have spent years reading the adventures of their favorite characters haven\u2019t found the time to explore new characters and storylines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you are a comic novice or expert, if you want to learn more about the characters being adapted to film, if you want to start reading but don\u2019t know where to start, or if you want to expand your knowledge of comics you have not yet explored, we are here to Nerdsplain It to you! We are a here to give context to these characters by discussing classic and current storylines and brushing up on the history of comics and their characters.\u003cbr\u003e"
