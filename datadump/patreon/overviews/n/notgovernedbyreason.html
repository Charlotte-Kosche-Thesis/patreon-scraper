We appreciate you taking a moment to learn about us and what it is we do, our goals and ambitions, and the rewards we are offering in return for your continuous support! By joining our cause you will not only be supporting our dreams and goals for the podcast and services we would like to provide, but you will be receiving some great thanks in return in the form of production credits, giveaway entries, exclusive content, and so much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that said, lets not bore you anymore with this intro and get on to the nitty-gritty of the whos, whats, whens, and whys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT THE NOT GOVERNED BY REASON PODCAST?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Not Governed By Reason Podcast (or NGBR) began its formation in September of 2016 and now carries many different facets. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, we are a LIVE weekly podcast that focuses on current events and news, but with a politically-incorrect and often times hilariously offensive perspective. The show features a variety of special guests each week and is hosted by creator Doug Ware (Former vocalist for Other People\u0027s Children; Founder of the now disbanded TheMSG Studios) and Josh Coleman. We stream our podcast LIVE every Tuesday on Facebook Live, and then gets distributed to all of our various platforms (Youtube, Bitchute, iTunes, Google Play Music, Stitcher Radio, etc.). The show aims to break down our current social division that is often created by opposing opinions, and tries to do so through the guise of humor. So, needless to say, its not for the easily offended or faint-hearted!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond just a weekly podcast, we are creatives and jacks-of-all-trades when it comes to multimedia! We not only do this podcast but we also create a variety of content including videos, music, graphics, marketing plans and more for other creative minds! Eventually we would like to expand into a network for creators to host their content and share their souls without having to worry about censoring themselves in the process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOUR GOALS:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to continue to expand our creations beyond what we\u0027ve already done. Each pledge will help us with the incurred costs of running the show (basic equipment maintenance, web hosting services, etc) and help us grow our quality and quantity of creations. Since inception, all of our expansion and costs have been completely out of pocket, and that definitely adds up! By pledging you are assisting us in upgrading equipment (like the 3 unmatching cameras we have that show a noticeable quality difference), expanding our marketing, and allowing us to expand our creative operations! Each time something is funded through your pledge, full credit will be given, and we will make sure to show you what it is we\u0027re doing with your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHATS IN IT FOR YOU?:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging you will get access to exclusive behind-the-scenes content, one-on-one performances from musicians we host, production credits, exclusive releases, interview questions, extra entries into our giveaways, and SO MUCH MORE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGo ahead and take a look at what we\u0027re offering, and thank you for taking the time to make our dreams become a reality!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

Once we hit this goal it will go toward purchasing a new Sony Mirrorless Camera (to match our other one), Better Soundproofing for the studio, merchandise (stickers, t-shirts, etc), and a large vinyl banner with our logo on it to show off at events! (P.S. If you pledged to the \"Ultimate Reasoner\" tier, we will sharpie marker your name on the banner)",
