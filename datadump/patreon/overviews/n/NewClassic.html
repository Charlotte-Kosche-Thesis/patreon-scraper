    "summary": "Good evening, internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those whom I haven\u0027t met, my name is Taylor Hidalgo, and I\u0027m a freelance games writer and editor. I write and edit regularly for \u003ca href=\"http://www.haywiremag.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHaywire Magazine\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.thethesaurusrex.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e, on a freelance basis for \u003ca href=\"http://xpgain.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eXPGain\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.unwinnable.com/author/taylor-hidalgo/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eUnwinnable\u003c/a\u003e, and the \u003ca href=\"http://www.escapistmagazine.com/profiles/articles/NewClassic\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEscapist Magazine\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI take great pride that I have the opportunity to write about\u2014and love finding\u2014new ways to approach games as a medium. This Patreon exists so I can move toward expanding my work. Not just into writing more, but writing more widely, taking time to practice writing with a laser-focus as well as a wide net. To explore new topics, cover approaches I\u0027ve not considered previously, and find new ways to make observations about games as a hobby, gaming as a culture, and games as an art form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to have that reach, every extra cent is another step toward widening how I can approach my writing. Major releases come and go, and with them opportunities and perspectives I could develop for them. Sadly, my pocket\u0027s too thin to pay the cost of entry. I\u0027m opening this Patreon not just to earn myself some money, but also to help expand how I can approach writing, and help me afford the costs that come with doing a demanding craft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat this means for me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor me, earning money for writing is just a possibility; it\u0027s not that probable, and it\u0027s not terribly lucrative. The reason I write about games is because they\u0027re worth discussing. They aren\u0027t going to change the world in flourishing style, nor are they going to solve the maladies that have been plaguing society. They are, however, worth exploring: they tell us about ourselves, the world we live in, and the world we hope to one day create. Like film, visual arts, music, and literature, they\u0027re part of how we explore who and what we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m honored to be a part of that, and everyone who turns on a console or launches a PC game are a part of it too. We\u0027re making a future that consumes and explores games. I\u0027d like to hopefully make enough to be able to do it more often and better. Because the discussions like these shouldn\u0027t go unsaid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat this means for you:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery dollar that filters its way through the internet is another dollar I can put toward improving my craft. Whether that means exploring more topics to cover things you may love, helping me find a partner to produce content with, or even help push me forward because you enjoy my work, this money is something I can use to help make better content for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to use the income I make to better create for my readers and patrons, because you all deserve no less than the best I can offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn short,\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon enables me to write more, both \u003cem\u003efor\u003c/em\u003e you and \u003cem\u003ewith\u003c/em\u003e you, and I look forward to getting to plunge headfirst into the great knowns and unknowns of writing out there. I hope we all find something amazing in our journey there together.\u003cbr\u003e"
