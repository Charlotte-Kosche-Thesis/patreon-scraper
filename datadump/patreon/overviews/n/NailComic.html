    "summary": "This story is about a boy named Nail (yes that is his name) that lives in a city filled with superheroes which he thinks is the coolest. But one day something happened and spiritual monsters started appearing all over town possessing people including Nail. Now Nail is struggling with this new found power and the new voice in his head. Getting the chance that every kid dreams of he becomes a superhero with his new abilities. But, will he keep on his path or will he find out being a hero is not at all what he images.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time if you have a moment to cont.....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have this comic idea since i was 14 yrs old.
