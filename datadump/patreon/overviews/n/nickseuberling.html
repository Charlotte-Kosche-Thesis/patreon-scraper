He is also a proud alum of Moeller High School where he served as the team\u0027s placekicker and punter for three seasons. After graduating, he spent his college years behind the mic at Bowling Green State University (class of \u201903) calling numerous football, basketball and baseball games for the Falcons. He spent one summer on the air as an intern at ESPN 1470 WLQR-AM in Toledo, OH. Before coming to Cincy Jungle, Nick served as the podcast guru at WhoDeyFans.com where he joined up with The Number One Fan (aka whodeyfans) to produce the podcast. In November 2013, the show was a finalist in the Podcast Awards for Best Sports Podcast for the 3rd year in a row. The podcast went up against the giants of ESPN, Yahoo Sports and CBS Sports.\u003cbr\u003eIn January 2012, Nick created the Sports Podcast and Entertainment Network (SPNT.tv) which features podcasts from all different teams, sports and more.
