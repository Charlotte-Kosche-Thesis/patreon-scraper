A lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is a good thing, as I\u0027ve been writing for the better part of a decade and a half now. Jobs have come and gone, including 1UP.com and \u003cem\u003eNintendo Power\u003c/em\u003e, among various other publications and websites (click \u003ca href=\"http://www.poisonmushroom.org/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e if you want a more comprehensive list).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn and around these other jobs, I\u0027ve also been running some of my own websites, which make up most of the collective \u003ca href=\"http://www.nyteworks.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNyteworks\u003c/a\u003e network. These include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.marios-hat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMario\u0027s Hat\u003c/a\u003e, dedicated to Canadian gaming news, as well as reviews and previews that anyone can use. And it\u0027s not just Nintendo stuff, either! Xbox, PlayStation, PC-- it\u0027s all good here. I try to spread the news about any sort of gaming-related events taking place in Canada, including early previews, launch events, and weekly deals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.poisonmushroom.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePoisonMushroom.Org\u003c/a\u003e, or PMO for short, which over the years has evolved into something of a general sort of geek culture site. Comic books, movies, toys, wrestling, video games (naturally), and even \"fast food culture\" are all par for the course here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.themmnetwork.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Mega Man Network\u003c/a\u003e, which I\u0027ve been at the longest. There, I cover not only \u003cem\u003eMega Man\u003c/em\u003e games and related media, but also keep an eye out for \u003cem\u003eMega Man\u003c/em\u003e-esque stuff that would appeal to the same audience. Even in these times where it seems there is very little happening with the Blue Bomber, I try my best to make sure fans have \u003cem\u003esomething \u003c/em\u003eto look at every weekday from Monday to Friday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.thepreorderblog.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Pre-Order Blog\u003c/a\u003e, which presents everything you need to know about the pre-order bonuses available for games, or potentially movies, or anything else with a perk for handing your money over early. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/nyteworks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Friday Nyteworks Stream\u003c/a\u003e, which is a recent video game live streaming endeavor I\u0027ve begun on Twitch. Previous streams can be found on \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Nyteworks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Nyteworks YouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to provide insightful, informative, and where applicable, entertaining articles across the whole lot. This particularly applies to PoisonMushroom.Org, where I tend to write more comprehensive pieces, but it can be tough, particularly when always on the lookout for your next paying job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, I want to be able to focus more on these sites than trying to write for others. I want to write for \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e, to present some fresh pieces and maybe even provoke a bit of thought. I want to be able to devote my energy-- a few smaller projects aside-- on making these sites the very best they can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven something as basic as The Pre-Order Blog can be quite time-consuming. Did you know that most PR people know squat about the pre-order promotions going on with the games they cover? So those entries tend to require quite a bit of research.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to do more. I want to do \u003cem\u003ebetter\u003c/em\u003e, and I \u003cem\u003ecan \u003c/em\u003edo better. It\u0027s all about focus and support. To make these sites the best they can be requires more focus, and I need your support to make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e"
