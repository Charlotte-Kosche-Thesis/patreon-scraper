     "about": "My name is Andrew Niel...but everyone calls me Nelly.\u003cbr\u003eI was born in Wimbledon,London. My first experiance of music and the thing that changed my life and gave me the passion i still have to this day for music, was down to an uncle i never had privilege to meet.\u003cbr\u003eWhen i was 5 years old I inherated a box of records,they were 7 inch singles......there was probally 500 vinyl\u0027s in this box.It was like every big song from 60\u0027s and 70\u0027s from Dusty Springfield to The Beatles(all picture covers),Frank Sinatra to Black Sabbath and Free-alright now,Elvis to John Lennon and the plastic ono band. It was just crammed full of amazing music.I would just sit for hours listening to this wondrous sound that came from from a mere piece of plastic(vinyl).In fact i would sit there playing \"Air drums \"along to the tunes(ironic,cause i ended up being a guitar player)....LIFE  WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME FROM THIS POINT ON     .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started playing guitar when i was 13, i didn\u0027t have a guitar....but my older brother did.But he wouldn\u0027t let me near it.I would get home earlier from school than him,which meant i could play for an hour !!\u003cbr\u003eWhen we were 13 my best mate also played guitar ,he was amazing.within 6 months he was learning all top players solo\u0027s by ear.i was never that good ,i developed my own style and in time.....a long time....can now play....but i knew i was never gonna be a Stevie Via or Eddie van Halen .I wasn\u0027t naturally gifted like he was,i had to work hard at it. (there\u0027s actually a video,on this story-\u0027I\u0027m not a finesse player\u0027)\u003cbr\u003eMOVING ON A BIT....i played in bands,with some success,and realised i was always gonna b a musician as I\u0027m very creative, my heads always full of music and ideas.So i knew i had to have a facillity to record/rehearse my music from and generally make loads a noise.So i set up Washouse studio in Brighton.....in the 90\u0027s.  we were 16 track studio,i aimed for local bands to record demo\u0027s .\u003cbr\u003eLoad\u0027s of bands I recorded got record deals,it was great experiance....and i learnt how to engineer,program and produce.Also recording for people like Captain Sensible,Matt Hartley ex Cure, Annie Knightingale (Radio 1),and other local brighton celebs ! ...... all this led to a record deal offer for my band,from Fred Dirst(Limp bizcuit) he was A+R for Flip records in L.A.\u003cbr\u003eagain so much to tell but will leave that for another day.\u003cbr\u003eIt was round this time when i came back from U.S.A \u00a0that my Life started to fall apart...with mates ,business partners,and wife all dying. I won\u0027t deny..... it sent me mad...from the sorrow and loss.\u003cbr\u003eTHE PRESENT.\u003cbr\u003eI needed to get away,so went to India for a holiday-but also to buy and learn Sitar.I have just been channelling all my energies into my music,playing and recording.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMusic has the potential to heal,its even magical i think.\u003cbr\u003eIn this modern world it\u0027s one of the few things that can make you laugh or cry,make you happy or sad . Music\u0027s a wonderful thing.\u003cbr\u003eRecently I been playing Slide Guitar and Sitar,on the streets in Brighton UK,I love the freedom of busking,and,seeing peoples reactions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI now have a Youtube channel /nellyslideguitar \u00a0and a Facebook page\u00a0/nelly.niel.9 \u00a0set-up for me by Rob Chapman a Youtube Guitarist who saw me playing in the streets in March 2014 ,he heard my story,and wanted to help me get back on my feet.,you can see the video if you cllck this link \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PnIu1hd4q0\u0026amp;list=PLo06sLh2Pxqb2widXiY_fDh195mIm8ISQ.\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PnIu1hd4q0\u0026amp;list=P...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have now started making videos and posting them on Youtube,from me playing Slide or Sitar to Tutorial videos like playing Slide or using technology such as Guitar Rig , Ableton ,Amplitude., In these video\u0027s I can pass on my +20 years of Knowledge,of Guitars and technology\u003cbr\u003eSo enjoy the new video\u0027s....and photo\u0027s ,and my first Blues Album is now available to download from\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://planetnelly.co.uk/blogs#sthash.98yQCcJY.dpuf\"\u003ehttp://planetnelly.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e  \u00a0Bye for now \u00a0 Nelly",
