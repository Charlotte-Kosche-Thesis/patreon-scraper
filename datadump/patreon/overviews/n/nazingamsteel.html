    "summary": "So what does a young Afro Caribbean, American have to say?\nWhat does she write about that would interest me? Is she going to WOW us with\nsome epics about country life on the isles of spice? I sometimes imagine this\nto be what people think when I mention that I write. Writing is a passion, no\ndoubt, but for me it\u2019s more than that, it a means of sanity, and an outlet to\nsurvive this crazy train we\u2019re all on called life; hopefully it\u2019s not on a\ncrash course. I remember drawing pictures for my mom as a preschooler in the country\nside of St. Georges, Grenada, and regaling her about the stories behind the art.\nShe used to hang them up in her room, and I felt such an accomplishment over\nthe idea that what I had created warranted such a lofty place in her space. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen I moved to Canada at age 8, I began putting down\nstories in note books, even in the back of text books. I made paper dolls, they\nhad background stories that I kept in a folder. When I moved to the U.S, the\npressures of life had just begun to touch the fringes of my psyche. I was a\npreteen and had moved from Queens, to Maryland, and back to NY, only this time\nto Brooklyn. Then suddenly I was a teenager and all of the strange awareness\u2019s\nof myself and the perceptions of the world I inhabited were culminating to a fever\npitch; and writing, became my psychiatrist, my best friend and sanctuary. Now here I am, a young woman, my writing\nevolved and desires to create, deepened by the inspiration of the unique experiences I\u2019ve had, the people I come\nacross, the frightening progression of the world, and last but not least, the\nexpansion of myself. Will you join me on this journey of exploration through\nstory? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
