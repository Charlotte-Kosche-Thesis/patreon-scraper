    "summary": "Hey everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Steven Cornett, I\u0027m a small scale regenerative farmer and permaculturist and I run a successful market garden in my backyard, in San Diego, CA. \u003cimg src=\"https://steemitimages.com/DQmRaL5TA2zMmcU4JQozHXELncrVJSS87X6EJ1pCd4jH861/2017-11-05%2008.18.47.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have 19 chickens, 10,000s of red worms, fruit trees, grapes, \nberries, passion fruit, dragon fruit, and 1/4 acre of space for my \nfarming enterprises. I make my own soil, fertilizers, and brought \nfertility to my land cheaply and naturally using sheet mulch and cover \ncrops. I detail it all on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/naturesalwaysright\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmPnq1gxBLe1s41bUBCtMPGsbukgkaWwfEvsvmzHbCwqnH/2017-02-25%2010.59.26.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal is to teach as many people as I can about regenerative farming \ntechniques and how they can grow healthy food for their family and even \nmake money as a small scale urban farmer. Regenerative farming use \nno-till methods that focuses on creating the healthiest soil, plants, \nand animals possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt really is possible to make a decent living on a small amount\n of land if you utilize an efficient design, a great business plan, and \nchoose ideal crops to grow. Crops that are in demand, have a fast date \nto harvest, and high profit margin are typically chosen as the major \nsource of income for small urban farmers. It\u0027s not for everyone, it\u0027s a \nlot of long hours and you won\u0027t get rich, but you will become rich in \nmany other ways I can assure you. Farming has blessed my life in \ncountless ways and I would love to share my story with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you would like to hear my personal journey of how I started \nfarming 6 years ago, please check out the Sustainable Living Podcast \nepisode about me \u003ca href=\"http://sustainablelivingpodcast.libsyn.com/slp-125-urban-farming\"\u003ehttp://sustainablelivingpodcast.libsyn.com/slp-125-urban-farming\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing food is my passion but I have two higher goals beyond just farming:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n#1 I want to help as many people learn to grow food as I can. So they\n can experience the joy and health benefits of raising their own \nproduce, and if it\u0027s right for them, make a living enjoying this amazing\n lifestyle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n#2 I believe that radically changing our food system can achieve \nmassive economic and social change that will help breakdown many \ngovernment monopolized services and replace them with legitimate and \nefficient private service providers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf 100,000s of new farmers start small scale regenerative agriculture businesses it will have many effects:\u003cbr\u003e\n-Increases local economic growth\u003cbr\u003e-Reduces healthcare costs\u003cbr\u003e\n-Reduces overall environmental and health impacts of conventional farming\u003cbr\u003e-Reduces use of pharmaceutical drugs and many conventional treatments\u003cbr\u003e\n-Localizes community, scales back and replaces federal government services\u003cbr\u003e\n-Food security\u003cbr\u003e\n-Makes government subsidies of agriculture/gmo less frequent\u003cbr\u003e\n-Reduces transportation of food reducing emissions\u003cbr\u003e\n-Restores more power and freedom to individuals and their communities\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHelping to change our current large scale degenerative food system to\n a small scale regenerative agriculture system will have a major \ninfluence over the future of our world and society. In my opinion, this is\n the best solution to all of the environmental, health, cultural, and \neconomic crises we currently face. We can use the positive incentives of\n the market to drive ethical behavior and farm using natural systems \nthat are highly efficient and mutually beneficial to all involved.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou might be surprised to learn that I actually use 0 pesticides on \nmy farm. Birds, ladybugs, hover flies, predatory wasps, spiders, \nlacewings, ect are my pest control. I always have dozen of species of \nplants growing on my farm to promote biodiversity, which brings a high \nlevel of balance to the micro ecosystem of my market garden. I even make\n 75% of my own soils, fertilizers, and amendments. I am aiming to have \nmy property be 95% sustainable by the end of the year including feeding \nmy chickens for free using free inputs. Everything I do will be \ndisplayed for all to see on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/naturesalwaysright\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://steemitimages.com/DQmdp4PU1hbDT1ksa8nxfBqyBtZtpaCmswN7hEUn7iwLoLR/2017-09-30%2018.07.21.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNature is already perfect and we can use its systems to an incredible \nadvantage. Or we can meddle with its perfect systems, destroying it \narrogantly in the process. These universal patterns and rules of nature \napply across all aspects of life. The land is an endless teacher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLooking forward to sharing more with this awesome community! Thank you for considering supporting me in my work.

     "description": "I will create a video for you each month about any farming/gardening/nature/sustainability topic of your choosing. If you prefer only a single video we can arrange that. It can be a how to, build, or classroom style lecture. Video length will depend on topic, anywhere from 5-15 minutes in length. I will always put as much value as I can into these videos to ensure full understanding of the topic and the length will reflect that. If desired I will personally mention your name or business in the videos I produce at your request. These videos will also be posted publicly so that everyone can benefit.\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Help support me in my goal of educating and inspiring new farmers and gardeners to create a small scale farming revolution!\u003c/p\u003e",

     "description": "I\u0027d love to be able to earn $500/month from my content creation in order to be able to upgrade my filming and recording equipment. I film using my Samsung S6 right now and I want to become more professional. I want to get a wireless microphone to have consistent sound quality, I want to get a gimble to stabilize my filming, eventually a nicer camera, and someday I want to hire an editor so that I can focus on just creating the content and not having to do the back end work of video creation. Each of these upgrades gets me closer to a professional channel that can have an even bigger impact on the world. \u003cbr\u003e",
