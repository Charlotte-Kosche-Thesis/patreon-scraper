    "summary": "Thanks for checking us out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts Rob Fort here, during the last two years I\u0027m getting requests to publish more videos like the Reel Screaming Kayaks Show and content on the outdoors that features the sport of kayak fishing.\u00a0Currently the NZ Kayak Fishing channel is produced with no financial support. So the goal is to answer the call and make more content on a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo film and travel has costs associated like\u00a0fuel, road user, vehicle maintenance, etc I don\u0027t have sponsorship for this plus there are also other charges. Then there is the ongoing running costs of all the camera gear including a drone and without these it would not be possible to produce these video clips to a high standard. On top of everything else there is the many hours spent editing which can be four days to produce an episode of the Reel Screaming Kayaks show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso I would like to share my knowledge and long term experience with the fans by producing regular videos with the goal to eventually do weekly productions.\u00a0The videos assist anglers, spear fishers and outdoor adventurers with information on the locations and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you get access to the content it will assist with achieving my goal and you will be part of my exclusive community by becoming a Patron to this channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can choose the level of contribution/support that starts at just $2.50 USD per month (around $3.35 NZD).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return you get more videos on a regular basis plus access to heaps of other content like ten one hour versions of the Reel Screaming Kayaks Show. As the support comes through this will increase. You will also have access to other exclusive videos and articles on subjects like setting up kayaks, tackle talk, fishing techniques, gear maintenance and care, product reviews, targeting species, how to process and cook seafood, fishing and diving hot spots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the budget increases the content will become more frequent plus I will be able to travel further in search of the best places to find adventure and more species.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you believe in what we contribute to the sport of kayak fishing and its community then get behind this and benefit from my exclusive content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for making it possible to live the dream of adventure in the great outdoors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRob Fort"
