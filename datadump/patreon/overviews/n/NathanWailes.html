     "about": "You can reach me at nathan.wailes@gmail.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up in New Jersey, USA, right across the river from Manhattan (New York City).  I was among the best students in my elementary and middle schools, and for high school I attended the prestigious \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen_County_Academies\"\u003eBergen County Academies\u2019\u003c/a\u003e Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology (abbreviated BCA, AAST), which exposed me to the work ethics of some of the smartest people in one of the richest counties in the nation.  I didn\u2019t find the classes interesting, and my parents were fairly hands-off (letting me do what I wanted), and I didn\u2019t care about making a lot of money, and so I didn\u2019t study hard to get the kind of GPA that would get me into a prestigious college. I instead spent all of my free time in high school playing computer games and learning a little programming so that I could customize the games I played.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTransitioning from high school to college was a transformational experience for me; I suddenly felt like I was handed the reins to my life in a way I hadn\u2019t felt before. I had a few different experiences in the year or so after I graduated from high school that combined to make me lose interest in computer games and instead focus on studying and social extra-curricular activities (sports, acting, dancing, and various other clubs).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI graduated from \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_College_of_New_Jersey\"\u003ethe College of New Jersey\u003c/a\u003e in 2009 (3.81 cumulative GPA, psychology and philosophy double-major).  I spent my first year out of school preparing for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and got a perfect score (180 out of 180), which would make Harvard Law School \u003ca href=\"http://harvard.lawschoolnumbers.com/stats\"\u003epretty much a sure thing\u003c/a\u003e and would make Yale Law \u003ca href=\"http://yale.lawschoolnumbers.com/stats\"\u003ea question of my work experience\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u2019t want to rush to take on $200,000 of debt, and so I spent a few years reading lots of (auto)biographies and just generally thinking about how to make a decision about what career to go into. I ultimately decided that the four skillsets I should focus on were: entrepreneurship, programming, finance, and mathematics (in roughly that order). For a year or two I was thinking I would try to copy Michael Burry\u2019s path to becoming a hedge fund manager, but I ultimately decided that the tech sector was less competitive than the financial sector and easier to raise money in for someone with unconventional credentials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think the most valuable attributes I have are:\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Because I\u0027m a generalist and self-taught in many subjects, I often approach problems from a different angle than others, which allows me to come up with ideas for solutions that hadn\u0027t occurred to the people around me.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 I was an only child with fairly hands-off parents, and so I was forced to become comfortable being on my own and having to decide things for myself. As a result, I\u0027m often comfortable trying new ways of doing things that other people are reluctant to try because those new approaches are strange.\u003cbr\u003e",
