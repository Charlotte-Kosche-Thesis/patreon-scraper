I have an aspiration that this hobby will be self-sufficient, so that I can continue to improve the content and quality without too much of a strain on my economy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe traditional ad supported platforms are great, but there is a disconnect between the producer and the consumer, where the medium of transaction is watching obnoxious ads to get to the content. Patreon offers a more direct connection, which also allows me to share my appreciation more targeted than \"thank you for watching ads before my content\" :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a long shopping list of things I would like to invest in to improve the quality and these are not directly tied to revenue, but it is a lot easier to justify buying new gear knowing that the community has contributed towards it. Here are some examples:\u003cbr\u003e* Dedicated streamer PC (my current PC is about to burst into flames when streaming Factorio mega base)\u003cbr\u003e* Professional video editing software (there are many free options, but I have learned to use LightWorks and would like to buy it)\u003cbr\u003e* Graphical designs (I want to improve the look and feel on various platforms to make it consistent and professional)\u003cbr\u003e* Green screen and professional lighting (for streaming I really want to improve the experience through better home studio setup)\u003cbr\u003e* Much more for projects that have not even conceived yet :)\u003cbr\u003e"
