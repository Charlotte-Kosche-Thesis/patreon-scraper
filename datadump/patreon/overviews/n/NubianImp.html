Please feel free to use she or they as my pronouns. I think a lot. I read a lot. I\u0027m in love with words and the meaning and the information they can convey. I am a verbal processor which means I need to talk a lot with others in order to help learn, understand and integrate. Good thing for me is many people have more words than opportunity. Sometimes I don\u2019t know what I think until I start to write or talk. Sometimes I seem incredibly positional, but I\u0027m also curious and perhaps a bit too generous. It can be problematic and uncomfortable sometimes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCulture has always sparked my flame - artistically, socially, behaviourally, materially, etc. I have worked with a range of cultural non-profits in a variety of roles over the past 30 years. I am known to be a compulsive and prolific Vancouver community events participant, patron, organizer, connector, and commentator over the last 20 years. I have six years of governmental social justice work on my resume, along with almost a decade and a half of municipal cultural facilitation and coordination. I read widely across subjects looking for connections not made with tin foil. My voice is heard online in targeted ways. At heart I am a sometimes actor, artist, and writer. I\u0027m currently in a time of transition. May we agree that those are enough receipts?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Black Life Matters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eI write and roll up my sleeves a lot online. I work behind the scenes and sometimes in the light. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany people wish to recognize and support my voice. This is a mechanism.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of working on my first novel, I am working on the manuscript for #SometimesMyVancouverLooksLikeThis. Other words are also demanding to be made manifest outside of my head. I am working on more texts. I am planning more art projects. I am pondering the next iteration of my co-created internationally toured art installation, \"The Queeriodic Table.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to release all of these into the world.\nYou can help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLAND \u0026amp; ANCESTRY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eI live, work and play on the unceded Coast Salish lands of the Musqueam, S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh and Tsleil-Waututh peoples. Vancouver, BC Canada. I was born in the Whiteness of Alberta. And that includes the snow. Born on the 1876 Treaty 6 land of what is now known as the Enoch Cree Nation; 16 Alberta First Nations were absorbed. I am the first person in several generations of both of my parents, to be born outside of the colonized lands that are now known as Guyana (which is at the Northern tip of South America; immediately North of Brazil). Currently the government recognizes around 67,000 Aboriginal people from 16 different groups. Interestingly, it is the only South American nation in which English is the official language. I have no idea where my people were snatched from. That\u2019s why I hold an exclamation mark in front of my name. To remind me of my African ancestry and the dozens of click languages. Languages that I do not speak. I am part of a stolen people settled on stolen land.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
