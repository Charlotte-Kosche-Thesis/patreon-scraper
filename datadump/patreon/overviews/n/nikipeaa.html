You may know me from my IG @NikiPeaa or my FB Page @MissNikipea. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California but Im currently residing in Australia. I have an absolute passion for Travel. Ive been to 11 Countries outside the U.S and counting. Ive been modeling since the age of 18 and I am very into health, fitness and fashion. I was not always the best at Make-up but I think practice makes perfect. Ive created an Instagram Page @NikiPeaBeauty to showcase some of my favorite looks \u0026amp; favorite products. I plan to start posting Beauty Blogs on my youtube Channel ( Cruelty-Free Products only). At the moment I am saving for better lighting equipment \u0026amp; a better camera. Not only do I love being in front of the Camera, I love taking photos as well. Im still practicing but learning everyday. I\u0027ve created an Instagram @Npeaphoto to showcase my photography work (skills hehe). Photography has been something I have always loved in front and behind the scenes :) ! \u00a0Ive been Pesacatarian for over 10 years (only seafood) and since July 2016 I decided to go Vegan. I went Vegan more for Health reasons then I learned more about how Animals were treated and I decided to help spread the word, I made an Instagram called Vegan_Edu (which is still a project in the making) to help educate people that eating animal products is not okay and it also leads to Global Warming. Using Instagram \u0026amp; Facebook as social Media Platforms, I feel that now a days they crack down on women who have images that are \"too revealing\" or \"too sexy.\" Often their pages with large followings are now getting deleted. I made my Patreon page to share exclusive photos with you guys while expressing myself freely without censorship. Content posted here will not be posted anywhere else and for your eyes only (#freethenipple). Subscribing to me will also help me create better content, provide outfits + cost for shoots, help pay for different cameras \u0026amp; editing software and more videos and more photoshoots around the world! I will be uploading content multiple times a week. Im open to suggestions on what you guys want to see, feel free to send me a message :) Scroll down for a few different options to Subscribe \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove xo,\u003cbr\u003eNiki Pea\u003cbr\u003eP.S Im starting a Live stream to chat with all of my followers.
