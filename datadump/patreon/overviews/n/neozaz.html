Since launching our very first podcast in 2008 our shows have been downloaded over 4 million times all around the world. We\u0027ve created long running series, specials, live events and launched a non-profit charity - all through friends having fun and without any sponsors, advertisers or funding to influence our content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn mid 2015 we launched our Patreon campaign and for the first time 2016 we could truly call ourselves \"Listener supported\" - our generous Patreon supporters kept the lights on at NEOZAZ! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith our current operation costs covered we\u0027re ready to grow, and with that we\u0027re ready to give more than ever before to all of our Patreon supporters. Now all Patreon subscribers at all levels will get access to content created exclusively for Patreon, starting is \"SWIC Extra Minutes\". After each regular episode recording of \"Star Wars In Character\" we keep the recording going and revisit of the highlights (and even better, the lowlights) of that episode and share it exclusively with our Patreon Supporters. Next up is \"Sudden Death Trivia\". The series starts with unknown number of questions shared with a unknown number of players. Each player gets a shot at the questions one at a time - when they get one wrong, their done. Contestants rotate until the last question - that no one ever sees coming - is answered. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat content is just that start, at each level of support the rewards increase. More exclusive content, early episode releases, and our \"Print of the Month\" - a new SWIC inspired exclusive print available digitally and physically at different levels of support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking our our Patreon campaign and thank you for your continued support in everything we do at \u003ca href=\"http://www.neozaz.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNEOZAZ.com\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e"
