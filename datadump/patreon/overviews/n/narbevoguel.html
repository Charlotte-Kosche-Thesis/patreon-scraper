I am, as you may know, NarbeVoguel and I\u0027m from Venezuela. In case you haven\u0027t heard or don\u0027t know, this place has become horrible for the past 18 years, progressively getting worse. My plan is to start a new life elsewhere, and make a living, until I can be stable enough to help my family get the medicines and food they need and overall to have a better lifestyle and helping them get out as well when I get a stable life. Thing is, I\u0027m lacking the funds, and ever since my boss left the country, he has been paying less and less attention to paying us (his employees) on time, so basically I\u0027ve been out of pay for over 2 months unable to buy what little food I can find, but because of how the laws in my country work, which make it literally impossible for me to acquire the US Dollars I need to buy the necessary tickets to leave, I can\u0027t even gather the funds here. Long story short, my government, self proclaimed socialist but is actually a disguised communism, has a monopoly over foreign currencies, purposefully obstructing access to civilians like myself to dollars or euros, as such, people who do have access to them (via illegal means), sell them on what we call the \"Black Market\", and the exchange rate is insanely high, unaffordable (to give a mere example, I make 300k my currency [which is Bol\u00edvares Fuertes, Bs/BsF for short] a month, and each dollar is worth 52128 my currency [as of november 10th, 2017], which means that if I needed $1500 to travel, well, I\u0027d need over 78 MILLION in my currency, and by making 300k a month, well, \"impossible\" might not be enough to describe it, heh).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe reason we wanna move\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecause the situation here, as I explained above, got progressively worse and is reaching a point where it\u0027s hard to live, we hardly have anything to eat (food is scarce), we can\u0027t get medicines (because they\u0027re also scarce) in fact, I\u0027ll give you a little episode of my life, my dad had a CVA/stroke years ago, and ever since then, he suffers from Parkinson\u0027s disease now, we could easily keep it under control with his medicines, but ever since this whole medicine scarcity started, we all had a hard time moving him around, and if it weren\u0027t a friend of my brother\u0027s brining his medicine from Italy, well, we could have lost him... and now with the totalitarian government trying to make a new law to turn this into a communist country, North Korea style, we are in a rush to leave ASAP.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to move to Chile with my friend, and for that I need an average of $3000 dollars to afford both our tickets and the cash we need to move around, find a place, and live a few days while either one of us or both of us get our legal papers to be able to work there. We\u0027re both in a really difficult situation, so I wanna help her out with that, and that\u0027s the reason I\u0027m trying to get the money for both of us. Why so much? The plane tickets [as of september 2017] are worth $800 or a bit more for each one of us, plus the money we need to rent a place and settle in, and we need to at least have $400 in cash for each one of us so immigration lets us in and don\u0027t deport us back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you wanna learn more about what I just explained, here are a few links of interest:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eSimple video explaining in full detail what I just said (except the dolar value is outdated since this video is from august, but the foundation is still the same)[Credits to Vox.com]:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1gUR8wM5vA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1gUR8wM5vA\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGeneral explanation: \u003ca href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/05/venezuela-worst-economic-crisis-wrong-170501063130120.html\"\u003ehttp://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/05...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUSD Issue (only has dollar value up to september th 2017, as of today, the value is 23870 BsF per dollar, and increases every day): \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy_of_the_Nicol\u00e1s_Maduro_government#Currency\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy_of_...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFood and Medicines being scarce: \u003ca href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/10/24/venezuelas-humanitarian-crisis/severe-medical-and-food-shortages-inadequate-and\"\u003ehttps://www.hrw.org/report/2016/10/24/venezuelas-...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRecent political conflicts: \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Venezuelan_protests\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Venezuelan_pro...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eSo if you wanna lend a hand in our humble goal, we\u0027d greatly appreciate it!
