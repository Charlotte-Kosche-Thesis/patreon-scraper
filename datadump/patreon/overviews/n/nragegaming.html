We started streaming\nbecause we had been lingering around Twitch for a few years, and we figured,\nhey were playing video games all day, why not share our joys and excitement\nwith other people too! We also started streaming to make friends with the same\ninterests, and so far we\u2019ve made a lot of really good friends! We\u2019ve both been\ngaming for about 20 years now, so we have pretty good knowledge of past and\ncurrent video games.\u00a0We really enjoy streaming and want to continue streaming full time. So far we\u0027ve been blessed with such an amazing community and wonderful helpers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSome other info about us,\nTom is 27 and Sonya 33 . We\u2019ve been together for 5 years, friends for 7.5 years and now married since June 2015! We met on World of Warcraft, and Tom\nmoved all the way from New Hampshire to Michigan to be with his two favorite\ngirls!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have a 9 year old\ndaughter named Bri who occasionally pops on stream to say hi to everyone.\nAlthough Bri doesn\u2019t look sick, she actually is. Bri was not premature, but she\nwas born with a lot of health problems and spent the first 6 months of her life\nin the hospital. She now suffers from Chronic Renal Failure (Kidney Disease), Grand\nMal seizures (Epilepsy) and she\u2019s Cognitive Impaired. So life can be really\nrough on her sometimes. Doctors expect her to need a transplant around the age\nof 10-13 years old and we are also keeping our fingers crossed that her\nseizures will eventually stop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBefore you consider donating\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, please know that we will be using the money to pay bills and keep our stream updated with equipment and other needs.
