    "summary": "Assalamu alaikum.\u00a0 I send you the greetings of Peace!\u00a0  My name is Nathan Richmond Hoag.  I am \noriginally from Pennsylvania in the USA, but spent the majority of my \nlife in California.  I became a Muslim in 2010 after a 20 year journey \nin search of the truth.  I was taken on a long journey, around the USA, \naround the world and in and out of many cultures and environments to get\n to to where I am today.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 I left America to get married \nin Indonesia and then proceeded with my wife to Cambodia to teach \nthere.  It was at this time that I became interested in pursuing a \ndeeper knowledge of Islam and all that it entails.  I applied for the \nUniversity of Madina in 2014 after learning about the great benefit that\n could be had studying there.  Three years went by and I was finally \naccepted.  It is very rare for someone of my age to be accepted to study\n there, so it was an opportunity that I was very fortunate to be \noffered.  I also do not have a university education so this is a chance \nthat I have never had before to gain one.  I have started in the \nUniversity now and it is an amazing place filled with just about every \nnationality on Earth.  We are being taught and able to learn in the \nblessed city of Madina about the real tenets of Islam, peace, \ncompassion, and justice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy wife and I were blessed with the \nbirth of our baby boy last year and he has gone with us on all of our \nadventures and moves and we are proud that he will be able to grow up \nand be part of the next generation of people who have a wholesome view \nof the world and respect for all in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have created this Patreon page because I am starting a YouTube page where I will make videos detailing life here and showing people that it is never too late to pursue an education and to go after your dreams.\u00a0 I also want people to see and know that Islam is a simple religion, in this day and age we have so many people hung up on thinking they are \"on the right path\", and this other group \"is not\".\u00a0 In reality, most of us are just trying our best to be good people and in the long run, that is the real key.\u00a0 My goal is also to start an education program for new Muslims, to help them know how to follow the balanced middle path.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother reason I am seeking assistance is for general expenses to help support my family. The students from the USA do not have any \nassociation or group that helps us officially in any way unlike other \ncountries.  As students we only receive a small stipend and are too busy\n with our lessons and outside lectures etc. to have time to find any \ngainful employment.  I also have some medical condition that makes it \ndifficult for me to ever be rested but I am thankful that I am able to \nget to my classes and pursue my education.\u00a0 The normal \ncourse of study here is a six year plan.  Two years in the preparatory \nArabic institute, then a four year Bachelors degree course in one of the main \ncolleges.\u00a0 Any \ndocumentation needed to prove my student status is available on request.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am \neternally grateful to anyone who can assist me in this and if you\n cannot assist financially your goodwill and blessings are more than \nwelcome!"
