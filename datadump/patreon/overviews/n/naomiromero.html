I am proud to say that I have done work for Illumination, Nick Jr, Facebook, BOOM! Studios, WeLoveFine, and more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon, I am hoping to find more time to create what I love! This way, I don\u0027t need to fill every weekend or day with work so I can still make personal art (the art that you see me posting!).\u00a0 I will also have more time to design more products, including my Anxiety Fox brand and my \"characters as dogs\" series!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon? It is like a tip jar where you say \"Hi, I like your stuff! I want to support it!\". Tip jars are cool but with Patreons, you get goodies for showing your support! If you ever wanted to learn how I created my pieces, get art, and see behind the scenes stuff, and want cool products before anybody else, Patreon may be for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will always create art and share it to all of you, Patreon or not! That is my promise to you. With this nifty website, I am hoping to create more art with your support! Whether you decide to support or not, I cannot thank you all enough for showing your love for my work and giving me the inspiration to continue to create every day! :)"
