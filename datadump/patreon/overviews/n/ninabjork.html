    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eThank you so much for making your way to my Patreon page. I have\u00a0some really big plans for the future and\u00a0I\u00a0am asking you to be a\npart of it all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy intention since the day I began making art was\u00a0to create art that makes people aware about that there is something more\nbehind the painting. I first off al want my paintings to create harmony and\nmake you feel good, but I also want my art to tell you a\u00a0story.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am so\u00a0fortunate to have fans like you! People\nwho are willing to help fortify me and be a part of who I am\u00a0and what I do.Your support means much to me! I have ideas that will entertain you in so many ways.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to create art. How am I going to enjoy what I do, even more than I do already? By inviting you to accompany me on my journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, it\u0027s hard to be an artist and even more so,  being a freeminded one, that is to paint what\u0027s on your mind rather than following mainstream .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. As my supporter, you\u0027ll have front seat access to the projects I am busy with before Exhibition Day.\u003cbr\u003e2. You\u0027ll see my paintings here before they appear on Facebook, Instagram or anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e3.You\u0027ll be able to follow me through the ups and downs of this jumpy art road and together we\u0027ll be able to celebrate the fruits of the journey.\u003cbr\u003e4.You\u0027ll be able to see how I build up my paintings and you\u0027ll also have the opportunity to ask me questions along the way.\u003cbr\u003e5. You will have the opportunity to get discount before anyone else. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been taking steps to create a business in order to make my dream come true. I\u0027d be so happy if you would like to join me in this endeavour. If your artistic talent is expressed through music,  then  financial reward comes when people listen to you. However artists don\u0027t receive the same recompense. I am sure you enjoy listening to music? Maybe you\u0027d like to see my art?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Me\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in Stockholm, Sweden in a small apartment with my husband. We enjoy living a minimalistic lifestyle, however, my artwork needs space. My dream is to be able to rent a  studio/ gallery to work in and also to show my paintings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0 like travelling,  and in so doing, take inspiration from the beauty of creation, I would love to make an Art book of my paintings. Another aim is to publish a children\u0027s book with my illustrations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am using English in order for all of my friends to be able to follow me on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome! and have a first hand peek at what\u0027s going on in my studio.\u003cbr\u003e/Nina\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

My inspiration comes from within. I often have humans, animals and nature in my paintings trough them I express a story I want to tell. My paintings is insightful, Art with a history and a purpose. I paint to encourage and create a resting place for the eyes but I also paint art that challenges for reflection. A face that have a history, a landscape and the people living there, a \"awerness\" of something more... behind the scene. \u003cbr\u003eI shift the teqniques becouse I want to challenge myself, sometimes I make realistic paintings and sometimes impressionistic or expressionistic paintings.
