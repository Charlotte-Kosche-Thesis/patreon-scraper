    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThanks\u003c/strong\u003e to people willing to part with a portion of their meaningless fiat currency, the Nihilist Podcast Network will be able to continue to \"thrive\" and \"create content\" and \"make people laugh,\" if such words can be considered meaningful. (They cannot.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider designating some portion of your currency to supporting this endeavor. Your contribution will be used to support the editing and production of NPN until such a time as the podcast is forced to end due to apocalypse. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bit of history behind the Nihilist Podcast Network:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Nihilist Podcast Network was first created in 1834 by a group of \nAmerican pioneers who needed a collective way to come together and \nexpress their innermost desperation and hopelessness. Inspired by \nwriters such as S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, the weary travelers had regular \nmeetings during their arduous journey westward, towards the Northwest \nterritories. However, one day as the pioneers were discussing their \npodcast network at a trading post in Fort Kearny, a fur trapper named \nBessie Gale now famously said,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing ye folks talk for a while now, and by \nthe bye, I can\u2019t help but notice that the title yer got is a bag of \nnails. Podcasts ain\u2019t been invented yet, but yer sure as a gun know \nthat. And the very concept of a podcast network is fit to be so foreign \nto a simple fur trader\u2019s ears- like me- that she might be too flummoxed \nto apprehend what in God\u2019s good creation yer talking about.\u201d\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003eIt was from that moment on that the Nihilist Podcast Network became\u2026 \nthe Nihilist Podcast Network. It would continue as a robust and thriving\n podcast network until World War 2, which effectively ended all podcast \nproduction in the United States, as factories, workers, and able-bodied \nmen and women contributed to the war effort. It seemed that the future \nof NPN couldn\u2019t be more in jeopardy when tragedy struck in Berlin. The \nfounder of the Nihilist Podcast Network, former-pioneer-now-soldier \nDallas Shapiro III, was severely wounded in combat. Faced with his own \nmortality, he was unable to cope with that reality, fled Germany, and \nstarted praying to the local god, Marduk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFacing budgetary constraints, and what was thought to be the \nimpending nuclear apocalypse, the Nihilist Podcast Network\u2019s skeleton \ncrew reported every week on the state of the world, local happenings, \nand the threat of nuclear annihilation, in This Week In Nihilism. In \n1992, at the request of listeners, the Nihilist Podcast Network acquired\n Staring Into The Endless Void: 30 Minutes Of Quiet Weeping, with Jean \nPaul Beaumont.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce the internet became widely available in households, and podcasts\n were officially invented, the Nihilist Podcast Network could finally \nrelease its content using the technology and infrastructure that the \npioneering founders envisioned. No more was the audio quality marred by \ngroaning oxen and rickety wagon wheels, no more wandering from saloon to\n saloon looking in vain for a wifi connection, no more staring up into \nthe stars by the campfire wondering when microphones will be invented, \nor what they even are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2016, network executives decided that, since all of our endeavors \nare ultimately fruitless, it makes no difference whether or not new \npodcasts were brought under the umbrella of the Nihilist Podcast \nNetwork. The collection of podcasts now featured in the Nihilist Podcast\n Network weekly podcast now included podcasts about food, travel, and \nlife. Some had no point, and some had no meaning. The bottom line is: \nThe Nihilist Podcast Network was back in the big time again, though \nnetwork executives realize that assigning any real meaning or value to \nthe podcast is a naive and fruitless gesture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nStill, in keeping with modern custom, they invite you to share in the\n wide array of podcasters and programs featured on their network, with \ngreat gratitude and humility."
