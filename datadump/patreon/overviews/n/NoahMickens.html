    "summary": "Hey there. I\u0027m Noah Mickens. I\u0027ve been producing and performing in shows in Portland, OR and elsewhere for about 20 years. You may have heard about some of these: Wanderlust Circus, Societas Insomnia, Bogville, Someday Lounge, Nequaquam Vacuum, Batty\u0027s Hippodrome, Blackstar Rising, White Album Christmas, MegaBounce!!, 2Gyrlz Performative Arts, The Umbrella Festival, The EnterActive Language Festival, The 999 Eyes ov Endless Dream, and so on. Not to say that I created any of these by myself, of course, but I was a driving force behind them all. It was an excellent run, and I\u0027m proud to have done it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m pretty much done with all that, however; thanks to a combination of reasons that I\u0027ll likely address in writing at some point. You may have heard about some of these, too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomething else I\u0027ve been doing, since around 2003 of thereabouts, is writing arts and culture journalism for various magazines and websites and newspapers. I think the first one I wrote was that cover story about dancer and choreographer Linda Austin for Cue Magazine, which I still haven\u0027t been able to get my hands on. If I ever do find it, I\u0027ll post it here on this Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, I dug up a bunch of these articles and published them in a book called \"Scatterbrain.\" I didn\u0027t want that book to be a vast 1000-page tome; so I picked a selection that I felt hung together well in terms of range and quality, sprinkled in a few of my favorite song lyrics (another thing I\u0027ve been writing for a long time without ever particularly hyping it to the public), and sent it to the press. People seem to be really liking that book - it\u0027s selling rather well, folks are writing to tell me how much they like it, and I\u0027m happy that this old material is seeing the light of day. I don\u0027t know that any of this is really available anymore, outside of this book; and together it paints a picture of a certain time in recent history when the city of Portland and I went through a lot of incredible shit together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I keep finding more of it, is the thing, and I want to get all of it out there without shifting my attention to compiling and promoting a second book while I\u0027m still actively involved with the first one. So I started up this here Patreon as an outlet for existing writing that I want to release, as well as new stuff that I\u0027ve been writing recently and haven\u0027t shared with much of anyone. If you liked the Scatterbrain book (or if the $20 price tag was too much for you to spend all at once), perhaps you can drop a few bucks each month to read this stuff. For that matter, if you like this stuff, perhaps you\u0027d like to buy the book (available now at \u003ca href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/ScatterbrainNoah.)\"\u003ewww.tinyurl.com/ScatterbrainNoah.)\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, I\u0027m putting everything up here for free, so you can read it and decide what (if anything) you feel like paying. Pretty soon, I\u0027ll start putting up some patron-only material, but it didn\u0027t seem like a good way to get started.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJesus, it\u0027s 3:30am and tomorrow is Shaina\u0027s birthday. I\u0027d better get some shuteye. I wish much love to those who love me, and continued mediocrity to those who\u0027ve worked to tear me down. It\u0027s a beautiful world out here, far away from the rainy old city I called home from 1996-2017. You ought to join me some time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5000. - N."
