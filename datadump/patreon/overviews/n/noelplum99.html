To do this takes time, both in terms of scoping out the video and then recording and editing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy time is precious: I work 42 hours a week as a professional firefighter, with a young baby boy and a wife with a reduced work commitment. As a result the time I devote to YouTube HAS to pay to continue. If it does not then, sadly, that time will have to be spent earning money in another way. That is something I desperately want to avoid because I enjoy making videos and enjoy the exchanges that result.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, with the help of my existing patrons my output has already seen improvements and looking forward I hope to make my channel a place where more and more people will go to be entertained, challenged and also to find good debate amongst the comments section.\u003cbr\u003e\nYour pledges make that possible because your pledges allow me to spend considerably more time taking the kernel of an idea for a video and fully realising it as a project, rather than rushing it out in an hour and a half because that is all that I can justify.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128,100,162);\"\u003eWhat is in it for me?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGood question (though I asked it on your behalf so don\u0027t get too smug!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI ask for pledges on a \u0027per video\u0027 basis. As a matter of principal I will only ever set as pledged those videos that justify your support and never more than four pledged videos in any month. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eAny other output during a month will be unpledged.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAll patrons get access to my patron-only videos. These are something I take seriously and, because I actually ENJOY making them, you can be assured they will be a regular feature of the patreon feed. These videos detail future plans (upcoming videos), additional subjects that I am not minded to discuss publically via my channel and thought-provoking additional content that runs alongside some of my YouTube videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons who pledge $4 (or more) per video get early access to my planned videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons who pledge $8 (or more) per video get the right to ask me whatever they like and I will give my thoughts in the next Patron-only video. If you enjoy my output and have questions to ask regarding something I have covered in a video this is potentially a very useful thing. It is also not a one-off, you can ask me to clarify or give my thoughts as often as you wish (within reason).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eif you have gotten this far, thank you for reading whether or not you then choose to pledge - though getting this far means you are a sufficiently bloviating windbag, nine times out of ten, that my channel will be like manna from heaven ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
