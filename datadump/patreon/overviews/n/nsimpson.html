Through an evolving interest in being the best I could be in a few areas - I continue to learn a few things that I hope will be of value to others. I don\u0027t have all of the answers but I do love to problem solve, relate distinct areas of physiology, medicine \u0026amp; society and tie together concepts with depth and broader understanding.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"\u003c/strong\u003eOver the last four years that I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to work with him, Nick has played a critical role in my athletic development. Nick pushed me to work harder, showed me how to move smarter and encouraged me to train with intent and greater focus. I became stronger, more skillful and more confident in my ability than ever before. However, more important than the personal bests and medals of success achieved under Nick\u0027s innovative training plan is the value and strategic approach he brings to recovery and lifestyle. Nick\u0027s vast scope of knowledge, constant learning and passion in all fields related to human performance, whether athletic or health based, makes him the ultimate resource; to this day Nick is who I trust the most when it comes to maximizing not only my athletic performance but also my human potential.\u003cstrong\u003e\"\u003c/strong\u003e - \u003cstrong\u003eHelena Hlas\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgur.com/SBGE2IW\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/SBGE2IW.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I am not generic. And I am not an easy client. My body needs a bunch of things, in a unique order, under constantly changing rules. I have 2 auto immune issues, a family history of hypothyroidism and extreme anxiety/depression and I am recovered anorexic/bulimic...all of which make my system very, very special. Oh yeah - and I am professional athlete, actor and stunt person so I need to be able to move, act and perform, all the time, in amazing ways.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eI am picky about who I take training or nutritional advice from. I went to school, got a great education, had a fun career as a strength coach and personal trainer. I am not a naive or an uneducated population. I have had many a coaches tell me all kinds of things over the years. Nicholas is the first person to look at my system as a whole. Not only in the framework or sport performance, but also for me as a human being with a life after sport. He is happy to work WITH me and my doctors to help fill in the gaps between what they have determined and what he has seen in his clients. He isn\u0027t afraid to make mistakes, learn from them, ask for feedback, tweak, tweak again, and again...until he figures it out. This guy has mad patience, a huge lovely brain that is basically an encyclopedia AND a huge heart.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eI am excited about our journey together. I am looking ahead with hope. I know that the changes will be small, sustainable and made with my long term well being in mind.\" \u003cstrong\u003e- Kelsey Andries\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/FjehKXP.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\"Nick Simpson truly saved my life. After over training and just simply doing too much for most of my life I had developed many symptoms that inhibited my lifestyle and health.  I was not sleeping well, getting frequent UTI and Kidney infections (undiagnosed), Losing my hair, my mouth was always dry, my moods where erratic, I had kidney pain, (back pain), my joints hurt all the time, I was itchy around my kidneys to the point of scratching myself raw, my breast hurt all the time, I did not enjoy being around people, some days I could sleep for 20 hours and feel like I could sleep for more until I crashed and ended up in the hospital.  I had many symptoms that my family doctor diagnosed as pre menopausal. After many doctors and blood test, EKG, after urine samples, hormone tests, ultra sounds, X-rays and drugs. I met the \u201c Best thing to happen to me and my health\u201d, I met Nick Simpson.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNick first started coming to see my husband for treatment and soon we all became close friends. Nick programmed for me, and helped me recover and figure out what I needed to eat, and take in order to sleep, in order to not have night sweats, in order to not loose my hair.  The list of my symptoms was long, but Nick took the time to educate me and teach me why and how to make myself feel better. He has helped me with my long list of symptoms and continues to send me material to read about things that can help my condition. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf anyone in my family needs nutritional, medical help I will always go to Nick first. Before taking drugs, before running to the doctor I run to Nick Simpson.
