Both art forms are my passion, and being able to make my living off of them would mean that I would have the time and ability to hone my writing skills even more, as well as being able to share it all with my Patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can expect to find short stories, drafts, novel work, as well as worldbuilding posts and the occasional art piece that is linked to my writing. Some of my content will be NSFW in nature but that will not be the only thing posted nor will it appear in everything that I write.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you put even $1 towards my Patreon I will be endlessly grateful and you\u0027ll be able to get tons of wonderful material as a thank you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
