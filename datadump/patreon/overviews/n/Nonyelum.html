It\u0027s not even about finding your true self or about making you get up from your bed and get your act together. This is not fiction. This is me. What I think! What I feel! What I see! What I experience! Writing is my healing, writing is my therapy. And I love it that way. If at any point, this changes and I start writing on other topics, that\u0027ll be fine. But I don\u0027t ever want to stop. Making money from something that renews me would be beautiful. Perfection! And I\u0027ll need the money just to, you know, live, survive and eat. \u003cbr\u003eBut more seriously, I\u0027ll need the money to promote myself in every way possible. Instagram promotions, Facebook ads, the whole shebang. I really want to go all out with this thing. I want to grow my social media following and create a blog. And through out this process, create a community. Maybe I could tell \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e stories, as well as mine. Writing as a hobby is fun, but making money from it would be ultimately fulfilling. \u003cbr\u003eYou can always count on my undying gratitude.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Complex Minded Female,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNonye"
