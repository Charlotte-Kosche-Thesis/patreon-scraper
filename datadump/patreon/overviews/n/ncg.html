To make transparent an \u003cem\u003eentire\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0industry that most people go about their lives being mostly if not completely unaware of? \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYikes.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e So we got to thinking: \"Where do we start? What do people want and need to know that they don\u0027t already? How the hell can we make this fun?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll pretty valid questions! Let\u0027s throw that first one out of the way up front; We have a vision:\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the end of 2018, we plan on being in our own space, hosting events, running a blog, and broadcasting regular podcasts and streaming.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that the video game community in Des Moines, the surrounding cities and, hell, the whole state, is underdeveloped. One thing at a time won\u0027t change things fast enough to keep up with the rapid evolution of the video games industry, so we\u0027re going to tackle \u003ci style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eall of it\u003c/i\u003e.

A grassroots campaign to thrust an entire culture under a spotlight is awesome, but then, what do you tell people? What can you show them?

We want people to know about subjects like what it takes to make a game, the people that make them, the up-and-coming world of eSports, the Indie scene, local players, developers, organizations, the different demographics in games...really, we want to cover \u003cem\u003eeverything\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eLearning! \u003c/em\u003eTrust us, it\u0027s more fun than it sounds (especially about games). However, getting educated in the culture of video games is a hard enough venture to start, let alone knowing where it\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003esafe\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to start. \u003cem\u003eThough most are not\u003c/em\u003e, online communities in games, due to the people within them, \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e be unnecessarily critical, harsh, and toxic, which is a major problem that we will try to fix at every opportunity. We also know that from the outside, the video game landscape can seem too complex, even intimidating to get into.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are going to ensure that everyone feels comfortable learning about, competing in, and playing games. We\u0027re here to teach, to help, to make a safe space for gamers, and to have fun doing it. We don\u0027t tolerate bullying, belittling or any offensive language (keep it at home, people).\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe believe that a healthy community is such because the people it\u0027s made of understand and respect each other, and expect to be treated the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe believe in NCG.
