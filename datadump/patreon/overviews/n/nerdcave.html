    "summary": "What is the Nerd Cave? It is simple really we are three best friends that love talking about all things nerdy. We started out with The Nerd Cave Podcast three years ago. We have grown a lot since that time by moving to Youtube. We started making let\u0027s plays, reaction videos, reviews, top 5\u0027s and more and fell in love with the platform.\u00a0All that being said we enjoy making content for our growing community. We want to be able to provide entertainment while building friendships with all of our awesome viewers/listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why we have two different parts: Nerd Cave and Nerd Cave Gaming. This will allow us to have more focus on both channels. If you want pop culture news and reviews check out the Nerd cave. If gaming is more your focus then Nerd Cave Gaming is your one stop shop for let\u0027s plays, news, reacts and much more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what tier you support us here on Patreon, know that your subscription helps us produce better content for you, get better equipment, do more community focused events, go to more conventions and overall grow and reach more awesome people.\u00a0So whether you just give us a one simple dollar a month, or subscribe for early access to the podcasts, or even generous enough for one of our higher, premium tiers, know that you\u2019re part of the engine that makes the Nerd Cave go.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the age of the Nerd and no better place to spend it with us here at the Nerd Cave.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
