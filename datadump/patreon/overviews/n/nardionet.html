We review games, we also review anime, manga and books as well. We also interview people who we find interesting. Most of them are game devs and cosplayers, but we have covered others (authors, owners of small businesses) and we hope to continue this in the future.  There\u0027s a lot more we want to do, and that\u0027s part of why we need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe need your support.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\nWe\u0027re here today to ask for your help so we can make Nardio a better site and ultimately make this our full time job. After doing Nardio for several years we have made zero profits against the expenses of maintaining the site, getting the games, traveling to events and paying for the movies and streaming services. Despite growing our followers on Twitter and Facebook, we\u0027ve just been in the red in terms of income. This is where you come in. Nardio has been a labor of love for a long time now, but to really grow and expand it we need you to believe in us and offer ongoing monthly support as a Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eFor you becoming a Patron means making a monthly contribution towards the site. Be it $1.00, $5.00, $10.00, etc. Every month you will have the amount you donate taken out of your account. Think of it like your Netflix subscription.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eWe then use that donated money to fund the website\u0027s operation costs, such as buying content to review and helping us get new equipment, etc. This will provide us with the freedom not to worry constantly about rent or bills and instead focus on providing you with more and better content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOver time with your help, we\u0027ll be able to make Nardio the site we always knew it could be and dedicate ourselves to it full time. With enough support hopefully we can hire some writers and work to expand the content and scope of what Nardio is.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv

We really try to cover all of the aspects of a game in the reviews. Well...as long as it doesn\u0027t suck. As we were reading other game review sites - especially those that focus on mobile - we noticed a lot of them were almost like carbon copies of each other. On top of that it seemed like the reviewers only played games for 30 minutes. For us, reviewing a game means playing it until the end or putting in the hours to get the full experience. Not only does this provide you, the audience, with a better understanding of the game, it is also a way for us to show our support to indies. And if we hate a game or show, well you know we put the time into it to at least try to like it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe like to consider ourselves an indie evangelists. While we do review games from the big companies on occasion, our main focus is to bring attention to the indie game developers, authors and others that other sites might not cover. We want to share their work with you not only through reviews but interviews and even promoting their games at events. With your support, we eventually want to promote them in larger venues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCosplay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://nardio.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/honeylemonBW.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love cons, cosplay and cosplayers! We go to as many events as we can and take you along for the ride. We pride ourselves on introducing talented cosplayers to the world and sharing their stories. We also make sure to have them share their advice and wisdom to all the future cosplayers who look up to them. Along the way we have been lucky enough to make friends with them, be accepted into the community and even cosplay a little ourselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCheck out two of the interviews we have done with talented cosplayers below:\u003cbr\u003eVSol Cosplay as Korra\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0DTiJsY7qns?rel=0\u0026amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRebecca as Jeice\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S__WUMlS6Pc?rel=0\u0026amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease try and help us with our dream.
