But what is Patreon anyway? Patreon is sort of like crowd-funding, except it\u0027s subscription based. Patreon has been around since 2013 and has enabled many creators and artists like myself to continue producing new work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I creating? \u003c/strong\u003eI shoot a variety of styles, including boudoir, fine art nudes, and other creative concepts (for example, projection art, body paint, etc). When I asked for feedback about what kinds of shoots people would like to see from me on Patreon, I was happy to get an overwhelming response that you guys would like to continue seeing a combination of those things - encouraging me to continue creating all of the things I am passionate about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get for helping out?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange for your support, you can receive access to full sets including NSFW images that can\u0027t be shared on other platforms. While I post a lot of my work for free on social media, there are many NSFW images that can\u0027t be shared on the main image based platforms, like Instagram and Facebook. Many sets are also simply too large to share in their entirety elsewhere - so as a Patron you will have access to exclusive images. Rewards tiers also include access to instax, prints, NSFW selfies, and my NSFW Snapchat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you become a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eShoots can be expensive - buying outfits and props, renting locations, taking time off from my day job to shoot, paying for gas to get to locations, etc. As well - I often collaborate with photographers whose work I enjoy which means I usually do not get paid for shoots. Supporting my modeling and photography ensures that I can keep creating art to share with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you in advance for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e"
