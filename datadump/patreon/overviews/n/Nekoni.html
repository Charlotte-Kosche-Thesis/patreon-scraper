(matching my 8 piece set) You can chose for your pose to be released as part of that pose set, in which case you\u0027ll be accredited on the file, or you can keep it all to yourself! Your pose choice must be \u0027safe for work\u0027 (not overtly sexual),and 3 characters or fewer. If you sign up for this tier too late for me to complete the pose before my release time, I\u0027ll send you the pose personally, (and if you choose to have it released to everyone else, it\u0027ll be saved for the next release)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
