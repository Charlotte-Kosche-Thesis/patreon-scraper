    "summary": "Aanii/Hello,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my patreon page. Nice to meet you. Little bit about me. I\u0027m an Indigenous artist and poet, this page is for my comic book projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve an ongoing series called Navriss which I\u0027m always working on with the hopes of getting published in print. The story is about an Indigenous man who wakes up dead and finds himself standing before his tombstone in the afterlife. To make matters worse Navriss has no memories of his life except one; he was loved and loved someone when he died. With this knowledge he leaves the graveyard and seeks out his memories in the hopes of discovering who t was that he was loved by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also working on a graphic novel, which is part of a trilogy of sci-fi novels, actually it\u0027s the middle book in the trilogy. That\u0027s right the first and last books will be traditional novels with the middle being a graphic novel. I\u0027ve been told that my writing has a very cinematic feel to it, and that it works well with comic books and graphic novels which is how I see things when I write so that works out for me. The Krillinan Key: Salamander Run is about Kyrill Nickolas Savek aka Salamander who wakes up in the year 2242 in his 289th year of life. It\u0027s new year\u0027s day, he\u0027s apartment has been cleaned out by the party goers. He gets an anonymous video phone call from someone who alert him to his being discovered and that sets Salamander off on his epic chase through Neo-New York. The entire graphic novel is a real-time chase through his apartment building, across a roof, down 13 flights, through a neighboring building, the streets on foot and in a fusion powered Porsche Dragon through the streets. With interludes in the Arctic and various locations in Neo-New York as the conspiracy behind Salamander unfolds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe three stories that I had been working on recently for several Indigenous anthologies are: The Krillian Key: Ogichidaawag Giizhigong, which translates from the Ojibwe language (Anishinabemowin), as \"Warriors in Space.\" In the year 2242 aliens invade and take over and enslave roughly 95%, leaving the remaining to fend for themselves. Seven years later a fourth alien race arrives in the Earth Solar System, this one aims to kill off every last human being left. It\u0027s up to the crew of the pirate ship Nindedeyag Jiibayag (My Father\u0027s Ghost) to save what remains of humanity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second story is based on the short story by Gordon Henry, he\u0027s an Anishinabe Author, the story is called \"The Prisoner of Haiku\". It\u0027s about a boy who survives residential school, loses his voice in the abuse, and communicates as an adult only through written Haiku. I was asked to add 4 extra pages of work to this project which I\u0027ve just completed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third project is called \"Linger\" and is based on my poem of the same name. It\u0027s part of a forthcoming Indigenous anthology where all the stories have something to do with Love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything I do and create has some kind of Indigenous perspective, all my protagonists are Saulteaux, or another First Nations. My language and our traditions also shows up too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs new projects come up I\u0027ll let you know about them and give you exclusive access to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime I also take commissions for comic book style illustrations of yourself in costume, you can message me for prices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGitchi migwetch (thank you very much)"

I grew up reading the Savage Sword of Conan and from there X-men, the Incredible Hulk and read novels by Jack L. Chalker and Piers Anthony being my favorites. I started drawing early on, and began taking it seriously when I was 12 and by that I mean I focuses in on wanting to create and draw my own stories. It was around this time that I took up writing, starting with sci-fi and pretty much never looking back. I play DnD 5e, started with the red box, then AD\u0026amp;D, the 3rd and 3.5 and skipped 4th entirely. I play WOW and shooters, but mostly I draw comics and write poetry. From time to time I\u0027ve drawn characters people played in DnD, that\u0027s always fun and perhaps where and why I grew to love Dragons. . .\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
