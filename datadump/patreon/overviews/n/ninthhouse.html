Now, more than ever, beauty - truth- and love are all we have. Art in any of its forms is one of the best ways to inspire this qualities into each moment of our lives. \u003cbr\u003eWOW-WEE, BayBee.\u003cbr\u003e You\u0027ve got an idea of where my heart and head is, but I am still yearning to know more about you, my beloved Patreons. SO, by donating a little bit (or a lot.. I\u0027m open to the infinite!) we can be in this co-creative relationship. How DIVINE.\u003cbr\u003eThis is a humbling and wonder*full gift. With this much money a month I can afford to travel and blog while still creating the art, taking the classes, and embodying my truth. Imagine multiple videos a week, crafts, poems, dancing galore! All because you\u0027ve been so kind to support me and my dream of making my love manifest through creative expression. \u003cbr\u003eThank you, soul family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
