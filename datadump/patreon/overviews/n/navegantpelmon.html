Sails, solar panels and a wind turbine: the sea, the sun, and the wind are the energy that propels us.\u003cbr\u003eWe firmly believe that this experience will make us grow as people, that it will also have a positive impact on our surroundings, and that it will inspire  various solidarity, sports, and environmental challenges, just as we were inspired by the magical stories of great people that we have met along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does Navegant pel M\u00f3n mean?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNavegant pel M\u00f3n is not just a dream come true, it is so much more.\u003cbr\u003eNavegant pel M\u00f3n means leaving everything behind and fighting for a goal, learning and overcoming obstacles day by day. It means getting to know yourself and those around you, and being able to find resources and solutions to achieve your goals. Effort and sacrifice are present on a daily basis, but the chance of connecting with and being moved by nature is fulfilling and helps us to move forward.\u003cbr\u003eIt means awakening our conscience and the awareness of those around us, fighting for the preservation of our environment and its fauna. A great solidarity, sports, and environmental challenge. A way of life.\u003cbr\u003eNavegant pel M\u00f3n constitutes a set of core values that will make us grow and that will help us to pass on to our and future generations the courage and the hope that are necessary to fight for a dream and to contribute to the common good and the preservation of our planet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE ROUTE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow us and share it with us.\u003cbr\u003eDeparture and Arrival: Roses (Alt Empord\u00e0, Catalunya).\u2028\u003cbr\u003eStarting date: Octubre 2016.\u2028Estimated length: 2-3 years.\u003cbr\u003eThe planned route, which is open to adaptation, runs from East to West, avoiding the areas of typhoons and hurricanes in the wet season.
