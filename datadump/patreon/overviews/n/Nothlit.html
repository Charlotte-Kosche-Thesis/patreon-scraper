    "summary": "I\u0027m an artist from New Jersey who wants to make Art her main career. I want to share stories and let people enjoy them! Creating is my passion and I\u0027d love to make it my career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I work on personal projects only in my spare time when I\u0027m not at work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Life and Nothy, which is short comics based on things that have happened to me. These comics are fairly easy and mostly done in my in between time, thus has more updates. However, I really enjoy making them and the response they get. It\u0027d be great if I could make them more! At the moment I had moved and was unable to work on it. I\u0027d love to get back to working on Life and Nothy since a lot has happened since I\u0027ve moved, but as I work a normal full time job, I need more encouragement to work continuously on it\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current project that\u0027s more active is my comic, Aura to Avatar. It\u0027s about some college kids playing a game for money, but it also happens to be the designers Psychiatry final. What happens next depends on the minds in the game, and them trying not to cross that thin line between going too far. I\u0027m really excited about this and plan for it to be my first serious comic. It\u0027s slightly based on my D\u0026amp;D games with my own friends, and it\u0027s something I plan to work very hard on.\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Status: Chapters being written.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFamily Ties is more of a passion project. It\u0027s an original story about how despite the shit the world can throw at you, those you bond with can become stronger than blood. It\u0027s one I worked on for a very long time, I\u0027ve written it differently a million ways. However the way the comic is made is one that I want to work hard on and put my best foot forward with. Family Ties is currently being worked on only in my little spare time when I can, as such it\u0027s unfortunately not as important. This comic is more on the back burner and may not be worked on until I can sustain myself on art as my career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are just a few things I\u0027m putting my imagination towards but there is more and others I want to work on as well. I plan to write more stories, and scripts. I also want to try my best in learning animation as well as furthering my experience with illustration and continuously improving.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I do not have much if at all income at the moment. That\u0027s where you guys can come in. With a donation as little as a $1 you can help me to work towards my goals and bring my stories to true fruition without worrying about necessities and whether or not I can afford them. You\u0027ll be helping me out so much, but not without getting things in return!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar more towards my goals and plans gets rewards! It includes: Sketches, Streams, Cameos, Behind-The-Scenes Content, and much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please consider pledging, every little bit helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
