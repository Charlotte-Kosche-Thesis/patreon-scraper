I\u0027m also a self-employed professional photographer, but the bread-and-butter work just doesn\u0027t inspire me creatively like my passion projects do! YOU can help me to spend more of my time creating art for art\u0027s sake by supporting me on Patreon! By contributing a small monthly amount, you are allowing me to let my creativity loose, as well as supporting and promoting the models I work with. You\u0027ll see my creative process from the inside out, as well as enjoy the results. You will get a glimpse into the vast depths of the universe and learn about it at the same time. And you will help give me the freedom to create beautiful photos and concentrate on doing the things I love instead of working to pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a professional photography teacher and have produced six ebooks and three video training courses. At the higher tier levels you will get to tap directly into my 13+ years of photographic experience and short-cut your own photography learning curve. I love teaching and sharing my passion for photography, so I\u0027d love to be able to help you with yours!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Folio/Astrophotography/i-C6KBf62/0/X3/creek161027-052-X3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Vision For Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI really want to share my creative process with you as much as possible, so as I grow my Patreon, learn how it works, and understand better what you enjoy most, I\u0027ll be expanding and adapting what I offer and share here. You\u0027ll get to have a big say on what you see, and I\u0027ll be listening to all of your cool ideas and suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreativity for me is an immensely collaborative process, so I\u0027d like to involve you in interesting and imaginative ways! Got a shoot idea? Let me know! Want to see more about how I achieve certain looks? Just ask! Always wanted to know how to find models to work with, locations to shoot at, the right gear for you? I can help with that. I plan to be active in the community and your questions and ideas will feed back into my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month I plan to do one Patreon specific shoot, which will be exclusively for $10+ backers to see for three months. I\u0027ll be sharing behind the scenes photos and videos to all backers from each shoot, and when I come to process the photos, I\u0027ll record a screencast of me at work for everyone to watch. I\u0027ll even spend some time explaining my thought process and give some insight into how I process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-fzKHcpx/1/O/i-fzKHcpx.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoin Me! :D\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf all of that sounds like fun, then please consider signing up and supporting me here on Patreon. You\u0027ll be following in a noble renaissance tradition of patrons of the arts, supporting artists so that they can be artists, without being beholden to employers, investors or governments. Patronising the arts is good for your soul \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a FAQ to help if you have any questions before you choose to join:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/8447685\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/8447685\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
