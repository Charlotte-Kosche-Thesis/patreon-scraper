    "summary": "Let me first say thank you, I\u0027m listener and viewer\nsupported, so I couldn\u0027t do it without you. It\u0027s difficult to put to words how\nhumbling it is to be given the opportunity to communicate directly to the\nexponentially growing numbers of inquiring individuals. I work as an open-source citizen investigator. Primarily I\u0027m contracted by an open-source, citizens organized collaboration dedicated to offering a fact based reference for alternatives to official narratives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat means this content, independently researched and investigated, is intended for those of you who feel you aren\u2019t getting the entire story from mainstream outlets. Discerning fact from fiction is difficult even with conventional sources, therein is where I\u0027ve found my niche. My intention from day one has been to\ngrow the discernment and awareness of anyone willing to lend an ear. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have no doubt you understand the throes of financial rigors however I don\u0027t demand or expect you to contribute to this project much more\nthan simply sharing my material. That in itself is much appreciated. Anything\nthat is contributed goes towards content creation, research, and the continual\neffort to grow and reach others. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe carrot on a stick economics leaves much to be desired and simply exposing\nthis inherent truth can often lead to ad hominem attacks and outright\ndismissal. Most have an innate ability to be actively involved in something\nmore profound and productive than the often repetitive and mind numbing tasks\nthe Standard Model is awash with. If that sounds like you, I\u0027m personally\nasking for your help. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPerhaps you have an eye for this type of research and you would like to\ncontribute to its growth in some way. I invite you to become an actively\ninvolved resource for the continual release of relevant and pertinent information\npertaining to the less understood aspects of today\u0027s world. Again,\nsince I\u0027m listener and viewer supported, it\u2019s crucial I extend my thanks and\nlet you know I truly value your participation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBe sure to check out my work on YouTube and follow me on my blog.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYouTube: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJrHzXINwxVm9jP3uShPlTg\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJrHzXINwxVm9jP3u...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBlog: \u003ca href=\"http://wakeusup.over-blog.com/\"\u003ehttp://wakeusup.over-blog.com/\u003c/a\u003e"

One instance led to \nanother and I found myself pouring over mountains of literature and research \nsteeped in controversy in an attempt to better understand what was going\n on in the world and more immediately, how it affected me directly. I \nquickly learned that a significant amount of discernment is required to \ndistinguish upright information from dubious. That line isn\u2019t always clear even with \nconventional resources. Disinformation, poorly researched material, and \nbiased studies abound, but appropriate conclusions can still be \nachieved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe sure to check out my work on YouTube and follow me on my blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube:\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJrHzXINwxVm9jP3uShPlTg\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJrHzXINwxVm9jP3u...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlog: \u003ca href=\"http://wakeusup.over-blog.com/\"\u003ehttp://wakeusup.over-blog.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
