I\u0027m a writer, editor, labor organizer, baby academic, and (most recently)\u00a0 teacher. I\u0027ve written fiction, plays, poetry, essays, book reviews, food columns, blogs, listicles, zines, podcasts, travelogues, and comics. My work has been published by Nightmare Magazine, Tor.com, Fireside Fiction, Podcastle, Cicada, and other venues, and has been awarded places on the Tiptree Honor List and the Working Class Writers Grant. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write for lots of reasons: to make sense of things, to satisfy my curiosity or cure my boredom, to dig into fears, to tell truths. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eA true story\u003c/h2\u003eWhen\nI was six years old, my first grade teacher interviewed each of her\nstudents. Decades later, I only remember one of her questions\u003cem\u003e: What\ndo you want to be when you grow up?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy\nanswer was typed up and displayed for all to see:\u003cem\u003e I\nwant to be Hulk Hogan. \u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\tSuburban\nCommando\u003c/em\u003e had come out that year,\nwith Hulk Hogan playing some kind of Flash Gordon ripoff in super-armor.\u003cimg src=\"http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Movies/2005/12/17/suburbancommando2.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e What\nI really wanted to be when I grew up was an interstellar hero with an\nawesome spaceship, the ability to fight evil, and a leather headband.\nAt six years old, however, I didn\u0027t really know how to articulate this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027ve been writing for more than half my life, in all kinds of formats. I\u0027ve had enough\nsuccess to think I can maybe make a living at it, and even if I can\u0027t, I should keep at it anyway. Since \"interstellar superhero\" is off the table, being a writer seems like a good fallback. I can still fight evil (or at least try to understand it better), and leather headbands also seem to be an\noption.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eI originally started this Patreon in 2015 because I was barely scraping by financially. Having a Patreon meant being able to buy some groceries or pay for health insurance. My finances have stabilized for now (thanks, grad school), but I still live on low wages and freelance work, and have to deal with summer unemployment (thanks, grad school). There\u0027s also a big question mark after I graduate. The future, as always, is uncertain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love that Patreon offers a way to connect to creators in a fun, informal way. I love writing to people\u0027s prompts and suggestions: I\u0027ve made stories about a serial killer\u0027s search history, the adventures of a Really Good Hat, and people running away on flying trees, all based on people\u0027s random ideas. I\u0027m also hoping to use this Patreon as a place to post up my thoughts about writing as both a craft and a profession, as well as an excuse to get back into making chapbooks and zines, two hobbies I had when I was younger that I\u0027d like to get back to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this Patreon is really successful, I have other ideas in the pipeline. Want me to start a podcast? Start sharing lesson plans and writing exercises? Interviews? Choose Your Own Adventure stories? Like I said, the future is uncertain -- but sometimes that\u0027s what makes it fun.\u003cbr\u003e"
