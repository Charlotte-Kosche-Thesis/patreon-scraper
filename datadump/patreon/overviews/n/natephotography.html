This sense of photography in me started at the age of 13 when my dad showed me how to use his old DSLR. He explained to me what it\u0027s like to take pictures and how I can improve them and here and there he let me use his camera all on my own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Photography to Me?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo me, photography is a way of capturing the moment for life. Imagine walking by a beautiful lake, and you take a snapshot of it so that you can always remember that memory of the lake basking in the sun. Or seeing a child smile and capturing that cheerful and innocent smile of a child forever. You can grow old and you look at that picture and go back to those amazing moments, knowing that you were part of that picture, immersed in such surreal experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see my portfolio here:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/nate_photography_malta/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePowered by the People\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish that this journey of mine for photography is shared with anyone I can. That is why, with the patron system, I can give as much as I can to those who are willing to aid me through my photography experience. Who knows, maybe I get to help you in your photography journey too :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all,\u003cbr\u003eNathaniel Cutajar"
