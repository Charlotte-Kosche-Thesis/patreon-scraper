Making videos (which I hope to do a lot more of) is a pretty slow process. On top of that personal art, offer (free!) writing prompts every April (national poetry month), intermittently host a (free!) women\u0027s writing group, and I ry to be active and present in my community. I think that it\u0027s important to cultivate a community of artists and I am committed to keeping the community inclusive; I don\u0027t want anyone not attending a poetry show because they couldn\u0027t afford the cover or not writing because they could afford to by a how-to book. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat said, I live in a world where things are expensive. As an artist, I\u0027m faced with the hard truth that every hour I spend working overtime to make ends meet is time I can\u0027t afford to spend making art and/or serving my community.\u00a0\u00a0That\u0027s where you can come in and why I\u0027m on Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is like an ongoing Kickstarter. Instead\nof supporting one product or event, you sponsor me and my work with a monthly\namount that you set yourself. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can make a huge difference in the amount\nof time and the quality of materials I use for as little as $1 per month. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDon\u2019t worry; you can cancel, downgrade, or\nupgrade your support at any point. If you\u0027re still have questions about the how\nthe financial part works, Patreon\u2019s \n\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/200359925-Patrons\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/a\u003e section has got\nthe answers you need.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do I get Out of It?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBesides that heartwarming feeling of knowing\nthat you are a kickass patron of the arts? \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst, let\u0027s talk about something. If I invited you to my house for a potluck dinner, we\u2019d\nbreak bread together whether you brought one biscuit, a cake, or nothing. So it\nseems counterintuitive to not do that here. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, if you contribute, you get access\nto the feed \u2013 whether you contribute $1 or $20 or $1000. That\u2019s not because I don\u2019t\nappreciate capitalism and the price of time and art supplies, but because I\nunderstand percentages and I\u2019d rather you were here with me. And if a dollar is\nyour way of doing that, awesome. If $20 is, that\u2019s awesome, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nScroll down to the perks and pick the one\nthat feels right for you. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you can\u2019t become a Patreon supporter of my art\nright now, you can still visit my website, make a one-time donation, and/or\nshare this page - or my other online haunts - with people who might dig what I do.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEither way, thank you for stopping by. \u00a0You can get to know me and what I do better at\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://nicolehomer.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003enicolehomer.com\u003c/a\u003e and of course in the wide wide world of the internet where I occasionally\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/realnicolehomer\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esay short things\u003c/a\u003e and share\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://instagram.com/realnicolehomer/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy view of the world\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
