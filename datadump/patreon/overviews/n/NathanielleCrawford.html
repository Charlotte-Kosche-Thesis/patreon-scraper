    "summary": "I\u0027ve been writing all my life. It was only recently that I found the courage to self publish two mystery novellas in e-book format and then an in print collection of short stories. The Nicodemus Dean stories can be found on Smashwords and The Ideas in my Head, my demo disc, is available through Lulu.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy stories range from fairy tales and mythology, to science fiction, horror, satire and social commentary. And all I really want is to reach more readers by making my work available in a number of formats, including e-book and print. I also want to branch out into short film by putting some of my ideas out there in a scripted format of one sort or another. The accompanying video with this Patreon will give you an example of what I like to do, as well as a sample of my writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations will go towards printing costs, paying artists for covers and illustrations, software and equipment to use in all projects including books, videos, and promotional materials. Donations will also offset costs for classes and workshops, travel, and other expenses associated with creation. I\u0027ll always keep my donors apprised of how I am putting their money to use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe beauty part about Patreon is that it is far easier than I thought to become a creator or a donator. You can set up a regular monthly donation, as low as 1 dollar, to be automatically deducted from your bank account. Or if you\u0027re squeamish about giving out your bank information you can buy a preloaded gift card at Target, Walmart, or over a dozen other places and make a one time donation that way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also tie your donations to specific content. For example, you can donate 5$ per short story, with a cap at two donations max per month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are two artists I support through Patreon. Ken Reid, a comedian based in Boston. And Peter Hollens, a brilliant singer and musician who creates stunning videos. Ken Reid gets five dollars per month and Peter Hollens gets five dollars per music video with a ten dollar cap each month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo supporting my work or the work of your favorite creators (Which I really hope I\u0027m one of) doesn\u0027t have to break the bank. But there are still some rewards I plan to offer to all of my readers and supporters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
