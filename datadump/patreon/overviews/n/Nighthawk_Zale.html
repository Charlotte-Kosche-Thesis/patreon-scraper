My first channel, SpartanM064, was mildly successful but taught me a lot about what it takes to run a Twitch channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/spartanm064\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.twitch.tv/spartanm064\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0set aside streaming for some months to help my Mother with the family business and focus on my mental health programs through the VA. I\u0027m happy to report that I\u0027m in a much better place now but I won\u0027t be able to hold a \"normal\" 9-5 job. Now my wife, Lady Nighthawk, and I are expecting out first child together, Babyhawk! It\u0027s extremely exciting and at the same time very stressful. Because of this I\u0027ve decided to grab the proverbial bull by its horns and dive into full-time Star Citizen content creation as my career. My plan is to add to this creative, passionate community through informative and interactive entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwitch \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/nighthawk_zale\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.twitch.tv/nighthawk_zale\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYouTube \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9IGifESkWt-Lk7dkphphqA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9IGifESkWt-Lk7dk...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goals of both my Twitch and YouTube channels are to provide the community with entertaining and informative content to instill a passion for Star Citizen in others!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDISCLAIMER: Nighthawk reserves the right to modify, rename, reschedule and alter in any way the details of programming listed herein.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e Traverse the \u0027Verse\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone enjoys a\u00a0well-designed tabletop game.
