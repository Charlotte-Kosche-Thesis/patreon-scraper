    "summary": "THANK YOU for supporting NVT Studios and the K 101 Podcast! \u00a0It is because of patrons in our communities like you, who assist and enable us to produce these podcasts, that we can continue to help educate newcomers to the BDSM / Fetish / Kink / Swinger / and other sex-positive lifestyles. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMr. NVT and his loving wife eNVy, were HS sweethearts who ended up apart from one another due to not having resources like the ones they now produce in their local area. \u00a0Once back together - they decided to take a bold step and support the BDSM community - by making sure anyone who is interested, has access to the answers of any questions they may have. \u00a07 years ago, they started - and still host - a local \"munch\" in their area. (A munch is the same thing as a \"meet and greet\" to those of you who are familiar with swinger terminology.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, they have just launched a website and podcast for everyone to come and learn at their own pace. \u00a0All of our podcasts, all of our posts, and any workshops we have done - are all in a Safe, Sane, and Consensual environment. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEducation Is The Key To Understanding, Understanding Is The Key to Life\u0027s Enrichment\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eFinally, you\u0027ll see that our patrons are kept private. \u00a0This decision was made in an effort to help protect the anonymity of those who might not want to advertise they have a kinky / swinger / fetish / BDSM side. \u00a0We will ALWAYS respect your privacy, and do our best to create the safest place we can, so you can come and explore the topics you want to learn about - discreetly. \u00a0"
