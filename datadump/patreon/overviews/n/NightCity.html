I\u0027ve been working on a Alpha of this game in RAGS for over a year, and have recently decided to change the engine as well as the art assets of the game. With an increase of cost and time, I\u0027d like to continue to build, improve, and expand the game and game world I\u0027ve created, but will need some financial backing to do this right. SuperPowered is the byproduct of a resource management game that got drunk one night and woke up the next morning next to a sex oriented dating sim. It has many adult themes as well as a good amount of humor. I ultimately would like to get to a developmental point where I can put out monthly episodic updates, much like a comic book. In order to do that I\u0027ll need to be able to pay for art resources, other technologies, and possibly additional staff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see the previous version of the game built on the RAGS engine by going to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.hypnopics-collective.net/smf_forum/index.php?topic=21072\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.hypnopics-collective.net/smf_forum/index.php?topic=21072\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eLearn about and discuss the Public Version\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.hypnopics-collective.net/smf_forum/index.php?topic=21631.0\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA wiki for the game can be\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://night-city-productions.wikia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efound here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s some gameplay screenshots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgur.com/Hvnet9j.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgur.com/TqzXaIE.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgur.com/f4o2py6.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgur.com/YcstpbU.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgur.com/pTuBI7T.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeads up...Charge Upfront has been turned on, so you will be charged as soon as you pledge.\u003cbr\u003e"

The handful of images I\u0027ve made with backgrounds have taken 5-6 hours to render. Plain sprite renders currently take me about 80 minutes.\u00a0Unlocking this goal will allow me to start building a much stronger graphics oriented computer that can render backgrounds as well, which will generally make my game look better and speed up production. \u00a0This will also unlock more locations to travel to in game.",
