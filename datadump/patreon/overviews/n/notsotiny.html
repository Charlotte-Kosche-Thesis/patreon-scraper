I write and draw a weekly web-comic for my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.notsotiny.co.uk.\"\u003ewww.notsotiny.co.uk.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing and drawing comics for as long as I can remember and it has been my dream to publish my own comics directly to the people who care about them most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I hope to achieve?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tried to be a freelance illustrator for a while and, although I got fairly steady work, I lost my creative control. I have a head full of ideas that I would like to share with people and want my web-comics to be free so that anyone can read them on the internet. \u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I am a full-time Dad with a couple of evenings a week to make my comics, but in the near future, I will have to get a job that actually helps pay the bills, and this is where I hope Patreon will come in. With your contributions, making comics can be my job! I would be able to support my family and, as I\u0027d be working on this full time, I would be able to update more frequently, go to comic book conventions and even invest in new equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in this crowd funding platform. It means those who like my work can directly help in creating it. I have been a supporter of subscription websites and enjoyed being part of the conversation between the creators and the fans. I wanted to recreate this for people who care about my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid you say rewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUm...no, but while we\u0027re on the subject, I currently have a small selection of rewards for contributors including my comics a week earlier than they go on my website and exclusive artwork and blogs. If I am lucky enough to meet certain goals, I\u0027d be able to expand the amount of rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that leaves me with thanking you for reading, asking you to take a look at my comics and if you like what you see, I would very much appreciate it if you\u0027d consider supporting me and my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
