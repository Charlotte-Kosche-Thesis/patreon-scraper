    "summary": "Next of Ken is a producer of reference online video content, covering all things entertainment including video games, movies, TV shows, trends, and more. We upload new videos daily with Top 10 lists, Origin stories, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSup. I am Ken of Next of Ken and I love pop culture. My love affair of all things entertainment began as soon as I could talk. Honestly, I think my first words were \"check, please.\" Eventually, I turned that passion and ability to reference pop culture at the drop of a hat into a hobby. I began making AMVs when I was 12 or 13 and that\u0027s when I discovered my secret talent for video production and video editing. I had never taken so much as a class or read even a tutorial, but boy did I love doing it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI took a break from it to focus on my energy on writing novels and songs for awhile, but I would return to video editing in 2014 when I took a job in a technical writing field. Although the right brain was being thoroughly exercised, the left brain was given little to no tickling at all. I needed a creative outlet. So, I began making countdown videos with the little editing and video production talent that I had preternaturally developed at 12 years old that wasn\u0027t entertained ever since. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in those days, the few videos I made garnered little to no fanfare. In fact, I think I hit 100 views across 4 videos. However, I didn\u0027t obsess over it because this project wasn\u0027t really about the views and likes. That\u0027s not why I did it. Next of Ken, at the time, was just a creative outlet and it was never meant to achieve thousands of views or have any subscribers/fans. It was just a audio/visual expression of the passion that I had for entertainment and pop culture, but then something happened... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e... I gained a subscriber! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomeone out there in YouTubeland had taken notice of what I was trying to do and actually hit that small red bar on the right hand side of their screen, so they could be notified whenever a new video was uploaded. It was amazing and I was genuinely surprised. And it didn\u0027t stop there. No no no... it didn\u0027t stop there at all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had another subscriber and then another and then another subscriber. Now.... almost 4 years later, I have 60,000,000 lifetime views and over 80,000 subscribers. Clearly, many out there understand the passion I have for my video project and want to support me in continuing it\u0027s progression. We\u0027re the WatchMojo kind of channel, but without all the talking. It\u0027s just the good stuff. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat support that you\u0027ve given us over the years is what\u0027s keeping our channel alive today and we want to do everything we can to encourage that support. We hesitated at first to do a Patreon. Many probably won\u0027t understand why we even need one. If you don\u0027t feel as though we need the assistance, that\u0027s fine. You do not have to contribute. No one has to contribute anything. Even watching one second of one video is contribution enough and we love you for even just yet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if you did want to support this project financially, you can do so here. We will literally accept anything. A dollar. A cent. Bits of string. Photos of kittens. We\u0027re not picky. We are creating a Patreon as not only means to connect to our fans and our audience, but we also do need the help financially. This has become our full time job and we denote hours every day to researching Adwords for trending keywords and researching the latest pop culture. The process to create a video also includes spending hours every day watching TV and movies to find all the right clips to make for an impactful and mesmerizing video. This does take time, patience, and energy and it does become exhausting after all. It\u0027s not the same as watching media for fun. We also spend money on video equipment and video production materials every month such as editing programs that we use to create, edit, and produce our videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, you do not have contribute anything to our channel. We will love you all the same and we will continue to upload new content every day. However, even the smallest of change can make a world of difference to us and the quality and the quantity of content that we\u0027re able to upload every week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
