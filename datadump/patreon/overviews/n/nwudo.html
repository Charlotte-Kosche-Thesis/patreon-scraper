     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe following is an old essay I wrote entitled \"Why I made all of my characters Igbo\".\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was raised in Washington, DC by Igbo parents. Growing up,\u003cbr\u003emy favorite shows were usually on PBS and had a multi-cultural cast. It never\u003cbr\u003ereally sunk in that Africans were not represented widely on American cinema.\u003cbr\u003eEven after I was excited by the one episode of \u003cem\u003eGhostwriter\u003c/em\u003e where Jamal was dating a girl with a typical African\u003cbr\u003efather (anyone remember this line: \u003cem\u003e\u201cI\u003cbr\u003etold you not to mention his name in my presence!\u201d\u003c/em\u003e). Even though the father\u003cbr\u003ewas aggressive and not really the nicest representation of African men, I was\u003cbr\u003estill just excited to hear an African accent on television; something that I\u003cbr\u003ecould relate to.  I have\u003cbr\u003ealways been a writer. I don\u2019t even remember when I started writing, because I\u003cbr\u003ewas so young. I remember winning a poetry contest when I was 10 years old\u003cbr\u003e(because the award is still in our living room), but I also remember winning a\u003cbr\u003espeech-writing contest (in honor of MLK) at a younger age than that.\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I relate all too well to the statement of Ngozi Chimamanda\u003cbr\u003eAdichie\u2019s in her famous TED talk \u003cem\u003e\u201cThe\u003cbr\u003eDanger of the Single Story\u201d\u003c/em\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u201cAll my characters were white and blue-eyed, they played inthe snow, they ate apples, and they talked a lot about the weather\u2026Now, thisdespite the fact that I lived in Nigeria\u2026We didn\u0027t have snow, we ate mangoes,and we never talked about the weather\u2026\u201d\u003cbr\u003e  Mycharacters were not always blue-eyed, but I had definitely (at some point)internalized the idea that people in books and on television were supposed tohave white skin. I had never consciously thought that dark-skinned people couldnot be in books or on television, but I did recognize on some level that it wasnot so; and without knowing the reason, I had accepted it.\u003cbr\u003e  The firstbook I had ever completed was entitled \u201cHowto Be a Monster\u201d. It was a kids book that I had begun to write because Ithought the title was cool. So, I fashioned a story around it involving 4thgraders and tried to fashion a moral about \u201ccultural acceptance\u201d into it. Thestory was awful! Not just because of the irony about the a story of culturalacceptance being told by a Black woman without any Black characters in it, butmoreso due to the fact that it was contrived based off of what I thought normal was (based on television)to the point where it didn\u2019t make sense to anyone, NOT EVEN ME!\u003cbr\u003e  A fewyears ago, I was in a writers\u2019 group with an Asian girl, a white guy and mysister. One day, the Asian girl said to me, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you tell stories aboutAfrican people.\u201d Although it had occurred to me before, somehow, I had always(on some level) felt that I was unable to tell those stories. As if mycapabilities and knowledge were somehow lacking in debt to tell the story ofwhat was essentially MYSELF! As someone with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology,I took it very personally. I began soon after to craft a story about a young,Igbo heroine (who at the time was named after me). Over the last 5 years, Ihave played with making her different races and even at one point making her from another planet. Somehow I keep coming back to Igbo-ness. Since then, Ihave crafted several stories with Igbo, female protagonists and am happy to doso. Ultimately, it\u2019s about self acceptance, cultural pride and solidarity. Thewriting of Chimamanda Adichie definitely gave me tons more confidence to writein this way, and since then, I have found many new African authors thatencourage me to grow in this craft and write what I know.\u003cbr\u003e  There isa common saying among writers, which is \u201cWrite what you know.\u201d The idea behindthis saying is that writing loses it\u2019s authenticity when you try to hard to fityour writing into some abstract formula, and readers can tell! Once upon atime, I thought nobody would want to read my stories if they were about Africanor Black people. I thought there was no point in writing these stories, becausenobody would read them and I would not make any money. Now, with opportunitiesopening up at every turn, with the first Black president in America beingelected, with the popularity of Chimamanda Adichie and the death of NelsonMandela, Maya Angelou and Chinua Achebe; now is the best time EVER for mygeneration to step up and create art and media that will shape the culturallandscape for our children and our children\u2019s children. We are at a crucialpoint in history, (as one expert calls it \u201ca choice point\u201d) that has thecapability to change the direction of the cultural paradigm as we know it. Thequestion is, what will we do with this opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e  As forme, I have decided to let go of writing what I think people will like, orwriting what \u201cwill sell\u201d.  I have chosen,now, to write for me and for my people. I am choosing to tell uncommon andunpopular stories. I no longer believe that this is synonymous with \u201cbadstories\u201d. I think the craft ofwriting is foundational, but the stories told are up to us! So, I\u2019m choosing totell well-written stories, but from now on, I will try to tell stories thatcome straight from my heart. This is why all of the heroes of my stories haveto be Igbo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere you can find me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cimg height=\"97\" src=\"https://nwudo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-follow-social-buttons-300x97.png\" width=\"300\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTwitter: \u003ca href=\"https://www.twitter.com/igboswag\"\u003e@IgboSwag\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nInstagram: \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/therealnwudo\"\u003e@TheRealNwudo\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYoutube: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoIjM6j6LLs0Guvj31E07qA\"\u003eNwudo\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon: \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/nwudo\"\u003eNwudo\u003c/a\u003e",
