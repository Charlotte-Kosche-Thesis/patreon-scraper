    "summary": "The Nights of Qualara (NoQ) project is a Role Playing Game\n(RPG) setting with a rules system agnostic paradigm.  The goal of NoQ is to bring together various\ncampaigns into a shared living universe. \nThis allows one campaign to be enriched by the details of another.  As Game Masters (GMs) and Players take part\nin a campaign, their actions change the face of the Qualara Universe and become\npart of the lore that is NoQ.  We want to\ncreate an inclusive universe for creative people to share their creative\ncontent and possibly publish that content to the world, regardless of what RPG\nrules are used.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith Nights of Qualara we have created an active process\nthat will help generate lore to incorporate into the living universe,\ncontinuing to detail and expand out the universe.  This process, known to us as The Cycle of\nLore, is a cyclic feedback process that allows for internal and external submissions\nof content to become cannon in the universe. \nThe output of this process is the recorded cannon that may become game publications,\nsuch as maps, adventure modules, gaming accessories, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe concept of NoQ began with the idea of running a multi-store\ncampaign world where GMs from different stores would play campaigns or some\nseries of adventures and the GM would summarize the sessions to be entered into\nlore.  This lore would then be published\nout to all other GMs to let them know what has occurred and to incorporate the\nevents into their campaigns as they saw fit. \nHowever, quickly after we pitched the idea to those we wanted to\ninvolve, the true potential immediately became apparent.  The first expansion came when everyone asked\nwhat system we were using.  The next\nquick expansion of the concept was following the question I received from a\nfriend that was interested in NoQ and he asked if he had to run his campaign at\na store or could he do it from his house as part of his home campaign.  We realized that it did not matter what rule\nsystem we were using, nor did it matter where the campaign was being\nplayed.  With these two thoughts, the\nconcept exploded into a series of events that ended with us creating the NoQ\nUniverse.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur audience for NoQ is virtually limitless with a game rule\nneutral and location neutral universe. \nHowever, our idea did not stop there. \nWe did not feel we would be fully inclusive unless we allowed for some\nGMs to contribute their personal creations without the cycle of lore feedback\nloop interrupting long running home campaigns. \nFurther still, we would not be able to claim true neutrality until we\nallowed other genre RPGs to join in our universe.  To answer both of these, we have introduced\nour concept of Timelines.  Homebrew\ncampaigns take place at a specific time in the past and become historical and\nalternate genre campaigns can be placed at future points of time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe culmination of these ideas have created the\nencapsulation of our universe that we would like to share with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow we will use Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating this idea is a large and involved effort and the creativity necessary is tremendous. \u00a0We will use the backing of our Patrons to keep this idea going, creating new things and continuously expanding the universe. \u00a0However, this is not all a hidden endeavor and instead, we will give back to our Patrons, all Patrons, the ability to see and watch pieces of this world come to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will pick one segment of the world and flesh it out here on Patreon. \u00a0When that one segment is complete, we will pick the next and the next, etc. \u00a0You will get a first hand view on our creative process and our imaginations (good luck...). \u00a0In addition, we will look to our Patrons to openly provide comments, suggestions, and ideas on what they would like to see built. \u00a0We will build what you want too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help and support we can create our (and your) living universe. \u00a0Thank you for everything you make possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
