The 1 ad we have on the site only covers and estimated 0.5% of our yearly payments. Patreon would enable us to actually perhaps get somewhere, it would enable upgrades, moving a more efficient and effective host for our needs, it would render us more independant, and even provide the incentive to develop and build more things for our site that could help in the long run.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt certain moments, if a patron has consecutively supported us to a certain number of dollars, we will grant them special titles or other neat things more info on this later!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Ninpocho?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNinpocho.com is a roleplaying community site based on ninjas, death, story, writing and combat!\u003cbr\u003eNinpocho is unique in the way that we have an actively developed chance-based combat system that is ever-changing and ever evolving. Even on it\u0027s 14th year since it was first created back in 2004 we are still finding upgrades, updates and amazing tools that helps the community.\u003cbr\u003eWe have semi-regular events where we engage with each other and even do tournament fights. Our community is evolving and growing. And one of our goals is to ensure that we are able to move to a new host that enables us to grow even further without trying to find solutions that sacrifice our creativity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNinpocho is split into 4 different categories of users depending on their choice when they first start on the site. Either they join Sand, Cloud, or Leaf. The final category is our missing population which are members who decided to leave their affiliation with any of the main three villages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are an open community and are always willing to help and support new coming members.\u003cbr\u003eOur Discord server is also open for players to join in and ask questions about the site and the community at large.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur administration consists of veterans and uniquely skilled individuals who are assisting with the general management of the site and the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLegal notice\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBy submitting to patron for Ninpocho Chronicles, you are agreeing to the terms of use which include the following:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou (the patron) agrees to the reality that the content shared on the patreon, including the exclusive discord channel, and the exclusive patron part of the forum on the ninpocho.com website is to remain in the areas that it was originally shared.
