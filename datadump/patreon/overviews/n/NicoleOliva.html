    "summary": "Hello Everyone! my name is Nicole and many of you know me as Nicole Oliva Soprano. I am a singer, actress, model and many other talents. I love to perform and I especially love to tell a story through my work.\u003cbr\u003eI have been fortunate enough in the past year to leave the mundane of a 9-5 job and peruse my career in the arts. \u00a0I know this could never have been possible without the love and support of all of you! My family, friends, and fans! \u00a0The only thing better then being able to do what I love for a living by creating this type of work is knowing all of you truly enjoy it. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had some big plans brewing for a while now in terms of brand new projects which includes but are not limited to...\u003cbr\u003eMusic Videos, Films, Short Plays, Original Music, Concert Tours, Fashion Collections, and a Cosplay Cataloge!\u003cbr\u003eIn the past I have tried my best to accomplish several of these projects slowly but surely through means of free or affordable resources and help from friends. \u00a0But now I have hit a point where I cannot proceed much further without handing over more cash. \u00a0Not only do these newer and bigger projects cost more, but I don\u0027t feel its fair to keep creating a staff for projects with nothing to pay thm with except for credit. I don\u0027t like dealing with that and I don\u0027t think any artistic professional likes that. \u00a0Sadly though that seems to be the way a career in any industry of the arts works nowadays. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, not only will you be making a dream come true for me by helping me continue to pursue my performing and visual arts career you will also be helping to jump start the career of many other film makers, composers, artists, actors, and photographers who make my work possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy contributing through Patron, \u00a0you will be subscribing to a monthly fee in exchange for not only the content that will be produced through contributions but so much more!\u003cbr\u003ePerks to contributions include early access to music \u0026amp; photos, behind the scenes photos and video clips, custom made products and clothing, tickets to film screenings, concerts, theatre, opera, and conventions, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any doubts about contributing to this new crowdfunding platform based site take a look around at what patreon has to offer. \u00a0Since it is a monthly subscription you can donate as muh or as little as you want that will be taken as a monthly subscription and if anything happens you can cancel anytime. \u00a0Although I hope you don\u0027t because that could put a damper on the production budget.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA quote came to my attention recently that I\u0027ve tried to live by which is \"May you live in interesting times\". \u00a0This could mean a lot of different things to different people. \u00a0The phrase itself is of English origins in the 1930s but also takes from a Chinese phrase that translates to\u00a0 \"better to live as a dog in an era of peace than a man in times of war.\" \u00a0It has also been used by several authors including one of my favorites Sir Terry Pratchett of the Disc World Series.\u003cbr\u003eThe way I see it \"May you live in interesting times\" is how I greet each day and the people around me. \u00a0I may dress like an 1800s doll and sing several alternative styles while acting as a murderer in a film, but at the end of the day I\u0027ve created my own little world that I am happy and content living in even though the rest of the modern world might have a very unpopular opinion about it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
