    "summary": "Hello - I have been writing for 25 years about music, politics and culture. Although especially interested in race, hip hop, metal and the experience of immigrants in western pop music I\u0027ve written about all kinds of music from the avant-garde to the charts, for all kinds of magazines and for all kinds of readers. I\u0027ve also written about film, politics, the music business and . . . .tell y\u0027what, let me show you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fuckyouneilkulkarni.blogspot.co.uk/\"\u003eF.U.N.K Blog\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s my blog. It contains spanking new writing about what music is floating my boat and spinning my propeller on a weekly basis. It\u0027s also a home for thoughts about journalism, politics, cinema and everything inbetween.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write currently for DJ Magazine where I\u0027m in charge of the hip hop page and hip hop features, as well as Wire magazine and the Quietus. My Quietus pieces, including my acclaimed series\u0027 \u0027A New Nineties\u0027 and \u0027Eastern Spring\u0027 (later expanded on and published by Zero Books), can be found here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thequietus.com/users/5098\"\u003eNeil Kulkarni @ The Quietus\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIn a career spanning 3 decades I\u0027ve written for innumerable mags and newspapers in the UK, Europe and USA. In about 2005 it was becoming increasingly tuff for me to support my family with just freelance-journalism work so I took on a few hours teaching at a local media and music college. That teaching quickly ballooned to the point where it is now my full-time job, which leaves me precious little time to write. However I\u0027m still maintaining regular work with all the mags \u0026amp; sites above, as well as many others. In the past 15 years I\u0027ve written and contributed to 4 books, and my blog has nearly 3 quarters of a million views after 4 years of writing it. I\u0027m currently writing a new book for Repeater Books called \u0027The English Rock Defence League\u0027 about the racism inherent in Western pop music and the music business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlot of my writing has attracted a lot of controversy over the years but I feel my style of writing - opinionated, funny, intelligent writing that doesn\u0027t talk down to people - is increasingly marginalised in today\u0027s era of \u0027content provision\u0027 and \u0027s.e.o\u0027. It\u0027s still my belief that a critic\u0027s job is to write as beautifully as the things s/he\u0027s describing and to tell the truth.\u00a0I\u0027ve decided to ask for support via Patreon as I\u0027d love to find a way to become purely a writer again.\u00a0I have set up this page in order to enable people to help me continue to write and survive. Thanks in advance for anyone who cares to contribute x\u00a0"
