I am currently a software development student, but I started out on\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eTumblr\u003cem\u003e\u00a0as a writer of erotica for\u00a0Liard, but it didn\u0027t take me long to also develop a fancy for 3D art. Nowadays, I mostly make various pictures with the occasional animation as I do my absolute utmost to learn and improve, hoping to one day make my mentor proud of me. A girl can dream, right? I also still do write the occasional story, although that is no longer my \"primary objective\" here. I would suggest checking out my Tumblr to get an idea for what I do, but you being here probably means you already know. :3\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: WHAT IZ DIS AND Y R U HERE???\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis, my dear friend, is my patreon page that I created as a way to... how do you say this... uh, allow me to do what I love while also providing you with more content and, while at the same time, keeping my landlord at bay and allowing me to eat something other than instant noodles. While I do not intend to put up any hard \"paywalls\" or anything of the sort, it is the uncomfortable truth that making this stuff takes quite a lot of time and with a real-life constantly lurking around the corner, it can get quite tough - and a few extra bucks would go a long way in keeping things afloat. I do try to post as often as I can but keeping everything else in check at the same time can only get you so far. I also figured that it would be nice to at least offer some kind of thank-you to those who like what I do enough to consider taking their own hard-earned money and give it to me to allow me to make more stuff (I will still be posting pretty much everything on my tumblr!). The various rewards can be seen in the column to the right. --\u0026gt;\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: WHY SHOULD I CARE???\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWell... I cannot really ask anyone to care about me or my problems, but I feel that this is a nice way to show appreciation for my work and my time investment in a way that allows me to focus more on said work and repay your own investment in lewds.

I will let patrons vote and decide what the story is about and which characters will be featured! Do note, however, that these take quite a bit of time to make so I doubt I would be able to make them monthly. Every few months, I believe, is a more realistic expectation. c:\u003c/em\u003e",
