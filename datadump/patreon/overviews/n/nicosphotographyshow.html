Back when film was the only option I had a darkroom and tried to print as often as possible. But life (social) got in the way and I gave up photography for a career in construction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYears later I was working in construction sites and as much as I enjoyed it I always had some sort of camera (p\u0026amp;s digital) with me. One year the huge economic depression came and I was unemployed week yes, week no. So I went back into photography withe the then new Nikon D700. Years later loving all the ease of digital I was still not 100% happy with it and a friend bought a Hasselblad. \"Film is for romantics\" is what I told him, but as always I ventured onto ebay and found out that 85mm f1.4 I was saving for was 2x the price of a full Hasselblad. So I jumped onto a minty Hasselblad with an 80mm and a A12 back, I knew they were some of the best cameras back in the day (and still are), so I had to do it. Once I open the viewfinder and looked down my D700 never got any use again...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo long story short, I was a ignorant on all film things, developing, loading, shooting, metering, etc... And along that learning path I met some amazing individuals that helped me so much. I became so grateful that I made myself help other before anything else. And so became my fight to help other in the film photography world. And this was 2009, its been 9 years at the moment that I eat, breath, talk, drink film photography. Always in a community and respectful way to other and that is what I try to show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYoutube\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter spending years on forums, meetings and other film related adventures I came to the conclusion I would start a Youtube channel. It seemed easy, grab a p\u0026amp;s (still had my Canon G9) and I was a Youtuber. Take a minute and watch my\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/idCqAQAyc5I\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e first video\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e(it will go into history for the best video for sure). And was I wrong, it takes SO MUCH work to produce quality content, after that first video I have been on a learning path that is so hard to describe. I still feel like my videos are under my expectations, but Im not stopping.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIm here to continue to grow in all possible ways and always willing to help, but on this page its where you guys can help me. And for that Im trully grateful.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
