    "summary": "Welcome to NonTraditional Board Games (NTBoardGames for short)! I am Adam Dork and I run this thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNTBoardGames started as (and still is) a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.meetup.com/NonTraditional-Board-Games/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMeetUp group in Silver Spring, MD\u003c/a\u003e. I was looking for people who wanted to play board games and was having problems finding people reliable enough to do it. That was on April 8, 2012. Four years have passed and I am looking at more ways to give back to the group and people anywhere who enjoy board games but want something just a little bit different.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eENTER THE PODCAST\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn February of 2016, a friend and I started a podcast for the group called, \"I Can Deal.\" It is a board game show about board games where we talk about board games. Neat, huh?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe originally the show, \"I Can Deal,\" had us playing a simple game while recording but did away with it in order to focus more on the discussions. Adding a little more content (and to have some fun), I started recording the western/steampunk/horror RPG we are playing called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.wyrd-games.net/through-the-breach/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThrough the Breach\u003c/a\u003e. Besides just posting it, I do some editing and add some ambiance (sound effects \u0026amp; music) to give the listener a more fun user experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo more RPG dramas that are currently happening are HEX Adventures (pulp adventure in mid 1930s) and Edge of the Empire (Star Wars). They are getting the same editing and ambiance added to a better experience like Through the Breach is getting. This way\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this is available free on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ntboardgames\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNTBoardGames SoundCloud page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNEXT COMES THE WEBSITE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way, the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://ntboardgames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e took form to give a writing outlet. The podcast would be posted on the site but the idea is to create to fun, original content on the site, some \"reviews,\" pictures, and ramblings that you can\u0027t find anywhere else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLASTLY VIDEOS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a new endeavor and I have a lot of ideas to use on here. Slowly but surely video content is arriving. I aim for these fun little videos to be something a bit different as well as some streaming of live gameplaying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE GOAL\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have no intentions for charging for any of this content, it is all free. But if you would like to contribute or pledge money towards NTBoardGames, I would be truly grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s Play Some Games!"
