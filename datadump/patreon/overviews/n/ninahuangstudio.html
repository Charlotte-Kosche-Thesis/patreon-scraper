    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi there, welcome to my Patreon Page! Thank you so much for being here! I am Nina, I live in Portland Oregon, and I write words and make pictures.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I could remember, I have been transfixed by the wonder and power of books, especially illustrated books. Growing up in Taiwan, comic books were a huge part of my childhood and early creative inspiration. Illustrated stories and ideas nourished my imagination and gave me endless worlds outside of the one I materially occupied. They were essential to my self-development and stretched my sense of what was possible. Perhaps the combination of words and pictures have always had an uniquely persuasive effect on our psyche.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve written and illustrated a children\u0027s book (My Apollo), which I funded for self-publication on Kickstarter. While the project was a big success and many readers loved the book, I have come to learn that being an independent creator and striving for financial stability can be challenging. Income ebbs and flows. And sometimes you need to switch direction for creative authenticity even if that means you make less art income for some time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I have started my Patreon page. I want to have a way of connecting directly to readers on a monthly basis (instead of by project) and building a foundation that fosters stability and creative freedom.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am passionate about spreading worthwhile ideas through the illustrated word, and some of my favorite topics include creativity and the creative process, Taoism and spirituality, self-development and personal growth, female sexuality and empowerment, social justice, and love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe studio zine, titled Unsocialized, is an informal compilation of all the writing/illustrating work that comes out of the art studio on a monthly basis. A typical issue, about 10-15 pages, might include comic strips, illustrated short stories, hand-lettered quotes, paintings, life studies, musings on the creative process, and work-in-progress or finished pages for the current book project (right now I am working on an illustrated book about the Taoist principles of creativity). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe zine is delivered to you electronically in PDF form, please check Patreon updates for your tier in order to download it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating $1/month, you will receive 1 studio zine every quarter. That\u0027s 3 zines a year! The quarterly zines are delivered at the end of April, August, and December. But as soon as you become a patron of this tier, you will receive the last quarterly zine at no extra cost to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating $3/month, you will receive 1 studio zine every other month. That\u0027s 6 zines a year! The bimonthly zines are delivered at the end of January, March, May, July, September, and November. But as soon as you become a patron of this tier, you will receive the last zine at no extra cost to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating $5/month, you will receive 1 studio zine every month. That\u0027s 12 zines a year! The monthly zines are delivered at the end of every month. But as soon as you become a patron of this tier, you will receive the last zine at no extra cost to you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
