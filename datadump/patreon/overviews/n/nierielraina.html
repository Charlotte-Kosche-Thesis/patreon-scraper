I have since started making my own costumes and taking pictures in them and such. I am super awkward and so bad at talking about myself so I will probably do a Q\u0026amp;A at some point to see what people actually want to know about me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to hear from all of you. You do not have to be a Patron to reach out and say hi. Shoot me a message and we can chat!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope I can make some content you will enjoy and bring a smile to your face. (:\u003cbr\u003e"
