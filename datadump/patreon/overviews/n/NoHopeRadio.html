    "summary": "Hello, my name is LiA\u00a0Lindsaychen and I have squandered my potential. Did I have potential? I can\u0027t remember. It seems familiar. Apologies if that\u0027s irrelevant; I try to speak precisely. I don\u0027t. I\u0027m all over the place, but I hope that\u0027s part of my charm. Do I have charm? I can\u0027t remember. It seems familiar, but it might have been a dream or a TV show. It might have been Ted Danson.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo hi. I\u0027m a weirdo and an outcast, a trans woman in my thirties who has been unable to pass any of the gatekeepers along the way and forced to endure an imitation of an ordinary life. I have failed that life. I was never able to convince anyone I belonged save my disabled partner, whom I am determined to provide for because she\u0027s the only good person I\u0027ve ever met. But my health has deteriorated as well, and I am decreasingly in position to help anyone. I\u0027m running out of options and running out of time, and now at the point where suicide seems almost the most logical choice, I\u0027ve decided to do the next best thing: start a comedy podcast!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTales of Insecurity are post-modern horror stories, but they bear more similarities to situational comedies. They are tragedies of manners, a Wodehouse novel where Jeeves saves Wooster from marriage until the two of them are alone and infirmed\u00a0and still class-conscious. I intend to produce an entertaining and overwhelming hour every week. My father was a preacher, and I will not be outdone by that guy. And I\u0027ll do all the music. I\u0027ll act out all the roles. I can do everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really want to give you some joy out of my misery. That will make it all worth it. Thanks for freuding\u00a0my schaden!"
