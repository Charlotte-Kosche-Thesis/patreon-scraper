I was not made to charge people for it.\u00a0I was made to thrive, so I have more and more to give!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThats where Patreon comes in \u2764\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy intention is to use Patreon as my only source of income, so I can focus fully on giving fully and freely to every person I can touch.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I give? I\u0027m glad you asked \ud83d\ude09\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a single homeschooling mama, and I made it my life goal to live a bliss life with my kids, regardless of any perceived limits, through doing the work from the inside out, \u00a0and now I inspire others to live their bliss. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a Life Vision and Soul Alignment Guide for 4 years, and I have helped hundreds of lovely people catalyze their stuck into full on transformation to live more authentic lives that are good for them and good for this world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI usually tend toward heart-centered, authentic living, freedom-oriented aspirers. These folks often tend to be low-income, single mothers, hippies, dream-followers, people who have the heart to do big things in this world, but usually don\u0027t have a disposable income to pay the rates I need to charge to provide for my family.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you support my life purpose, I get to offer private sessions and unlimited content (videos, programs, e-books, articles, etc) at no cost. So, I get to give fully on a need-basis, not a cost-basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to live in a world full of joyful good-hearted people who are living their dreams, and I\u0027d love if you could support me in doing my part to make that happen. The work I do is powerful. I have RAVE reviews on my website, and I would love to cut out the middle man (cost) between people feeling lost + struggling and people living their bliss + contributing to this world being a happier better place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution (of as little as $1/mo) makes it possible for me to do my greatest work. In return, you will receive success stories from the lovely people you enable me to work with, and you will have easy access to all of my free content to share with whomever I can be of service to in your world \u2764\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my tribe \u2764\u003cbr\u003e"
