I was born in the german city Ludwigshafen/Rhein, which lies in the southern part of Germany and lived there 19 years. After those 19 years of having a save home and always warm food on the dinertable my life took a rather drastic turn. I left my mothers house and into my own first appartment. there i was soon after kicked out because the landlord needed it himselve. after that i lived on the streets for two years more or less.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere i learned to know my fiancee and soon husband who helped me and helped me get a new appartment where i live right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat was my life untill now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are my hobbies?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOh another easy question? Nice...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell my hobbies are (in order biggest to smallest) listening to music, playing PC games like Guild Wars 2 (worth checcking out) , vaping E Cigarettes (yeah i know they are ment to quit smoking but they can quite easiely mutate into a collectable or other kind of hobby). I love to write fantasy stories takeing place in the \"Furry universe\" too but i don\u0027t seem to be really good at it so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are my motivations in life?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy motivations are not much. Mostly it is my absolutely awesome soon-to-be husband. But what get\u0027s me through the day aswell is music. That\u0027s why i decided to change my youtube channel from vaping to music reaction videos to share my favorite songs with everyone of you and let you show me other songs and bands that i might love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat sentence describes your life the best?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\"Expect the worst but hope for the best... that way you never get dissapointed.\"",
