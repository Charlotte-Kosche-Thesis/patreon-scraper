    "summary": "\u003ch4 style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\nNew Patreon, Who Dis?\u003c/h4\u003e\nHi, I\u0027m Nick Trujillo! I\u0027m an illustrator from Seattle Washington and you can find my work\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://nick-trujillo.myportfolio.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mynty/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, and sometimes\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/myntyfresh\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve done work in animation, commercial storyboarding, tabletop board game illustration, comics, shirt design, and much much more. In 2014, I struck out on my own to make a living for myself freelancing hoping to eventually transition into living off of my own stories, products, and illustrations. This Patreon page is part of what it\u0027s going to take to get me there, so thank you SO much for taking the time to visit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\nNeat, So What\u0027s Your Endgame?\u003c/h4\u003e\nThe goal here is for me to be able to earn enough to experiment more. Make more. Try more. To get in there and create art, stories, videos, comics, streams, posters, stickers, shirts, and whatever else my mind wants to create to express itself. And to be able to do this FULL TIME. By supporting me here, no matter what level, you are directly enabling that goal!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\nWhat\u0027s Getting Shared Here?\u003c/h4\u003e\nMostly personal work. Illustrations that I can take time in doing that aren\u0027t owned by other entities or people. A vast majority of my work is for contract or commission, so I can\u0027t share those here. But with every dollar earned here, that will open up more free time to make more art! This will be sketches and illustrations to start, with the hopes to grow into making posters, stickers, comics, and tutorial videos.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\nWhat Bonuses Do I Get as a Patron?\u003c/h4\u003e\nEvery tier will get access to my production blog, and high resolution illustrations on a weekly basis. Once I\u0027m able to afford to make physical product and comics, being a patron will allow for rewards like discount codes and early access. Higher tiers enjoy things like layered PSD files, postcards, and prints on a monthly basis.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\nDope, I\u0027m in. Now What?\u003c/h4\u003e\nGreat! All you have to do is pick a tier on the right that you feel comfortable with and wham! You\u0027ve instantly made my day better. You can go back and get previous rewards, or just wait around for me to post some new ones. Thanks so much for the support! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0026lt;3 NT"
