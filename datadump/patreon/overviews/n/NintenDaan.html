    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHitting the restart button\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA moment comes in your life where you are\nstanding between two roads. One leads to an unknown future, while the other\nguides you a path that you didn\u0027t think about before. Over the past ten years,\nI have done a variety of things about video games. It varies from talking in\npodcasts to writing long articles that give my vision on a game. This has been\nan incredibly fun and rewarding journey, where I made many friends and got to\nspeak to people that make and play games. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile I was seeking my next venture, an\nepiphany hit me. What if I could make writing the main focus of my life for an\nundecided time? Currently, however, that seems impossible. I am not getting\nfunded by any outlet in a crazy way and seeking new places would mean leaving\nthe places I love in the dust. Next to that, the main place where I get funds\nto cover games comes from YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy problem is what my YouTube channel has\nbecome. It is a place where you can see pure gameplay without chatter. There is\na niche that really enjoys it and I don\u0027t think that I want to take that away\nfrom them. I have no intention of stopping that channel altogether, closing up\nshop and just focus on something that is solely a gaping hole. At the same\ntime, writing and talking about games gives me way more joy than most people\nrealize.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt is why my preview articles are so crazy\nlong, because I love to take games apart and see how they are built. The same\ngoes for posting news on GoNintendo, which creates discussion and fun chatter\nbetween fans. And then we have the podcasts, which I want to bring back in a\nbig way. It is why Double Dash Radio was created. It will be a new place for\naudio experiments, a new way to handle discussions and a place without a fully\npainted canvas. We can make it whatever we want it to be in this new place on\nthe internet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe reason why I made this Patreon is simple.\nAfter ten years, I want to swift my focus and do a variety of different things.\nIt is likely that not every single idea is going to succeed, but I want that\nfeeling back where there are no constraints any longer. If I want to write\nabout how I played a new game, I want to do that. If there is a possibility to\ntalk the ins and outs of the Monster Hunter franchise, I love to do that for\nlike an hour or three. At every step of the way, I feel that I am hitting a\nwall that I can\u0027t get past.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith your support, you are not only giving me\na boost, but also the places that I talk with actively. GoNintendo, Nintendo\nWorld Report, N1ntendo and Nintendo Force will all benefit from someone who can\nI think games seven days a week. It breaks away the walls of doubt and makes\nway for new chances like long term features or researched content. For that, I have some amazing ideas with interviews, opinion\npieces and daily content. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNext to the writing, there will be broadcasts\nfrom Double Dash Radio, which will feature the audio interviews and discussions\nthat I love. With an additional mixture of musical programming, I think I could\nhave a lot of fun putting live an pre-recorded shows together. You are free to\nsubmit shows of your own if you so desire. It isn\u0027t a requirement that you\nsubscribe to the Patreon though. Any person with a good idea or distinct\nversion can come down to virtual doorstep. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFinally, YouTube will continue. Next to your\ngameplay video of the day (maybe two), there is a second channel (with zero\nmonetization) where Double Dash Radio bits and additional content will be\nposted. There are ideas to look at old Nintendo merch, doing First Look Rewinds\non retro games and create additional shows where we would talk actively. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo what do you think? Are you willing to take\nme by the hand and jump in? I will be appreciative about any backers coming my\nway, because gambling on somebody you don\u0027t know is a huge risk. Every single\none of you gets the guarantee that you can call or contact me at any given\nmoment. If there are concerns, I want to take them on and discuss them in any\nway that I can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you. Not only for putting up with me\nover ten years, but also for reading this through from beginning to end. Let us\nmake some beautiful things happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWords of encouragement\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"If I have ever found myself undecided on a video game, there are only a handful of people that I turn to for their thoughts, and one of those is Daan. Despite his passion and love for Nintendo, he is completely unbiased, and always prepared to give you his honest opinion on whether a game is worth your time or not. I have had the pleasure of knowing Daan for a number of years and consider him a good friend. He has always been a committed and hard working guy who always gives it his all.\"\u003c/em\u003e - Darren Kerwin, Shinesparkers/Harmony Of A Champion\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Daan is one of the most enthusiastic and dedicated Nintendo fans I know, tackling any and all games while also following fresh releases in Japan. On top of that he\u0027s a gentleman, always willing to share information and help others.\"\u003c/em\u003e - Thomas Whitehead, NintendoLife\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Daan Koopman is one of the hardest working writers and video content creators in the Nintendo fan community. If you are someone who keeps up with Nintendo news on a daily basis, then chances are high that you\u0027ve seen his work at some point. He regularly writes previews, hands-on impressions, and reviews for Nintendo World Report. On a regular basis, he has helped Kevin Cassidy (Rawmeatcowboy) with GoNintendo every week. I had a chance to work with Daan Koopman during my years at Nintendo Force Magazine, and he was always a class act who showed kindness to everyone on the staff. There have been so many moments in the past where Daan has helped me with something. I am very grateful to have a wonderful friend like him in my life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over seven years, NintenDaan\u0027s (current) YouTube channel has proven to be an excellent source for gameplay footage of upcoming games. With over 66 thousand subscribers, his channel has brought attention to indie games that would have otherwise flown under the radar and been ignored.\" \u003c/em\u003e- Emily Rogers\u003cbr\u003e"
