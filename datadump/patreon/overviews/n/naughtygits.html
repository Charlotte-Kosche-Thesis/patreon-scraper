My name is Calley Nye and I\u2019m the founder of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://naughtygits.com\"\u003eNaughty Gits\u003c/a\u003e - a clothing line I\u2019ve designed specifically for women in STEM. To be honest, we sell men\u2019s clothing too, and children\u2019s, but the real goal is to focus on helping women in tech. Here\u2019s the thing, the \u201ctech wardrobe\u201d of today often consists of jeans, t-shirts, and hoodies. Ugh. And if you step outside that, you might risk losing some \u201cgeek cred\u201d or calling some unwanted attention to yourself at the open floor plan you call work. I want to fuck that shit up. Or at least add options for women by providing clothes that they feel good in, while manifesting a new type of geek cred of the feminine variety.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eCheck out Naughty Gits and all of our current products!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://naughtygits.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClick here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1830/8509/files/monokai_2048x.jpg?v=1497148912\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMy Story\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s my story. One day I found myself staring at at minified JS file. I thought to myself \u201cyou\u2019re so pretty, I wish everyone could see you\u201d. I looked down at my legs. Lightbulb. \u201cPeople like to look at legs.\u201d This same thing happened over and over. But I\u2019m a developer, I don\u2019t know anything about designing clothes. Plus I have always had a love-hate relationship with fashion. I love it, it hates me.  Throughout my life clothes have never really felt right, neither for my personal style nor my body type. So for years I shopped at Old Navy and called it a day. This approached worked fine for the startups that I worked for, as my career progressed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I co-founded a company recently, I realized that you can just \u201cmake things\u201d (I know, what a concept). So I did. I wanted JS leggings. I made JS leggings. And other things too. At first it was all print-on-demand goods, which were fairly easy to get off the ground. But as I began producing more and more pieces, the vision of what this might become started to really materialize. Let\u2019s imagine a girl in high school who really digs technology. She reads sci-fi, sits in the front of class, and spends her nights in front of her computer/smartphone/tablet. She might be made fun of, considered a nerd, and laughed at. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what we in the development community know that she and her classmates might not know is that tech is fucking cool. Imagine that same world, but all the cool girls are wearing JS leggings. Their instagramming photos of themselves in smash(patriarchy) t-shirts. They\u2019re owning it. Tech is cool. How might that change this girl\u2019s life and impact her future? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy Become a Patron\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a lot of what I want to do that has proven to be more difficult. There is a lot of overhead to running a store, and a lot of times the profits don\u2019t cover it all. I\u2019ve become increasingly more and more frustrated in a lot of print-on-demand services and their lack of inclusive sizing. I\u2019m a plus-sized woman, and I can\u2019t even wear a lot of the clothing we sell. It\u2019s bullshit. Yes, I can wear the leggings (thank God!), but almost none of the t-shirts fit right. With the holidays coming up there is a lot to prepare and do in the next month, as I want to provide all the geeky gals out there (regardless of body type) lots of cool gifts to choose from \u0026amp; receive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere your money will go:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u2019d like to engage with a new distributor that offers more flattering and inclusive sizes and styles. This requires more of an investment than the current set up, and I\u2019d like to get some options churning before Black Friday.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u2019d like to hire an assistant to help me with the day-to-day running of the store. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere\u2019s a lot of consistent overhead for running a store with inconsistent returns. With some steady income from patrons, it would lighten the load.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u2019d like to partner with some talented designers to take the designs up a notch. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u2019d like to upgrade the site and branding.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd I\u2019d like to do all of this while securing a steady enough income that I can dedicate more of my time and donate a portion of all sales to a charity that helps girls get into STEM.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to that regard, I\u2019m asking folks to step up and help support my mission and my company. There\u2019s so many bad ass, smart women out there, and with your help, I can make sure that they know it. That they can feel like they belong in the industry they\u2019ve dedicated themselves to. And ensure that the next generation has even more opportunities. Please support women in STEM and Naughty Gits. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI love you all!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Calley :)\u003cbr\u003e"
