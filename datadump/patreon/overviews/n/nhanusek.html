     "about": "Why reproduce a photo as a drawing or painting? Because it\u2019s not simple reproduction\u2014it\u2019s reinvention. I\u2019ve always been able to make a faithful version of the original picture, but the joy in it for me isn\u2019t in the purely technical. It\u2019s in creating my own interpretation of that still moment:  from turning an orange Bengal tiger into a blue dream cat that didn\u2019t exist before, to leaving out electrical wires in a streetscape and embracing bold colors in the scene as a way of heightening the composition\u2019s impact on the viewer, I have control over the painting in a way that lets me say precisely what I want to say.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEmbracing that kind of joy is why I became an artist. When I was ten, I started drawing mermaids. I obsessed over it, and came up with clean two- and three-color palettes. By the time I was in seventh grade, the Little Mermaid was everywhere and when I drew her for myself, I felt the connection and I knew that I wanted be an artist. I dedicated myself to art in high school, and went off to the Savannah College of Art and Design. After a year, I came back to my native Ohio and transferred to the Cleveland Institute of Art and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Art in Illustration in 2000. I\u2019ve been working as a professional artist and designer since.\n\u003cbr\u003e",
