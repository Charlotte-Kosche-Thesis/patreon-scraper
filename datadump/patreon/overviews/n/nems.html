I feel like I\u0027ve created something that needed to be created. Nagios is notoriously difficult to setup and configure, and I\u0027m working hard to make NEMS the easiest out-of-the-box experience ever -- and one that runs on affordable hardware.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou\u0027re here with me at the start of something great. Years from now, you and I will look back and say, \"Wow, it started there. I helped build this.\" and that\u0027s exactly what Patreon helps you to do: help me build this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eLet\u0027s do this together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI know there are some NEMS users who simply wanted to give it a try to see what it\u0027s all about. But then there are those of us who deployed NEMS Linux for a very specific reason: to save many, many hours of work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eTo the first group, I hope you\u0027ll consider becoming a Patron having found NEMS to be a great tool on your network. For the second group, I hope you\u0027ll acknowledge the time NEMS has saved you, and take this on as an expense. I\u0027ll never charge for NEMS, but Patreon lets you say \"Wow, this is a great service Robbie is providing, and I want to help him do it by putting some money into it each month.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eNo matter your reason for being here, pick the tier you\u0027re most comfortable with, and let\u0027s make NEMS the best it can be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eRobbie Ferguson // The Bald Nerd\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNEMS Status\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNEMS is an established product. The first release was on May 8, 2016. Since then, there have been several major releases and exciting progress to get NEMS to where it is today. Check out the changelogs to see for yourself:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://docs.nemslinux.com/changelogs\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://docs.nemslinux.com/changelogs\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout NEMS Linux\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003eNEMS Linux (\u003ca href=\"https://nemslinux.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enemslinux.com\u003c/a\u003e), short for Nagios Enterprise Monitoring Server, is a modern pre-configured, customized and ready-to-deploy Nagios Core image designed to run on low-cost micro computers. At its core NEMS is a lightweight Debian Linux deployment optimized for performance, reliability and ease of use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNEMS Linux is free to download, deploy, and use. It is created by Robbie Ferguson (that\u0027s me!)--the host of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://category5.tv/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCategory5 Technology TV\u003c/a\u003e. As a free product, NEMS\u0027 development is supported by its community of users. Your patronage will help me further improve NEMS, offset the cost to operate, code, update and distribute NEMS, and even allow me to do things like purchase other SBC\u0027s to port NEMS Linux to. I also dream of being able to buy ad space to promote NEMS, and would even like to be able to afford to donate NEMS appliances to charities who could benefit from it.\u003cbr\u003e"
