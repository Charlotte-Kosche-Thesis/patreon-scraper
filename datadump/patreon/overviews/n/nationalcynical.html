These programs are in a long-playing AUDIO COLLAGE format and are made up of transformed pieces of sound taken, and recycled from the media environment through an artistic work process. The overall tone of these mixes is psychedelic and stream-of-consciousness in format.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the same way MTV in 1983 housed many works of the (then) new artform \u0027music video\u0027 (as well as its own programming) so too does the NCN project act as a receptacle or venue for other accredited \u0027recycled media\u0027 or \u0027found sound\u0027 works, such as bastard pop, mash-ups, media collages, version medleys, parodies, covers, remixes, and anything musically NEW and UNIQUE made out of pre-existing material. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn our programs, we explore UNIVERSAL themes in a very SUBJECTIVE way, representing our own MAGNIFIED PERSPECTIVE on the subject matter at hand to create a compelling listening program. We seek to communicate our experience of the media, as well as give listeners a way to discover new and obscure music and create a sonic collage album of AUDIO snapshots taken withing the current MEDIA ENVIRONMENT at the time of their creation.\u00a0Note that some of the programs that are not marked \u0027radio edit\u0027 may be NSFW in tone and subject matter. Listener discretion is advised.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIdeally, the BEST podcast programs, the FAVORABLE MUTATIONS, become more than the sum of their parts and exist as audio documentaries representing the cultural conversation, and zeitgeist, of their subject matter at hand.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been favorably reviewed by Boing Boing, The San Jose Metro, The San Jose Mercury News and the late George Carlin characterized our efforts as \u0027tremendous\u0027 and \u0027fabulous\u0027.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are not asking for money in exchange for content, but rather asking for pledges to help support the work, time, and expense, that goes into creating and maintaining the podcast and website.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have created over 100 shows, in our podcast archives and on Mixcloud, and want to continue! But we need financial support. Even a revolving donation of $1 per month is helpful to us if we get enough supporters!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are affiliated with The Church of the Subgenius and our network has been called \u0027An Outreach Ministry to the Latent Einsteins in Our Listening Audience\u0027 as are other SubGenius-oriented radio shows in existence such as WREK\u0027s \"Bob\"\u0027s Slacktime Funhouse, The Puzzling Evidence Show on KPFA and Hour of Slack which is on WCSB. Our radio program/podcast is similar to the radio program of the band Negativland, Over the Edge, from which we take inspiration and direction. We stream our shows live as well as make them available on our podcast and/or Mixcloud page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

From making mixtapes back in the 1970\u0027s, to writing for various \u0027zines\u0027 in the 1980s, to his radio collaborations with groups such as Negativland, The Bran Flakes, and The Evolution Control Committee in the 90\u0027s and 2000\u0027s, Phineas has communicated his own magnified perspective in the form of his radio programs and writings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to Science Fiction author John Shirley, Phineas is a saint in his own Church. Phineas founded The National Cynical Network in 2000 as an umbrella project for a group trio of South Bay artists. It later became a solo project, then a network of unique and interesting collage-styled programs, offering an alternative course of programming as well as being a commentary on, and parody of, mainstream media. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe late iconic comedian George Carlin has called the work \u0027fabulous\u0027 and \u0027just tremendous\u0027 and the project has been reviewed favorably by The San Jose Metro and The San Jose Mercury News.",
