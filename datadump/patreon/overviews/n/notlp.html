My wife Amy and I (along with friends Andy, Kelley, Chiseck and Mikey B) have been producing the weekly horror film discussion podcast Night of the Living Podcast for eleven years as of this writing. We started the show back in 2006 using some recording gear that I had laying around from my days as an aspiring musician. I was about to sell the gear and hang up my creative hat for the foreseeable future. Resigned to a life of 9-to-5 drudgery followed by evenings in front of the TV. Then, Amy discovered a podcast called Keith and the Girl and thought that if they could do this thing maybe we could too. The rest is history.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the past decade, our audience has grown beyond our wildest expectations. We\u0027ve become great friends with the creators of HorrorHound Magazine and this opened up countless opportunities for us to cover their bi-annual conventions and access to creators that otherwise would be out of reach for the average pro-am journalist. Our friend Matt has been running our server out of his home during this entire journey. This has saved us money, but honestly this show would have bankrupt long ago if it wasn\u0027t for listener support.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA handful of listeners have kept NOTLP.com\u0027s head above water through generous individual donations. However, we never had a formal fundraising system in place to cover the recurring expenses associated with producing the podcast and the website. Right when we\u0027re about to run out of funds and begin questioning how we will continue doing this show that has become a hugely important part of our lives, a few of you arrive like the cavalry and save the day.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen Patreon first came on the scene, we were apprehensive about asking our listeners to become patrons of the show. The system we had in place (accepting PayPal donations and mailing tee shirts as a thank you) seemed to work OK and we weren\u0027t sure that we wanted to rock the boat. That said, it just makes more sense that if a listener is interested in supporting a show that consistently releases content each month, we should allow for consistent monthly donations. If 100 listeners donated $1.00 each per month, NOTLP as you know it could continue indefinitely. If we see more support, we\u0027ll commit to creating bigger and better content (remotes from interesting destinations like film festivals domestic and abroad, convention coverage, live shows and meet ups with listeners in your town, etc).\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, let\u0027s see how this goes! Let us know what you think.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for your ongoing support,\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFreddy Morris\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
