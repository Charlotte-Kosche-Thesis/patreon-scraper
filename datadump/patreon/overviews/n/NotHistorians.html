    "summary": "Hi.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are Desmon and Shalom, but if you are here then you probably know us or have heard us as the hosts of The Not Historians Podcasts. If not, check out an episode on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://nothistorians.podbean.com/\"\u003ePodBean\u003c/a\u003e or\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-not-historians-podcast/id1200497921?mt=2\"\u003e iTunes\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal from the start was to better ourselves. We both fancy ourselves as intelligent fellows, but neither of us was (or is) that strong in history and history really affects everything we do, it\u0027s the story of us, how we got here, the universe. So there\u0027s no excuse not to take a closer look. Which what we try to do and have a little fun doing it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe goal of the podcast\u00a0is two-fold, to share our passion for learning history, and to entertain people as we do it. Neither of us is an expert researcher or a historian (thus the title) but we are pretty skilled students and the appeal that we hope we have is that despite so many history podcast is just that... We aren\u0027t authorities or pretending to be, we are average dudes, who are bettering ourselves and share that with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruth is we just want to share our journey because we want to show people that there is no reason for ignorance, you just need a library card and/or the internet. That\u0027s it...and maybe teach people something along the way.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe can\u0027t do this alone, though. We\u0027re investing our time and money to get off the show \u00a0ground and we will continue to. However, with extra every dollar we get, we can improve the show. Whether it be to offset the cost of hosting, upgraded sound equipment, or journal subscriptions and museum admission. We want this show to grow and to be able to reach more people and to bring more everyone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo join us on an adventure into the unknown...and you know, help some brothers out.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
