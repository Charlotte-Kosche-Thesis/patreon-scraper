    "summary": "Music is a wonderful thing, and I make music because I LOVE it.  When artists share their creations, it makes the world a more beautiful place. I\u00a0hope that the music I create connects with people. That people feel not so alone when they hear it. I hope it heals and inspires. \u00a0If this feels important to you in some way, then this is the place where you get to help make more of that possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring my last 10 or so years of being an independent musician, I have learned that the most important thing I need for my music was my listeners. \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYOU are the ones who believe in me and my music, the ones who support the creation of my music, and the ones who allow me to do what I love everyday. From now on, you are invited to be even more connected to my music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you\u2019ll hear new music before the rest of the world! \u00a0Yes--new music is on the way. This year, I\u0027ll be releasing one song at a time.  One about love for Valentine\u2019s Day, one about family near Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day, one about friendship in the fall, and a holiday song at the end of the year. \u00a0Patrons will have the opportunity to contribute photos to a \"Patron Photo Video\" for each new song. \u00a0I also plan to make official music videos, lyric videos, and performance videos throughout the year. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are all equally important to me when it comes to my music. My music has purpose because you LISTEN. \u00a0So if supporting me in this way is not possible or appealing to you, that\u0027s fine! My videos will always be available to you for free, my songs will always be released in all the usual places. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also excited to develop and launch some new events this year: \u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Capturing Life Performance-Workshop\u003cbr\u003eIn \"Capturing Life\" I share about the creative process and guiding others to capture their own life stories and memories through journaling, poetry, and songwriting. I can\u2019t wait to help others on their own path to creativity! \u00a0Patrons will be invited to workshops first, and have an exclusive opportunity to secure their spot. I hope to offer this workshop online as well, and patrons will be the first to know about it!\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Music and Legacy Concert-Presentation\u003cbr\u003eIn \"Music and Legacy\" I present original songs that preserve the stories and legacies of the people and occasion they were composed for. The program also includes songs from the Saving His Music project, which is my work to preserve the music of Steven Goodwin, a local composer with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Annual Concert Fundraiser for music programs at Portland Homeless Family Solutions\u003cbr\u003eMore information on this soon! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for believing in me and my music. Your support helps to make all of these plans possible! \u00a0Thank you for being my team of patrons. Let\u0027s go make some wonderful music together.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eNaomi\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3\u003eFrequently Asked Questions\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eHow many songs and videos will you release?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan for this year is to release four singles somewhat seasonally, and one video per month. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027d like to attend a \"Capturing Life\" workshop. \u00a0When will these be offered? \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe workshop is in the development / launch stage. \u00a0Patrons will be the first to know about workshop dates, and the first people given an opportunity to secure a spot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eCan I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes of course!
