I\u0027m a freelance comic artist, printmaker and illustrator and am here to share insights into my studio like a diary and send out a print subscription based on my Risograph explorations each month. With your support I can produce more of my own work and experiment more with the Risograph printing process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll try and share my knowledge on everything I do creatively. That ranges from printing, making editorial illustrations, self publishing comics, working on a graphic novel, illustrating YA novels, running online stores, selling work at comic festivals and working entirely digitally. I love to share tips and information with friends and I think this is a great platform for me to spill the beans to you too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you\u0027ll see here:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on your level of patronage, you\u0027ll see sketches, works-in-progress, PSD files and layouts, PDFs of my comics, inspiration and reference material, business/freelancer advice and tips and tricks I\u0027ve found to make creative freelance life easier. You\u0027ll see a lot more of my Risograph work and process in the Risograph Print Subscription tier.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://payload548.cargocollective.com/1/1/63754/13266691/product_image_670.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a cartoonist and illustrator currently living and working in Brooklyn, New York. I\u2019m originally from Charlotte, North Carolina and went to school at Ringling College of Art and design in Florida, graduating in 2013. I work regularly for editorial clients like The New York Times, NPR and Charlotte Magazine as well as for YA book clients like Penguin Random House, Simon \u0026amp; Schuster and Harper Collins. I\u0027m currently working on a graphic novel adaptation of The Nutcracker and The Mouse King with First Second which is due out late 2019. I self publish my comics and print them using a Risograph and table at comic festivals fairly regularly. In 2016 I was the Artist in Residence at the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://risolab.sva.edu/artist-residence\"\u003eSVA RisoLAB\u003c/a\u003e and have been printing there consecutively since.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Risograph?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think of what a Xerox machine and a screen printing process\u0027s baby would look like it\u0027s Risograph. The images are printed using a screen burning process that happens entirely inside the Riso machine so you don\u0027t need a massive studio for screen pulling or a dark room for emulsion burning.\u00a0The Risograph makes a stencil or \u0027master\u0027 of your image via thermal laser burning and wraps it around a large cylindrical drum that acts as the screen frame. Paper then runs flat through the machine while the drum rotates at high speeds, pushing soy-based ink through the master to create each image on the paper. The result is a vintage looking spot color print with a grain or screen tone texture that becomes richer as the colors are layered on top of one another. Risograph was originally intended as an environmentally friendly alternative to copy printers in schools and businesses but was quickly adopted by artists for it\u0027s beautiful quality and it\u0027s accessibility, fostering experimental production. A Risograph can make small print quantities for cheaper than most printing processes and is a very hands-on process where artists can be in control of their production. The\u00a0Riso company is still astonished that artists are using their machines to make multi-layered prints and books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://payload457.cargocollective.com/1/1/63754/11452851/IMG_6467_670.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Risograph Print Subscription Tier:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve chosen the Print Subscription reward on the rewards tier then you\u2019ll be getting a Risograph print from me every month, straight to your doorstep!\u00a0The prints will often be small but ranging in size, around 4x6 up to 8.5x11. The prints will always be new and depicting a subject meaningful to me, most likely a tough girl on some kind of adventure. In addition to the physical print I\u0027ll share behind the scenes process into making the piece, the digital image it\u0027s based off, plus the black and white final value separations. I\u0027ll also share my layer process and how I organized the file for printing, something that keeps evolving for me. You\u0027ll also get all the previous tier rewards so that will include any other Riso files that I produce other than the ones shipped to you, hi-res scans and tips I\u0027ve learned along the way.\u00a0I sell all my work in my online store and\u00a0I\u0027ll still be posting pics of these prints on social media\u00a0but some of these prints will only be available at comic festivals or exclusively for the Patreon subscribers. This tier also includes a discount to my online store if you\u0027d like to receive older prints!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow the Risograph Subscription Tier works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0On the 1st of every month you\u2019ll be charged the subscription fee of $15 USD (or more depending on your tier). \u003cbr\u003e- I\u2019ll ship out the prints on the 20th each month and send a reminder as well!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- ****If you become a Patron in the middle of the month you\u0027ll receive your prints in the following month. For example if you sign up on Feb 10th then you\u0027ll receive your prints around March 20th. I do this because if someone signs up in the middle of the month they aren\u0027t actually charged until the 1st of the following month. Until Patreon installs their \u0027Pay First\u0027 option then I\u0027ll have to keep it this way in order to make sure people don\u0027t sign up, receive the prints for free and then ditch. Thanks for understanding!***\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0I currently have one tier for US/CAN shipping and one for International shipping. Please choose your correct tier.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- If you choose this tier please make sure your address is correct and updated in Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e- If I\u0027m able to print more in a month then I\u0027ll send out more prints than just one! Some will be exclusive to Patreon and some will be fun little Riso experiments.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some samples of Riso Subscription prints so far:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://payload561.cargocollective.com/1/1/63754/13533838/IMG_4893_670.JPG\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://payload551.cargocollective.com/1/1/63754/13334698/IMG_2177-2_670.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://payload557.cargocollective.com/1/1/63754/13448354/IMG_3352_670.JPG\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther sites where you can find my work:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://natalie-andrewson.com\"\u003eMy Website\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/natAndrewson\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/natandrewson/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://natalie-andrewson.tumblr.com\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://natalieandrewson.bigcartel.com\"\u003eBig Cartel\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0My Online Store\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gumroad.com/natalieandrewson\"\u003eGumroad\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your consideration,\u003cbr\u003eWith love,\u003cbr\u003eNatalie\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://payload374.cargocollective.com/1/1/63754/9788776/LA_670.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I won\u0027t ship something to you on the other tier if you\u0027re not US or CANADA so this is the place for all other international orders! An 8x11, 3-5 ounce parcel costs roughly $5~ to ship internationally so this only covers shipping! You get everything from the original Riso Subscription tier.",
