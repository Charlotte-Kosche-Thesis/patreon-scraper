The Irregular will be just that: irregular. When there\u0027s breaking news, or we\u0027ve seen an awesome show, we\u0027ll launch a quick episode. A \"first draft of history\" that can happen at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNO PRO GOES PRO\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eNoPro is run by a talented team of passionate fans, creators, and curators led by yours truly: Noah Nelson. I\u0027m the idiot in the video up above.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nBy day I work in public media, wearing a dozen hats for a non-profit organization. By night -- and every other waking hour -- I\u2019m the spider in this immersive web. There\u2019s always an article to edit, a podcast to record, the Facebook group Everything Immersive (which we co-founded with the teams) to admin, and our Slack channel to keep up with.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nSomehow I\u0027ve also managed to work behind the scenes on organizing the immersive theatre creator community (check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://founding.leia.design/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLEIA\u003c/a\u003e for more info) and co-produced the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://immersivedesignsummit.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eImmersive Design Summit\u003c/a\u003e (which we\u0027re bringing back.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo keep up this crazy pace we HAVE to go pro: and that\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve set a big goal for the year: \u003cstrong\u003e$6000 a month\u003c/strong\u003e. Which seems immodest in the extreme.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this is the reality of media in 2018: a direct relationship between audience and publishers is the only secure path to stability. That number would merely mean we could have ONE full time staff member (um, me) with a travel budget that we could extend to the team as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOn the way there we\u0027ve got a lot of fun paths that open up: more VR coverage, meet-ups in cities we\u0027ve never been to, seminars, and live Town Hall interviews.

That\u0027s great. Maker knows I have a lot of ideas and hopefully some of them are good.

Any coverage of the project on NoProscenium will be CLEARLY FLAGGED as having a financial relationship.  That includes interviews and features. Those would be published as insider views, and then: only if we the editorial board were excited about it. So hiring myself (or any of the others) as a consultant doesn\u0027t gaurentee coverage. It actually makes it a little harder!  Other NoPro writers \u003cem\u003emay\u003c/em\u003e be dispatched to review the show, but we do not guarantee the availibility or the content of a review.  (The same is true for any workshop any of our writers are invited to. If our notes went in, the review must be handled by someone else.
