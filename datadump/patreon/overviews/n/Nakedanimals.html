He most recently had a song featured in the film, \" The Assignment,\" featuring Fast and Furious star Michelle Rodriguez, he has numerous major television song placements including, CSI - New York, The CW\u0027s. \" Tomorrow People,\" CBS\u0027 medical drama, \"Three Rivers,\" PBS\u0027 \"Roadtrip Nation,\" A\u0026amp;E\u0027s, \"The Cleaner,\" countless commercial ad campaigns for Pilot Pens Australia, Nissan and video games/app games like Apple\u0027s, \" Tap Tap Revenge,\" which has sold over 20 million downloads to date.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His partner and close friend is Cory Johnson, an outstanding local producer and singer/songwriter from Tallahassee, Florida.

This kept us in a constant question and head spin of what was truly the best way to connect with our fans directly; yet, financing our musical endeavors without the need of a label\u0027s support., or going into deep personal debt in some regard.\" \" I, now, truly believe upon waiting for a time period and seeing the various platforms and ideas cycle in and out,\u00a0 Patreon is the best model to help meet the artists short term and long term goals while keeping their supporters plugged in along the journey.\" \" I say thank you in advance to the developers and most importantly our partners and fans as we kick off this campaign!\" \u003c/em\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eJody Hicks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
