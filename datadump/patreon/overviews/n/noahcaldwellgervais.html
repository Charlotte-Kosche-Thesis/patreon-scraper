    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Noah Gervais. Thanks to the generous support of Patrons past and present, I\u0027ve finally gotten real professional games writing gigs. Without crowdfunding, I would have never had the time to develop my writing or my channel to the extent I needed to get to this point. I\u0027m always going to be grateful for role the generosity of strangers has played in moving my life forward in meaningful ways. Here\u0027s how I\u0027ll be using Patreon from here on out:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) The Channel is Still the Main Thing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not being employed by any publication as a full or part time employee, I\u0027m strictly freelancing. This allows me to pitch ideas and pick up work as I\u0027m able to do it and work is available. I\u0027m still aiming to produce at least one major 30 minute plus video per month for my channel, hopefully with a general average of an hour\u0027s worth of content per month. These videos are what I enjoy doing the most, and I\u0027m going to continuously produce them alongside any written/professional work. I know very well that the vast majority of patrons are donating to facilitate making these types of longform videos, and that\u0027s still priority number one. But neither can I ignore an opportunity to become increasingly employable as a legitimate game critic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) The Road Trip Is \u003cu\u003eOVER FOR NOW\u003c/u\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.Unfortunately, winter has arrived and my wife is tired of living in a 14x5 foot space, so the trip is over and I\u0027m back in Seattle. I\u0027m going to continue to continue to produce travel content, but I will be taking shorter solo trips going forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) No, I Won\u0027t Shut Up About Politics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t run a channel based on political content, but I do run my channel based on what I believe and what I value. Most of what I do is close reading of the text, whether a video game or a movie or whatever, but if I want to go into personal detail and personal conviction when exploring a topic, I\u0027m going to go ahead and do so. I don\u0027t feel like this channel has a point if I don\u0027t say what I mean. If that\u0027s bad news in your book, don\u0027t donate!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4) Don\u0027t Donate if It\u0027s Not Easy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a lot of people already contributing to this channel, and between that, freelancing, and my part time kitchen jobs, I\u0027m able to live comfortably and expand the scope of the channel. If you need money for you, keep it! But if you\u0027re a Real Adult Professional and want to help out someone still trying to find their way up the nonfiction ladder, I could surely use the help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5) Refunds Are Available Any Time For Any Reason\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes I have to make decisions of whether to delay content further or publish with some technical shortcomings to make the content available. Like my Fallout 4 DLC video-- my microphone was broken, and I had spent everything on bus parts and taxes, so it\u0027s either wait until next month to replace it or roll with the frustrating echo. I opted to roll with it. I\u0027m open to people being frustrated with these calls,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eand if a video doesn\u0027t live up to your standards I\u0027ll refund you the money you spent on its production. Similarly if you feel I\u0027ve offended or insulted you, I\u0027ll always at the very least give you your money back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon and the incredible community of support I\u0027ve received from viewers has transformed my life completely, bringing me all the way from rank amateur to novice professional. I\u0027ve had a haphazard time of it, I\u0027ve been wingin\u0027 it pretty hard, but I\u0027m continuing to challenge myself and produce both new content and new sorts of content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo a huge thanks to everyone who watches my videos-- whether you donate or not! But a special thanks for the folks who help me pay my bills. You\u0027re helping me live a life I\u0027ve been trying to stumble into for a decade or more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
