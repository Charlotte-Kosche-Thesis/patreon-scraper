    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Jackson Akitt (call me Jay!). I\u0027ve been working on the Non-Binary Portraits photography project since August 2016 to try and create more visibility for the non-binary community in its diversity. I myself identify as non-binary and am a recent graduate of the University of Brighton\u0027s BA (Hons) Photography degree course.\u00a0During this time, I\u0027ve photographed non-binary people across the England, Scotland, Wales and, more recently, the Netherlands. I also organise non-binary meet ups to encourage community building in Brighton, where I am based, but would love to take these further afield as I travel for the photography project too to places where similar groups don\u0027t yet exist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy does Non-Binary Portraits need support on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003eThe project is currently funded entirely at my own cost. I support myself through freelance photography work, whilst also seeking more stable employment (which I\u0027m finding difficult particularly due to my mental health).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe project costs occur each time I travel (whether locally or further afield) to meet another Non-Binary person to photograph them for the project, on top of the costs of buying film and having it developed. Whilst I scan the film at home myself to keep costs down, it is not currently practically possible to develop the film myself.\u00a0Though i could shoot the work digitally, this would drastically change both the outcome and the process of taking the portraits, which I think affects the quality and integrity of the project in turn!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you could spare a \u00a3 or two a month, or make a one-off contribution, you will be helping Non-Binary Portraits to continue, and thus widen and increase the representation of the non-binary community. If able to travel further or more regularly I can organise non-binary meet ups in smaller cities across the UK to allow the more isolated or unrepresented non-binary folks access a sense of community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU\u003cbr\u003eYour support means everything.\u003cbr\u003e"
