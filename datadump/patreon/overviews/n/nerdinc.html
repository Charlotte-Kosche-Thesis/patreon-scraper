But why? What\u0027s really going on?\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a big time lover of all things pop-cult/gaming/books and more hailing from a small corner of the UK, so small that the only way I can justify its existence to people is by saying that it is, \"\u003cem\u003enear Leeds\u003c/em\u003e\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to start up my own page because I simply love writing stories and the dream would be to do it full time (heck it beats having to pull pints to pay the bills). I enjoy creating new and varied characters and then throwing them into some crazy adventure and seeing where it all leads in the end. I like to think that I employ a wide variety of styles when it comes to my storytelling so there\u0027s everything from fantasy to sci-fi to absolutely god knows what\u00a0.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Essentially I\u0027ll have a crazy idea for a story, I\u0027ll bash a few ideas out for it and see what I think and if I feel strongly enough about it then I\u0027ll run with it and pitch it on here for you guys to see.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will have some stories which may run for quite a while, either as one continuous tale or as a collection of short stories in a connected universe. Other times I may have totally one-off stories which have just come to me that month and I\u0027ll write them up simply to see what you guys think of them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you get if you subscribe to me? Well, basically you get access. If you back me then you\u0027re basically saying, \"yeah I\u00a0wanna see what you got\" so at the very least my backers get a package of intro\u0027s to all the stories I currently have in the works for my Patreon. These are essentially synopses for each story with a short excerpt from each and an explanation as to why I wanted to the write them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs crazy as it may sound, I aim to have something publishable for each individual story every month if possible or at least some form of update on what\u0027s going on. I\u0027ll run rewards for you guys, the first of which is a D\u0026amp;D style session where we create our own characters/story together and then the dice will decide the rest.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting my Patreon you\u0027re effectively supporting me, this is a place for my work but this will also be my life and so you guys would be a part of that and I aim to be as engaging a Creator as you\u0027ve ever seen!\u003cbr\u003e"
