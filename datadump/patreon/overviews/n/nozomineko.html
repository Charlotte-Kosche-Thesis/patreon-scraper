    "summary": "Hey Everyone! Thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Dezi, and I\u0027m a freelance artist, here on Patreon to make art, illustrations, and comics (like it says above lol)! I\u0027ve been doing art for pretty much my whole life, and I would not be the same without it. It means a lot to me, and my ability to express myself in pictures the way I can\u0027t in words has really helped me through some difficult times. Art is life - at least for me! I\u0027m a Christian and a nerd, located in Wisconsin, USA, and draw mainly in an anime/manga style. I sell prints of my artwork and other products at anime and gaming conventions across the upper Midwest - when I get accepted, of course! I go by \"Nozomi Neko\" most places on the internet, so you might know me that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why am I here? Well, because art is awesome to do, but doesn\u0027t pay much LOL. I studied graphic design in college, and so far have been unable to find a career in my field. But, even though I studied graphic design, I found my real passion is illustration - storytelling through pictures. This passion led me to comics, and I fell in love. I\u0027d wanted to be an animator all through high school, but finding comics in college changed my mind. I just love the way that that particular form of sequential art tells its stories. Ever since, I\u0027ve been really hoping to get involved in the comics industry, and my big, impossible dream is to do so in Japan, essentially doing missionary work through the stories I write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure, these are all really cool things, but it doesn\u0027t explain why I need money. Well. I have had a series of unfortunate and complicated health problems throughout the course of my life. Sadly, most of them are permanent, and quite a few of them require monthly - sometimes weekly - doctor visits. And let me tell ya, that\u0027s expensive. Things were okay when I had insurance, but I\u0027ve recently lost my \"normal people\" jobs due to these health problems, as they\u0027ve been getting worse and not better. And when I lost my job, I lost my insurance. I have a pile of doctor bills as well as student loans and other debt that keeps increasing, and no income to throw at it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in, you lovely people! If you enjoy my artwork (or were moved by my sad story lol!), please consider pledging! Any amount is appreciated, no matter how small. I will do my best to create quality content for you at reasonable intervals if you will help me afford the doctor visits I need to stay alive. Sounds like a fair trade, right? You can get some pretty cool rewards based on how much you pledge, and those are detailed on the right side of the page. --\u0026gt; (More tiers/rewards may be added!) And even if you can\u0027t pledge, sharing this on your social media or anything else is just as appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time! Be good to each other! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDezi\u003cbr\u003e\"Nozomi\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(I will be posting a welcome video soon! Pretty sure I need to re-shoot it... The first attempt didn\u0027t go so well lol...)"
