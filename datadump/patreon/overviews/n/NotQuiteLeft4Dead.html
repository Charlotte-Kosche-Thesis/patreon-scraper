    "summary": "Thank you for arriving at my Patreon Page. It is sparse, humble beginning. However, it will only grow from here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a young novelist who has been struggling with the craft for years, until this very year. I have been writing and posting fragments of my novels onto blogs to positive reviews, which fueled my ability to write more and more. They tend to be horror-themed, though the actual settings and tone are quite different, they are all tied together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, despite finally hitting upon the inspiration needed to fulfill my dream of writing my stories for others\u0027 enjoyment, I have run into an issue that may prevent me from continuing. While my lodgings themselves are secure, the power, internet, water and groceries have a high chance of being cut off. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would only need this for as long as it\u0027d take to get another income source, which may be when I complete my novels and am published, or find some way to sell them. I know it is a lot to ask of people, so I hope that a lot of people can donate a little each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much, everyone. Every little bit helps. Don\u0027t feel bad if you can only give a dollar. I would be happiest if everyone only needed to give one dollar to help me achieve my goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I will always be willing to chat about my stories as I write them. Your support literally inspires me to write more and better. If you have any suggestions on better to improve my Patreon, whether or not it is adding reward tiers that better suit you or merely how to better word things on it, send them in and I will do my best.\u003cbr\u003e"
