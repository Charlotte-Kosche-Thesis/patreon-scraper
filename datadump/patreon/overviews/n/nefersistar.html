    "summary": "Hi everyone,\u003cbr\u003eWhen listening to my readings I strongly encourage you to pay close attention to the oracles and spiritual messages I provide for how to proceed. All general and personal messages coming through in my readings uncover hidden energies within people\u0027s environment so that they know what is circulating, blocking, or may be binding about their energy and those around them. I analyze what is occurring around you. There may be something important you need to know that a typical reading may not uncover and what a love and relationship reading may not highlight. I uncover hidden energies and share how they are working in your environment. It is better to be aware of what may be active and circulating to recognize what can happen before it affects the future of your reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Tarot readings are based on energies existing and circulating that can be binding. Control the outcome by knowing what\u0027s ahead and how to handle them. You can take steps to alter it by understanding why it is happening. Things that do not serve your best interest tend to yield unfavorable conditions. You can intercept the negatives before the causes affect your reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nefersistar.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThis link takes you to my website.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re new to Patreon, welcome.
