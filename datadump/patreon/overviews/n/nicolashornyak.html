    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Its beginnings stem from my freshman year, when I\nfaced my first midterm assignment in the creative writing program. The requirement\nwas simple: write a short story, 8-15 pages, double-spaced. And I agonized over\nwhat to do. Some of my classmates finished their work weeks ahead of me,\nclearly used to this type of request, but I\u2019d never written such a long piece\nbefore. What could I possibly write, though?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\n  The\nanswer came in a dream where, for the first time, I saw endless oceans,\nmountains becoming islands, and a man in his twenties sailing the new nations\nof the world with a teenager who was somehow his slave. These were the first\ncharacters to exist in the world of \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem style=\"\"\u003eAimless\nSky\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e: the captain Sky Ashworth and the royal slave Blue Windsor.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- excerpt from\u003cem\u003e Finding Aimless Sky: A Foreword\u003c/em\u003e, as published in the senior thesis \u003cem\u003eFour Stories from the World of Aimless Sky\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi there! My\nname is Nicolas Hornyak, and I\u0027m\u00a0a freelance writer, game designer, and composer from Brooklyn, NY.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u2019t just\nwrite short stories. I write a \n\u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of short stories. And my favorites always\nturn out to be part of their own series, with the same settings and characters. I had a few in my mind for a while, and finally, I decided to take a huge risk and put together my first novel off the style, which was entitled\u00a0\u003cem\u003eAimless Sky. \u003c/em\u003eOne successful collection run later, I\u0027m doing it again for the sequel, \u003cem\u003eNiagara Falls\u003c/em\u003e, and prepping for the third book in the trilogy, \u003cem\u003eBlue Nile Rush,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand it\u0027s all thanks to supporters like you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Nicolas_Hornyak/media/FE%20TRILOGY%20patreon%20page_zpsvef5t1c3.png.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah281/Nicolas_Hornyak/FE%20TRILOGY%20patreon%20page_zpsvef5t1c3.png\" style=\"width: 640px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI put this\nPatreon together because I wanted to spare more time to write, and perhaps someday, I can even make a living off of it!\u00a0In addition, I know a few people who would like to read\nmy stories, but until I discovered Patreon, there wasn\u0027t a very suitable method to\nrelease and distribute them on an as-is basis. Fortunately, Patreon makes all of that easy, and now I get to write at a pace that is fair to everybody, and receive at least a little compensation for the hard work of drafting, rewriting, revising, editing and more!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat should I expect?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy specialty is\nin speculative fiction, so expect quite a bit of science fiction and fantasy. I might occasionally release the standalone literary piece or one shot, but my\neventual goal is to put each collection together in a physical format, and perhaps better market them as novels in their own right. That\u2019s\nright, every dollar helps create actual books! And this also means I\u0027ll be keeping to the same universe most of the time, so you\u0027ll be able to follow along as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach short story is going to range in word count from 3000 to 10,000.\n\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eIt\n may not seem like a lot, and it\u0027s certainly a wide range, but I\u0027ve written incredibly compelling stories with less\n than that. Regardless, I aim to provide everybody with the \nsubstance a good story is made of, and I believe some of that quality \ncomes from a perfect length, hence the large window. We\u0027ve so far seen stories as big as 8000 words and as short as 4000, though, so if you want a more narrow window, that\u0027s it!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo how do I know you\u0027re a good writer?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRight off the bat, I\u0027ve studied at the creative writing program at Purchase College, which is incredibly selective and requires a portfolio for consideration when you apply. Additionally, the first four stories of\u00a0\u003cem\u003eAimless Sky\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0served as my senior thesis, and was\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ewell-received by professors, classmates, and readers here on Patreon. (I\u0027m...very happy about this development, to say the least.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut furthermore, the creators of Patreon developed this site with the intent to share their work with everyone, not just their patrons. Because of this, I offer the first half of each collection free of charge as it is constructed. In addition, the first story in each collection is always free to read if you aren\u0027t backing the collections yet. That means when the fourth story is released to backers, the second story will be made available to the public. When story six is released, a third will become available, and so one. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo sum this up, for every even-numbered story released in a collection, a previous story will be made available to the public. This allows for exclusivity to backers, since the second half of every collection will never be offered up for free, but also lets you judge for yourself if your money is well-spent here.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo answer the original question: give the stories a read if you\u0027ve got the time, and if they\u0027re right for you, consider offering a dollar each month to help me provide. Thanks!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does pledging work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you pledge, you aren\u0027t spending any money. You\u0027re only promising it as a payment until a short story is released. When it\u0027s released, only then is the pledged money collected. This means that your pledge is a recurring fee for smaller products, instead of the price for one big product. IT\u0027s like Kickstarter, but on a subscription basis, and the product is guaranteed. This plan lets creators like me keep creating product after product.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nShort stories are only released once a month. That means your pledge will only be collected once per month as well. And if, for any reason, a story isn\u0027t released one month, you will not be charged a single cent for that month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis Patreon is a big deal for me, and I\u0027m super excited. In advance, thank you so much for supporting an author with wild dreams!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eCollections\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"The Flooded Earth\"\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eAimless Sky\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 A YA science fiction, set in the future of the Flooded Earth, where climate\nchange has flooded the world, turned mountain ranges into island chains, and\nbrought politicians and dynasties to their knees.
