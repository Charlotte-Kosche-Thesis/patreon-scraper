    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Rina, aka Not Rina. I\u0027m currently a history student in college (set to graduate in May!) and I stream in my free time on Twitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI discovered my love for writing a few years ago for a project I had to do in high school English. I don\u0027t remember what I wrote and don\u0027t even possess the original piece anymore. However, I learned that I loved writing, despite how horrible I was at it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to 2016. I had some really bad experiences that year that brought upon really bad anxiety on me, something I\u0027ve never experienced before. I\u0027ve never really talked about it in public, and I don\u0027t feel the need to, but some of those closest to me know what happened to me, and how badly it messed me up. This is also around the same time I took my first Creative Writing class in college and I was hooked. I found ease in writing poetry, but writing short stories is what really got me thinking. I was addicted to the process of creating characters, choosing what happens to them, and making up scenarios that not only I could imagine, but scenarios that I could find other people relating to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI admit that my writing isn\u0027t the best, and that my skills are lacking. Even my college advisor told me that my writing needed work, which is why I took a creative writing course. However, the few I initially showed my short stories to loved them, and I hope you will too. Please do not support me on Patreon if your only intent is to just to criticize my work, but pledge to show support for me as a writer. Even if you can\u0027t pledge, you can show me love through my twitter/stream/discord and keep pushing me to write!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: You will be paid ONLY per short story that\u0027s released! You will NOT be charged monthly!"
