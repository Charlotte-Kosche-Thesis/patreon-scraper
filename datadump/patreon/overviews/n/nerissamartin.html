    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://nerissamartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hello2-1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, thanks for checking me out. Born in Toronto, Canada, I was raised in Mississauga, (at the time) a suburb of Ontario. \u003cstrong\u003eAs a kid my dream was to be like Pippi Longstocking: strong enough to protect the people I loved and confident enough to live the way I wanted\u003c/strong\u003e. At the time I didn\u0027t see anything \"wrong\" with the fact that she was white and I was black, but the older I got the more I noticed the main characters in the books, shows and movies I loved didn\u0027t look like me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThen I noticed their experience of life looked different than mine. The realization was slow in coming, but by the time my twenties hit I started to consider suicide.\u00a0My birth wasn\u0027t a mistake, but what happened to me afterwards was an aberration, I thought. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://nerissamartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/njm2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo one was meant to live a life like the one I had lived, no one would be expected to survive domestic abuse, isolation, depression, racism, and the other circumstances that made up my experience. Suicide was a better option.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe most notable piece of evidence to support this idea was that other people (particularly white people) led lives that were comfortable; easy, it seemed, when compared to mine. I found a disturbing connection between my race and my experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nA lot of work went into moving past that idea\u003c/strong\u003e. I went to therapists, self-help gurus, I learned to mediate and work out. I did yoga, went to intuitives, psychics and astrologers. I tapped into my own intuitive skills and bought every self-help book that came recommended, or that I picked up at a bookstore and answered a question I had. Eventually I started to choose different ideas; ones that wouldn\u0027t lead me to think about committing suicide. In trying to find ways to support these new ideas, I\u2019ve relied on curiosity, spirituality and imagination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOk, so why Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m ready. Is my stuff any good? Can I really do this? What if this doesn\u0027t work? I\u0027m not sure about any of it. So let\u0027s see what happens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfile Pic by Miguel Weston,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/whoismiguel\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@whoismiguel\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
