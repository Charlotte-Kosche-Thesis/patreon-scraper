You both are wonderful and I\u2019m blessed to have both of you!\u003cbr\u003eFor everyone else, thank you for visiting my Patreon page! I hope you enjoy your stay and join Deborah, Gina and myself on this artistic journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a self-taught artist who uses flowers to paint on canvas. And I cannot become the artist I want to be without Patrons! At this time I am working full-time at a job I love but have very little time to pursue my real passion, which is art. I\u2019m only able paint when I have a free moment. And of course I need to dedicate time to my fans, giving you all updates, sneak peaks, and a chance to purchase my artwork. So here we are, with me inviting you to join me on my journey so we can make my ideas into reality. I\u0027m so excited to include you all in my creativity and get your input. Patrons will have access to view all paintings that I work on, even test/practice ones. There will also be a tier for patrons to be able to request for me to make a painting from a specific flower. I want to build a community around my idea of how to be the best version of ourselves: Be Authentic. Be Unique. Be You.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
