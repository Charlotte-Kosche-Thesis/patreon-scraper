    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWho\u0027s there?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Nightbeca and I craft, paint and sculpt things. Whether or not your visit was intentional, I\u2019m really glad you have landed on my page\u00a0(:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you see here is the start of something big, huge for me in fact. This is the big turn in my life and I\u2019m here to tell you about it, to show it to you first-hand. And maybe, if you like it enough, you could even help me build it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor so many years I\u2019ve been working as a graphic designer. I used to draw every single day when I was a toddler. While growing up I got better at it and my first computer gave me the digital skill that led to video games, web design, corporative design and ultimately UI/UX. I also did some things with clay, I was good at it as well. I actually liked it a lot more than drawing and yet for some reason I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to make a living from it. So graphic design was the line of work I took.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd for a while (well, almost fifteen years :D ) it was cool. Very cool indeed. I had to expand my skill set to other related areas (such as HTML, CSS, copy) and this was also nice since I was learning new stuff all the time. But it was not enough. I could just feel I didn\u2019t have the same eagerness or excitement as before. I knew I had the strength to fully invest myself in getting better at whatever I was doing, I just didn\u2019t want to use it. It didn\u2019t feel compelling enough. It made me somewhat miserable to go to work every day with this feeling. I was scared to change, to do what I really wanted to do. Until now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to leave my job and started modelling in polymer clay. For real.\u003cbr\u003eWhat I do now and how badly I want to be better at it makes me feel simply amazing. This is where I want to invest all my time and effort. This is where I aim to be the very best (why the hell not?). But like all things in life it\u2019ll start from small bits that will evolve and grow into bigger pieces. And this is where you guys come in and can lend me a helping hand.\u00a0Whether I receive a patronage or a word of encouragement from you, I\u2019m going to use it to further improve myself and the quality of my crafts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo all that\u0027s left for me to say is, thank you so much in advance, your time reading this is also much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat will I find here?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe general theme of all my creations is very much influenced by things I liked when I was a child (back in the 80\u0027s) and which have remained in time as cult classics. Like movies (Alien, Dark Crystal, Cube), video games (Legacy Of Kain, Legend Of Zelda, Blades Of Vengeance, among others) books (Lord Of The Rings, IT, Mort and many more) and even music (Dethklok). But also contemporary discoveries in these fields such as The Kingkiller Chronicles book series, Skyrim videogame or Doctor Who TV show just to name a few.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this in mind, you will find unique decorative objects that will also bear a purpose: boxes, ball-jointed figures, lamps, home accessories and many more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you are curious or keen to see what I\u0027m up to, currently working on at the moment or planning to do, you know now where to find me, and I will gladly tell you all about it."
