    "summary": "Hello fellow art lovers and creators,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Naomi, sorry I have no video for you guys to watch and see a preview of my artwork due to the fact I only have a web cam and no YouTube channel as of yet. So please excuse this somewhat lengthy description I have written for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a self taught painter and sometimes I\u0027ll throw a little sketching into the mix (still on the journey of finding my own definite style). I paint with oils, acrylic, and also watercolor (just got some gouache paint so that soon as well). I will be posting up to about 5 times a week due to the fact that I have a job and work 12 hour shifts, and sometimes I just crash when I get home. So no worries, if you don\u0027t see me for a couple/few days just wait another day, I promise I won\u0027t make you wait as long as Sherlock or Doctor Who.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been inspired by some amazing artists which I will name at the bottom so you can look them up as well. They each paint in oils and watercolor (not sure about acrylics right off the top of my head), and all have different styles of their own. With the tutorials they have put out I have become a better artist myself and hope to become even better with time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came to Patreon because I noticed in the past, almost a year now, that so many artists had started their own page here and loved it. \u00a0They found it to be an amazing way to get their artwork out there whether it was made with paints, pencils, pens, video cameras, musical instruments, or even computers and some wonderful technology. I love to share my artwork with others and I think this will be the best way to start out doing so other than my Facebook page and my Instagram (both linked below). Now whether you create or collect or like looking at amazing artwork, or just want to help support others artwork we can find and support each other here on Patreon. With my pledges I have tried to make them simple and easy to do, but also fun and rewarding for whatever amount you decide on. And don\u0027t forget, you can edit or cancel at any time. :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you ever so much for the support and I am very happy that you have taken the time to visit my page and I hope you have a beautiful day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eN.V.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind me here :D\u003cbr\u003eFacebook:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FlightsOfWhimsey/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/FlightsOfWhimsey/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut also here :D\u003cbr\u003eInstagram:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/flightsofwhimsy23/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/flightsofwhimsy23/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe artists I mentioned before\u003cbr\u003eThe first one I found:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/LenaDanya\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/LenaDanya\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second one I found:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/happydartist\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/happydartist\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third one I found (through the second):\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/liobabrueckner\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/liobabrueckner\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
