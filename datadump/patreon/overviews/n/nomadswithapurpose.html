    "summary": "We are a family that travels the world in search of adventure in the form of rock climbing, surfing, hiking, mountain biking, and getting lost in nature. \u00a0Our family consists of Robyn and Victor and their five kids Daniel (18), Gabi (16), Isabelle (13), Jiraiya (9), and Tatiana (6). \u00a0Three years ago we questioned the status quo, sold everything we owned, and moved into a 30-foot RV. \u00a0We loved mountains so we began road tripping around the USA and Canada. \u00a0But our rebellion didn\u0027t end there. \u00a0The wanderlust took over and we spent 6 months camping in Europe and traveling to 15 countries. \u00a0We loved nomadic life! In Europe, we decided to create\u00a0a blog called NomadsWithAPurpose. Our purpose being to\u00a0inspire you to travel more and live a playful and adventurous life. Our journey continues as we seek high mountain peaks, epic trails to hike and bike, and beautiful waves to surf. \u00a0We do it together and we do it with boldness. After\u00a0all, the family that plays together\u00a0stays together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRobyn and Gabi are the ones that write these adventure tales. \u00a0When you join us here on Patreon you get access to an exclusive collection of stories--never-before-seen-stories about a life of adventure with your family as well as the humor and struggles of being on the move--being nomads. \u00a0These tales tell the epic and often comical stories of once-in-a-lifetime experiences like climbing up a multi-hundred-foot face with your kids, cliff jumping into ice cold water also with your kids, traumatizing your kids by almost getting them lost in a lava tube cave, and hearing your 9-year-old son climb mountains and say, \"Mom, I think I was born to do this.\" \u00a0These tales tell of living small, being together, and escaping conformity. \u00a0These tales tell of a family\u0027s purpose-- to live with intention and determination for happiness and adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"How do you guys make a living?\" A question we relentlessly receive. \u00a0Well, when it all started we saved up, after all without rent or bills to pay we didn\u0027t need that much. Then we discovered that blogging could be a job, that we could make enough money to continue to travel with our website NomadsWithAPurpose. \u00a0Our determination and persistence is there but it\u0027s a well-known fact that it takes a while for blogs to make some money. \u00a0Does that mean we are giving up? NO. We\u0027re looking for other ways to share our passions, knowledge, and guidance whilst continuing to build our blog until it works for us."
