     "about": "I\u0027m a comic artist and freelance illustrator currently living in Nashville, TN.  I have a MFA in Sequential Art from SCAD: College of Creative Careers, and a BS in Hypermedia from the University of New Orleans. While I\u0027m skilled with a variety of media, my favorites include watercolor and alcohol based marker rendering.  When I\u0027m not working on illustration or comics, I\u0027m usually attending conventions, presenting panels, or updating this blog.  My hobbies mainly revolve around art and finding new inspiration- I enjoy testing and reviewing art supplies, going on sketch adventures, and volunteering my artistic knowledge in a variety of ways including teaching.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy focus is kid friendly media, and this includes my current comic project,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nattosoup.com/kara-comic\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e7\" Kara\u003c/a\u003e.  I enjoy working for others, working on personal projects, and collaborating with other artists.  My current major projects are creating new content for\u003ca href=\"http://www.nattosoup.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Nattosoup Studio Art and Process Blog\u003c/a\u003e and the complement Nattosoup\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/Nattosoup\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e channel. \u00a0The focus for both is creating honest, useful content for students and artists- artist interviews, art supply reviews, convention reviews, art tutorials, tutorials for convention prep and making merchandise. \u00a0I\u0027ve written the blog for over six years, and we have three years worth of Artist Interivews on the Youtube. \u00a0I\u0027ve recently started recording tutorials, reviews, demonstrations, and product overviews in 2016",
