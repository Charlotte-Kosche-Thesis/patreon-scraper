When I bought my Bronco I started looking for how-to videos to help me fix my Bronco up, but I didn\u2019t find any. That\u2019s when \u003cstrong\u003eI decided to take my passion for Broncos and my experience in video and start my YouTube channel.\u003c/strong\u003e Slowly I started filming my upgrades step by step and putting them together when I finished.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBut now, it\u2019s grown to so much more than that. I\u2019ve been able to meet so many amazing people and hear their Bronco Story, I\u2019ve been to awesome events, and I\u2019ve learned so much about my Bronco along the way. My favorite thing I hear is when people tell me because of my videos, I\u2019ve inspired them to get out in their garage and start working or keep working on their Bronco.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, here is where you come in. \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eI want to keep uploading regular videos, but the parts, events, and time gets expensive. \u003c/strong\u003eIt usually takes me a few days to film and edit a video, and in that time I\u0027m not providing for my family. I have an amazing wife who loves seeing me work in my passion, but she also likes it when I get paid :) In short, you can help me to continue to bring this content to the community all while helping me provide for my family.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI normally upload a new video once a week. Sometimes 2-3 times a week.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m asking for a monthly pledge with various rewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRight now, the only award I\u2019m offering are my T-Shirts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to start making custom parts that I will release the plans for only on Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf I\u0027m not living up to your expectations, you can fire me and stop your pledges at any time\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\t\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to be a part of this amazing community and rep some sweet swag,\u00a0 consider signing up for a pledge from the section on the right.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you, each and everyone of you.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
