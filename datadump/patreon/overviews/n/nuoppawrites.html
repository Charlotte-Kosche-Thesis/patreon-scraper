    "summary": "2008 is when it all started for me. I didn\u0027t just enjoy Korean music and culture, I lived and breathed it. Whenever I would get the chance, I would watch hours and hours of music videos, variety shows, and dramas to get an even closer glimpse at what soon became my favorite starlets. It wasn\u0027t just a hobby for me anymore, it was an intense interest. This inspired me to write my own story about one of the brightest and most influential people in the industry today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012 I took the plunge and began to write\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.asianfanfics.com/story/view/269039\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Give Me More\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e, a collection of one-shots that displayed our beloved pink loving pop star in situations that only a fan could dream up. The beginning was humble, but as I continued to write, people continued to read. I was so excited each time I logged on to see new comments, new subscribers\u00a0and new views to my story. People actually enjoyed what I was writing! I was so humbled the first year, I couldn\u0027t stop updating. As the years passed, my schedule got more hectic. College classes were piling high, and my time was always divided between classes. Against all odds, I was able to update the story, though not nearly as often as I would have liked. It wasn\u0027t until this past year, or 2017 when I finally got a break! I was privileged\u00a0enough to travel to South Korea and study to live there for 5 months. I got such inspiration for my story while I was there that as soon as I returned, I began to think of new ideas and new scenarios to illustrate with words.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis brings me here! As of late, I decided that I really wanted to focus my efforts on this story. I was lucky enough to gain a large and loyal following, and I haven\u0027t\u00a0done my best in terms of giving back to them (or you!). This is why I wanted to start a Patreon to get my followers involved and create better content for the readers who enjoy\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.asianfanfics.com/story/view/269039\"\u003eGive Me More\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eas much as I do. This gives me a chance to show off my writing skills and develop more stories that are meaningful and well received by like-minded\u00a0people. I hope you all continue to join and follow my (and Tiffany\u0027s) journey as we create even more memorable and ultra-sexy times with one another!\u00a0 | From, Author-Nim ;v;)/"
