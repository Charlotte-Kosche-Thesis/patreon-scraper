    "summary": "Thank you for taking a peak at what we do and for your patronage, if you so choose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Creative thinking is vital to the future of the human race. Being able to think around problems and come up with innovative solutions is going to be the cornerstone of our journey together into the unknown of \"what\u0027s to become\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Here in the U.K. we\u0027re preparing our children for this by...... cutting arts funding and actively discouraging creative thinking in our schooling system!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity/up-next#t-197431\"\u003ehttps://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_school...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U\"\u003ehttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe provide art workshops to schools and we endeavour to fund this through Grants. Alas it\u0027s a lengthy and difficult process. We also try to fund it through setting aside some of the profit from our sculpture, but in these troubled times we often scrape by on what we earn and so can\u0027t be as altruistic as we\u0027d like.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in! People of the world, if we can get \u00a3500 ($650) a month of patronage then we can provide 2 full days or 5 x 1hr long sessions to schools in the U.K. with no cost to the school. If we can get \u00a32000 ($2600) a month (our maximum capacity) we could provide 8 full days or 20 x 1hr\u0027s (worked out at an average rate for creative workshops). If we get less than these figures then we\u0027ll save it until we\u0027ve enough to provide a session . Using a child led learning ethos we structure our workshops to encourage and nurture creative thinking. The more we get the more we can provide.\u003cbr\u003e So, what do you get? Well apart from the warm fuzzy glow and the fact that you\u0027re helping, albeit by a tiny bit, secure the future of the world, you\u0027ll get exclusive access to the life of an artist and exclusive access to some of our art. We\u0027ll produce videos of us working (time lapse as we doubt you\u0027d want the tedious unedited version). You\u0027ll see walk around videos of the sculpture we produce with commentary of our inspiration and how we conceived/created it. You\u0027ll get access to our Exhibitons (virtually) before we open them to the public. You\u0027ll get to see, and be involved in (we\u0027ll ask your opinion) our design process. We\u0027ll talk through the tools we use and show you how we use them. We create art in the form of photography and videos too, you\u0027ll get access to those. Basically everything that makes us/ inspires us as Artists, you\u0027ll get exclusive access to. A unique peak into our creative world!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
