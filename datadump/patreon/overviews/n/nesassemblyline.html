    "summary": "Thank you for checking out this page and potentially contributing to \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Assembly Line: An NES Homebrew Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we set out to begin making this podcast, our only thought was to put together episodes that helped share our love of new NES games and the amazing developers behind them. We wanted to do whatever we could to help spread and share the love of homebrewing. In doing so we were able to start reaching more and more people, and the feedback has been\u003cem\u003e tremendous\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe downside of this (and trust me, it\u0027s a good problem to have!) is that the more episodes we put out, the more expensive it is to host our files. We have been using SoundCloud to host our episode mp3s, and once we hit the maximum data allowed on a free account, we had to pony up and spend $121.50 to upgrade our membership to allow us to create and store as many episodes as we want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe $121.50 is an annual charge, and it is going to be renewing on July 18th of every year.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe honestly never considered asking for help in this, but we have had numerous people asking if we had a Patreon, and that they\u0027d love to support us if we did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, dear listeners, here we are! If you love what we do, and you\u0027d like to help support us and help with the fees associated with putting out a podcast, we would love it if you could. But please, don\u0027t donate any money if it isn\u0027t something you are comfortable doing. And if you do decide to support us, if there ever comes a time that you have to stop, please know that there won\u0027t be any hard feelings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything you can spare will help tremendously. And in the surprising situation that we somehow get more than the fee associated with the SoundCloud hosting, we will use the money to upgrade our account at ZenCastr, the site we use to actually record and interview developers. This will allow us to increase the quality of the episodes themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, feel free to let us know your thoughts or questions if you have any."
