The pro 2A community is simply awesome and I\u0027m humbled by the support you all offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Adam Johnson and I own the NFA Review Channel on YouTube, Full30, Facebook and Instagram. I could not be more humbled to be working in this industry and my journey here would not be possible without all of you! You all rock!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work as a full time Firefighter/Driver Engineer and on my off days I hit the ground running recording reviews for all of you! It\u0027s very hard to get your hands on all the new NFA products out there and my goal is to make that easier on you! I want the review so immersive and detailed, you feel as if your standing next to me, manipulating the product in your hands, and studying the machining, cool features, and performance that it offers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent years learning the industry, upgrading camera gear, upgrading my computers for editing, learning how to properly record and capture clean audio/tone, and creating partnerships and memories with some of the brightest minds the industry has to offer. I then began to plan, host, and execute two large public shooting events each year as a way to help all of you get your hands on the products I experience in my daily work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe outcome of this life passion has been rewarding and a struggle all at the same time. With the increased scrutiny by the anti-gun media it has been hard to stay afloat in a sea of expenses when my compensation system is constantly on edge of disappearing from a flawed monetization system based solely on the knee-jerk reactions of the MSM and companies like YouTube who bend under pressure. Wouldn\u0027t it be nice if YouTube actually supported the people creating content for their audience? There\u0027s an idea!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s the hardcore fans and Patreon supporters like you that will keep my journey going and I cannot express enough how appreciative I am! I hope you throughly enjoy the experience and the content. Lets get to it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdam Johnson\u003cbr\u003eNFA Review"
