    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m nyxocity, long time Supernatural fan and writer of fanfiction. I\u0027ve written over 1 million words of fanfiction in SPN fandom, from epics 70-100k in length to dozens of 1-3k one shots centering on J2 and Wincest, all of which contain adult content. I\u0027ve written fandom classics like But Then My Homework Was Never Quite Like This (J2), and Stranger Than Fiction (Wincest) to name just a couple.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a divorced, single female with two huge, furry dogs who is in between full time employment at the moment. That\u0027s a relative situation which I hope will change in the near future, but in the meantime, my dogs and I need to eat. Also I am hoping to supplement my future income so that I can find a place which will house me and my two huge dogs (I am currently staying with friends).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is a place where you can support me and my work with a monthly pledge of your choice.\u00a0In return you\u0027ll receive not only huge thanks from me but access to content I will be posting \u003cstrong\u003eexclusively\u003c/strong\u003e here. This includes (but is not limited to):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eNew and original Supernatural and SPN RPF based stories\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnswers to questions about my writing, stories, characters etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrompts from patrons!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSupernatural and SPN RPF based poetry\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBehind the scenes info about my stories: Directions I chose not to go in, deleted scenes, thoughts about certain characters\u0027 futures after the story, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll also get to vote in polls to help decide what I\u0027ll write next, among other things (see rewards!). I will be writing a few stories per month at a length of 1-3k, and one poem of short length per week. Sometimes I may write more than that, occasionally I may write less. Once every couple of weeks I will ask for prompts. I will also fill individual requests--check the pledge levels for the finer details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing is pairing-based and very much adult, usually revolving around J2 or Sam/Dean, but I will, on occasion, write other pairings. Basic list of pairings (but not limited to):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSam/Dean\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJared/Jensen\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSam/FC, Dean/FC\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSam/MC, Dean/MC\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSam/Cas\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGenevieve/Danneel\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re looking for a pairing (or crossover pairing) outside of these we can talk ( see rewards).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou guys are amazing and I love you! My dogs and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
