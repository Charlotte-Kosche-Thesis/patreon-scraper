    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon! Thanks so much for being here! This is a place where you can help me continue making YouTube videos while also getting special, exclusive content that won\u0027t go onto YouTube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry, I\u0027m not leaving YouTube anytime soon. I truly love what I do, and I believe YouTube is the best thing for me. This is simply a separate platform where I can do even more for you guys while also (realistically) being able to continue. Here is where you can find some extra mukbangs, vlogs, music videos, bedtime stories, house tours, Colombian city tours, old videos, gossip videos, behind the scenes, and photos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, YouTube made some big changes that greatly affected YouTubers. In January 2017 (1 Year Ago), many companies pulled out from advertising and YouTube increased censorship across the platform, in favor of the companies still invested in the website. \"LGBT,\" for example, automatically receives a demonetization, deemed \"inappropriate\" for advertisers. LGBT creators can appeal YouTube\u0027s decision, but they can\u0027t control the strength of the ad placed back onto their video, nor can they control their channel\u0027s CPC (cost per click) or RPM (average earnings per 1,000 views). \u003cbr\u003eI started noticing huge drops in my earnings in February of last year, especially around the time of my \"proposal\" video with Orlin. I\u0027m assuming the two are connected, but ever since, my earnings have remained low.\u00a0ASMR and Mukbang channels have been been hit particularly hard, due to their false association with \"fetishes.\" I have a triple whammy on my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thought things would improve by now, but they have not. It\u0027s been almost 1 year, and it doesn\u0027t look like things are going to change. In spite of everything, I still posted each and every day for 1 year straight. I never gave up. If I missed a day, I posted 2 the next day. But now it\u0027s come to a point where I\u0027d like to do something different.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently hit a major technicality crisis with my visa status (and not by fault of my own). As many of you know -- especially those of you living here in Colombia -- we have hired an immigration lawyer and are appealing the decision (Tourists have every right to contest notices that involve being banned from re-entering the country).\u00a0Despite many of you asking, I chose NOT to make a \"GoFundMe\" account. I think GoFundMe should be reserved for things such as disasters, homelessness, charity, etc. It\u0027s much more appropriate to go through Patreon because you can get regular updates, while also getting additional content to enjoy. This is my way of saying \"thank you.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see lots of YouTubers making Patreons that start at $10 a month, $20 a month, and all the way up into the hundreds... in exchange for Twitter Follows, emails, giveaways, responding to your comments, etc. I\u0027ve always been extremely transparent and interactive with you guys, and I do all of those things for free already. My Patreon will start at $1 because I truly want this to be available and affordable for everybody! If you want to support me a little bit extra, you can always increase your pledge to a higher amount you feel is best. You can also change your pledge amount at anytime, going higher or lower. But I\u0027ll leave that up to you. Please know that this gesture is appreciated so much by me and my family during this difficult time. We cannot thank you enough for the support. And again, I hope you enjoy what I can offer you here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide Patreon is right for you, thank you! Feel free to send me private messages on here. I respond to everybody. Let\u0027s have fun with this!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
