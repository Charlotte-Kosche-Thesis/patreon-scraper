This place is for those of you who want to help support what we\u0027re doing in ways that allow us to continue making FML episodes, Deadersons episodes and bringing back old favorite shows like ReTales.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, the concept is that you support a creator financially for each piece of valuable content they create for you. In our case, it\u0027s comedy videos such as FML and The Deadersons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe in this concept. It\u0027s helping creators (like you and me both!) bring more value to the world by making it financially sustainable long-term. Please consider supporting our work with a dollar (or however you much you like) per YouTube video we post. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gears.jpg\" style=\"color: rgb(35, 45, 50);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month we tend to publish about 4 to 6 YouTube videos to the NotebookMovies channel, including FML, Deadersons, Off Topic podcast etc. \u00a0Each time we do so, we share that YouTube video here and mark it as a piece of content that you\u0027re supporting. The number of YouTube videos we publish that month determines how much you contribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, if you pledge $1 per YouTube video and that month we publish 4 FMLs and 2 podcast episodes of Off Topic, you\u0027ll contribute $6 for that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there\u0027s no surprises at the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, you can pledge $10 per YouTube video, get access to the rewards at that tier, but cap your monthly contribution limit to $10, thus supporting 1 YouTube video that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t worry about missing out on any content either. You will still continue to get our YouTube videos even if I publish additional YouTube episodes that go beyond your maximum contribution limit for the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/give-money.jpg\" style=\"color: rgb(35, 45, 50);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables us to invest into producing free YouTube entertainment videos and podcast episodes for those who enjoy our content such as yourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, it takes time and resources to create content, both which require money. Your support lets us focus on making the most valuable content for you that we possibly can instead of spending as much time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also helps us replace broken equipment, produce higher-quality videos, and free up some of my time to do more important things, like investing time into producing our feature film, publishing Kris\u0027 book and paying our actors! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eShoot, I don\u0027t have money to support this.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/no-money1.png\" style=\"color: rgb(35, 45, 50);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo problem at all! Please don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on money or are struggling financially. We know what that feels like and want you to take care of more important priorities first. We will continue to make videos and podcast episodes that we hope will entertain you as we have for almost 10 years now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h3\u003eNotebook Entertainment is run by Wyatt Elliott and Kris Williamson. We are not rich by any means but we found our passion in story telling and with modern technology and determination we have been able to pursue that dream. Between the two of us, we have more ideas then we will ever probably live long enough to produce, but we\u0027re are determined to try. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now Kris works two full time jobs and Wyatt works full time in order to support ourselves, pay bills, and invest in our dreams. We have slowly begun adulting and taking Notebook more seriously this year because of all the support from you, the fans. We never dreamed we would have made it this far in such a small amount of time and we are forever grateful to anyone who takes the time out of their busy schedule to watch one of our productions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarted in 2007, Notebook Entertainment has grow substantially since 2012 with now over 14 million views, 14,000 subscribers, over 300 episodes of FML and has produced 481 videos currently on YouTube. We are not shy on content ideas and produce quickly enough if given the time that we are confident we can produce 3 times as much content if allowed the time and money. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are lovers of pop culture and geekdom. Some of our favorite films and TV shows are Star Wars, Doctor Who, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, The X-Files, Kevin Smith, Tarantino films, and anything Marvel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Wyatt Elliott and Kris Williamson run Notebook Entertainment which specializes in making content for YouTube such as \u00a0our FML series, The Deadersons, ReTales, etc. Our flagship series Tales From FMyLife has been running for almost 7 years, \u00a010 Seasons, over 300 episodes, and has over 14 MILLION total views world wide. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDespite popular belief, it is extremely difficult to make a full time living on YouTube these days. We both have to have one or more full time jobs to pay the bills and to afford to create the content we love. We heard from you as to why it took so long between seasons 9 and 10 of FML? The answer is. we got busy with our real lives as well as additional programming we had developed.\u003cbr\u003eWe have so much content we wish to bring you. You want to continue to bring you FML episodes at least once a week, continue with The Deadersons zombie sitcom, bring back FML\u0027s spin-off series FTW as well as ReTales for all of you retail workers. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where we need your help. First off let me state that we are NOT ending FML or The Deadersons. With your support or not, we are passionate about these shows and they will continue as is. However, with your support we can afford and have the time to increase production and have FML air more often. Bring back some of our past shows and create new ones. Our goal is to have Channel NotebookMovies be a network with a new show everyday of the week. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor as little as $1 a month, you can help us do just that. We are NOT demanding that you pay us for our content. We want our content to remain free to enjoy. This is simply a voluntary way to subscribe to our channel and support the creators you love and return, we want to make more of the content you love more often. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTry it for one month and see what you think. If every subscriber donated $5 for one month, that would set us up nicely for over a year to create content for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are perks for supporting us and our shows! As a Notebook Patreon, you will get exclusive access to behind the scenes videos of FML which have never before been seen by the public and that;s just ONE of the perks we have planned. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help us thrive on this little platform we call the Internet. \u00a0Thank you so much for all of your continued support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
