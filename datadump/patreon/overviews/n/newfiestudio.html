    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to the Newfie Studio\u0027s\u00a0Patreon Page. You can probably tell what this studio is creating, but that\u0027s just not enough. Therefore, allow me to inform everyone what it\u0027s all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe studio is creating a webcomic titled, \"The Grand Six\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://sta.sh/01qlc8c0fpa1\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://sta.sh/01qlc8c0fpa1\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/a57f/f/2017/272/2/2/logo_tapasticsize_by_the_elusive_caravan_dbcfgyv_by_lloyd1191-dbozoco.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a fantasy-medieval story about a group of six heroes in a quest to save the world from destruction. What\u0027s so interesting about this six heroes, besides the whole saving the world thing? I mean, come on, who hasn\u0027t done that before? Well, my dear reader, what if I told you that it\u0027s a group of misfits? What kind of misfits? You\u0027ll know soon enough.\u003cbr\u003eAnd you might be saying: \"Another fantasy thing? So, like, is there going to be elves, dwarfs, and such? That is so last year\". That\u0027s where I will say: \"NO! None of that! Shame on you!\" If you get the reference of that, I applaud you. Back to the description, there will be different races in the world, each based on a different animal, with their own abilities, and skills. There will be different threats to deal with, and many themes in it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I wasting your time with this? YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF RIGHT NOW! Just follow this links:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tapas.io/series/The-Grand-Six\"\u003ehttps://tapas.io/series/The-Grand-Six\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttp://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/the-grand-six/list?title_no=146263\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, let me introduce myself: You can just call me D. Omars (might sound familiar, but probably not), or Big D, but I might be recognized as lloyd1191. I\u0027m really trying here, aren\u0027t I? Anyways, I\u0027m the writer of this here webcomic, and you cannot imagine how much time I\u0027ve put in planning this thing. I mean, I got this little book that is completely filled with character descriptions, and plot. Oh my god, the plot. It literally took half the book, and I still have more to write. Oh god, there\u0027s still more to write, is what I would say, but I want to keep adding. ALL OF IT!!!!\u003cbr\u003eSo, there will be plenty in it, and I hope that everyone enjoys it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here is the artist\u0027s introduction:\u00a0Hello everyone~ I am Jura, the artist for Newfie Studio. Thanks for dropping by to check our page. We have only started not too long ago, but I hope that in due time more content will be released and you will be able to check out our stuff~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you might be asking, and guessing correctly, it will be free to read on Tapastic. However, the uploads will be a bit slow because I will be paying out of my pocket to make the pages. Therefore, your support will help make it easier to get the webcomic going. Who knows? Maybe 2 pages every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, that\u0027s all for now. I wish every single one of you a good day/night.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOC RULES\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOnce payment is received, you\u0027re given the opportunity to make an OC appear in the webcomic. However, you have to consider this:\u003cbr\u003e- The OC will most likely appear as a background character, won\u0027t have any dialogue, and only once.\u003cbr\u003e- Depending on the setting of the story, certain characters won\u0027t be able to appear. For example: The story takes place in Kingdom A, but there\u0027s barely, if any, characters from Race B. It would be recommended to suggest an OC from a Race that is common in Kingdom A.\u003cbr\u003e- Depending on the situation in the story, certain characters won\u0027t appear. For example: There\u0027s a battle going on, and besides any main or secondary character, there aren\u0027t that many people like merchants, commoners, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make a character, this information is needed:\u003cbr\u003e- Race\u003cbr\u003e- Gender\u003cbr\u003e- Age (Child, Adult, or Elder)\u003cbr\u003e- Physical description (Reference picture would be appreciated)\u003cbr\u003e- Personality (To be more precise: what would the OC be doing in a particular situation? Example: There\u0027s a battle going on, the OC is a civilian, what would the OC do?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease submit this information in a comment or message. If it\u0027s not possible to put the OC at the moment, then it will be put in a waiting list.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor any questions, please leave a comment or a message, and will be answered as soon as possible.\u003cbr\u003e"
