    "summary": "Hi!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Justyna Wo\u0142odkiewicz, and my passion is art. \u003cbr\u003eAfter sculpting in polymer clay for about two years I came up with the idea of incorporating abstract sculptures into embroidery. This has become my obsession and enormouse source of daily joy. From the day one of inventing the whole mixed media idea I\u0027ve been stitching funny, vibrant clay pieces into densely embroidered hoops. I can\u0027t get enough, I\u0027m flooded with the ideas. I just need time which means I need some help and support to balance the whole life-money-art-time thing. That is why I am here! To ask you for your help - even as little as one dollar - but so powerfull in consequences!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who are interested there are my sites:\u003cstrong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://nibyniebo.blogspot.com/\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.behance.net/nibyniebo\"\u003ebehance\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nibyniebo/\"\u003efacebook\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nibyniebopuppet/\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow there is the part of story when I was sculpting in polymer clay and didn\u0027t know that one they I will take needlework to the next level. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of life 2014-2016:\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been exploring polymer clay world with childlich curiosity. And I fell in love. \u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m into wall clocks. \u003cimg src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7ic4taKJ2JE/Vp3m-EZRKrI/AAAAAAAABHY/sK29d7z7IQY/s1600/P1120288.JPG\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I sculpt I shape colors with joyful precision. I experiment and look for new techniques. \u003cbr\u003eExcept clocks I make miniatures...like jumping jacks:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/max_1200/fa130935052351.56e8361577ad6.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr small polymer clay illustrations that express the world of fantasy and fairy tales:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/7a825534864959.56e07d9f1aa15.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI paint, I draw, I sew, and just feel it\u0027s my way of living. But as it is in life it\u0027s sometimes hard to make a living from art. Moreover as Elizabeth Gilbert wrote -creativity suffers when we try to make it pay our bills. \u003cbr\u003eI try to keep my spirit free, dreaming sometimes about becoming professional artist, but not dying for it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who are interested there are my sites:\u003cstrong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://nibyniebo.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.behance.net/nibyniebo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebehance\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nibyniebo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efacebook\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nibyniebopuppet/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf it\u0027s real (it is!!!) getting support from patrons would be a huge and beautiful thing - giving me more freedom, wings and time to create. I will be able to afford supplies and tools without hesitation or delay (in case there are urgent living expenses). And also if I improve some of my electronic devices my online presence will flourish. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon for me is one more suprising opportunity to see if there are people who truly like my art and are willing to support it in any way (I would appreciate every one of them). Pledges are monthly, but can be canceled at any time. The comments and likes are lovely too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I hope for fun adventure for you and me! \u003cbr\u003e"
