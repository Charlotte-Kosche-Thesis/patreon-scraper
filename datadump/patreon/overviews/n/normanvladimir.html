I\u0027m excited you\u0027re interested in learning more about me. Please read on...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho I Am:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHi!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Norman Vladimir - an independent, pop-soul singer/songwriter and musician who makes\u00a0 music that gives us hope for our world and tells the story of our generation. I made my way from a small farm in Tennessee to the downtown music scene of NYC... and now, Europe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027ve Done (so far):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010, I sang for President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Sir Paul McCartney, and many others for Tony Award winner Bill T. Jones\u0027 nationally televised tribute at the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington DC. I later received national features from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norman-vladimir-a-pop-soul-artist-with-depressingly-hopeful-lyrics/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCBS News\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/introducing-norman-vladimir-video-888\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEbony Magazine\u003c/a\u003e, and I performed extensively in NYC, opening for/sharing stages with Norah Jones, John Forte, Me\u0027shell Ndegeocello, and Ben Taylor to name a few. Now, I have now hopped the pond to become a true international artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere I Am Now:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are all on a journey, and we all have our stories to tell. We\u0027re trying to make good decisions, be kind and understanding with one another, and we\u0027re trying to leave the world around us a little bit better than when we arrived.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me, my dream is to do all those things through my music. There\u0027s something about being able to turn the experiences I and my generation have (yes, the boring, the exciting, and the crazy ones) into those musical moments that frame our mood, shape our lives, and ultimately bring us ALL closer to understanding one another. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy calling and my goal for my life is to make that song that becomes \"our song\", to frame that moment we share with our best friend, that stranger we pass on the street, or that beautiful one we\u0027ve always wanted to tell how we feel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want that privilege - to tell your story through telling my own. It has already been an honor in my life to do this on my own, and I want to continue to grow and expand my reach to the corners of this world to find what connects us, rather than what divides us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic has been my healing, my best friend, and my way to express to the world that we all matter, that we all have good times and bad, and that hope is never lost, no matter how hard it gets!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, all I ask is that is a simple deal with you:\u00a0 if you can give to me what you can to help make my dream of spreading my music to the world happen, then I will do all I can to bring you the music that inspires, that gives the world a bit more hope and love, that reaches as many hearts as possible, that makes us all take a moment to reflect on where and who we are, and that paves the way for progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to bring you those new songs, take you along with me on my journey (on the road, in the studios, at the radio stations, and in your headphones), sharing stories, giving you sneak peeks of my WIPs (that\u0027s works-in-progress), new lyric ideas, and other bonuses just for you. You\u0027ll also be the first ones to know when I\u0027m releasing a new project or single.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore about me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNorman Vladimir - the now Europe-based, independent artist \u0026amp; singer-songwriter, uses soulful, big range vocals and raw talent combined with live loops and live instruments to create an authentic sound, with a definition of \u201cpop\u201d that\u0027s all his own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis latest project, \u0027No More Obligations\u0027, an independent release, recorded at Redbull Studios Amsterdam, will be out in winter 2017 with his \"Free To Be Me\" tour beginning shortly thereafter."
