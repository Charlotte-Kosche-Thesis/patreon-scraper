    "summary": "Hello! My name\u0027s NihonTiger, and I\u0027ve been creating content on YouTube and Twitch since 2012. You might know me from my Minecraft videos, UHC events, TFC Tuesday and the like. Or perhaps you\u0027ve stumbled upon some of my racing league videos, or one of my other let\u0027s plays. Either way, I\u0027ve been recording, editing and streaming anything and everything for the last five years, and I\u0027ve been trying to bring as much joy to others as I can while doing so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the while, I\u0027ve\u00a0been making videos and streaming without plastering my videos and streams with ads. Because of your requests for something like Patreon, and due to the somewhat turbulent nature of digital advertising revenue, I\u0027ve decided to launch this page to give everyone the chance to contribute on a monthly basis, and hopefully an affordable one for budgets of all kinds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron helps me to improve my equipment to offer more content, without having to go into deep debt or, you know, stop eating for a month to be able to afford it. The stability of a monthly Patreon pledge, no matter how big or small, is an immense benefit to taking away some of the stress I\u0027ve got financially, and it will open up new avenues for me to interact with you guys on a daily and weekly basis."
