I make videos on a range of topics including: Breakdown reaction videos, crime analysis, silly skits and conversation/advice videos. you can see more of those\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/Nattering\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m not on the Tube I\u0027m in my element studying Forensic science and it\u0027s application in criminal law, creating digital art works, working as a photographer and making silly comic sketches. YouTube started as a space to find like minded people who were like myself, somewhat reclusive due to uncontrollable lifestyle factors, namely mental illness.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow-days I consider my platform, although small a success in that it\u0027s allowed me to open up a space for discussion and change ( oh and fun because .. duh!) I think it\u0027s really important as a creator to share knowledge and breakdown the barrier of the unknown that lies within our society. Thankfully I have knowledge across a few areas (see above) and am more then ready to help bring about that change!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to further my platform, make my videos of higher quality, longer and release them more often so they have the potential to find people on the platform like me who feel a bit lost within themselves or have an interest in similar areas!.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of this I would like to expand my avenues into more of a cinematic realm and produce ( albeit low budget) short films or music videos and really full-fill passion projects like #braveproject that have the potential to bring about important change and awareness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support me in this effort, please consider signing up for a pledge from the selection on the right. The rewards are fun and your help will be greatly appreciated (and hey I regularly ask via twitter what you guys would like in return from me, so rest assured you will always have a voice)"
