Started by Native youth, the on-going content curation is multidisciplinary, drawing from academic and non-credentialed sources to bring the latest on political issues affecting Indian country throughout the Americas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur\u00a0goal has been making all content accessible, and bringing current events as well as resources of all kinds, to anyone. Whether you are a student, parent, graduate student, or homeless, we aim to provide a service that is beneficial to you; to represent and inform the reviled, ignored, and silenced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis service grew from a need to see concerted campaigns about issues affecting Indigenous peoples in the Americas and internationally that did not further marginalize intersections of the populations or prominently feature content that was voyeuristic or exploitative.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile many of these articles, artworks, images, and documentation are freely available online, or offline, they are either to digital accessible or easily searchable in one place. Our goal is to keep our communities updated on topics relevant to their daily lives, especially but not limited to issues that directly affect them. We want to\u00a0incite discussion on social media, as well as activist, academic, and educational spaces. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe traditional means dissemination has varyingly ranged between printed word and spoken word, but with the democratization of digital access, youth today have the opportunity to reclaim agency as creators and activists in ways that have been previous restricted to marginalized youth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch of the content we provide can be difficult to read, and of a serious nature, particularly that which confronts historical, and contemporary, violence which marginalized communities face(d) on a day-to-day basis. But our goal is\u00a0to actively engage with the folks and have \u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003ebecome a part of not just our content curation, but active in resisting, overturning, and \u003cem\u003eremembering\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0hegemonic and normative narratives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatronage will provide us the opportunity to not only engage you and a wider audience \u003cem\u003eoffline\u003c/em\u003e, but the ability to provide you higher \u003cem\u003edaily \u003c/em\u003ethroughout and better, more radically curated content, which cuts to the center of issues. We focus on central issues of our time: colonialism, anti-Blackness, misogyny, Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG), fatphobia, transmisogyny, homophobia, environmental racism, poverty, serophobia \u003cem\u003eand their intersections\u003c/em\u003e to name a few .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith enough support, you would helping us reporting from the ground\u00a0at protests as they occur, interviewing marginalized communities and Native peoples in their daily lives and on the front-ground of defending land and water, academic functions, and facilitating activist work in face-to-face environments. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage means more access, more reporting, more curation, and the ability to do our own reporting work, without the need to reference non-marginalized/hegemonic and non-Native\u00a0resources, and allocate\u003cem\u003e support directly to Natives themselves\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.indianandcowboy.com/news/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe Indian and Cowboy Media Network\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage goes directly to making new exciting projects possible across various media (text, photo, video).
