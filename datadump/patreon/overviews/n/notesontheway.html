I can still hear things my friends\u0027 parents said to me as a awkward, growing fourth grader.

Some words stick to our hips, telling us a story that we are just a little too misshapen to be loved. Some stick to our heads, putting so much space between what we think and what we say because we were told just one too many times that we\u0027re stupid and shouldn\u0027t speak up anymore.
