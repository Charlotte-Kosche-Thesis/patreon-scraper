     "about": "Hey everyone, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know my name is Neel Kolhatkar. I\u0027m a 22yr old actor/comedian from Sydney, Australia and I am lucky enough to already be doing what I love for a living. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been creating internet content for a while now. And I\u0027m humbled to know my videos have reached an audience all across the world. What started as videos in my bedroom have become fully fledged short films and plans for web series with an entire cast and crew involved. Our last film involved 17 people over a 3 day shoot! All of whom volunteered their time generously. I want to continue making the highest quality content and production for all of you and I sincerely believe this is the next big step in what I do. I set up this Patreon to ensure we continue to improve on the quality of these films so you can enjoy and be a part of the best of what we\u0027re capable of. Any donations would go entirely towards paying our cast and crew which includes but is not limited to the directors, editors, audio and lighting personnel, actors, special effects and producers to just name a few. Myself and my crew work extremely hard on these films, perfecting every small detail and making sure every line of dialogue is on point so every little cent will go a long way! With your help we can continue to create original, edgy, high quality content. Content you can not only enjoy but content you can now be a part of!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of our projects take weeks and others can take months so you will only be paying per video. That is, once the video is released, the donation will be made. Our Patrons will have exclusive access to behind the scenes content, alternate endings, interviews, producer credits and even personalised videos. So there is plenty in it for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, thank-you. I mean it in saying I wouldn\u0027t be anywhere near where I am today without you guys and simply cannot say it enough. Thank-you all so much!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeel.",
