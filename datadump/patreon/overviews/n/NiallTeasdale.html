With some extra income through Patreon, however, I can afford to stretch myself in other areas. For example, audiobook projects: audio is expensive to produce and may or may not end up paying back the investment, and Patreon can make it viable to do it anyway. I may even be able to set up some animation projects and bring some of my characters to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as what you get out of subscribing... I produce a lot of artwork which no one ever sees but me. If you subscribe, you\u0027ll get to see it too. This is concept art for the books. I use it to visualise what characters look like for particular scenes or generally. I\u0027ve put this on DeviantArt before and will continue to do so, but I have buckets of images which have never been seen which I can put up for your viewing. In the future there will also be giveaways and opportunities for requests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, subscribers are helping me press forward to develop more books, more characters, and more media. No one who buys and reads my books has any obligation to even \u003cem\u003econsider \u003c/em\u003esubscribing here, but if you do you\u0027ll be joining me in making my worlds better places for my readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA couple of notes:\u003cbr\u003e* This is a monthly subscription, don\u0027t give me money you can\u0027t afford.\u003cbr\u003e* You \u003cem\u003ecan \u003c/em\u003egive more than a dollar a month, but you don\u0027t need to.\u003cbr\u003e* There \u003cem\u003ewill \u003c/em\u003ebe additional rewards for those who give more, I just don\u0027t have a clue what yet.\u003cbr\u003e* I repeat \u003cem\u003edon\u0027t give me money you can\u0027t afford\u003c/em\u003e!"
