As Three 6 Mafia says, \u201cIt\u2019s hard out here for a pimp.\u201d Enter Nightpantz.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.nightpantz.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNightpantz\u003c/a\u003e is a digital sketch collective based in Los-Angeles that successfully strives to give artists opportunities to be seen and heard. We write scripts, turn them into videos, and release them into the world. The entire growing team of 350+ collaborators lends a hand at bringing the sketches to life. Our intent is simple: allow anyone with talent and drive to make fun, quality content that can be posted online without waiting for permission from the traditional Hollywood gatekeepers. We hope to serve aspiring actors, filmmakers, and writers around the country by providing them a creative home as soon as they arrive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to harness the frustration felt by many independent filmmakers and actors, and give them a chance to flourish. Nightpantz provides a safe, inclusive space to brainstorm and collaborate, as well as access to the tools needed to create a finished product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTZuOv_E3qc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur process\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach week, a rotating group along with some core members of Nightpantz, enter the UCB caf\u00e9 on Sunset Blvd. If it\u2019s a writers meeting, many scripts will be read out loud by talented actors. After each read through, a lively discussion ensues with the goal of shaping the script into something magical, and if it hits the team in that special spot, it gets the green light.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnybody can bring material, or ideas to pitch, with the goal of getting green-lit. If it\u2019s a production meeting, the green-lit sketches are assigned shoot dates and directors and producers are chosen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince our inception in November 2014, we have completed more than 60 sketches, and in the process given hard-working artists a chance to learn and take chances.

Our open source approach means anyone can take a shot at writing, acting, shooting, directing, producing, editing, or recording sound- our members are only limited by their imagination and know-how. Pooled resources have allowed us to do all of this work with a minimal budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it still takes money to make the Nightpantz magic happen. And that is where you come in. Every dollar we raise will go entirely towards producing new sketches, including hiring more editors, sound mixers, and cinematographers, as well as covering our location and costume fees. By reaching our $1,000 per month goal, we\u0027ll be able to produce at least four quality sketches every month, till the end of time. Anything we raise beyond our goal will go towards producing even more sketches each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour help means the world to us. Heck, maybe we\u0027ll see you in one of our sketches in the not-too-distant future. We believe in the power of collaboration. We believe that artists working in harmony with one another create magic. We believe in something bigger than ourselves: comedy is our higher power, Nightpantz our vehicle.
