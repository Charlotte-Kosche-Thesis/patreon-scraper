Patreon is a platform that offers you a way to support the artists you love, helping them continue with their content by a little effort!\u003cbr\u003eI am so humbled to have you all here; thank you so much for your love and support as you are the main reason I choose to keep going. It is absolutely mind-blowing to me to know I can do what I love, with the support you send my direction. Everything you do is immensely appreciated, and you guys are helping me do what I love! A simple smile from you while viewing my content will drive me a long while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eA BIT ABOUT ME\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Hope Walter. Many of you may know me as nipnuts on my social media. I have a passion for creating many things, such as videos, sfx makeup, animation, and cosplays when I can afford them. I have always leaned toward the creative-arts side of life, and the joy I feel from accomplishing something creative is indescribable. The visions I have in my head of things I can do are wild, and I get so excited to start them; but sometimes it gets difficult to pursue something that requires financial attention first.\u003cbr\u003eAs a creator of all sorts, my main focus has been on editing and sfx makeup for the passed few years. Although I would love to pursue my love for cosplay, I am driven to do one thing at a time, as best I can, and wait until my financial situation improves.\u003cbr\u003eI am 19 years old and just starting my journey as an artist! The future is so exciting, and I can\u0027t wait to keep putting things in the world for the better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY AM I USING PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a future aspect, in order for me to continue creating, it is very important that I find a way to earn. The daily expenses and requirements life brings makes it very difficult to afford the necessary equipment and supplies to make my content. I do not obtain extra funds to fulfill my creative visions.\u003cbr\u003eI plan to make not only make regular videos, but specially-made tutorials of how I do what I do! With your help these things will be an easy knockout, as I know how often I\u0027m asked to make tutorials. To add to the list, I would love to actually create films that can do numbers of things...make you laugh, make you cry, want to help someone or something. As a prior videographer for weddings, it is definitely in my focus to continue creating moving films.\u003cbr\u003eI also plan to attend an art college soon to really emphasize what I love to do. To learn more in the fields I\u0027m interested in, to foresee my entire life career! College isn\u0027t even an option to think about at the moment, so I plan to spend my next few years dropping content and raising funds!\u003cbr\u003eAnother big reason for using Patreon is... \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCOMMISSIONS!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore info. about commissions will be listed below!\u003cbr\u003eAgain, even a dollar a month is extremely appreciated. With your monthly subscription to help me, I am so excited to give you all sorts of rewards! Don\u0027t forget that you can pause your subscription at any time, if you find the need to do so.

Why of course~\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e+ Want a customized edit? An animation? A birthday present? A meme? No worries. Several options are available to you regarding every little detail you want within the edit. Different lengths are going to range from cost; for instance...a 6 second edit will be much cheaper than 60 second one. I am more than thrilled to make customs for you! The only limitation is, I will not sell edits containing artwork belonging to someone else, without their permission.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- COSPLAYS!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e+ Think my face fits with a character?

It makes more sense to me than it ever has, and how awesome is it that we have the option to support our favorite creators!?

I would love to earn enough to be able to save funds for a very special upcoming event. It is an actual dream of mine to be able to attend Anime Expo in Los Angeles, CA during the summer of 2018. There I will have the opportunity to meet the love of my life, truly. He\u0027s not only that, but my best friend. I am in a long-distance relationship today, with a man I have yet to see up close in person. Every day I pray and hope that I will be able to afford this trip, and the worry is also escalating. Not only will I meet him, but my best online friends too; it is so thrilling to imagine this trip with all of my favorite people together, the things we can do, the laughter spreading. My younger sister is attending with me and this will be the very first anime convention we\u0027ve ever even seen up close. It would be immensely and extremely appreciated if we could have some outside help to achieve this goal, to afford two plane tickets to California, two tickets for the con, and funds for food etc. I will not stop at trying make this journey happen... right now it seems near impossible, but I have faith in a positive and uplifting outcome. Thank you so much if you decide to help in making this miracle happen; you\u0027re a life-saver. ^^",
