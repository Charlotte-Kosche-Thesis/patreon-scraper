One is the aforementioned Edgar Cl\u00e9ment, the other is the game designer D. Vincent Baker, creator of the acclaimed role-playing game \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.apocalypse-world.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApocalypse World\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. That\u0027s right, \u003cem\u003eNahual\u003c/em\u003e is \u003cstrong\u003ePowered by the Apocalypse\u003c/strong\u003e. The main mechanics from which it feeds are the Moves, the core of \u003cem\u003eApocalypse World\u003c/em\u003e. It also profits from the game style and the agendas of the Master of Ceremonies, focusing on a narrative gameplay. The main difference is that \u003cem\u003eNahual\u003c/em\u003e uses d6 dice pools, determined by the sum of two Attributes. That among other things try to take a look from another perspective to the excellent system created by Baker, while trying always to capture the essence of AW and that gameplay that fascinates me so much.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Patreon instead of Kickstarter?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.nahualrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/skectch_book_page_by_angelero.jpg\" style=\"width: 238px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eOne of the reasons is because we live in Mexico, and Kickstarter doesn\u0027t work here yet. And even if there is also Indiegogo, the truth is that the main reason is another one: we\u0027ll be releasing the Nahual role-playing under the Creative Communs license. Both Cl\u00e9ment and Baker are very generous with their creations, and I believe the vision they have is very similar: \"Take my ideas and use them, change them, twist them. This makes them grow and thrive\". Not that they say it exactly like that, I\u0027m putting words in their mouths, and I may be wrong in doing it. Cl\u00e9ment I\u0027m sure he thinks like that, we have talked about it, and that\u0027s why he\u0027s coming aboard this project. As for Baker, I\u0027ve been following him on interviews and comments online, and I believe he thinks somehow likewise (I\u0027ve been trying to reach him online, I\u0027m still waiting for a reply). But in various interviews and talks I\u0027ve seen on the internet, he mentions that he wants people to use his game, that\u0027s why the Powered by the Apocalypse logo exists. So here we are.\u00a0And since they\u0027re so generous with their ideas, I\u0027m thinking in \nfollow their steps and put everything I write under Creative Commons,\n so that someone else may repeat this process. How honored I would feel \nabout it!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTherefore we appeal to your generosity so we can devote as much time as possible to this effort. We have our jobs and we do some freelance stuff also. With your help, we hope to focus more of our time to this game, instead of worrying about paying our bills.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.nahualrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/LPS_sketch_006_by_edgarclement-688.jpg\" style=\"width: 662px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h2\u003e\nIf you become a patron, we\u0027ll be receiving from you \n\u003cstrong\u003e$1 usd\u003c/strong\u003e (or more if your generosity decides so) each time we post here one of the chapters of the book or one of the new original illustrations for the game. In general I\u0027ll be posting on average 1 or 2 chapters per month, and Cl\u00e9ment will be posting 1 or 2 illustrations. The chapters will vary in extension given the nature of the content, but the amount you contribute will be always the same. That\u0027s right, sometimes chapters will be short but this will compensate with other longer chapters.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat do you get as a patron?\u003c/h2\u003e\nPatrons will get, first and foremost the satisfaction of helping this noble cause =) They also get exclusive access to the chapters that I will be posting here, previous to the final open public release.
