    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe mission field is closer than you think!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s not always overseas, sometimes it\u2019s in our own backyard. We are the Jones family and we are full-time RV missionaries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy RV Missionaries? -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJust as Jesus called Peter to get out of the boat and come to Him on the water in Matthew 14:29, we also felt God calling all three of us to step out of the boat, and out of our comfort zones to embark on an epic journey to serve as mobile missionaries. Selling everything we had, we moved into our 29 foot RV to minister wherever God told us to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Are We Serving? -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThrough our travels, God laid it on our hearts to serve the people in the FLDS (Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) town of Colorado City, Arizona. Colorado City is a tiny and forgotten polygamist cult town where we fell in love with the people and saw the dire needs of a town fraught with abuse, brain washing and injustice at the hands of a deranged self-proclaimed prophet named Warren Jeffs. With a leader who keeps moving the \"spiritual bar\" and blaming his current prison sentence on his follower\u2019s lack of faithfulness, the people are left feeling hopeless and unsure of their eternal existence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Are We Answering God\u0027s Call Here? -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are in charge of recruiting, planning, scheduling and leading mission teams from all across the country to serve along side us in Colorado City. In addition to our ministry teams, we run and volunteer in a small local thrift store every week, we organize free community events for children (involving music, reading, writing, games, story time and bible study). We organize and are heavily involved in community outreach events such as food banks, internet services and education, community clean up crews, free BBQ\u0027s and social gatherings. Our daughter Haley even started tutoring sessions for kids and teens and the three of us are all forming unbelievable relationships and inroads with many FLDS people who have never had any kind of contact with anyone from outside their church or family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Become a Patron? -\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBy supporting us, you make this mission possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor the past year we have been spending our own money to fund every mission outreach, event, volunteer opportunity and travel expenses to serve in Colorado City and in disaster relief with Samaritan\u0027s Purse. We are living a minimalistic lifestyle, with no house payment and nothing extravagant or unnecessary (where would we put it in the RV anyway)?! However, we still have medical bills for Haley, a car payment and we can\u0027t forget to eat. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen people like you have the capacity to lend a hand, it allows us the freedom to focus on the work God has for us. With that support, there is also a sense of responsibility and accountability. Which is why we are passionate about sharing the ministry and how God is working with each and every supporter. You will see first hand where your support goes and how God is at the center of everything we do in this town. When you can visualize and feel the impact and the changes happening right now, you will know why we feel called to Colorado City and why we are shown on a daily basis that God has us exactly where He wants us. We truly believe that God has a purpose for us here and with your help we can continue to boldly follow HIM. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant To Know More? -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGlyn and Jena started Navigating Hope Ministries so that others could donate their time, their prayers, an Action Bible, a gift, their friendship, or their talents; because God calls different people for different reasons and we believe that building relationships is what changes lives and is the way to spread His love all across the country.
