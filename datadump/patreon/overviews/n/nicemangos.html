    "summary": "Hell-o Sinners!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to look at my Patreon page. As a woman, writer and illustrator of Pakistani/Muslim background who often critiques religion, both the far-right in the East \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e the West \u00a0- I certainly do not find myself in a position to win many popularity contests, or get any sponsorships.\u00a0I started off as a sex-blogger \u0026amp; illustrator but my work has expanded to include so much more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am interested in studying and documenting what makes extremists/radicals of all sorts tick...and trying to understand how best they can be defeated. In the past I have primarily focused on rising Islamism in my own Pakistani and Muslim communities but as the Alt Right grows in the West that too has become a subject I\u0027m interested in tracking. I feel...to combat extremism on one of these sides one must try to understand and combat it on the other too. Without at least examining both, you aren\u0027t really looking at the bigger picture. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a distinctly left leaning ex-muslim in this increasingly polarized political climate is pretty rough. I find myself pushed into a corner, where I am strapped for time...wanting to create tons of content but unable to find the time and resources to fund this defiant voice of mine. I am a freelance graphic designer and writer by day, so I have no luxurious day job to fall back on. This is what I do, these are my marketable skills. I am inundated with requests from people to write and draw for their publications (usually for free) - which I cannot always fulfill, because I too need to pay bills. Being a freelancer means I have to hustle to get paying projects, but my most satisfying work is the work I do on my blog and podcast, with your help I can continue to improve the quality of this work and have more reach.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to build bridges by hearing a variety of viewpoints, but that does not mean \u0027softballing\u0027 or agreeing with all sorts of views. I enjoy hosting robust discussions on my show exploring different perspectives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to keep sharing and creating work for free, but it is getting harder to sustain as the demand grows. You do not have to contribute to this Patreon to enjoy my work, but if ever it has provided you with entertainment, I would appreciate a tip, just so I can keep going...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work is varied, I do artwork, write blogs and articles, do podcasts and I also create children\u0027s books.\u003cbr\u003eMy book \u0027My Chacha (uncle) is Gay\u0027 has been used in libraries and schools across the Toronto area. I hope to create more children\u0027s books too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading all this! Basically, I hope not to be stuck at a corporate job making pharmaceutical brochures soon. Any help from you to prevent that from happening would be much appreciated. I absolutely love hearing from you, and creating content for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you contribute a small amount towards funding\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nicemangos.blogspot.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNice Mangos\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/politeconversations\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePolite Conversations\u003c/a\u003e per month, I can spend more time on creating better quality and more frequent content. You can cancel your contribution at any time, \u003cstrong\u003eso it\u0027s not a lifelong commitment.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work has been featured on Buzzfeed, VICE magazine, ELLE magazine, Richard Dawkins Foundation, Huffington Post and many more publications. I promise, I\u0027m not *that* bad at what I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny help would mean a great deal to me. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be perks for you of course, to show my love and gratitude! And you will get access to early releases!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Eiynah\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
