I\u0027m currently enrolled at Georgian College for the Graphic Design Production, my final year, and I enjoy what I am creating so far. I was encouraged to create a Patreon from a few friends who\u0027ve seen my artwork. So this is a little new to me. Anyone with experience with this is more than happy to hit me up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe work I create sketches of characters I\u0027ve encountered with my writing, other individuals characters in their own writing, comics based on my life and I am working on trying to learn animation on my own. I\u0027m in the pending works of writing a story, but... I\u0027m still in school!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I had a goal, I\u0027d say I\u0027d like to get noticed by Blizzard Entertainment. Yes, big company but I have big dreams and a lot of creativity under my belt.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this, and hopefully: I\u0027ll get the hang of this.\u00a0",
