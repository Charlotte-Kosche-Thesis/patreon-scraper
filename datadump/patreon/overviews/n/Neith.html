To me, art has always been a way of expressing my emotions where words failed to create a clear picture. I\u0027m passionate about art because it allows me to make clear my emotions, and connect with those around me.\u003cbr\u003eIn pursuit of this, I dream of producing quality art that people can feel. Filling viewers with determination at a portrayal of defiance, or expressing more primal urges with some naughty artwork. I want to continue to improve until I\u0027m creating art that I can be proud of, and eventually go beyond that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have some really big plans for my artwork. I love applying my craft to all new mediums. From simple Illustrations to Manga, Visual Novels, and even Video games. My ultimate goal is forge my own outlets for my artwork to entertain.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Patreon allows me to spend more time on working on what I the many projects I have in store. It helps me pay bills, educate myself and hone my craft.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell First things first, this is a \u003cstrong\u003eNO PAYWALL\u003c/strong\u003e campaign. It just doesn\u0027t feel right. On top of that, It feels counter-intuitive to hide things when I want the world to notice me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I \u003cstrong\u003eCAN \u003c/strong\u003eoffer you (on top of my undying love and appreciation) is a great look behind the scenes, and the chance to influence the direction of my art. I\u0027ll be using this Patreon to connect with my fans, and release special content you can\u0027t find anywhere else. Things like \u003cstrong\u003eprocess videos, Hi-Res downloads, sketches, WIPs, updates for my new projects, and lots of other great stuff.\u003c/strong\u003e On top of that, Patrons will get access to special polls which give fans a chance to choose the topics for my upcoming projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003eWhere\u0027s my money going?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e100% of what this patreon makes goes into keeping a roof over my head and the lights on. An all-ramen diet sucks, but I\u0027ll live.This Patreons money is going toward those bill that\u0027ve been piling up. By taking those kinds of burdens off of my mind, I can focus my energy on what I\u0027m passionate about. That gives me time to improve my art to create more art and, most importantly, more time to express my appreciation to you guys in every way that I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt is my hope, that with Patreon, I will be able to supplement my current income (not a lot these days) and maybe even one day replace it! My takeaway message to anyone reading this would be \"Please think of this Patreon as a tip-jar. If you like what I\u0027m doing; If you support my what I\u0027m doing here. If you believe in me and believe in my craft, please consider a pledge\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://puu.sh/m0Pi9.png\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNe\u026a\u03b8"
