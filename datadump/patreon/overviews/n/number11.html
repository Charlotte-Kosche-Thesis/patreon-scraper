I run the Yugioh strategy/information site, The Big Eye at \u003ca href=\"http://Number11.xyz\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://Number11.xyz\u003c/a\u003e to share with you the knowledge I have accumulated over my years of playing the game. I want to continue to produce consistent quality content and keep it 100% free for my readers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I\u0027ve made this Patreon page to ask those of you that are able to, to consider supporting me in this way. Let\u0027s be real, my family and I need to eat and my 2-year-old daughter can put it away like it\u0027s nobody\u0027s business. This Patreon page is just one way you can help me to keep the content coming and keep it free for everyone. We\u0027re on a tight budget and every bit helps out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you pledge or not, thanks for reading and supporting me. I hope you enjoy (and continue to enjoy) the articles I write. Feel free to let me know what you\u0027d like to read, what you\u0027d like me to cover in the future, and what kind of rewards you\u0027d like to see from me as well; I\u0027m still new at this, and the content is for you guys, after all! I want to hear anything you have to say that\u0027ll help both of us improve as players.\u00a0"
