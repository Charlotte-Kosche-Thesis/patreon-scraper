I hope I will be able to get back to the favorite and most important work of my life in the future. My plan for now is to upload all my work files here for anyone to use as they wish as I don\u0027t know how my future will look. And a huge thanks to everyone who supported me! We share a passion and one of the most important things in my life and maybe yours too :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- IMPORTANT END -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey\neveryone, \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m\nAGLASSOFMILK, and my passion is making Adult Video Games. When\nplaying games, I used to always think \u201cAww man, how awesome would\nit be if there was a hot sexy scene right here in this moment of the\ngame?!\u201d I dreamed about these thoughts turning into\nreality.Unfortunately, the only way to make this happen is to create\nthese dreams myself. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\nstarted making games myself years ago. When I graduated University\nand landed a job, things changed. Work was stressful and took up\nlarge amounts of my time. I found it was hard to balance work life\nwith my passion, and my production for my dream games slowed down to\na crawl. It sucked, because I truly enjoyed the games I make, and so\ndid my fans. It takes a lot of time to make something with such good\nquality and unfortunately there is not enough time to spare. \u003cstrong\u003eHOWEVER\u003c/strong\u003e\nI believe these problems can be overcome! I believe Patreon is my\nchance to change my circumstances, quit my job, and devote all of my\ntime to my passion\u2026creating adult games and entertainment for \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e.\nI truly believe my work is unique and I test my creations quite\nfrequently. I have to say, I have never had more fun being able to\nplay and test my own creations, and you can too. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u2019s\nhow I plan to develop and release my games.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\nuse flash, because it offers a variety of options for animations; and\nis very efficient to code. When completed, I will release the games\nand levels on my DLsite web page listed below. \u003cstrong\u003ePATRONS\u003c/strong\u003e\nwho support me with a certain minimum will have access to the games\nas well as bonus content which may or may not make it to the final\nproduct. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeep\nin mind\u003c/strong\u003e,\nquality content takes time to produce. I will work my hardest to be\nable to deliver in a timely manner depending on my circumstances. If\nI am able to make a living off of this, the time I used to spend at\nwork will be fully devoted to developing content for you!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\tI\nlook forward to sharing my dreams with you through my creations. \u003cstrong\u003eHelp\nme make it a reality!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am working right now on \u003cstrong\u003eCracked Vessel\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.nearfatal.net/patreon/crackedvessel.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.nearfatal.net/patreon/crackedvessel.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn arcade space ship arena-like shooter where you can upgrade your ship to get more abilities, weapons and tools to infiltrate an transporter with tentacles and other stuff to progress and discover new things in the space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand other games I will post infos about:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.nearfatal.net/patreon/header_MIX_2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike ImpregDef(ense), TheGhostHouse, EggDrop and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eFAQs:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eWill I make a cheap deal by getting your games here?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made this patreon so I can finish games in less time as it takes right now. So that means, no, you are not getting a cheap deal, but you and me will get my games at all. Without this patreon it takes me years to finish a project. Because I spend all my time at work (40h a week like every normal person), where I make shitty ad campaigns nobody needs. It\u0027s sad because I think my games are good. If I make enough money with this patreon I can make full time my games, releasing better quality content in muuuch less time.

Maybe more often maybe sometimes a little less, depending on what I am working. For example when I code basic gameplay it is rather boring to update that. When finalizing a part of a game/animation updates can be more frequent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you post?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, because I am still short of time because of my casual job, I will post games/animations I started but never published, because I don\u0027t like to spoil people. Yes, this will be massive spoilers, but it\u0027s for a good cause :3 Some will be gameplay stuff, most of it will be started xxx animations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere can I find more of you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can check out my website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.nearfatal.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.nearfatal.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hentai-foundry: \u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/pictures/user/AGlassMilk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.hentai-foundry.com/pictures/user/AGlass...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd my products on dlsite: \u003ca href=\"http://www.dlsite.com/ecchi-eng/circle/profile/=/maker_id/RG18557.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.dlsite.com/ecchi-eng/circle/profile/=/m...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
