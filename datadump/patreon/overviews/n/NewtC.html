I\u0027m a streamer and content creator for both\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TheNewtC/featured\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/newtc\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e. My content includes a combination of story oriented games and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSQSsMCgp5bAAfxMyQHh8XVeKWv8ZvxUm\"\u003efranchise\u003c/a\u003e streams. Franchise streams are rare, but when they happen they go for months at a time. I also try to play every game I stream on the hardest non-hardcore difficulty available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranchise Streams?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFranchise streams are exactly what they sound like: I play the entirety of a video game franchise, in its currently released form, from start to finish. These are rare, and currently consist of only two franchises: Bioshock and The Witcher. However, I intend to do many more in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs far as donations go, I came to Patreon to avoid using ads in my videos. I absolutely hate ads, and intend to never use them if possible. I know if I find them annoying, they must be even worse for viewers of my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does my money get me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently, any donations above a dollar get you access to the Patreon channel in my Discord, which allows you to vote on the polls regarding major in-game decisions. More rewards will come as I think of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my money going towards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUltimately, donations are going toward allowing me to stream full time. Short term however is much simpler. I want to eventually commission stream art, along with games and additional recording equipment for the stream. While my current setup works, it could be a lot better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Promise\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will never, ever ask users to donate if they don\u0027t have the capacity or don\u0027t want to. That being said, I massively appreciate every donation, as it brings me one (or maybe more than one) step closer to achieving a permanent streaming schedule. Donations directly translate to less time spent working at a job and more time spent working on the stream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you everyone who decided to donate!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat don\u0027t you stream?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA good question. I refuse to even touch anything that\u0027s only available on Origin, and that rules out most things I don\u0027t already own made by Electronic Arts. While some of these titles look interesting (read: Dragon Age Inquisition) I can\u0027t bring myself to support their business practices.\u003cbr\u003e"
