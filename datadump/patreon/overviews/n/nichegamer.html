For those who\ndon\u2019t know us or what the site encapsulates, here\u0027s a brief run down for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u2019re the premiere source and community for both niche and unique games across the globe. We\u00a0truly care about our fellow\ngamers as our supporters\u2014not the advertising companies, publishers, and so on. We cannot stress this being our core goal with Niche Gamer enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat comes from this is that relying on advertising revenue is\nsimply not a sustainable and/or ethical practice for us. We don\u2019t want to keep\nfocusing on numbers of views every day; instead, we want to focus on the\nquality of our content, the amount of exposure we can give those unloved games,\nand the mutual love for games we can share with our fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to make Niche Gamer bigger and better, but sadly we don\u0027t have the money to keep doing this on our own. We don\u2019t have the capacity to grow the site any further out of our own pockets, so\nwe\u0027re looking to you guys to help us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll of the funding spending with our Patreon will be\ndisclosed every month in our backer newsletter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA message from Brandon, the Editor in Chief: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I\u2019ve always looked at Niche Gamer as a dream project of\nmine, but also as an investment, and I have lots of plans outlined that will\ngrow the website, the community, the brand, and the quality of our work. I just\ncan\u2019t do all of that without your help.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to donate once (that\u0027s totally fine), you can do so via our Paypal donate page, over on our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nichegamer.com/donate/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
