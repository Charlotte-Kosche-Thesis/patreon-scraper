    "summary": "Hey there Stranger! My name\u0027s Neos and this is my Patreon page! But you probably knew all of that already, didn\u0027t you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003eWho am I?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut hey, just in case you didn\u0027t let me give you a quite rundown. Most people likely know me from my YouTube channel at\u00a0\u003ca\u003eYouTube.com/NeonNeos\u003c/a\u003e or my older channel at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/NeosForme\"\u003eYouTube.com/NeosForme\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027m a guy who loves games, loves making videos, and loves trying his best to entertain people however I can. I\u0027ve done that in many ways such as art and writing, but my current passion is making videos to help brighten people\u0027s days with their silly content. And since I\u0027ve always been such a huge gamer, I\u0027ve found myself a little audience here in the gaming community that seem to enjoy what I do. I try my best to make highly energetic, entertaining gaming-related videos and post one every day. This varies from more long-form content like full playthroughs, to early looks at upcoming games, and frequent, highly edited craziness to hopefully help people to smile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s me. A guy who likes to try to entertain people on the interwebs. Unfortunately, as much as I love making videos (and I do), and despite how many hours a day I put into creating them to share with people (it\u0027s a lot), it\u0027s nowhere near able to pay the bills. And that\u0027s why I\u0027m here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy am I here?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to beg for money or try to guilt trip anyone into feeling like they owe anything to me, I just wanted to set up this Patreon page as an option for any of my viewers who would like to help support my efforts as I continue to try to make free, entertaining content. Or for anyone who just want to leave a tip.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I don\u0027t want to just ask for money without offering anything in return, so I\u0027ve tried to come up with some things to give back in return to my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhat you get for being a patron\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon stream\u003c/strong\u003e - \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eOn top of my currently planned monthly livestream, if I manage to get enough patrons to make it possible, I plan to do an additional monthly stream for my patrons. These will be streams that are voted on exclusively by my patrons. You get to tell me what you want to see and decide what it is I play for the stream. Now I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s a way to stream exclusively to my patrons without other people being able to drop in, but that\u0027s not what I want to do. I don\u0027t like the idea of excluding people who want to watch my videos just because they didn\u0027t pay me. So everyone will be able to watch, but only my patrons will get a say in what is being played.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2) \u003cstrong\u003eVote for future videos or series\u003c/strong\u003e - \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWhen I\u0027m planning to start up a new full playthrough of a game or even just trying to decide what sort of new highly edited \"experiences\" video I\u0027m planning to make, I\u0027ll give my patrons first say in making the choice. This won\u0027t be for every video or series, mind you. But I will try to make at least one of each ongoing playthrough a patron selected one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e3) \u003cstrong\u003ePatron selected videos\u003c/strong\u003e -\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eUnlike the previous entry where I\u0027ll offer options and allow you to vote on the outcome, here I\u0027ll offer the option for you to choose my fate and tell me what game to make a video on. This can be absolutely anything, whether I like it or not. It could be anything from an obscure old game from your childhood that you\u0027d like to relive again, or a terrifying horror game to send chills up my spine and leave me screaming like a coward. The choice is yours! (At the moment this will only be once a month until I can feel out how frequently I can do these on top of my current upload schedule. And these will have to be either something I own or can get my hands on without spending excessive amounts of money. I don\u0027t make a lot remember? That\u0027s why I\u0027m here, hehe.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e4) \u003cstrong\u003eAdblock forgiveness\u003c/strong\u003e -\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThis is a waaaaay less interesting option to a lot of you I\u0027m sure, but I feel like it\u0027s worth mentioning. I\u0027m from the internet and I know how big of a pain ads are. They\u0027re just everywhere. And I know a lot of people simply find ways around having to watch them. Which I completely understand, I\u0027m not going to judge. Unfortunately for me, that\u0027s the only way I can make money on YouTube. But hey, if you feel inclined to leave me a dollar a month here on Patreon, that would more than make up for any ad-skipping you may be doing over on my channel. (Believe it or not, it really does.)\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s about it! I\u0027m just a guy who likes to entertain people through my love of games and video-production and I\u0027d love to continue to do so! Thank you so much for your time, and whether you decide to support me here on Patreon or not thank you for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut anyway, this has been my Patreon information rant! I hope guys\u0027ve enjoyed all this information and stuff! Take care! And I\u0027ll see you next time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWait... Does that mean there\u0027s gonna be more Patreons?"
