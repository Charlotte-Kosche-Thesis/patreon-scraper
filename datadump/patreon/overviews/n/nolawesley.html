    "summary": "The NOLA Wesley United Methodist Campus Ministry is an inclusive, justice-seeking campus ministry on the campus of Loyola and Tulane in New Orleans. We are open to students of all Christian denominations, with a particular heart for students who have been marginalized and alienated by the church.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur regular activities include: Sunday evening worship, multiple small group Bible studies throughout the week; alcohol-free community events like open mics, movie nights, and coffeehouse outings; and community service projects building houses, feeding the homeless, and community gardening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have four core values that define the NOLA Wesley vision: open table, safe space, changed lives, and transformed world. Our table is open to whoever will join us, wherever they are in their faith journey. We create space where it is safe to be completely honest and make mistakes. We expect to have our lives changed by Jesus\u0027 love. We take responsibility for transforming our world according to the values of the kingdom of God.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of restructuring in our denomination, we are facing major budget cuts that require us to transition to private funding. We are completely different than a financially self-sufficient congregation that supports itself through its members\u0027 tithes. We depend on the generosity of those who would like to see inclusive college ministry thrive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support! You are investing in the future of the church.\u003cbr\u003e"
