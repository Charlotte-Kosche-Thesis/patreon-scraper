    "summary": "Hey, my name is Brandon, but you know me as either NewWorld or Power\"Mageeka\", because I guess people can\u0027t pronounce \"magika\"... I mean, how fucking hard is that \u003cstrong\u003ereally \u003c/strong\u003eto pronounce? Mag-i-ka, exactly how it is spelled. Whatever, I\u0027m rambling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI said a few years ago that I would never make a fan page, so how hypocritical is it that I now made a Patreon? Listen, I\u0027m not happy I had to do it, either. But listen, I want to make the best content I can for you guys, my viewers. It sounds like I\u0027m pandering, but I really mean what I\u0027m typing. I have a determination to YouTube that I don\u0027t have for anything else. I wanna be the best at it and I\u0027m finding it truly difficult to get out quality content to you guys. I gotta be honest and I\u0027m sure you can all agree, the actual quality of my videos are GARBAGE and there\u0027s a reason for that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, I\u0027m not looking for a hand out and I don\u0027t want to throw a pity party for myself so I\u0027ll try my best not to do those things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube doesn\u0027t pay smaller content creators nearly enough and I\u0027m in a very small community of content creation. Aka, I bust my ass off and not many people see it, sadly that\u0027s how the YouTube system works. I made this Patreon at the end of the day for you viewers so your eyes don\u0027t have to be strained by the terrible quality of my videos. I care about my channel too much to not do SOMETHING. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is that first \"something\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThree, five and twenty... If someone gives me twenty a month, I\u0027d literally shit myself. That was my version of a \"crazy\" number. \u00a0Basically everyone will be mentioned who gives me money will be rewarded in some way, shape or form. I just need to find a good idea of showing my gratitude other than just a credit segment at the end of my videos to show appreciation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I don\u0027t value my own hard work and determination, who will, am I right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
