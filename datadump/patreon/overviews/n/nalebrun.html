A. Le Brun, because my novels and short stories tend to focus on Science Fiction and/or Fantasy. But my friends, and therefore my patrons, can call me Nat. \u00a0My poetry is usually based on my own experiences, which means of late I\u0027ve been writing about that dreaded subject known as love, yeah I know, soppy right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had a passion for writing for as long as I can remember, with some of my earliest works still to be found in notebooks with written with a child\u0027s hand, one such story was about a duck called Quackers who lived at the bottom of a garden in a rusting garden shed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese days my main characters are usually LGBT+ because I want young adults and others to have the characters I didn\u0027t have, and often still don\u0027t have in the literature that I read. And whilst I enjoy reading books with romance in them, I don\u0027t want romance and or sex to be the only things in them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy latest published work:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/26231128_787127094823418_4346166502097239573_n.jpg?oh=8a46d35de755e62c4cc1d493ee50f33c\u0026amp;oe=5AE4F89E\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Stolen Generation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBetween 1972 and 1993 the Global Sector Council forced single mothers to have abortions.When those babies were aborted, their souls were stolen and attached to lab made children. Those children, together with a group known as the Rebellion are now fighting back. Freya \u0027Freddie\u0027 Faith Raner takes us on a whirlwind adventure as she and her soul sister search for their soul mother, look to over throw the global government, and make friends, and enemies, along the way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA dystopian novel set in a parallel universe which split from our own timeline in the aftermath of the Second World War. Utopia isn\u0027t all that it seems, in a world where religion has been abolished, LGBT people have rights the world over, and food, shelter, and education are taken as given.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m an indie author. It gives me more control over what I publish, where I publish it, and gives me one hundred percent of the rights. But it also means I\u0027m in charge of the marketing, print runs, and anything else coming my way. I\u0027m also in a wheelchair, so to get to events etc, I need to be able to pay for not only a table at events, but public transport and accomodation not only for myself, but my carer as well. I\u0027m also looking at relocating, and I\u0027ll need furniture and things for the new place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon gives me the chance to not only share my work with an audience, but earn some much needed money towards the move, marketing, print runs, etc, whilst I\u0027m at it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
