    "summary": "Hi, let me start with a simple, humbled thank you from the bottom of my heart for being here, and I don\u0027t care if that sounds cheesy. Following a dream is one of the most wonderful yet challenging things, and it\u0027s taken me a \u003cstrong\u003elong time to adapt to the idea of people genuinely wanting to help me make that happen\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ve always struggled with understanding and accepting investment from people in any form on this journey, despite knowing I love to do the same for others that I can see are also following a dream. I think part of the reason I\u0027ve done this totally \u003cstrong\u003ealone for so long\u003c/strong\u003e is because I don\u0027t feel comfortable in that. But lately I\u0027ve been seeing things change and grow, slowly but in a way that is gradually opening my eyes to the fact that - yes, it is possible for people to enjoy what I do and want to become a part of making it happen, and that is OK! (and unbelievably wonderful ahhhhhh). I\u0027m going to be using Patreon as a way for you to donate a small amount each month, to essentially \u003cstrong\u003ebecome my \"label\", my creative foundation,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eallow me to give back to you guys in a unique, special way.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most recent step I took was to release\u003cstrong\u003e \u0027Bedroom Demos\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e, an album of 18 songs that I\u0027d written in the past, produced up to decent demos myself, and had then left, sitting in my computer and never heard. This is because time would fly, I\u0027d write new songs that resonated more with me, and they\u0027d become \u003cstrong\u003eforgotten fragments of experience and creativity, no less worthy of existing but having missed their time.\u003c/strong\u003e I toyed with the idea of starting a Patreon for those, but in the end I settled, perhaps battling the last little bits of fear of accepting committed help from anybody, on releasing a one off album for a set amount, with an after-thought goal of it helping fund studio time for my new material. I was totally and utterly BLOWN AWAY by the response to this - I had NO IDEA that many of you were willing and interested enough to buy a CD of tracks I\u0027d not only produced myself, but had at some point considered not quite good enough in comparison to something else in terms of writing. Some of you even came to see me on tour and told me your \u0027favourite songs\u0027 off the album, and you can\u0027t even imagine how happy it makes me to suddenly see those songs being heard and actually resonating with people, bloody hell. It\u0027s overwhelming in the most uncomfortable, beautiful way. But my aim is to get comfortable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to create more\u003c/strong\u003e, and feel like I can write without the ONLY outlet being commercial release. And hey I\u0027d love to get imaginative on a few covers too! Knowing that you are here, willing and looking forward to me releasing whatever I do here, is going to open so many doors in my brain and my heart. Sadly, despite growing my career from back in 2010 on YouTube, I\u0027ve sort of given up hope on it, due to the difficulty of uploading sporadically and getting any sort of views, after spending days learning songs, recording, and editing just one video. Like many kids getting big, I am no longer living with my parents and can\u0027t afford to consistently take days out purely for the love of it like I used to. That is NOT to say, however, that the \u003cstrong\u003efew people who do still watch my videos\u003c/strong\u003e don\u0027t make my world go round, and it\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003efor people like that that I am creating this Patreon page for. \u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027re gonna keep that alive!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, in summary, I haven\u0027t got the firmest plan yet, but I see this as being a new opportunity for me to \u003cstrong\u003ecreate, create, create\u003c/strong\u003e, without confining that creativity to \u0027singles\u0027 or the pressure of getting somewhere, wherever that is. I can\u0027t say for how long I\u0027ll do this, \u003cstrong\u003ebut for now it is EXACTLY what feels right\u003c/strong\u003e, as I want to connect with you all more than ever on a personal level. I also have a love for exploring this thing called life in a deeper way, and would love to share a bit of writing with you all if you\u0027re up for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s start something great together! GO TEAM \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNatalie x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. I found the words for my reward titles on a site called \u0027The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows\u0027, it\u0027s really quite moving!"
