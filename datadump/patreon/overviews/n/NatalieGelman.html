    "summary": "Hey! I\u0027m Natalie Gelman, a musician and songwriter. I grew up busking in the NYC subways and have toured all over the US and Europe without a label, manager or agent. You, the fans, are what keep me afloat through all of it as an independent artist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really excited to be starting this Patreon community but the truth is you\u0027ve always been my patrons. You\u0027ve hosted house concerts, let me crash in your guest room, borrow your car or your ukulele, fed me on the road... I could go on but you get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027m here on Patreon because I want to make our music-love-fest official. I want a space where I can share some extra special stuff with the peeps that \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e make it possible and to start a conversation about the projects and work you want most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it is work. On top of all the hours I spend every week on my work, I invest nearly every dollar I make back into my music to pay for recording, videos, new equipment and gear, repairs, website hosting and dozens of other things I am blocking from my memory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u00a0finish up what will be my third studio album I\u0027m realizing that I\u0027ve been craving a more ongoing connection with my community and that it\u0027s not sustainable for me to keep going the way I am... and that it\u0027s not allowing me to grow as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI put out a lot of music and videos constantly that are free for you but cost me a lot to create and I want to keep offering everything I can dream up to the world but I need my dreams and my financial reality to get a little closer...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I hope you\u0027ll join me here on Patreon and support the \"things\" I believe are worth my energy and your money. I chose to run this as a per-thing instead of per-month basis because I found as I made my last album that is how I work best. I will try to have something extra special for you monthly or so and it may fall slightly more or less some months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs this grows and I have a bigger budget per \"thing\" to spend on the projects I can create more and special MP3\u0027s, Videos and more work not exclusive only to Patreon too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccess to the Patreon only feed starts at just $1 and I am truly so grateful for any and all support sent my way to keep making music my full-time (and then some) gig.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can cap your monthly charges to make sure you stay in your budget and Patreon charges your credit card or Paypal account on the 1st of the following month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the rewards I\u0027ve set up too and if you have any questions just let me know at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:Natalie@NatalieGelman.com\"\u003eNatalie@NatalieGelman.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would prefer to just make a one-time pledge of support you can do that through this\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?business=Natalie%40NatalieGelman.com\u0026amp;cmd=_donations\u0026amp;currency_code=USD\u0026amp;item_name=Donation+to+++Natalie+Gelman\u0026amp;return=https%3A%2F%2Fnataliegelman.com%2Fhome\"\u003ePaypal donation link\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much always for being in my corner and just for listening to my music and being here...
