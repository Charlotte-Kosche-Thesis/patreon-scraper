Welcome to my Patreon page!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tTake a look below to to find out\u00a0what perks you\u0027ll receive for participating,\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0and to the learn about where this money is going.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBe sure to watch the video above for full details!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy main goals with this page are to increase the production value of my music videos, and to help up the frequency of my posts. This includes both cover videos, as well as upcoming original content. I will be releasing my debut EP of original music this summer! YAY! I want to make sure I give this project the full \u00a0treatment, and create proper music videos for each track. This will require a team, and production costs can add up quickly. Money made here will be going right back into the content created for you all.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThis will also aid in my ability to post on a more frequent and scheduled basis. I will be posting about 1-2 videos a month (give or take). Regardless of how much I post, you are able to set your monthly limit to whatever you are comfortable with. You are also able to cancel or adjust your contribution at any time! Amounts below are listed in dollars, but this page is not restricted to the United States. All currency will be converted if outside the U.S.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIn general, I will not charge for/register Vlogs. My intent with this page is to use it for videos where I\u0027m singing. The rare exception may be for select \"behind the scenes\" videos or Vlogs that direct you to a music video that doesn\u0027t live on my main channel. \u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWith all of that said, please feel no obligation to become a patron. If you\u00a0are unable to participate, I will still love you all the same! My youtube videos\u00a0will always be free, and available for all to view. This is just a\u00a0tool to help\u00a0aid in creating more and higher quality content for you all!\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI am so grateful for all the support that has been shown to me throughout the years! Youtube has enabled me to live out my musical dreams, and I am forever grateful to all who have watched/listened. With your help, hopefully I can continue taking this dream forward, and bring you all along for the ride\u00a0\u0026lt;3\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPhoto Credits: Austen Risolvato (B\u0026amp;W) and Alexi\u00a0Papalexopoulos (color)\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHere are a few examples of what you can expect from my covers/originals/\"One Man\" videos.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/qUY8PxfM3F4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/6VYok65Anyc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhat You\u0027ll Get...\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
