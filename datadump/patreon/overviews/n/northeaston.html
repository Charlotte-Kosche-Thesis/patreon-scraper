Now I can\u0027t remember any of the words to the songs for my first couple years...well...because I couldn\u0027t speak...and to be perfectly honest...even on stage at the age I am now...some of the words aren\u0027t as clear in my mind as I\u0027m sure they could be. But I love to make songs. A lot of the time, my songs are accompanied with some fun little videos that might have the lyrics on screen, or some images that highlight the stories of where the song started from. Like this tune here...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPFtZRBCIns\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wrote this song about a day that needed a little ROPE SWINGING...if you have ever grabbed a hold of big ole rope tied to a branch in a tree and took a big breath before you rolled the dice at where this was all gonna go...then I\u0027m sure you can relate to this. And, if you haven\u0027t ever done that...you probably have witnessed someone else doing something they shouldn\u0027t. It doesn\u0027t always end up the way you want it to....but...sometimes it does. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a creationist. A writer of songs and stories.
