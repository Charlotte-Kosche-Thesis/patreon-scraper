It means that my reactions and other original content have either entertained or inspired you in one way or the other. And that, my dear friends, is the ultimate reward. So before you even decide to support me on Patreon, I wanna thank \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e for letting me be part of your life no matter how small that part is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Ahmad, I have a YouTube channel called \"Nerdistein Alba\" where I post reactions, reviews, previews of my favourite TV shows and Movies as well as other original content. My YouTube videos are \u003cstrong\u003eAd-Free\u003c/strong\u003e and not monetised except for those claimed by YouTube, in which all revenue go to the claimant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIMPORTANT DISCLOSURE:\u003c/strong\u003e I have to be very clear with you guys because it\u2019s your hard earned finances that you\u2019re supporting me with: I work an average of 47 hours a week, the job pays very well, my parents and I are financially supporting my 5 siblings (4 in school and 1 looking for a job). I am the highest earner in the family including my parents. Filming 4 reactions and editing them takes me 3-4 hours minimum per reaction. If these information have affected your decision regarding your support, I really understand! I just thought that you deserve to be fully aware of my situation before any pledges get processed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- If you decide to stay, I want you to know that none of this I take for granted. To have people supporting me means that I\u2019ve impacted their lives somehow. And that\u2019s my friends is the ultimate reward and what makes me sleep at night with a smile on my face!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all again for your support \u2764\ufe0f\u003cbr\u003e"
