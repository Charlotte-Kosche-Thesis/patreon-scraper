This is why you should consider supporting me. My goal is to promote respectful and civil discussions among people who completely disagree with each other. My hope is that through civil dialogue we can present and be presented with different perspectives and viewpoints that may allow us to consider things we previously have not.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy vision is to bring fun, levity and satire to the religious/political discussion that has for so long turned ugly at every corner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my discussions, my YouTube channel consists of lots of music. I produce drum covers of popular songs as well as many hours of meditative and relaxing playlists that you can listen to after your ears have been blown out by my drumming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut Wait!

I\u2019m in my thirties, only child, married with two kids, as well as a cat and a one-hundred twenty pound man-child rottweiler. I\u2019ve been online since \u201996. I host regular discussions centered around religion, politics and current events. I also love music and produce many hours of it. Whether it\u0027s a relaxing playlist to help you drift off to sleep or bashing your ears in with metal drum covers, there is a lot of it on my YouTube channel. I\u0027m an avid gamer and produce gaming content as well as tutorials on how to do all the stuff I just mentioned. Feel free to reach out and drop me a line. I look forward to connecting with more and more people who share these interests.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
