    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eThere was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, united by the Superheroes in Pop Culture course run by Smithsonian X, to see if they could become something more. To see if they could work together to redefine the classic superhero story, to realize their dream of bringing their characters to life. And this isn\u0027t just a good old-fashioned notion-- it\u2019s a new project that wants to bring something fresh and unique to the superhero genre. Introducing NeoVerse: a collection of seven novels taking superhero lore and reinvigorating classic storytelling with a new breed of diverse, unique characters!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou read that right: novels. Not graphic novels, not comics. Since not all of us possess the talent to draw, we\u2019ve decided to skip the comic format altogether and bring our heroes to life in a different way. The classic novel is about to get taken over by superheroes, and our goal is to build a single universe of our very own that will eventually crossover to form a whole team like you\u0027ve never seen before. These guys are not your classic superheroes, and that\u2019s what makes them special! You\u0027ll meet telekinetic Mistag; werewolf mercenary Gatler; Auroch, the guardian of his city; Crimson Thorn, assassin-turned-hero; newbie vigilante Patrol; cosmic peacekeeper Thomas and the invulnerable Shadow among many others. These heroes fight villains, monsters, criminals and their own personal demons in action-packed tales that we just can\u0027t wait to share with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeoVerse is very much a \u0027by geeks, for geeks\u0027 project. To get it off the ground (and up, up and away!) we\u2019re asking you to help us raise funds for this project so all of us can achieve our dream of being successful writers and create something new. The funds will go to copyediting, cover design, interior design, printing, distribution and marketing. Follow us on Facebook or Twitter to get updates, sneak peeks and get to know the team and the universe. Share, donate, spread the word and never shut up about it, because that\u0027s how legends begin! And we in turn will give you cool donor perks, live videos, characters you\u0027ll love and a crossover of epic proportions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe slate of novels in this universe goes like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cAuroch\u201d by Casey van Camp\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeroes, villains, and other extra powered individuals have become a common occurrence in the world and the people live in fear of those that abuse their gifts and threaten their lives. Heroes stand to protect those that cannot protect themselves but are increasingly outnumbered by those that abuse their gifts and threaten people\u0027s lives to get what they want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAuroch, the protector, has taken to the streets to battle the forces of villainy and push back the darkness and corruption infecting his city. He stands as a symbol to the city to serve and protect what they care about and help those in need of help. The city and its police force are being inundated with monsters, villains, and creatures from all corners and cracks of the darkest realms and unofficial genetic experiments. The world is in need of a hero that can break them from the threats they face and Auroch is that shining beacon. Auroch is young however and must learn from his Father to use his powers wisely and avoid the temptations and influential powers of villains. The soul of the city and safety of its people hang in the balance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_620/v1459452086/received_10152846479755812_o9wjug.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cBlack Thorns\u201d by Enrique Betancourt\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMerrik Spark had been raised as an Assassin of the Cleansing, killing people who stand against the norm. Now, twenty-years old and an expert at killing, he seeks redemption. Once he learns that the man that trained him is looking to control his city and fill it with oppressive hatred, he returns from exile to protect his people against discrimination and crime. He becomes the Crimson Thorn. However, his dark methods left people wondering if he\u2019s really a symbol of hope, prompting to more vigilantes to show up in Nexus City.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon enough, the hate crimes get worse and they have the days counted before Operation: Lazarus, the day or reckoning. While trying to keep a balance on his true nature and the two men he loves, plus reconnecting with his family, Merrik will be face with the true question of his identity: Is he a hero or a villain? The crusade will escalate to involve his family, his friends, and soon enough Nexus City will be a playground for vigilantes and criminals. The war between two cults of assassins will force the black thorns to unite and take a stand against the real enemy\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_620/v1459452146/Final_lidobj.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_620/v1459452200/Stardust_kc6ztg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cThe Wolf\u201d by Brigadier-Wolf\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you stop believing in monsters they go away. But every story holds some truth in it, even monster stories. For centuries mankind has turned a blind eye to the beasts that walk alongside them. At the turn of the century something changed in both man and monster. As man became more powerful, more and more monsters became known to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGatler an ex-Black Ops mercenary spent most of his life killing the hidden evils of the world for profit. Five years into his retirement he is called on again. Only this time he has something more important to protect; his daughter.

It seems that around every corner, a new super-powered freak shows up. Society is divided between hatred and love whenever the topic of these transcended beings is brought up. No one knows where they have come from, or why they have made themselves known to the world. That is where our story starts\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMichael Louis was a seemingly normal child to the general population, but his adoptive parents knew the truth. One day when he was just an infant, he was crying. When they walked into the room to check on him, his toys were floating in the air around him. Michael grew up and learned how to control these powers with the help of his parents. He realized the only way to control the powers, is to control his emotions. He knew that these powers could be used to help people, and so he became Mistag.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, not all super humans are as kind-hearted as Michael. Some of them have had their minds warped by these special gifts. Others exploit these powers for darkness. Either way Michael must help them, and the people they threaten to hurt. But not everyone finds vigilantes helpful. The government despises the super humans and has hired guns to take care of them. One of the most skilled has been hired to take Mistag, and any other transcended being, down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cPatrol\u201d by Sabine Antigua\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKevin Rocita is a fast-talking DJ and martial arts enthusiast from Maharlika City, the illustrious home base of the Philippine super hero team the Three Stars. But when a powerful crime ring and a vengeful friend-turned-foe pose danger for both the heroes and ordinary civilians alike, the once-peaceful city threatens to turn into a warzone. And caught up in the middle is Kevin, whose martial arts savvy and untested taste for adventure makes him the perfect person to take on the Three Stars\u0027 tarnished legacy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAided by crime-fighting veteran Tanya Reyes AKA Alitaptap, resident billionaire-genius Nicho Carrera and fellow novice Jessica Cruz AKA the Black Butterfly, Kevin becomes the masked crusader Patrol and takes on the drama, danger and high-octane that comes with being a vigilante. And along the way he learns a pretty important life hack: when you take on the responsibility, that\u0027s how you get the power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cNeoDarkness\u201d (Working Title) by Cade Bengert\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTyler is a high school student with depression.
