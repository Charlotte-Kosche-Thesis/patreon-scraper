It was a labor of love. I paid for all the art, at a loss. Dex worked his tail off. The end result was a comic both were incredibly proud of, but which was deeply in the red, to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Domain,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0our next comic, takes our collaboration in a new, ambitious direction. \u003cstrong\u003eCura Te Ipsum\u003c/strong\u003e was black and white. \u003cstrong\u003eThe Domain\u003c/strong\u003e will be color. \u003cstrong\u003eCura Te Ipsum\u003c/strong\u003e was written for the trade. \u003cstrong\u003eThe Domain\u003c/strong\u003e will be written by the issue, and released as issues. \u003cstrong\u003eCura Te Ipsum\u003c/strong\u003e was set largely on earth. \u003cstrong\u003eThe Domain\u003c/strong\u003e is a sweeping space epic. \u003cstrong\u003eCura Te Ipsum\u003c/strong\u003e was written to learn what we could try. \u003cstrong\u003eThe Domain\u003c/strong\u003e will be two longstanding collaborators showing what they can do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are asking \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e to help us make \u003cstrong\u003eThe Domain.\u003c/strong\u003e Instead of relying on \u003cstrong\u003eKickstarters,\u003c/strong\u003e as we did for \u003cstrong\u003eCura,\u003c/strong\u003e we will instead treat \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e as a subscription service/purchase point for our issues. For \u003cstrong\u003ethree dollars a month,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0you get it all. Regular interaction with the creators. Works in progress. Commentaries. We will sell our book to the general public in order to continue to make the book, but we will give it to our patrons \u003cstrong\u003ethree full months\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0before we offer it to anyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe estimate the book will be \u003cstrong\u003ebimonthly.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0We hope to increase that speed, but in order to do so, we\u0027ll need the budget to make it happen. We will update constantly as to when the book will be ready, and how things are going. Unlike solicits and shops, \u003cstrong\u003eyou will be involved in the process,\u003c/strong\u003e and see it as it unfolds. We will also post a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly ledger,\u003c/strong\u003e to help you see how our goal, which is simply to break even, progresses. It will also help us find a way to monthly, ideally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we evolve, we seek your input and requests. We want you to love this book like we do.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eHere are our tiers:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1 A MONTH\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor just a buck a month, you\u0027ll not only get our thanks, you\u0027ll also get access to our blog with updates and news, and any sketches we post about the comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$3 A MONTH\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the three dollar pledge, you get The Domain as it comes out bimonthly, three months before anyone else, and all previous rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$5 A MONTH\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt five dollars a month, you will cameo at least once in The Domain, and get all previous rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$10 A MONTH\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt ten dollars a month, you will be a character appearing multiple times that we will arrange with you, and you will receive all previous rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$20 A MONTH\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt twenty dollars a month, you get access to pages as they are finished.
