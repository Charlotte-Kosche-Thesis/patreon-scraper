    "summary": "Hello everyone reading this,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethis\n is a bit of a long one, but please bear with me. I started the \nadventure that is \u003cstrong\u003eNeurofunkGrid \u003c/strong\u003eover 5 years ago as a hobby where I was \nlooking for new tracks on the internet, cutting tracks from mixes and \nposting them online just to be able to share my excitement over the new \nmusic. From there the channel grew and as it got more renowned, artists \nand labels started to reach out to me and get in touch. I couldn\u0027t \nbelieve it - suddenly I found myself able to chat directly with the \npeople who actually created the music that I knew and loved! I felt like\n I was exactly where I needed to be, I was part of a community, one of \nthe best ones out there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\n following years, as the channel grew, I met a shitload of awesome \npeople, both online and in person as this hobby allowed me to start \ntravelling and attend events I couldn\u0027t go to before. I met my biggest \nheroes (cough Noisia cough) and other people who I look up to, who \nhelped shape my taste in Drum \u0026amp; Bass and ultimately let me start the\n channel. As you can probably guess, this channel started taking a \nbigger and bigger part of my life - it\u0027s always been my passion, but it \ngrew into something as time consuming as a full-time job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow\n here\u0027s the problem. I used to work as a System Admin for 5 years and, \nto be honest, I was quite good at it but when my latest contract ended I\n took the gamble to work exclusively on the channel and help build the \ncareers of our \u003cstrong\u003eNFG Talents\u003c/strong\u003e at the same time as I could promote the music\n I love. At first I thought I\u0027d be able to survive on (but not make a \nliving off) the YouTube Ad income, but as naive as that thought was it \nnearly worked at first. Unfortunately nowadays nearly \u003cem\u003eevery \u003c/em\u003etrack\n that we post on the channel gets claimed by the labels who own them, \nwhich means that even though they\u0027re monetised and there\u0027s ads on them, I\n get nothing for the uploads. In order to pay my bills I\u0027ve been doing \nodd jobs on the side - repairing computers for friends and family, \nhelping people out with miscellaneous tasks and at one point, even had \nto be a private detective as a woman wanted me to follow her husband\u0027s \nmistress around to catch them in the act (I\u0027m not even kidding. I did \nthat).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve\n realised that I can\u0027t keep going like this and just as I was about to \ngive up and go back to my old full time job - severely cutting down on \nthe amount of time I can work on the channel - I heard about Patreon and\n thought it could be good to try. I\u0027m already grateful with the support \nyou guys give me, with returning to the channel almost daily for our new\n uploads, sharing and commenting on everything we do... it means the \nworld to me! Without you guys, I couldn\u0027t have done this. It shames me \nto do this, but I need to ask you guys if you\u0027re willing to help me out a\n bit more than you already are and support me via Patreon if you can and\n want to. This way I\u0027ll be able to actually properly focus on this \npassion by spending all my time on it, pushing the channel forward, \npartnering with new labels and artists and pushing our talents and \nartists in the direction of the greats (instead of spending part of my \ntime follow mistresses around for money).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m at a turning point of my life and you guys can help me overcome the obstacle I\u0027m at now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Axel, founder of NeurofunkGrid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS - Sampo is amazing\u003cbr\u003e"
