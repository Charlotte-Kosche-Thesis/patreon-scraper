    "summary": "In 1994, I was a bored 12-year-old on her summer break. My grandparents suggested I find a way to entertain myself. I started writing a story that would influence the rest of my life.\u003cbr\u003eThe first incarnation of North Oak (Mustang Ridge) was born July 24, 1994. It was just 7 pages. Over the next 5 years it would grow into 20 books.\u003cbr\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until the early 2000s that Mustang Ridge became North Oak.\u003cbr\u003eThis is your opportunity to support an original piece of literary horse racing history. All donations will go toward helping this series reach the youth who need to hear Alex\u0027s story, for she was created as a heroine for their time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eMay the horse be with you\u003cbr\u003e~Ann Hunter\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e**MY GOAL FOR 2018**\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027d really like to release paperbacks of the first 3 books in the series (Born to Run, Yearling, and Morning Glory), and take them to Breyerfest in Kentucky in July. The theme for Breyerfest this year is \"Off to the Races\", and it\u0027s our best chance of reaching more readers that could use Alex\u0027s story. Your support on Patreon will go towards this goal.\u003cbr\u003eThe estimated cost of this trip, production of the paperbacks, cost of the booth, etc is $2000.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
