Not enough to sustain a job in the software industry. Which brings us to videos...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe Love making them. We Love sharing them. It\u0027s a long shot, but maybe, just maybe we can figure out how to stay out here for a little while longer.\u00a0If nothing else, these videos are a picture album of our time out here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything we publish on YouTube and our website is free.\u00a0This means we will most definitely be back at a desk job shortly to pay the bills. In the meantime, we\u0027re\ndetermined to have some fun and share it with You!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe appreciate you watching our videos. That is hugely rewarding by itself. But if you love the videos and want to ensure they continue, consider throwing a couple bucks our way. Every dollar helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLove,\u003cbr\u003e\nBen \u0026amp; Ashley\u003cbr\u003e"
