    "summary": "At this moment one of the biggest problems plaguing our society is wealth inequality. At the same time we are also witnessing the simultaneous introduction of\u00a0AI in the areas of transportation, medical diagnosis \u0026amp; prescription, shipping, surveillance, farming, senior care, cashiering and many more. Based on current economic trends these AI services may only further wealth inequality as they will cost the jobs of tens of millions of working class people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow there isn\u0027t much we can do about losing our jobs to robots but in a functional capitalistic economy as robots replace human workers, the cost of essential goods and services should plummet consequently freeing each of us from the toils of sustenance. However\u00a0if a few people have a monopoly over those robots then that will hinder the process of capitalism hence not allow the cost of goods and services to become as cheap as possible. There are two main reasons for the persistence of monopolies:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHigh barriers to entry for new businesses\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor instance in the case of self driving cars, high cost of R\u0026amp;D(100 billion dollars so far) and bureaucratic red tape around being an investor, ensure that only a very few wealthy people and corporations are able to invest in it. Once they invent the self driving car technology, they will own the intellectual property rights to this technology which will allow them to keep out newcomers and \u003cu\u003echarge customers high profit margins to use their exclusive technology\u003c/u\u003e. The self driving car industry is expected to replace tens of millions of jobs and reach an annual revenue of 800 billion dollars within the next fifteen years and 7 trillion dollars a year in the fifteen after that. There is a good chance most of that money will end up in the pockets of the people who are already very rich today.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWinner take all aspect of internet marketplaces\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the case of ride hailing services, Uber and Lyft own about 99.99% of the marketshare. Back in the day, \n\u003cu\u003ethe commissions charged by ride hailing services\u003c/u\u003e may have been distributed among hundreds or thousands of business but today in the age of the internet, this number has reduced to one or two. This trend also results in concentration of wealth.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy personal quest is to help in breaking these monopolies, that is in flipping the two trends stated above, what if we could lower the barrier enough to allow anyone to have a stake in the ownership of self driving car technology and at the same time make all of its IP public? What if we could also allow anyone to have a stake in the ownership of the winning ride hailing marketplace? What if we could translate this model to the other AI services mentioned above? \u003cbr\u003eSince the only inelastic cost in the deliverance of AI services is energy, lowering barriers to entry will increase competition which\u00a0will ensure that costs rapidly converge towards the cost of energy. As we enter the age of solar, the cost of energy may also drastically drop over the coming decades.\u00a0Thus we can make the cost of our essential services produced by AI to become negligible, perhaps we can reignite the American dream and grant it to a lot more people around the world. Perhaps we can prevent most of the created wealth from hemorrhaging in the vaults of a few people, perhaps that may reduce income gap, perhaps that may allow power and money to be shared much more proportionately among the people.\u00a0In the age of the blockchain and AI, all this is indeed possible and I have decided to dedicate my life to accelerate the fulfillment of this goal. I want to help harness the power of Artificial Intelligence to empower and liberate the people by drastically reducing their cost of living. Then we may all be able to live in a world where a lot more of our kids have the opportunity to pursue the life of their dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout me, I went to CalPoly for Computer and Electrical Engineering, before even completing my degree or racking any industry experience I got several job offers. One of them was from Apple, for the role of Core OS engineer I was offered the chance to make close to 200,000$ in the first year but I turned it down to pursue a career in Artificial Intelligence. So instead I joined a billion dollar self driving car company with a team of senior level ex-Tesla autopilot engineers. I quit after 8 months because I realized I was unintentionally helping a few very rich people get even richer at the cost of the livelihood of a lot of working class people. I decided I would much rather contribute to a project that allows everybody to get rich, since that was actually a plausibility with the advent of AI.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, despite living inside my parent\u0027s garage and fending off emails from recruiters, I continue to work on my mission which is to make AI open and education of AI free and accessible to all.\u00a0In the short term, I want to make self driving cars an open sourced technology, which will reduce the barriers of entry for newcomers and therefore increase competition in this space, consequently lowering the cost of self driving car services for all people. I also want to decentralize the ride hailing marketplace which will also increase competition, thus lowering the cost of ride hailing services for all people. The dream is to let people use cars owned by the people, running technology owned by the people through services administrated by the people for the lowest cost possible. Not to forget, the reduction in cost of transportation will also \u00a0lower the cost of housing and food as they both directly depend on transportation costs.\u00a0This is not just some naive, utopian or romantic dream, this is a critical and necessary step in our evolution as we adapt to the widespread infiltration of Artificial Intelligence into our daily life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter 7 months I have burnt through my savings and maxed out my credit, therefore I am currently looking for 2000 patrons to join me on this journey. I am struggling to make ends meet right now, if you are able to give me one dollar a month, it would make a world of a difference to me and my family. Thank you, this is not a sacrifice on my part I love working on robots and I believe it is our collective responsibility to do what is right not only for ourselves but also our future generations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
