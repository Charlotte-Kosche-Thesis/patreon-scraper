I have a particular interest in RPGs, because they are normally heavily focused on building a world and letting you experience it through their characters.\u003cbr\u003eSpecifically, MOTHER 3 and Splatoon have been my biggest inspirations in terms of world building, I am constantly amazed by how they are able to build a believable universe, and how MOTHER 3 manages to convey a wide variety of emotions by interacting with characters and making changes to the environment. It has also inspired me to take a more positive focus on both my art and my daily attitude!\u003cbr\u003eAll in all, I think that videogames are a very powerful tool to spread a message, and a big part on effectively transmitting their message relies on good character and environmental design, as well as using colors to set the mood at different times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my free time, besides drawing, I enjoy playing videogames, going to coffee shops, having delicious food, and cuddling with my cat. I love animals and dream of someday owning a dog, two cats, and a rabbit in a house with a big yard. I also wish to travel around the world and get to know about the people that live in different countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love talking about things that I am passionate about and about people I admire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2605What you\u0027ll get\u2605\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, you\u0027ll get to see some art that never makes it to other places, as well as concepts and lore about my characters! I would LOVE getting input and ideas from my patrons, and I am definitely willing to listen to their suggestions.\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll also see my videogame art and 3D stuff that I will rarely post elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2605Some last words\u2605\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, I would love to be able to fully support myself by doing things that I am very passionate about, while also sharing and giving back to the community that supports me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2666Disclaimers\u2666\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you change from a reward tier that includes custom art/design, you will receive the difference between your previous pledge and your current pledge.
