Our story is futuristic dark fantasy where nothing is as it seems, told from the perspective of three gifted teens. A musician and a hacker, sisters in dystopian Shanghai carve out a life from chaos. A solitary boy in the darkness of Antarctica listens closely to a voice from under the ice. Each will discover how many layers lie beneath the surface of reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is a way for us to fund our creative work, letting us interact with fans and the creative community.\u003c/strong\u003e With your support, we will be better able to focus on the task of making new artwork and writing, while also giving you, the Patrons, immediate access to everything we make. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AdW85K4.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are passionate about our work, and hope that The Ninth Archive, and those who inhabit it, can provide you with some inspiration, some escape from the mundanities of life, or even the motivation to create your own world beyond the one we inhabit. \u003cstrong\u003eWe\u2019re here to tell stories, and we have so many to tell you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Ninth Archive is a tale told through Entries from the collection of a mysterious archive that spans time and space. This Patreon exists because without your help the Archivists cannot continue their work and the story will wither, unfinished. The Lucrephage must be fed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rreAmHy.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like our work, are intrigued by the stories of the Ninth Archive, and the possibilities of exploring its strange universe, you too may become a Patron. Choose how much you want to pledge per month (even a small amount contributes to the greater whole) and select from amongst a bounty of rewards such as work-in-process fragments, handwritten letters from the future, or having your name featured in monthly artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Patronage enables us to write more stories, create more worlds, draw more pictures, invent stranger creatures, and unearth deeper-buried lore. It keeps the lights on and the internet flowing, gives us time to imagine and motivation to continue. With us both being freelance professionals, \u003cstrong\u003eyour pledge removes some of the stresses of earning a living, and frees up more mental space and energy to do what we really love\u003c/strong\u003e: creating The Ninth Archive, and interacting with kindred spirits who enjoy our creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/4BVeNwq.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you will find the Ninth Archive\u2019s fusion of illustration and microfiction in an interconnected web to be innovative and thought-provoking.\u003cstrong\u003e It\u2019s possible you have never experienced a story told in this way\u003c/strong\u003e. The more you read of it, the more elaborate the web becomes, and more involved with the characters and universe you become. While our releases may be non-linear in nature, devoted Patrons will discover connections between them, which are all a part of the Grand Design of the Archivists. You might think this sounds confusing, but it\u2019s actually a lot of fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron you will also see, first hand, the artistic process that goes into creating such a work. Perhaps you will find this illuminating, or perhaps it will only deepen the mystery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only way to experience the story\u2019s strange and meandering progress is to become a patron. Pledging at higher tiers will enable access to astonishing rewards and expedite the unlocking of Goals: secrets too cryptic for the uninitiated.\u003cstrong\u003e It is only through your kindness and generosity that this enigmatic and beautiful world can exist.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePreview some of our tales below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/ehao-s001-7772283\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/ehao-s001-7772283\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/ehao-k001-7772292\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/ehao-k001-7772292\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/ehao-r001-7772305\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/ehao-r001-7772305\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/D3eBkHM.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWho are the Archivists?\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe are\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://niceghost.org\"\u003eMarcelo Gallegos\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://chigby.org/\"\u003eCameron Higby-Naquin\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow often do you release?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArchive entries are released three times per month.
