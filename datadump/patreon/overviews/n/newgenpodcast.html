We\u0027ve covered WWF, WCW and ECW PPV\u0027s, as well as DVDs, movies, Raw, Nitro, Thunder In Paradise and episodes of Total Divas, providing 3 unique perspectives of whatever was happening on - and off - screen at this crucial time in US wrestling history.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you want my money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, this has all come at a cost - hosting fees, newsletter subscriptions and audio equipment. Recently, we have had inquiries from various members of the audience about how they could give a little back to us for producing the show and outside of picking up the T-Shirt or Total Divas bonus episodes, there\u0027s been no concrete way for fans to do this. As an acknowledgement that there are those of you out there that wish to do this, combined with supporting the costs of producing the show, we have launched this Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ringthedamnbell.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/mantas.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, you want your listeners to pay to hear the show all of a sudden?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIMPORTANTLY\u003c/strong\u003e this is not a \u0027request\u0027 to pay for the Podcast itself - the show will still come out as scheduled and none of the regular content will be withheld from those who either can\u0027t, or don\u0027t wish to, contribute. Most crucially, however, if Paul starts \u0027getting paid\u0027 for the show, then Mrs Scrivens might finally be convinced that this podcast malarkey is actually worth doing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.diva-dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/bull-nakano.png?w=620\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get for giving you my money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a few different levels of rewards for the different pledges, but at ALL levels you will receive our watch-along audio of TNA\u0027s masterpiece \"The Final Deletion\". Will we finally be able to answer the age-old question; What was wrestling thinking?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny questions, don\u0027t hesitate to get in touch.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
