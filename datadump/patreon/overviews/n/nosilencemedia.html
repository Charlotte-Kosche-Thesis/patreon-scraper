Our plan is to post just our shorts, sketches, and shows to Patreon. In other words, just content that is a standalone creation. Tutorials and BTS are related to other videos--We won\u0027t be charging Patrons for that. In total, we\u0027ll probably be posting 1 to 4 videos per month that Patrons are charged for. Don\u0027t forget, however, that you can set a monthly limit if you\u0027re worried about spending too much!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u00a0Why do you guys need my money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWell, we don\u0027t NEED it. It\u0027s not for us, really. It\u0027s, in a weird way, going back to all of you. Our goal here isn\u0027t to fill our pockets with your cash. It\u0027s to make every video we do bigger and better with the money you put towards it. Every dollar you contribute, in some capacity, goes towards paying for better props, locations, actors, music, visual effects, and stories. Money doesn\u0027t make the movie, but it can absolutely make a difference.
