We\u0027re experts at independent - people powered - liberty driven news. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur reporting has been featured as the primary news in 3 major television markets and we\u0027ve been cited by countless outlets across the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe goal, \"empower our viewers with actionable information, enabling each to pursue their own life, powered by liberty and happiness, just as our founders intended.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe have the record, the tools and the talent to accomplish this.

We estimate that we can create compelling original news content generated by a small staff for about 10k per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAt one time we could rely on our partnership with YouTube to generate supplemental revenue.\u003c/strong\u003e However \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/youtube-has-become-increasingly-hostile\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eyoutube has become increasingly hostile\u003c/a\u003e to news and information related to geopolitical conflicts and controversial politics.
