    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! I\u0027m Neal, a Canadian erotica writer. I\u0027ve been writing dirty fanfic and dirtier original stories on the internet under the penname \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRedsliver\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e for almost 12 years now. I love it and I think I\u0027ve become better than pretty good at it. Good enough that I feel I could sell my work and be proud of it. Being my worse critic, that has been some threshold to reach. I love what I do and I\u0027d love to do it more and to do that I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do you write?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like adventure stories, science fiction and fantasy, superhero epics and fairy tales. I love villains and stories where the good guys don\u0027t always win. I love using any of those genres to tell dirty and sexy stories. I especially like stories that are about losing or taking control. I love the mind control kink. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExploring how power changes someone for the better and for the worse is always a great starting point and when that power leads to sexual control and domination all the better. The other side of the coin is writing about the person who has fallen under control, how they struggle against their bonds or how their forced to become the cookie cutter ideal their controller wants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of porn makes it into your stories? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI focus on heterosexual sex but eagerly include lesbian sex, especially as I love scenarios with multiple partners. I like group sex, orgies, harems, and gangbangs. I haven\u0027t written slash, it\u0027s never excited me, but I\u0027d be open to it for a short story or two if the votes swung that way or for a scene in a longer story that was served better for it. I like shifting balances of powers. I like moving tops to bottoms and bottoms to tops especially with the resistance that sometimes implies. I like breaking taboos and balances of power. I like coercion, mind control, black mail and humiliation. I like adventure and mystery and that added layer of danger or distrust that can turn a mundane sex scene into a powerful one. I love women of all shapes, all colours, all sanities and all means. I like comedy and imperfections and I love a sex scene that shies away from neither. I like fear and love and anger and despair and duty and honor and deceit and pride and how each and every one of those emotions can transform a sex scene or relationship. There\u0027s so much I love. There\u0027s only a few things I\u0027m not interested in writing: sexual violence, cannibalism, bestiality or scat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTell me about what you\u0027re working on.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on several stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLost Toys is what I had when I started my Patreon. Lost Toys is the story of Matthew an unassuming layabout who out of an act of kindness accidentally becomes a near all powerful mind controller. He doesn\u0027t take to the power well collecting dozens of women and not knowing when to quit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I\u0027ve started on several other series. Monkey Wrench is about Dean, who finds himself abducted by aliens and confined in a small box with nine other girls from his high school. They have to explore and discover the world that has been force onto them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMagic is Gross is a Buffyish, there are monsters in my high school story, that follows three kids: Curtis, Kristi and David. Kristi is the new girl and a witch, when her magic powers accidentally turn Curtis into a beautiful woman, David is needed to save the day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlue Ribbon follows Leo. Leo arrives at school one day to discover the cheerleading squad handing out ribbons. By luck, he\u0027s given control and domain over almost all of the people in school. He and six other lucky students slowly discover how much power that is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, Patreon members get access to Jack and Jill, a series of related Fairy Tale dark parodies, Maiden Stars, a series about a superpowered team of transforming goddesses (Power Rangers/Sailor Moon with a big helping of sex), and, coming soon, Great Justice, the story of two young superheroes trying to become Challengers (my world\u0027s Justice League).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs that all you write, porn?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty much yes, but technically no. I\u0027ve written the first draft of a comedic fantasy adventure story called \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSlimes Against Humanity\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. It needs a lot of work. I doubt it will find it\u0027s way out through Patreon but if there\u0027s enough interest, I\u0027d happily finish it and maybe even write it\u0027s sequels: Girls Can\u0027t Be Wizards and Black Unicorns Are a Myth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou mentioned fanfiction, tell me about that.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did. When I began writing I started with writing cheesy one shots in the Naruto fandom because I was reading the stories and there were some characters I felt not getting enough love. It was fun but I grew frustrated after a time. From there, I moved almost exclusively into original stories for nearly a decade. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I was still always a fanboy. I love animation. I love cartoons and anime. Warning, talk to me about One Piece only if you have the entire day to waste. What brought me back to fanfiction was that I had a favorite American cartoon: The Spectacular Spider-Man. It is genius, the best incarnation of Spider-Man I\u0027ve ever seen. But it was cancelled after two seasons and ended on a brutal cliffhanger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a year or so it itched under my skin. And then I sat down and started writing the next season for it. Please, go read it\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/series/41349\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e I have a massive plan taking the series right to it\u0027s season 5 end (which means 28 more chapters to write.) If I can get enough fans on Patreon, I could hopefully post two new chapters every three months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll of this sounds great, but what\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy patrons get access to all stories nearly two weeks before they\u0027re posted elsewhere. I post on Mondays to Patreon and the second following Friday to StoriesOnline and other websites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have plans to package short stories and sell them with cover art as eBooks on sites like Amazon and Smashwords. I still haven\u0027t found a proper artist or stock photos to make the covers yet, all Patrons will get access to copies before I post them live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything else I need to know?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, for supporting and for sharing about me and my stories! I\u0027d love to have your help and I am determined to provide you with the best stories and erotica I can possibly write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeal"
