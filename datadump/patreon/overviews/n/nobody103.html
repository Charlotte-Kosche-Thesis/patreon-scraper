    "summary": "I am an amateur writer, currently writing a fantasy story \u0027Mother of Learning\u0027, available on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.fictionpress.com/~nobody103\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efictionpress account\u003c/a\u003e. Here is a brief synopsis:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eZorian is a teenage mage of humble birth and slightly\nabove-average skill, attending his third year of education at Cyoria\u0027s magical\nacademy. He is a driven and irritable young man, consumed by a desire to ensure\nhis own future and free himself of the influence of his family, whom he resents\nfor favoring his brothers over him. Consequently, he has no time for pointless\ndistractions or paying attention to other people\u0027s problems. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs it happens, time is something he is about to get plenty\nof. On the eve of the Cyoria\u0027s annual summer festival, he is killed and brought\nback to the beginning of the month, just before he was about to take a train to\nCyoria. Suddenly trapped in a time loop with no clear end or exit, Zorian will\nhave to look both within and without to unravel the mystery before him. And he\ndoes have to unravel it, for the time loop hadn\u0027t been made for his sake and\ndangers lurk everywhere... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRepetition is the mother of learning, but Zorian will have\nto first make sure he survives to try again - in a world of magic, even a time\ntraveler isn\u0027t safe from those who wish him ill. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, a fair number of people have asked me about rewarding me for my work, so I am opening this Patreon account to facilitate that. The site, for those who don\u0027t know, allows patrons to set up an automatic payment that will donate a specified amount to the artist\u0027s account every time they post new content. In my case, that means every time I post a new chapter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMother of Learning is still free, and will remain so. I am writing as a hobby, and intend to continue writing the story regardless of its financial success (or lack thereof). However, donating money will motivate me to spend more of my energies on it than I am currently and leave me with a warm, fuzzy feeling at the encouragement I\u0027m getting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in worldbuilding related to my story, you can visit my \u003ca href=\"https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewordpress page\u003c/a\u003e for more MoL related content. There, you can also find link to various \u003ca href=\"https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/05/01/mol-links-fanart-translation-etc/\"\u003efanart and translations\u003c/a\u003e I have received over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those wondering about my update schedule: I currently update a new chapter every three weeks. Target date for the release of every new chapter can be found on the top of my \u003ca href=\"https://www.fictionpress.com/~nobody103\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efictionpress profile\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you all in advance for your patience and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(For those of you who have asked me about an alternate method of donation, you can do so by making a payment to my PayPal account, using the following e-mail address: autonemesis at gmail dot com. The address has been slightly modified to reduce spammer traffic, so you\u0027ll have to convert it to proper form before using it. You can also use this address to send me a regular e-mail, if you need to speak to me privately for some reason.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
