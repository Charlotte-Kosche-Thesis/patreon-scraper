I\u0027m thrilled to make free promotional content for indie or unrecognized authors, but it\u0027s hard finding the time when I already work two jobs and help edit books. My goal is to eventually make enough so I won\u0027t need to work other jobs and can dedicate even more time to audio readings. By supporting me, you offer me better opportunities to expand my platform and deliver more frequent content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor those who don\u0027t know, I offer a free book promotional service for any published authors by audio reading the first chapter of their book and uploading it onto Youtube along with links to purchase their book. It\u0027s hard getting recognized as an author these days without help, and I\u0027m honored to be that help.\u00a0"
