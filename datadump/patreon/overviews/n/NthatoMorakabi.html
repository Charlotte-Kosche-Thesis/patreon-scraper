Instead I will implore you to support the hard-working, talented artists that are scattered across Patreon who genuinely need your support; I learn from them as much as I do from myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for me, I am a published author appearing in three separate anthologies, two of which can be bought on Amazon.com and the third available for free on my website. I write for an online gaming magazine (Gamecca Mag) which is an advocate for free information, as in, the magazine is free to read.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a writer, it is my duty to create content that is enjoyable to you. As the reader, it is your prerogative to expect writing that is worth your time and effort. When the two converge, you have a writer determined to write a tale worthy to be read, and the reader a story they are looking forward to. Sure you can\u0027t expect the author to always enjoy what they write, especially if it is outside of their realm of comfort, but that is what makes the writing real; what makes writing work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you pledge to that?"
