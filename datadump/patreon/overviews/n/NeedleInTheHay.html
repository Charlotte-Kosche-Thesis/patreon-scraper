It was simple really, no long turnaround times, two way communication with the writers and a focus on creativity, collaboration and feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver 400 authors have passed through our doors, bringing their own unique voices to storytelling; we boast writers from every continent (except Antarctica, damn you Antarctica!!!). Now we\u0027re ready to take the next step, and we need your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Does It Work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriters enter contests based on prompts. Every\u00a0week stories are shortlisted and available for everyone to read. A group of volunteer judges determine the winner, and everyone gets feedback on their work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-----------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s where the new stuff starts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-----------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month Needle In The Hay is going to run one award that has a monetary prize, with a difference. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery author that makes it onto the shortlist for that award will share in a prize pool generated from the total Patreon pledges (minus Patreon\u0027s fees). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe winner will still get a 5000 word feedback prize, and we\u0027re still providing feedback to all authors for their shortlisted stories as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think this is a good initiative. Anything you can pledge would be great. It\u0027s important that we keep NiTH focused on the authors so if you find a hole in what we\u0027re doing, please let us know. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting Contests can be tricky \u003cem\u003eespecially once money is involved.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do we want to introduce prize money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople work hard on their stories. Feedback is great, but it would also be tops if we could reward people for their time, be able to maybe treat themselves to a book or lunch as a way of saying thanks for participating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is it going to the whole shortlist and not just the winner?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe already know folks love to compete on NiTH. The feedback prize is a pretty good one. We think that by giving it to everyone on the shortlist were rewarding good work and acknowledging the whimsical nature of winning awards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often is this happening?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re going to start with one a month.
