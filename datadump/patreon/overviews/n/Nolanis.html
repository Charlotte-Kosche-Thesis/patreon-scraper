I\u0027m also a gamer and\t a roleplayer, a critic and a creator, a nerd (or geek, however you define those), trying to live my life to the fullest between my day job and the passion for music. At the beginning,\nit was nothing but a hobby. Today, it\u0027s a \u003cem\u003elittle \u003c/em\u003ebit more than that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lm5kiaONUDY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eInterested in hearing more? Patrons get access to music videos a week before they\u0027re published anywhere else, exlusive previews, insights and commentary on my work and all sorts of other cool stuff - graphics, downloads, sneak peeks, photos, updates, live events... so if you like what I do, consider supporting my work, there\u0027s more where it came from!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo... how does this whole Patreon thing work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eOnce you\u0027ve registered with Patreon, you can pledge any amount of money for each new song I release. You can choose as little a $1 or as much as you want (but don\u0027t feel pressured to give me money if it\u0027s going to put any strain on you!)\u003cbr\u003eThen, every month, Patreon will check how many big, \u003cem\u003epaid\u003c/em\u003e updates I made. \u003cstrong\u003eThis will only include final releases \u003c/strong\u003ewith cover art and everything, you know, the real deal - and that rarely happens more often than once a month. In the meantime, you have access to most updates, previews, snippets, demos and other materials published here for all patrons. You can adjust or cancel your pledge at any time, and set a monthly cap so that you aren\u0027t overcharged if it\u0027s a particularly bountiful month. And if nothing happens and there isn\u0027t an update during the month, then staying updated won\u0027t cost you a thing!\u003cbr\u003eTake a look around, read up and see what other creators are here, before you decide. There\u0027s no rush, I\u0027ll continue making the music and releasing it to Youtube for free - albeit a little bit later than here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy pledging $1 or more\u003c/strong\u003e per music video you\u0027ll get updates about the progress I make on the upcoming songs. And if there are any other events to which I\u0027ll attend or partake in, I\u0027ll notify you about that, too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy pledging $3 or more\u003c/strong\u003e, you\u0027ll get to read about the creative process any my thoughts on past and future songs. You\u0027ll get to listen and watch music videos a week before they\u0027re published on Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBigger pledges\u003c/strong\u003e won\u0027t get you anything extra just now, but I\u0027m planning on preparing something more for the most dedicated patrons. Stay tuned, I\u0027ll let you know as soon as that happens!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOh, and if you\u0027re already a patron...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eLet me just say you\u0027re awesome and I\u0027m really glad that you like my work.
