Before the session, Nathalie had chosen crystals to use specifically for me and made me extremely comfortable on the table.  I don\u2019t remember much after she began, I was so relaxed.  At the end of the session, she told me about some of the spiritual insights that she received on my behalf and it helped me to make sense of some of the things in my life that I had experienced.  When I left the session, I had more energy and it felt like I had more power behind my physical movements.  It was like my power was returned to me!  I also felt more clear in my body and mind, and more efficient as I was going through my day.  I felt less resistance, I felt open and capable of dealing with everything\u2026I couldn\u2019t believe the difference!  I highly recommend anyone to have a session with Nathalie, she is a unique and has the ability to channel very powerful healing. \u003cbr\u003e-Noell Eanes, M.Ac.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLIFE ON EARTH PODCAST\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\" Love this Podcast, the energy is just so positive and so insightful. Always take away something new or something old I needed a reminder about. Nathalie and I seem to be in very similar spaces in our lives (metaphysically speaking) and similar ideological upbringing, so I really connected to this podcast easily and now we are questioning and searching for our own truth and I definitely feel like she is helping me find my own answers with just insight from her own journey. Nathalie is full of light and fun ! And her accent is so easy on my ears!\"\u003cbr\u003e- Lsj007 ( iTunes)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\" I love listening to Nathalie\u0027s podcast.

At the moment I was in Panama (where I am from) and I immediately called Nathalie to book a spot and the training happened to be full. Luckily for me we had an immediate connection (over the phone!!) and she promised that if someone cancelled she would call me right away and because the Universe works in wonderful ways that is exactly what happened next. \u003cbr\u003eThe day she called to let me know someone had cancelled was probably the happiest day of 2014!!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAfter that things just got better.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn a short period of 5 months my life changed. I had turned around the way I practiced, I had learned more than in the past 3 years of college, I was able to begin teaching in the beautiful space, and I became part of an amazing family , the Shanti Yoga Love Warriors. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNathalie and the whole Shanti Yoga Family are definitely a blessing and they were put in my way to help me grow and blossom.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Shala became my second home while I was in New Orleans and I miss it every single day.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI recommend coming to practice here and I definitely recommend taking the Teacher Training if you wish to deepen your practice and/or teach.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAs I said before, my experience at Shanti changed my life and I am infinitely grateful \u0026lt;3 \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNamaste \"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e- Aurora Brenes\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\" Shanti Yoga Shala was the first place that exposed me so deeply to the true practice of yoga. I carry that space in my heart every day and will always be grateful for the transformation that took place there and the loving energy of my teacher Nathalie. Nathalie led us through such a spiritual experience every day we met for training, we cried, laughed, learned and created a strong community. Shanti\u0027s RYT200 training inspired me to keep studying and teaching Yoga as my full time job, and Nathalie guided me towards my next steps after my graduation to keep pursuing my dreams and passions. I know I will always have a home in Shanti Yoga Shala and forever thankful for the doors Nathalie and the studio opened up for me! \"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- Beatriz Bonnin\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I have experienced so much growth and healing since beginning my yoga teacher training with Nathalie at Shanti Yoga Shala. I believe that yoga is about connecting to the body, mind, and spirit. I have learned so much about not only the asanas, or physical postures, but also about how to find peace and love within myself and others. I am learning that I can spread peace and love into the world through not only teaching yoga but also through living out the principles of yoga, such as performing acts of kindness. Each weekend I feel so refreshed, with renewed vibrancy. I highly recommend the yoga teacher training at Shanti Yoga Shala for anyone who would like to deepen their own yoga practice as well as contribute to world healing.\"\u003cbr\u003e- Katie Najder\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYOGA CLASSES AND MEDITATION\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u201d I have never actually been to this physical studio, but I took Nathalie\u2019s Vinyasa out door class at the Rasalila Festival in Tampa FL, last fall, and I absolutely loved the experience. It was a beautiful sunny day, the live music by Wynne Paris was soothing and inspiring. There must have been 50 people, and she lead us all gracefully, through an intense series, and she even walked through the crowd to help me into a handstand, which i really appreciated.\u201d \u2013 Erika H.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201d After moving back to New Orleans from San Francisco, it was very challenging for me to find a yoga studio or instructor that could compare to those that I had become accustomed to in CA. So I was thrilled to discover Nathalie and have been doing yoga with her ever since (it\u2019s been about 2 years) I encourage everyone to take a class with her. You will be hooked just like I was! No matter where you are in your practice; beginner, advanced and anywhere in between, you will find that her classes allow you to explore and test your own limits in a safe and beneficial way. Best Energy in town! Om Shanti.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u2013 Katherine England\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201d Nathalie Croix of Shanti Yoga Shala has a beautiful soul that radiates to everyone she meets. If you want to enjoy a wonderful yoga class complete with good music, beautiful shakti, and a teacher that will guide you into the \u201cedge\u201d of your pose this is the place. Nathalie really loves and knows yoga and it shows in her teaching.I love yoga and Nathalie has helped this love grow as well as help me move into poses I never thought I would be able to do.\u201d \u2013 Lula Fortis\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
