    "summary": "Howdy! I\u2019m Nathan Crowder but you can call me Nate. I\u2019m a writer, creator, and former small press publisher dipping his toes back into Artisanal Fiction. Yep. That\u2019s right. Free-range, corn-fed, organic stories that I then slaughter, part-out, wrap in plastic for delivery\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWait. Let\u2019s start that again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, I\u0027d like to thank patron, future patrons, and fans of Cobalt City. It means the world to me that you\u0027re here reading this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver a decade ago, I created a world of superheroes centered on the New England metropolis of Cobalt City. Originally used for a background for a RPG with friends and family, Cobalt City inspired a short story. Then a novel. Then a few novels. Then anthologies where the city was opened up to other authors whom I adore and admire. At the time no one was really publishing superhero novels (except for licensed properties). It\u2019s gratifying to see that changing. What was once my sole, crazy pursuit is now its own sub-genre. For my part, it\u2019s been a long, strange trip to carve out this little niche that includes six published novels, three anthologies and a handful of externally published short fiction. And that doesn\u2019t include the Cobalt City work done by other fine authors who continue to work in this shared universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s the thing: Cobalt City is a big, vibrant place with a ton of compelling, diverse, and unique characters. There are countless stories to tell. COUNTLESS. And I\u2019m just a dude with a full-time dayjobbery who writes other stuff that isn\u2019t superheroes. Horror and urban fantasy and high fantasy kind of things. Things for which there is a ready, established market.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo one is clamoring for stories about superheroes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr are they?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt only costs a buck to find out if you need some heroes in your life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s my pledge to you: I have a handful of brand-new Cobalt City stories waiting an edit pass, and dozens more plotted out, and I\u2019ll make them available here via the magic of Patreon. Higher pledge levels will get inside access: songlist of the story soundtrack, development notes, influences, a monthly video QA, maps, floor plans of Cobalt City locations, design ephemera, and even limited-edition signed chapbooks of each story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStories will explore the past, present, and maybe even the future of Cobalt City and surrounding world. They will feature, among other heroes: the cycle-riding anti-hero from the 70\u0027s, the Devil\u0027s Daughter; Cobalt mainstays Huntsman and Libertine as they go under the radar after his secret identity is exposed; police detective Roberta Pak tries to unravel a government conspiracy as the vigilante Bantam;\u00a0Thor avatar Midnight Thunder confronts a wave of forgotten, small gods plaguing the city in the disco era; and a new age of heroes including Wrecker of Engines, GhostHouse, and Kraken band together to push back a rise of fascism and white-nationalism following a contentious presidential election.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u2019t have any illusions that this is going let me quit the dayjobbery and write fiction full time. But any support is welcome. Think of it as a tip jar. Think of it as a coffee-fund. Think of it as a show of love and support for artists creating the heroes they want to see. Think of it as your very inexpensive bus pass to Cobalt City."
