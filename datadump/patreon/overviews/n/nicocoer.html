    "summary": "Savannah \"Nico\" Breakstone writes, does Disability rights, and organizes. They also sometimes do gaming live streams, art, and other stuff. Savannah regularly asks for input on projects on social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSavannah maintains a Disability Twitterchat Calendar to help the disability community schedule, find, and participate in twitterchats. It\u0027s their hope that the project will help bring the community closer together, as well as build solidarity between the larger disability community and marginalized PwD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSavannah is dedicated to signal boosting the work of other disabled people, especially those with additional marginalizations on social media. This is one of the reasons they don\u0027t offer signal boosting as a reward- marginalized people rarely have money, so we all must work to boost their work if and when we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Nico Streams, they stream retro horror video games and sometimes some other things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSavannah regularly goes to policy meetings and advisory meetings in the state of Pennsylvania as a disabled person, specifically as an Autistic disabled person. Most of these are unpaid meetings, though expenses are often reimbursed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLocally Savannah is involved in Oil Region Rising (local indivisible chapter), the county Democratic party\u0027s activities, and other community activities designed to educate and promote social change in Venango County, Pennsylvania and across the rest of Appalachian Pennsylvania.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently Savannah has gotten more involved in direct action. In order to do more of this having financial support to travel places when other trips don\u0027t coincide well would be helpful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe financial support this Patreon provides will allow Savannah to do all of the above things, as well as pursue future projects- and cover things like internet and food of course.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBackground about Savannah:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSavannah began formally advocating at the age of 12, when their mother asked them to sit on a panel for a state level conference presentation. Advocacy became a true passion for Savannah once they became an adult. Co-morbidly diagnosed GAD, PTSD, and Autistic, they worked in Mental Health advocacy before they connected with the ASD and DD communities. In adulthood, they was diagnosed with several life long as well as adult onset chronic health disabilities, some of which have a mild-to-moderate impact on mobility depending on the day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther advocacy as well as community involvements have included national and state level organizations and advisories, various county level advisories, and Freelance Advocacy efforts.  Savannah is a board member and current vice president of the PA based \u003ca href=\"http://sau1.org/\"\u003eSAU1\u003c/a\u003e (Self Advocates United as 1), and writes at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://crackedmirrorinshalott.wordpress.com/\"\u003eCracked Mirror in Shalott\u003c/a\u003e, at a couple of off topic blogs, and as a contributing writer at several multi contributor blogs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside of advocacy, Savannah\u2019s perseverations include Anthropology, Cats, Social Histories, Star Trek, and the Histories of Oppressed populations. They lives in the mountains of rural northwestern PA with their cat, Catterina.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSavannah does freelance captioning, writing, and consulting.
