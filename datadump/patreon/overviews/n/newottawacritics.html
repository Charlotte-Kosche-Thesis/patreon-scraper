    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eFounded\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ein 2011\u003c/strong\u003e by a small\ngroup comprised of students and alumni from the University of Ottawa\u2019s Theatre\nDepartment, the New Ottawa Critics(NOC) came together as a collective of\nindividuals who all shared a passion for writing theatre criticism. The organization\ntakes pride in our contributors\u2019 cultivated practical experience as a\nsupplement to their theoretical backgrounds and many of our members have worked\nor continue to work in the Ottawa theatre community. We believe in investing in\nthe future of theatre criticism in Canada and thus we strive to engage and\ntrain new minds through different workshops and non-traditional forms of\ntheatre journalism (i.e. video blogging or doodling). The NOC seeks to promote\nprofessional level theatre journalism on a digital platform from the\nperspectives of formally trained theatre critics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe field \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eof theatre criticism\u003c/strong\u003e and print media at large is undergoing a significant shift whereby the opportunities to become a paid professional theatre critic are slim to none (very recently the Ottawa \u003cem\u003eCitizen\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0let go their sole freelance theatre critic Patrick Langston). As such, young emerging theatre writers are driven to seek out alternative ways to monetize their work or, at the very least, compensate their time working. Given where critics lay on the theatrical spectrum, it feels ethically ambiguous to ask theatre artists or producers directly for money in exchange for a review (or the time spend writing the review); or to take the newspaper route and offer up our work only by paid subscription.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is why Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0feels like such a great fit for our organization. Our work is still published for free and for everyone to read on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.newottawacritics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enewottawacritics.com\u003c/a\u003e;\u00a0but if you like our work and believe that criticism vis a vis its theatre critics are an integral and essential part of theatre creation, then you can support us here with a small monthly subscription. By becoming a patron of the New Ottawa Critics (for as low as $1/month!) you will receive exclusive insider rewards that transcend the traditional theatre review.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport local theatre by backing its critics!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
