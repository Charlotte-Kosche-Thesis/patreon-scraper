    "summary": "We are a podcast based out of East Los Angeles that was formed by four friends \n(Nestor, Art, Juan and Adrian). The podcast\u0027s covers a variety of topics as we discuss it all and \nhave on interesting guests. We have been podcasting for four years and with every milestone we meet there is a new goal we want to accomplish. We are always striving for more and want to reach more people to create a bigger bond with people from all over the globe. We have been creating content on Youtube for 8 months and have been persistently growing the channel with a new variety of content. The channel hosts our podcasts, short films, film reviews, let\u0027s play videos, Vlogs, reaction videos, challenge videos, various commentaries, live streams, and un-boxing videos. We are trying to create interesting content all while still trying to figure out who and what we are as individuals and a unit. Patreon will hopefully provide us with a platform to reach people that we hope can support us in continuing to grow both the podcast and Youtube channel into its own self-sustaining creative outlet. We appreciate everyone who is willing to lend a helping hand and support our dream of making content that will be enjoyed by more and more people everyday.\u003cbr\u003e"
