    "summary": "Hey there! I\u2019m Lucas. I make video essays, and I\u0027ll make short films with your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew Century Narratives is about humans at the frontiers of technology. I cover topics that the other fantastic science education channels on YouTube leave untouched. I cover the breakneck speed of technology, and how it affects our culture and society in a way that is outside of your standard Frankenstein\u2019s cautionary tale. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany science educators and sci-fi channels try to avoid social and political topics that are controversial. But human experience exists in the margins - the age we live in is heavily affected by the political and cultural landscape. So, unlike my technoprogressive counterparts that avoid the hot button issues, I jump right in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow did I get here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrontiers fascinate me. I\u2019ve been a tech lover for as long as I can remember. After a chaotic college experience in Biomedical Engineering, and some years working with biohackers, I hung up the towel, so to speak. I lived on the road, did Parkour, and eventually settled in Colorado. Since then I\u2019ve been making action reels and shooting livestream videos for Parkour facilities such as Apex Movement in Boulder, Colorado and Sport Parkour League in Vancouver, Canada. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until the rise of right-wing YouTubers that I regained my interest in politics and futurism. Why futurism?\u00a0Many on both sides of the political spectrum fail to take just how much technology has changed us into account. If one expects that they will see cyborgs in their lifetime, then the idea of humans switching sexes seems quite trivial.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I create\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create video essays that combat regressive narratives, film interviews with interesting figures in technology and philosophy, and create mini-documentaries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere does the money go? How Often?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of my videos require that I read articles, papers, or even whole books before I say anything about them. Thus, at the current pace of reading, writing, filming, and editing \"I can release one video per six weeks.  Outside of my well-researched videos, I will release simpler \u201cthis is what I think about ___\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t really count. For that reason I decided that the Patreon contribution structure will be on a per video essay or mini-documentary basis. As the contribution goals are met I\u2019ll be able to get on a one video per month schedule, with my goal being one video every two weeks.  I encourage you to use the monthly limit option to ensure that you are paying for each piece of quality content I release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first priority is to buy a new computer to edit on, as my current laptop sounds like a dying T-800. Afterwards I\u2019ll look to buying a camera, audio, and lighting setup so that I don\u2019t have to rent everything for on-location shoots. Right now I use an ancient Canon t2i, which works, for now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any other questions please feel free to reach out to me!"
