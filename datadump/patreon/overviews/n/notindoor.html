    "summary": "NOTINDOOR Photography magazine has published 16 issues since December of 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNOTINDOOR is a photography magazine. A perfect fit for anyone wanting to get more from their Digital SLR, Phone cameras and film cameras. A good read for advance, amateur and professional photographers. While learning about your camera, how to use it and different photography techniques you get to enjoy stories about successful and starting photographers, learn to improve from photo critiques, get updated on the latest news, experience breathtaking photographs, learn how to sell your own photographs and more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecome part of our growing and supporting community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNOTINDOOR will keep you inspired, creative and informed.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s a must have magazine for anyone who is about photography in any kind of way: photographers, buyers, writers and hobbyists. \u00a0It is where every landscape and fine art photographer and photography enthusiast want to showcase their work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the moment we have a hard working team that believes in NOTINDOOR and donates the time and creativity in hopes that the magazine can finally be a big success story. They keep working on bringing you one of the best photography magazines out there, so let\u0027s make it count!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTwo of the biggest pain points photographers face are: most of the time they don\u0027t get paid for capturing the most beautiful moments of our lives and it\u0027s getting harder for them to get the exposure they need. This is why NOTINDOOR is committed to help photographers present their work and reward them for that. We have created a community that can help photographers follow their dreams and eliminate the \"I can\u0027t afford it\" excuse many of us (including me) keep using.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eNOTINDOOR Photography Magazine is maybe the only monthly issued photo magazine that is free, which means it is one of your best opportunities to improve your photography skills, be inspired by photos you never imagined could be real, earn money for your photography and be in the known within the landscape and fine art photography industry.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(35, 45, 50);\"\u003eIf you like photography, even as a hobby, you simply owe it to yourself.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
