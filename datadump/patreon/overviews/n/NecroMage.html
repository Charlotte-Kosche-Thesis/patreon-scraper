I figure that if you\u0027re paying me to keep making videos, that makes you the boss. As a producer, you can actually influence the type of content that appears on NecroMageTV, something mere YouTube commenters can\u0027t do, the freeloading scum. You\u0027re not scum. You\u0027ve got a creative vision for the future of this channel. You\u0027ve got things you want to see, things you want the world to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me be the instrument of your creative genius. Become a NecroMageTV Producer today."
