I am collaborating with some amazing people, and there is a lot of great stuff in the works. So if you feel like going beyond just buying the song, \u003cstrong\u003eyou can help support the work I do\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0by giving as much or as little as you like, whenever you like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are all kinds of up-front costs involved with the video and audio production, as well as the legal costs involved with cover songs. So even if you ignore the cameras, keyboards, computer software, and audio equipment that I already own, the work I produce can still take some serious dough. By supporting me through Patreon, \u003cstrong\u003eyou are helping me produce more videos, with better production, more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease give only if you are able.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t want anyone to feel obligated or give outside your means. \u003cstrong\u003eYour donation is an investment.\u003c/strong\u003e As my Patreon earnings grow, I will be able to transition into creating videos full time, and perhaps eventually take the show to a city near you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, \u003cstrong\u003ethank you!\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m still new to all this, and I can\u0027t believe how much people enjoy what I do. There is no greater feeling than doing what you love, with the support of people who like my work. The generosity of music lovers astounds me, and I hope that never changes.\u003cbr\u003e"
