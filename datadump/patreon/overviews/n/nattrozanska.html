I also don\u0027t find hunger all that inspiring, I find it unpleasant, and uncomfortable, and an unwanted throwback to my serious eating disorder days that doesn\u0027t encourage me to sit down and make beautiful things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf people like my arts, the ones I make just for the sake of creating and have little marketable purpose, it would be awesome if you could pledge a tiny amount per thing, to encourage me to create more of them. I find being able to pay my bills really encouraging. I wish I didn\u0027t, I wish I could just create art for eternity with no fuss about how \u0027useful\u0027 or \u0027marketable\u0027 these arts are, but unfortunately Capitalism exists, and it\u0027s everywhere, and so I have to jump through all these financial hoops just to keep existing in the manner that feels most natural.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create an ever changing variety of things, some of which I sell on etsy. I dabble in painting, I upcycle old hardbacks, I screen print my own fabric designs and turn them into clothing things, I sometimes even play with words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://41.media.tumblr.com/c240f01261a4ac4745bb615032e2478b/tumblr_mtlaxjr6Su1rrctr8o2_500.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13087524_1562953730664013_6219210943197512760_n.jpg?oh=2b5e8be74b32c094c8f9678fb03e48a6\u0026amp;oe=57A50617\" style=\"width: 475px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/7a698664ff2ad0a0d7ca66b95974acda/tumblr_n3z8nwexw41rrctr8o2_500.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12993406_1556804864612233_1885610355321978920_n.jpg?oh=d8efd8e367f77e30e453360547cbc26e\u0026amp;oe=57A2AF79\" style=\"width: 483px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/042c05a802d7f7320e4da7a5581f8380/tumblr_nrwd20uGFd1rrctr8o1_500.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
