I\u0027m Samy el-Noury,\u00a0an actor, aerialist, pianist, puppeteer, and vocalist. In addition to performing, I work as a teaching artist for the Smithsonian Discovery Theater and the Young Playwright\u0027s Theater.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also an activist and public speaker on the leadership team for the Baltimore Transgender Alliance. I work with various organizations on peer support, youth mentorship, and outreach for LGBTQ-identified individuals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently live in Baltimore, MD and work along the east coast. For more information on the work I\u0027ve done, and for additional media (images, press, and a full acting resume) visit my website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.samyelnoury.com!\"\u003ewww.samyelnoury.com\u003c/a\u003e!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#ACTORLIFE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of the hustle of being an actor is having the stamina to make your multiple creative ventures work.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m very fortunate to be making a living off of my art, or art-adjacent work projects. I currently work six (yes, six!!) part-time jobs in the arts or performance. I do a lot, and your support can help me get there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe business of acting can be very costly. Investing in my artistic career means spending on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Headshots, Business Cards, and Printing\u003cbr\u003e- Website and Domain Hosting\u003cbr\u003e- Bus/Train/Plane Tickets, Parking, Gasoline, and Vehicle Maintenance\u003cbr\u003e- Lodging Accommodations\u003cbr\u003e- Business Meals\u003cbr\u003e- Tickets/Registration Fees to Workshops, Panels, Plays, and Networking Events\u003cbr\u003e- Subscriptions to Acting/Casting Services\u003cbr\u003e- Membership dues for Actors\u0027 Equity Association\u003cbr\u003e- And other business expenses not listed here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is in addition to my basic living needs, bills, utilities, and more. Fortunately, I\u0027m able to cover these without much stress on my end. The arts are a very \"feast or famine\" industry, where opportunities are either abundant or sporadic with little in-between. Your support and patronage will help me get the rest of the way there, to continue devoting my time and energy to my career even in those months where business is scarce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSupporters of my work can choose from a number of rewards, based on their giving level. All supporters, regardless of amount, will be featured on my website (samyelnoury.com/support). Reward tiers vary from a shoutout on social media, career updates, tickets to performances, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I expand my repertoire into creating new essays, plays, and poems, this content will become available to donors first. You will have a direct hand in helping me develop new work by offering feedback on new content before it becomes available to the public!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I am launching a youtube channel to deliver fresh content to my patrons. I\u0027m hoping to upload monthly videos on topics ranging from the business of acting to the transgender experience, as well as livestreamed piano performances every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t thank you enough for taking the time to visit my Patreon. Your support helps fuel the creation of new artwork and directly supports my career. Can\u0027t give right now? That\u0027s okay, too! Even liking or sharing my work goes a long way.
