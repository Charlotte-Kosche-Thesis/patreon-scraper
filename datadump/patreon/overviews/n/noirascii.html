As long as I have made at least one person smile, even if it\u0027s just a smirk or a bit of a chuckle, I\u0027m happy.  It\u0027s a simple goal, but it seems to have worked with more and more amazing people every day and I am nothing but elated to be able to provide that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow then, allow me to explain the reason for this page.  Needless to say, making content is an immensely rewarding experience for me.  If I didn\u0027t enjoy it, I wouldn\u0027t do it.  The biggest reward is the daily interactions I have with all of my Survivors and no amount of money in the world would change that fact.  But, I decided that if any of you did want to donate towards improving the content and the channel, I should have an avenue for you to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are no tiers, there are no perks and there are no special privileges gained by donating.  I want everyone to be treated equally and that isn\u0027t possible by segregating people into \u0027who donated more\u0027 (\u003cem\u003elet alone the fact that I have nothing special to provide\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e ^.^\"\u003c/strong\u003e).  All I can say is that if you decide to donate, I will be honored and eternally grateful to you.  I will always do my utmost to keep you smiling!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep on surviving!"
