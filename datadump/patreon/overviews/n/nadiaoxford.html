Despite several attempts to alter my\ndestiny as a child, I\u0027m a writer. I\u0027ve published many works of fiction and\nnon-fiction since 2003. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI write about video games full-time at \u003ca href=\"http://www.usgamer.net/\"\u003eUSgamer\u003c/a\u003e. I also contribute words to \u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1179385029/luminous-echo-the-world-compendium-re\"\u003eLuminous\nEcho\u003c/a\u003e, a wonderful D\u0026amp;D 5E, Anima, and Pathfinder-compatible compendium full\nof characters and settings you can use in your tabletop adventures. Meet them. Love them. Make them suffer.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve previously written for Gamepro Magazine, 1UP.com, Nerve.com,\nAbout.com, PlayStation: The Official Magazine, Just Labs Magazine, and\nplen-T-moar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m currently hip-deep in a novel, and I\u0027d like to let you\ninto my parlour as I finish writing and editing it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know you\u0027re a busy bee,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tinygirltinygames.com/2017/10/hey-kids-i-revised-my-patreon-for-a-novel-im-writing-heres-a-sample/\"\u003eso you can skip to the free sample\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\"So, you\u0027re\nanother schmuck with a novel, eh? Impress me.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell, it doesn\u0027t have a name yet. Now that you\u0027re\ndoubtlessly sold on this thing, let me tell you a little about it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe novel takes place primarily in Northern Toronto, and\nplaces even more northern than Northern Toronto. Jamie, a newly-turned vampire,\nis having trouble adjusting to her new \"life,\" but her assigned therapist,\na kind-hearted incubus named Alexander, is helping her cope\u2014mentally,\nemotionally, and physically.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e(Oh yeah, um, this story is \u003cstrong\u003efor audiences age 18+.\u003c/strong\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eJamie and Alexander aren\u0027t the only \"Specialties\" hanging around town. There are other vampires, a few shape-shifters, and a\nsmattering of demons. They\u0027re all corralled and monitored by a herd of\nunicorns. The unicorns keep a tight leash on their charges, and to\ndissent is to court death\u2014or at least earn yourself a kick in the ass delivered\nby a pair of cloven hooves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.tinygirltinygames.com/content/uploads/2017/10/20171012-nadia-02.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\"Good thing I\u0027m not a shit-disturber,\" thinks\nJamie, who\u0027s content to retain as much of her old life as possible. She still goes\nto work, does her chores, and hangs out in \"Vampire House,\" a run-down\nstrawberry box house that serves as a kind of waypoint for other Specialties in\nthe area. There, in the damp cat-infested basement, they converge, drink Bloody\nCaesars, watch TV, play PlayStation, \u003cdel\u003ehave voyeuristic sex\u003c/del\u003e, and bitch\nabout the unicorns. Things aren\u0027t so bad if you follow the rules, satisfy your\nbloodlust in socially acceptable ways, and don\u0027t do anything to piss off the\nponies in charge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut Jamie comes to learn the unicorns just don\u0027t keep the\nSpecialties \u003cem\u003ein\u003c/em\u003e the city\u2014they also\nkeep their foes, the dragons, \u003cem\u003eout\u003c/em\u003e of\nit. And that becomes a lot more difficult when an ancient serpent, the Grey\nKing, returns to his old territory in Northern Ontario to slaughter male dragons\nand claim the females. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe long-exiled dragons are being pushed further south, and the unicorns\naren\u0027t having it. Jamie soon finds herself responsible for a refugee dragon\nmother and her son, both of whom are being targeted by the Grey King \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e the unicorns.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nVampire House becomes divided over the turmoil. Jamie must\ndecide if she wants to keep the peace with Alexander and her new friends, or if\nshe wants to take a stand against the unicorns and lend a hand in sorting out\nthe bad shit going down. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFun ensues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\"If I smeared\npeanut butter on my keyboard and got my dog to lick it off, he\u0027d probably write\na Mortal Instruments rip-off novel in the process. What makes your \u0027modern\nfairy tale\u0027 so special?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell \u2026 it doesn\u0027t take itself too seriously, I think. Yes,\nthere are serious moments, there are sexy moments, there are sad moments and\ndangerous moments. But the juxtaposition between the fantastic and the mundane\nis inherently ridiculous, and the characters aren\u0027t afraid to have a little fun\nwith their situation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are some shout-outs to geek culture and nostalgia, for\ninstance, but I\u0027m done with the \"Hey! Remember ALF?\" elbow-jabs popular\nmedia feeds us nowadays. When I talk about geekery, I\u0027m talking about a bisexual\nvampire snarking at a pansexual incubus for choosing Marie as his waifu in\nPersona 4 Golden (\"I like her hat. Get off my dick\").\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I think pissed-off dictator unicorns are an\ninteresting plot device, but I\u0027m biased.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"You\u0027ve said the\nword \u0027sex\u0027 and variations thereof a few times already. Please tell me more about\nsex\u0027s role in this novel.\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYes, this novel certainly has adult situations. Sex is part\nof the narrative, but not the focus. There\u0027s nothing incredibly explicit; I\u0027d\ndescribe it as vanilla with a cinnamon swirl. Warm and sweet with a little\nspice. There\u0027s a touch of kink, but nothing like Super Mario impregnating a\nlactating Sonic the Hedgehog ooooooor whatever.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe pairings I\u0027ve written already include straight, bisexual,\nand pansexual characters. There will probably be more to come, hurr hurr.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to find out if I\u0027m any good at this sort of\nthing, you can \u003ca href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/Sugoi_Argonian_Maid\"\u003echeck\nout my Archive of Our Own account\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.tinygirltinygames.com/content/uploads/2017/10/20171012-nadia-01.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"If I give this\nthing a chance, what\u0027ll I get?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m tens of thousands of words into my second-ish draft of\nthis thing. In fact, if you followed me on LiveJournal back in the day, you\nmight remember my first draft. The second draft is more of a compete rewrite, I\nswear to all the gods. I\u0027d sooner flush my head down a toilet than warm up that\nfirst draft and feed it to you again. Shudder.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you contribute a buck, you\u0027ll sit in on the rest of the\nwriting process. You\u0027ll get an excerpt once a week (maybe twice) that\u0027s\napproximately 700 \u2013 1000 words. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you contribute $5 or more, you\u0027ll have access to notes\nabout my process, inspiration, writing tips, and other fun junk.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you contribute more than $5, I\u0027ll kiss a piece of paper\nand mail it to you in an envelope. Well, no. But I\u0027ll be incredibly\nappreciative. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Don\u0027t you have\na full-time job? Why do you need more cash, you cash hog?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIndeed, I do work full-time. I\u0027m very lucky. But life is expensive, and I\nhave health issues like fibromyalgia, gastroparesis, and other stomach fuckery\nthat requires treatment and meds. Thankfully, Canadian health care covers a lot\nof my medical costs, but not all of them. That last slice is kind of important.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also have debts and taxes to pay. tl;dr, Nadia needs more\nmoney. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Are\nyou calling it quits on Tiny Girl, Tiny Games?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eNaw! Not on your life. Now, TGTG\u0027s role has definitely changed\nsince I launched it: I initially wanted it to be a site dedicated to handheld\ngaming, since I kicked it off around the same time I lost my role as\nAbout.com\u0027s Guide to the Nintendo DS. But when I started working full-time at\nUSgamer, I had less need for a writing showcase about portable games. Nowadays,\nTGTG mostly hosts essays I belt out off the top of my head. They\u0027re a bit\nrough, a bit unpolished, and therefore different from my work on USgamer. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eTGTG serves a good purpose, and so it shall continue to\nserve that purpose. It\u0027s fun, and it\u0027s therapeutic. But I wanted to shift my\nPatreon to something not-gaming related, so I can give my Patrons something they\ndon\u0027t normally see from me. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Can I give you\nmoney without becoming a Patron?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWatch how fast I don\u0027t say \"no.\" You can \u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/nadiaoxford\"\u003ebuy me a Ko-Fi\u003c/a\u003e, or send money to my\nPaypal (nadiaoxford at gmail dot com).  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you donate, get in touch with me and we can see about\ngiving you some words in exchange!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I miiiight be\nconvinced to throw a few bucks your way.
