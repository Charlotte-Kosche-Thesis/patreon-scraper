That\u0027s what I\u0027m working on for you. It\u0027s rare that you get to read a rough draft of, well, anyone\u0027s novel. But here you can see a book in its very first stages, from the first chapter to the last. If you want to provide feedback, that\u0027s great! Readers always have ideas that the author may not have thought of. Who knows? Maybe you\u0027ll influence the book!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m not just waltzing in off the streets demanding money. That\u0027s rude.\u00a0No - I\u0027ve made sure to bust ass so you\u0027re getting quality work from the get-go (or at least as quality as a first draft can be.

If you like fantasy, great. If you like romance, cool. If you enjoy survival stories, try it out. In this story, the mermaid is a kidnapper of men, the gentleman involved isn\u0027t a prince, and the woman he fell in love with is shipwrecked and struggling to survive alone on an island.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what will I be doing with the funds you give me? Besides loving you forever, you\u0027ll be the driving force behind me writing at least one chapter per month of my current novel. You\u0027ll get to read it before it becomes a book and gets released out into the wild. Likewise, these funds will go toward a final cover once the book is done, as well as any other necessary materials for marketing. (And dog food. What can I say? My dog can\u0027t work on an empty stomach. He has to stare at me\u00a0while I write. It\u0027s an important part of the process - also, very annoying.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMore funds mean extra goodies, such as excerpts from my writing notebook (think deleted scenes), free books, and anything else I can think of (or heck, maybe you guys can give me ideas!) to simply say thank you for the support. Otherwise, happy reading!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v62/SSJAkira1/IMG_0320.jpg\" style=\"width: 304px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
