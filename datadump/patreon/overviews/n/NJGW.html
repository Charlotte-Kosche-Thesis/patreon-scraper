    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m NJGW - a Robot Wars YouTuber who has been an avid fan of the show since the late 90s. Despite the show disappearing from our screens for many a year during the 00s, robot combat was still something that I had fond memories of, and many a childhood day was spent talking about, playing with, or drawing the latest machines to grace our screens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015, me and my sister decided to binge watch the entire series over, and that summer is filled with great memories as my childhood was relived over just a couple of months. Then, to make matters even better, as that childhood was upscaled to the present - with Robot Wars rebooted on BBC2!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo coincide with this, I started up my own YouTube channel, with the aim of attracting as much attention to the show as possible - whether that be via reminiscing over battles from a more archaic time, or giving the spotlight to the wonderful capabilities over the modern-day machines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the show\u0027s reboot increased in quality, so did my aims and goals to expand this channel - with videos such as Top Battles compilations, as well as the current project: The Ultimate Countdown being popular ones. However, I really want to make this channel the ultimate in Robot Wars content, and this is where I need your help, if you\u0027re ever so kind to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow despite The Ultimate Countdown, Top Battles, and Series uploads taking weeks to sort out, these are ultimately projects where I am simply using the raw material from the show and polishing it up. Now, I want to further the spare time I invest in the NJGW channel by providing you true, hardcore Robot Wars fans with deeper content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese aims were trialled with the Robot Wars History Podcast - a show where a panel of fans cover the career of a machine from the show. Despite not being as popular as some of the other content on the channel, the Robot Wars History Podcast still has its own little fanbase of its own. This is very encouraging for the much bigger plans in the future. These plans include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRobot Wars: Versus - a self-commentated show, where two machines are placed against each other two decided which machine is the superior. The two robots in the spotlight will be compared in five separate categories, before an eventual winner is confirmed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRobot Wars: The Big Question - each episode, a specific subject will be up for debate, with two guest speakers offering counter opinions to the other. Examples of these can include: debating about a controversial rule change, or making a case for the best driver in the show\u0027s history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRobot Wars: Top Tens - countdown videos, which will cover specific subjects, such as the best KOs in the show\u0027s history, or the best moments from an individual series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRobot Wars: The Ultimate Countdown(s): further Ultimate Countdown-style videos are planned - with one idea in particular potentially eclipsing The Ultimate Countdown itself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yeah: in simple terms, I\u0027m really looking to make this channel a blend of: the eye-catching and on-the-face combat, as well as deeper content which can provide debate and intrigue with Robot Wars fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is where I\u0027m looking for help from you guys in the way of a donation. Help which will allow me to be more consistent with my uploads, help which will develop the content of this channel from the above shortlists, help which can even allow me to pay the editor of the Robot Wars: History Podcast, Ollie, and even paying small guest appearance fees to people who appear on the channel! Every little helps, and even the smallest of donations can really help push this channel further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNevertheless, whether you donate or not: thank you. Thank you for the immense support this channel has had. I always enjoy reading your comments. Whether it be an essay on a certain episode, a Robot Wars Turd suggestion, or - in Toast\u0027s case - a frame-by-frame breakdown of the Ultimate Countdown, I always look forward to your guys\u0027 comments and reactions. Thank you, as always.\u003cbr\u003e"

A lot of them are well received, and that\u0027s great to see, but still - ultimately most of these are projects where I am simply using the raw material from the show and polishing it up. Although I will still provide these things, I want to further the spare time I invest in the NJGW channel by providing you true, hardcore Robot Wars fans with deeper content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese aims were trailed with the Robot Wars History Podcast - a show where a panel of fans cover the career of a machine from the show. Despite not being as popular as some of the other content on the channel, the Robot Wars History Podcast has its own little fanbase of its own. It\u0027s great that such a throwaway part of the channel still has a good following, and that\u0027s what has triggered me into thinking of extra ideas for the channel. These include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRobot Wars Versus: a series where two robots will face off against each other in each episode. Both robots will be analysed and scored in five criteria to decide the overall better machine of the two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRobot Wars: The Big Question: a series where two people from the community will discuss a certain topic at hand. In most cases, one of the guests will offer a positive view on the subject, while the other guest will offer the opposite. This series will look to inform and explore avenues on subjects that you wouldn\u0027t expect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRobot Wars: Top Tens: videos on certain subjects, summarised by the 10 best of a certain thing. It could be the 10 best OotAs, the 10 best moments from the classic series, the 10 best moments from the Pits - anything!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRobot Wars: The Ultimate Countdown: these mega videos will continue! Ultimate Countdowns concerning the foreign wars, a list of every single reboot battle, and more are being considered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yeah! I\u0027m really looking to make this channel a blend of: the eye-catching and on-the-face combat, as well as deeper content which can provide debate and intrigue with Robot Wars fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, this is where I\u0027m looking for help from you guys. Whether you donate or not that\u0027s okay as I still appreciate your support either way, but anything in the way of donations will just help me keep ticking along in an attempt to upload at more consistent speeds, all while improving the content further on the channel. Thank you, as always.\u003cbr\u003e",
