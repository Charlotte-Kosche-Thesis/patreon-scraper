    "summary": "With what had seemed like an unchallengable Tory dominance falling apart and with capitalism unable to offer any meaningful concessions to ameliorate a profound social crisis, the need and opening for a rigorous and radical socialist alternative is glaring. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party managed to buck a very powerful global trend of social-democratic decline in June\u0027s general election. \u003cem\u003eNew Socialist\u003c/em\u003e is creating a new space for the radical left, helping to build, organise and encourage the movement as well as fostering robust intellectual discussion, razor-sharp debate and thorough criticism. Unashamedly partisan but by no means an echo chamber, \u003cem\u003eNew Socialist\u003c/em\u003e will serve as an intransigent rabble-rouser as well as a journal of ideas, providing a home for domestic and international socialist left perspectives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe ran a widely\npraised Election Special which we are very proud of. Many of our\npieces have been very extensively shared and sparked considerable\ndiscussion of future strategic direction for the left. We\nhave also begun, with our pieces on conference, to provide directly\npractical organising guides for the movement. Everyone involved in\nthe project so far, from writers, to editors, to our web and design\nteam has given their time for free. However, this is not sustainable\nin the long-term and we have further organising and educational\nambitions beyond producing online content. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo sustain and develop the project, we\u2019ll need your help. If you believe as we do that such an initiative is sorely needed, please subscribe. \u003cem\u003eNew Socialist\u003c/em\u003e is, and will always be, not for profit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help us:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay contributors, as we believe that work should be paid for and also because material support for those who otherwise would not have been able to contribute is an essential part of widening opportunities and drawing on a wider range of experiences and thought.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay for editorial work, again, as we believe this is work that should be paid for and because paying for it will allow editors to spend more time seeking and helping a wider range of contributors.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay for hosting, design and other general expenses.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eShould we have any more money, we will use it on political education projects, including hosting events and supporting New Socialist clubs as community hubs of socialist discussion.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe commit to transparency about what we use we make of donations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe \u003cem\u003eNew Socialist\u003c/em\u003e is necessary as a tool for a specific politics, to advance the left both in and through Labour and in society as a whole. All our activity in \u003cem\u003eNew Socialist\u003c/em\u003e aims to be in the service of this. We believe that debate and discussion are an essential part of a vibrant, democratic culture on the left. One of the fundamental, and deepening, contradictions of capitalist society is that between a generic and ever expanding human intellectual capacity for clear, creative and effective thought and the narrow, specialised, socially authorised function of the intellectual.\u003cem\u003e New Socialist \u003c/em\u003eaims to provide a platform for discussion to help organise the left, clarify and socialise experience and knowledge and demystify politics and economics in the service of participation in the transformation and democratisation of the Labour Party and society. There is vast creative and intellectual potential in our movement but much of it is latent, much contradictory and unclear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, \u003cem\u003eNew Socialist \u003c/em\u003ewill not be a platform for debate for its own sake but for discussion that is always attentive to its practical consequences and advances the position of the left. We may offer space to the left outside Labour and Labour members not on the left as we believe there are lessons to learn but these contributions will be on our terms. We condemn and will allow no space not only for sexism, racism, ageism, homophobia, ableism, transphobia or other discriminatory language, but also for positions useful to social reaction or imperialism. We believe in tactful, generous, supportive discussion between comrades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for all your generous support, we couldn\u2019t do this without you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEqual Opportunities and Accountability\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome limits to the full development of the intellectual capacities of our movement are deeply rooted in social structures and therefore can only be overcome by the radical social transformation we aim to support. However, we can work to develop these capacities in the here and now, directly through the activity of \u003cem\u003eNew Socialist \u003c/em\u003eitself. One of the major ways in which the expression of the intellectual capacities of our movement is limited is that certain voices, experiences and organisations of knowledge are dominant, certain voices, experiences and organisations of knowledge are marginalised. This may be through discrimination, whether direct or indirect, or due to a lack of confidence or a lack of material support to allow the time to develop ideas and produce work. \u003cem\u003eNew Socialist\u003c/em\u003e aims to undo this suppression of capacities and experiences, not only because it is right, not only because it makes our values concrete, but even more importantly because the contributions emerging from them will strengthen\u003cem\u003e New Socialist\u003c/em\u003e and our political usefulness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will monitor equal opportunities data and publish it so that we can be accountable. As well as being attentive to the traditionally monitored categories, we will encourage new writers from a wide range of educational backgrounds, and writers from all parts of the UK, as we are aware that the dominance of London and the South-East in political writing reflects and reinforces geographical inequalities. Once we are able to pay writers, at least 50% of our pieces will be written by women and if we are notably failing in other areas we will introduce quotas for that too. We will also monitor for the type of pieces being written, we believe discussion of issues affecting marginalised groups should be led by members of those groups but also that members of marginalised groups are as able as anyone else to contribute in whatever way they want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur editors will make a particular effort to reach out to potential contributors to ensure we meet these commitments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will also aim to be accountable to our readers. We will invite responses to pieces, which if they help hold us to account or develop debate, we will publish. We will also seek to have some of these comments expanded into future contributions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for all your generous support, we couldn\u2019t do this without you.\u003cbr\u003e"

As we do not understand theory as unworldly, for us, any useful theory will be grounded in a practical view of the world that is dedicated towards changing it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy employing a part-time editor/organiser, this would not only allow us to publish more, but to develop the relation between our theoretical work and practice.

We would also develop and disseminate guides, like our \u003cem\u003eGuides for Conference \u003c/em\u003eand\u00a0toolkits for things like party offices and councillor and MP selection procedures.This would empower grass-roots members and enable the left to work more strategically to democratise and build the labour movement from below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of this is \"prefiguring in the movement the practices and relationships of a socialist society\" (Hilary Wainwright) which come out of everyday concerns, and we would organise to institutionalise democratic practice and a culture, through mobilising local groups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese endeavours will always be rooted in addressing how theory relates to practice, not only in the possibility that theory may guide our practical work but more importantly, with how theory emerges from these engagements to clarify our practical struggles and strengthen our theoretical perspectives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003epay for a part-time editor/organiser\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ecreate tools for and organise a range of opportunities for participatory political education\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eorganise horizontally across branches and CLPs to share strategies and socialise knowledge\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ehelp organise and mobilise pre-figurative groups around local needs\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
