I have a fabulous son who is in 11th grade, a husband who\u0027s the best, and 2 entertaining pets named Apollo and Cooper.\u00a0In a past life I owned a small boutique design agency that served the financial industry for 20+ years. But the 2008 financial collapse changed everything. The carnage was fast and furious and I lost almost 80% of my business. You\u0027d think I was devastated but in fact I was kind of relieved. I had been thinking about getting out of the business. The financial crisis gave me an out.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFast forward 10 years and I\u0027m now a full-time fine artist painting photo realistic portraits, nudes, and oysters in my studio\u00a0on a mountain in the Hudson Valley a few hours North of New York City. I\u0027ve been told my paintings are funny, defiant, and real and I think those are perfect adjectives to describe my art.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the early days, the beauty of social media was being able to share my work in progress images, see what other artist were doing, feeling of sense of community, and lots of networking. But it\u0027s no longer the case.\u00a0So I created this Patreon page because I\u0027m\u00a0tired of the clutter,\u00a0advertisements, censorship, and no one seeing my posts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon in an online platform where patrons can pay a small monthly fee to see my posts. It\u0027s\u00a0not like Kickstarter. It\u0027s more like Netflix.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eW\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehat can you expect if you sign-up and become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027ll be the first to see what\u0027s going on in the studio! I\u0027ll be posting work in progress and reference photos, videos, news, Q\u0026amp;A events, tips, freebies, first view and purchase options of final paintings, discounts, and so much more. For your convenience, I\u0027ve created\u00a0several award\u00a0tiers each of which will grant you access to more and more content. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy main goal is to create a community for my collectors, fellow art lovers, and like minded artists who want to support my art and participate in the development of paintings as they are being created.\u00a0if you have any questions\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:studio@nadinerobbinsart.com\"\u003eemail\u003c/a\u003e me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs always, thanks for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "American painter and photographer Nadine Robbins (b. 1966) grew up in\n the South of France and London, the Carolinas and the Northeast. Under \nthe tutelage of her artist mother, Robbins learned of the great masters,\n and with her father, the wonders of the natural world on the shores of \nthe American coast. Nadine\u2019s contemporary style is distinguished by a \nmasterly command of academic painting techniques paired with an \nirreverence for rules, gender and beauty.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eRobbins is widely \nrecognized for her large-scale painting series Eight Portrait Pieces, \nrecently featured at the prestigious Royal Society of Portrait Painters,\n London, 2010-11. In all of Robbin\u2019s figural works, the dialogue between\n painter and subject allows an evocation of complex emotion; often \nturning upside down the historical tradition of gaze, viewer and the \nsubject. As well, her succulent paintings of American oysters \ndemonstrate the artist\u2019s unique sensibility and way of blending \ntraditional techniques and meticulousness with a reconfigured gaze \nincorporating an intimate magnification in the style of Georgia O\u2019Keefe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNadine\u2019s\n masterful use of luscious jewel toned paint and high fidelity realism \nties the artist to the late twentieth century and contemporary \ntraditions of hyper-realism, photo-realism, and super-realism. Like \nChuck Close, Nadine uses a similar photographic and painterly process to\n produce dynamic contemporary portraits. The artist\u2019s montage-like use \nof atelier technique and way of working adds to the oeuvre a studied \ncomplexity that is enticing and refined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to her solo \nshow at Brill Gallery, Massachusetts, 2009, Nadine was recently selected\n for the special issue of \u201cFormation\u201d produced by Poets \u0026amp; Artists \nMagazine show at Bernaducci Meisel, New York, January 2017. Her recent \ninternational exhibitions include Museo de Arte Moderno de Barcelona, \nSpain 2016, Sala Bantierra de Zaragoza, Spain, 2016, Sirona Fine Art, \nSouth Florida in both 2015-16, Women Painting Women, RJD Gallery, Sag \nHarbor, 2016-2017; and the Robert Lange Gallery in Charleston. Nadine\u2019s \nwork may be found in several important private collections, most notably\n the Howard A. \u0026amp; Judith Tullman Collection, Chicago. In 2015, the \nartist was selected for the special feature Poets and Artists, 50 \nMemorable Painters. With multiple upcoming projects and exhibitions \nincluding her first solo exhibition in New York City in the fall of \n2018, Nadine continues to attract the attention of collectors, curators,\n dealers, and gallery owners around the world.",
