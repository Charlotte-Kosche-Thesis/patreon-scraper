Making films.\u003cbr\u003eThere is not a day that goes by when I don\u0027t think about making a filmsFilm is such a cool creative outlet, and that is why I like\u00a0it. Have I told you that I like films? Because I do, films are great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA couple of months ago when on a call with a friend discussing a script I had just finished they gave me an idea of making something greater than a short film. I immediately\u00a0started working on it, and until this day I haven\u0027t stopped. As of right now, I can\u0027t really tell you what it is besides the fact that it is, in fact, coherent series of short-films\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea is for me to work on 1 big project whilst posting smaller things as often as possible. I\u0027ve got a folder filled with enough ideas to last for at least a year!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason why this page exists is not that I want to earn money, it\u0027s here because I\u0027ll be paying for everything out of my own pocket, and this is a way of slightly reducing the mountain of debt I am headed towards with this project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter the size, every contribution helps a ton, and I promise to pay back in short films."
