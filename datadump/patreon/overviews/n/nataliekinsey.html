    "summary": "I\u0027m a joy bringer. I help people remember and return to their joy. \u00a0For every return to joy on an individual level, there\u0027s an increase the world\u0027s joy. It\u0027s a kind of beautiful math.\u003cbr\u003eAnd the more people I helped to get unconfused, the more they gave their gifts to the world, and the bigger my personal joy became. \u00a0Math plus math plus math equals more math, apparently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what I\u0027ve discovered about my path as a joy renewer is that only some part of it fits into a career. \u00a0Returning people to the life changing power of their true joy, regardless of their financial situation, has become\u00a0a calling. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeeper still, this radical stand I take in joying the world is a political act. A logical consequence of people getting centered in their joy is that they\u0027re impossible to control. When people learn to tend a sustained conversation with their deepest joys, new paradigms, solutions are born from that clarity. \u00a0 Joy centered people vote from the dictates of their joyful heart. \u00a0They live and design their lives in harmony with The Great Joy, they raise the future citizens of the world out of that joyful wisdom. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnowing this as deeply as I do,\u00a0I no longer refuse to take on clients who can\u0027t pay because I don\u0027t want to. \u00a0It\u0027s simply too important to our collective future, and to my personal joy. \u00a0Starting play churches wherever I go is a mission of the soul, an often unfunded mission as the places that need conscious joy the most are often the ones struggling the hardest economically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Play Church movement turns disconnected cities into joy-empowered tribes. \u00a0I\u0027m smitten with the story of ubuntu where, whenever someone in the village has done something wrong, instead of punishing them, they sit them in front of a tree and people line up to have a chance to remind them of their goodness. \u00a0Play Churches focus on developing the innate skills of effervescence of each individual to grow our capacity for ubuntu.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the great teachers teach that joy elevates us to where solutions live. \u00a0It frees, it renews, it warms, invigorates and illumes, or as the Dalai Lama says, \"the purpose of our lives is to be happy.\" \u00a0And this is why it\u0027s become my joy and privilege to devote a large portion of my vocation to serving the village. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo\u00a0now, I\u0027m asking the village of the world to support the grassroots movement of building more play churches, joy classes, and joy ashrams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027"
