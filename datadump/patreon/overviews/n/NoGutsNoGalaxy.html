Both had previously been a part of the MechWarrior: Living Legends development team (as testers and some 3D modelling), and they ran the Outreach Teamspeak community server, which eventually grew into what is NGNG today. Between them they have over 50 years of BattleTech and MechWarrior experience, starting with Daeron\u0027s purchase of BatteDroids in 1984, and including all of the tabletop iterations of BattleTech, the card game, most of the novels read over and over (and over!), all of the video games from Crescent Hawk to MWO, and so on. Yes, they love BattleTech!",
