    "summary": "Welcome to Naivety Gaming! We\u0027re a video gaming YouTube channel that expertly plays (not really) through mostly unknown games, provides engaging commentary (absolutely not), and professionally edits our videos for a family-friendly audience! ....Alright, let\u0027s not kid ourselves on that last part, but you get the idea. As being a small creator, we have a lot of costs we need to cover, from buying new equipment, covering marketing costs, and paying the employees that work within Naivety Gaming. Because YouTube is no longer doing us any favors by increasing the barrier of entry for ad monetization and sponsorship, we\u0027ve launched a Patreon page! For signing up, we\u0027ll give you special treatment through exclusive content, like polls, private discussions with us in the group, an occasional glimpse behind-the-scenes, and video series that only you Patrons can see! For as little as $1 a month, you too can get exclusive access to our special Patreon community, and also being a massive support by figuratively putting food on our tables today! ...Again, that last bit might have been an exaggeration."
