    "summary": "If the vision could be summed up at this point, it might be something like \"Just get started with whatever you have\". The idea of this channel is to show how much a person could do if they just begin. An expensive fully functional shop with great and vast tools is a wonderful thing, but it isn\u0027t necessary to begin. This page and the content is going to be geared towards a little how-to, a little come along as the possibilities increase, and a little just check out what\u0027s possible. It\u0027s important to understand that I am not portraying any mastery, or claiming to know something you don\u0027t. If you want mastery there are many more qualified for that than you will find here (Look for Jimmy Diresta, John Heisz and others like them). The main goal here is to show how one guy might reason through a particular puzzle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually we will build a proper shop (and you will come along for the ride if we hit our $300 goal). There are plans in the works to make that accessible for the interested Patrons... though we don\u0027t know the exact best way to do that yet and are open to ideas... Maybe a makers party type deal?\u003cbr\u003e"
