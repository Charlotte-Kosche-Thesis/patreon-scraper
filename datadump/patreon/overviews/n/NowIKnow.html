Readers have learned that Abraham Lincoln created the secret service \u2013 \u003ca href=\"http://nowiknow.com/abraham-lincoln-created-the-secret-service-the-day-he-was-shot/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eon the day he was shot, that carrots \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://nowiknow.com/carrots-were-originally-purple/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eused to be purple\u003c/a\u003e, how turkey (the bird/food) \u003ca href=\"http://nowiknow.com/how-turkey-got-its-name/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003egot its name, \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://nowiknow.com/archives/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eand a whole lot more\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing Now I Know since June of 2010. \u00a0I publish every weekday, and when people ask me how I do it, I tell them the same thing: it\u0027s a lot of work, but it\u0027s worth it. I love to share all the interesting things I learn about, and I now have a great way to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend dozens of hours each month -- okay, maybe each week -- researching, writing, and setting up the emails that I\u0027ve been sending out for free for years. It\u0027s important to me that the newsletter be a free experience because the whole point is to share. \u00a0I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to write a couple of books and find some great organizations who have published some of my articles over the years, which is great -- I get to reach more and more people, and get paid for it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut as you probably know, ads aren\u0027t really a great way to sustain projects like this. Plus, I\u0027d like to do more with Now I Know, but ads are increasingly more of a crutch than a springboard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m trying this. Please give what you can but there\u0027s no need to -- I\u0027m going to keep writing (there will just be ads!) even if this doesn\u0027t work. There\u0027s no obligation and there never will be -- the Now I Know newsletter will always be free, and hopefully, always be interesting, too."
