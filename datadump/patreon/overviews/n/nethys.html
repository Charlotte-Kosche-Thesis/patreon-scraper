    "summary": "Hello Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Blake Davis, also known as Karui Kage or Nethys, depending on where you\u2019re looking. I\u2019ve been involved with the games industry for over a decade now in some form or fashion, and often work on projects related to the Pathfinder RPG or my newer Let\u2019s Play channel, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCipbbZzEmrNy5B59DglL5hQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDungeons \u0026amp; Desktops\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon was created as a means to support the two larger projects I spend time on. The aforementioned Let\u2019s Play channel is one of them. The other is my website, the \u003ca href=\"http://www.archivesofnethys.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eArchives of Nethys\u003c/a\u003e, a massive compilation of Pathfinder RPG mechanics and crunch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve always enjoyed making things for the community, and I\u2019ve never been inclined to charge for them. I love it when people create amazing things and share them with the rest of us, and felt like I should return the favor whenever I could. The website and LP are the largest examples, but I\u2019ve also been involved in plenty of supplementary materials for the Pathfinder RPG and some other game systems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like any of the projects I put my time into, then this Patreon is a way to show your appreciation. Contribute however much you want, whether it be $5 a month or $20. Stop or start your support at any point. In part because of restrictions involved with Pathfinder\u2019s Community Use Policy, I can\u2019t make any promises about what will come from contributing or provisions only to those who show support. Really, all I can do is tell you that I will continue to do as much as I can for the gaming community. If you ever feel like that is not enough anymore, then I fully support you stopping any donations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an incredible system in that the amount of support you show me is entirely dependent on you, and it can begin or end at your whim. That said, while I don\u2019t ever expect things to get this high, I do have some ideas on what I\u2019d like to do if this Patreon ended up pulling down certain amounts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$70/month: \u003c/strong\u003eThe major restriction in my doing more with my projects is the need for a regular job. I work around it as best I can, but without hitting a certain threshold, that is always going to be a factor. At this level I would be putting the money back into all the projects I did the best way I could. The website would get an increase in support, a dedicated server, potentially a public API for accessing the database. The Let\u2019s Play channel would get an increase in quality equipment and footage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e$3,500/month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e: \u003c/strong\u003eIf I ever hit this threshold and was able to maintain it for 2-3 months, then I would begin doing this work full time. I have a *lot* of ideas on additional side projects I would like to do, that can only really be done if I had all of my time to do them. I\u2019ve listed some of them below as ideas on what I would start doing if I was able to really focus myself. If it ever seems like we\u0027re getting close to this amount, then I\u0027ll start prioritizing the below items (plus any others that are thought of between now and then) so those contributing will know more about what to expect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eArchives of Nethys\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWork on a publicly accessible API.\u003c/strong\u003e All of the data that the Archives uses is stored in SQL, and providing a public API would allow other users to access the data in an efficient fashion for whatever projects they had in mind. Faster searches, larger queries, and more have the potential.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdd more actual Rules content.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eAt the moment, the Archives has mechanics, but not really the rules on using them. The PRD (Paizo\u2019s official website) has all of those. Given the time, I would add these rules onto the site in a fashion that allowed users to find them quickly and efficiently.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFactions, Character Builds, other useful content:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eThere are a lot of other things that the Archives could track that I currently don\u2019t right now. I\u2019d love to add more features for the website and make it into a true one-stop location for everything Pathfinder. Being able to work on it full time would see new items being added on a weekly basis.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnectivity with MapTools and/or Roll20:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eThis ties into the idea of a public API, but the ability to script a lot of the Monsters I have stored so their information can quickly go into a MapTool Token is a possibility I\u2019d like to look into. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eOther Pathfinder RPG Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eMore Tools:\u003c/strong\u003e A comprehensive tool for managing summons, including all the feats that tie into them. A quick creation tool for building eidolons or constructing other monsters. These are things that exist in some downloadable tools like Hero Lab, but the goal here would be to put them onto the web in a convenient location for free.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacter Storage and Display:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI haven\u2019t yet seen a heavily-used and consistent way of displaying your character to someone else beyond the old days in Pen and Paper. I would love to engineer a new database to store whatever character data put into it, with convenient hyperlinks back to all mechanics at the Archives.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConversions:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eA long time ago I did a Legacy to Fire AP conversion back before the Pathfinder RPG was officially out. The popularity of the recent Rise of the Runelords conversion was pretty large, and I would love to go back and convert the other three APs, or even some older material from the 3.5 days (like Age of Worms).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eLet\u2019s Play Related Activities\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eMore Content:\u003c/strong\u003e Right now the channel puts out 1 video a day, sometimes more if we have a large enough backlog. I could see this easily expanding to 2-3 videos a day if we had the time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDifferent Reviews:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eKat and I would love to do \"Let\u0027s Play\" style videos for board games and tabletop RPGs, but that takes a bit more in the way of cameras and sound equipment. With a full time avenue, this becomes a higher possibility.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eTo all that contribute, I thank you with everything I have. I love doing work like this and being able to freely share it to everything I can. Thank you so much for helping me work towards that as a continued goal."
