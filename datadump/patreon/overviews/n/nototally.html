    "summary": "Hey! I\u0027m Shaun, and if you\u0027re here, I assume you know me from Twitter (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/NoTotally\"\u003e@NoTotally\u003c/a\u003e). If not, then probably my (currently on hiatus but coming back soon, I promise!) film and social issues podcast, No, Totally!.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf none of that\u0027s ringing a bell, you may have caught my closing keynote at Affect Conf 2017 in Portland? Or, possibly, maybe you read me talking about linguistics, race, and/or representation, for publications like The New Yorker, The Huffington Post, Splinter, USA Today, The New Statesman, or The Village Voice? Could\u0027ve been Cosmopolitan: they once erroneously claimed that I got into a Twitter fight with John Mayer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of what led you here, I\u0027m truly grateful and honored that you\u0027re reading these words on this website. Please, take a moment to absorb my full gratitude. I\u0027ll wait.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, so here\u0027s how this thing works. It\u0027s really simple. A lot of what I do that\u0027s of value- podcasting, say, or writing long-form about mental health and social justice- isn\u0027t really considered as such by the people who might typically compensate me for the time I spend on those things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut those are important things! I have and will continue doing them for free, but if you\u0027re someone who finds anything I do valuable and can afford to spare some of the cash a better society might be paying me, you\u0027re in the exact right place. And, in exchange, you get to read something original from me, accessible only to patrons, every week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you\u0027re here to pledge or are already a patron, I\u0027m staggered by your kindness and generosity, and can\u0027t thank you enough for your support. I\u0027m not tearing up, you\u0027re tearing up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lt;3,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShaun\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Please note that pledges on this page are counted every Tuesday, but are charged in one big batch near the beginning of every month. I know that\u0027s a bit confusing, but it basically means that, if you pledge $1, then in a month where there are four Tuesdays, you\u0027ll get charged $4 some time within the first few days of the month. Some months have five Tuesdays, and in those months you\u0027ll be charged $5, but also be granted superpowers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Sorry, sorry, the superpowers thing isn\u0027t true."
