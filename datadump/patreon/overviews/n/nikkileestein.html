Ultimately, I\u0027ll be writing a book in an attempt to analyze (through adventure! I promise it won\u0027t be boring!) road culture\u0027s role in the USA, and what it means that there\u0027s no space for women/queer people/POC in that culture. Along the way, I\u0027ll be writing poetry, taking pictures, and speculating wildly--and I\u0027d love to include y\u0027all in the conversation that ensues. As a patron, you\u0027ll have exclusive access to all the musings and tidbits that come before/possibly never make it into the book. In the meantime, I\u0027ll send you any theorizing I do, let you in on my extracurricular reading/researching, and probably sneak some poetry and fiction into the mix.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much in advance--I\u0027m so excited to take you on this journey with me, and I won\u0027t be able to do it without you!"
