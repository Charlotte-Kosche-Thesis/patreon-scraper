I\u0027m a novelist, a teacher, and a student. And I\u0027m the founder of Ninja Writers. In fact, in the spectrum of coolest things I\u0027ve ever been a part of, Ninja Writers is right up there with seeing my novel on the shelf at Barnes and Nobel and the library.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd let me tell you, seeing it at the library was incredible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have one guiding principle: I believe that a good story well told can change the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a favorite quote. It\u0027s from Ray Bradbury and it goes like this: Just write every day of your life. Read intensely. Then see what happens.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNinja Writers is all about building a daily writing and reading habit, then seeing what happens.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve grown from just me in February 2016 to 12,000 in January 2017. There are 8000 writers in our Facebook Group and it\u0027s growing at a rate of more than 1000 per month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s a little about how Patreon works.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThink of Patreon as Kickstarter, only instead of supporting a single project once, you\u0027re supporting a body of work and a community on an ongoing monthly basis. In return, I create things to help you write your novel and give them to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support (and even $1 a month makes a huge difference) lets me continue to work full time on this revolutionary community. It allows me to employ two Ninja Writers part time and one as a freelancer. It lets me develop ways for your stories to get out into the world. It gives me the resources to create courses and books for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut also? It supports other Ninja Writers. Because Starting in April 2017, we\u0027ll be producing a quarterly zine with stories from 10 community contributors and every time an issue is launched, those contributors share $1 for every patron who is supporting Ninja Writers at the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if there are 100 supporters, they\u0027ll earn $10 each.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there are 1000, they\u0027ll earn $100 each.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCool, right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, your monthly support makes you a patron of the Ninja Writers community as a whole, my fiction writing, \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0the Ninja Writers whose work we publish in our zine (it\u0027s called The NW.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting the artists and the creative communities you love is so important. It\u0027s how we take control of the publishing industry. It\u0027s how we revolutionize this thing. And I\u0027m so, so excited to be on this journey with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to write and create and teach and give it to you without the middle man, without constantly having to try to sell you something, without working about whether this story is commercial enough, if this book will find a publisher, if this course will sell enough spots to make it worth creating for those who it will help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s what Patreon will do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy motto for 2017 comes from that Bradbury quote. Just see what happens. It starts here. And you\u0027re here. And this is happening. Let\u0027s just see what happens.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eShaunta\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. Your support means everything in the world to me.
