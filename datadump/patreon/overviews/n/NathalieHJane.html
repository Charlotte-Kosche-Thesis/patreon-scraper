In fact, one of my reward levels gives you the opportunity to critique and give feedback on chapters of a new story I am starting, which I will describe further below. (If you aren\u0027t sure how Patreon works,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/rwvUjAv6pxg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyou can watch this video to learn more!\u003c/a\u003e)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs many of you know, I love to write dirty stories (eh, sorry, \"erotic fiction\") for fun on Wattpad and elsewhere. Right now my most popular story is \"The Teacher,\" a serial erotic romance about a depressed, anxious high school teacher in a small Texas town who finds herself caught in a very hot love triangle between a former student and his DILF rancher dad.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIRL I am a writer, editor, and a single mom to cats and humans who is finishing up her first (PG-Rated) novel. I am from the small town south, but I moved away at 18 and I now live as a happy New Yorker. I also spent many years living and working in Asia!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy Am I on Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI started a Patreon page because I really enjoy writing these stories. At the same time, I have to provide for my family, so I must be careful with my time and energy and how I spend it (in other words, I gotta make my rent every month lol!). My goal is to be able to spend more of that time and energy on writing erotic stories that are not only hot but also well written and with three dimensional characters and situations that my readers can relate to. As a writer I have learned so much about other people and cultures through my characters. I do a lot of background research to make sure I get the people and places that I write about as realistic as possible. Aside from the feedback I get from fans, this might be one of my favorite parts of writing stories.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eBecoming My Patron!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe more support I receive, the more often I can update my stories! \u003cstrong\u003eAlso, all of my patrons will have access to my Patrons Only Community on Patreon, which will include access to chapters of The Teacher and my other stuff a day before I post them on WattPad!\u003c/strong\u003e (Though, to be clear, you do NOT have to be a patron to keep reading \"The Teacher,\" it will all show up on WattPad eventually!) I will also have quizzes, post sexy photos that remind me of my characters, or that I just happen to think are hot. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons at higher levels will be even more involved in my work and my process. For example, they will get to read and comment on rough draft chapters of my next serial erotic romance, or help me name characters, decide plot points, and suggest ideas for future stories!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nALL of my patrons will receive thank you\u0027s and recognition on my WattPad page!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhat\u0027s Next?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy newest work, which I have only started outlining, is about a super nerdy grad student who is forced to move back to her tiny hometown in northern Florida for the summer and work as a cashier at the local Piggly Wiggly. Things get interesting when an old friend\u0027s annoying, redneck baby brother starts to seem somehow less annoying and more ... grown up than she remembered. He also brings out a side of her she has never experienced before, a side she finds shocking and yet very, very addictive ... meanwhile the Sheriff\u0027s Deputy has the hots for her big time, and her summer isn\u0027t at all what she expected it to be!"
