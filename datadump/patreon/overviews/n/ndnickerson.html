Your support will help me work less so I can spend more time writing new stories and new story chapters for you! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing fanfic for years, since before I knew there was even a name for it; I\u0027ve been a fan of Nancy Drew for longer than that. I\u0027ve figured something out, though. As awesome as Nancy Drew is, it\u0027s even more fun to play Carolyn Keene.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to be a writer full-time, working on Nancy Drew stories. Until an actual publishing house hires me to be Carolyn Keene, though, my writing will just be for fun, to entertain readers who love Nancy and Ned (and some of my other favorite pairings) as much as I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout fandoms:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main fandom is Nancy Drew, usually either the Mystery Stories or the Files. My OTP to end all OTPs is Nancy Drew/Ned Nickerson. Give me an intriguing Nancy Drew AU or ask about missing scenes, and I\u0027m in my element. (One of my favorite things to do is rewrite a Files plot with a lot more Nancy/Ned content.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have written in some other fandoms in the past. However, I\u0027m not up to date in all fandoms I\u0027ve ever been a part of, like \u003cem\u003eCommunity\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eJustified\u003c/em\u003e. I also find it difficult, if not impossible, to write some pairings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContributors at the $15/month pledge level can suggest/request stories outside the Nancy Drew fandom. \u003cstrong\u003eAt this time, I can only accept suggestions/requests for the following fandoms/pairings\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Chuck (TV show), Chuck Bartowski/Sarah Walker\u003cbr\u003e-Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre/Edward Rochester\u003cbr\u003e-The X-Files, Fox Mulder/Dana Scully\u003cbr\u003e-Legend of the Seeker, Richard/Kahlan*\u003cbr\u003e-Law \u0026amp; Order: Criminal Intent, Bobby Goren/Alex Eames\u003cbr\u003e-Lois \u0026amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, Lois Lane/Clark Kent\u003cbr\u003e-Perry Mason series by Erle Stanley Gardner, Perry Mason/Della Street\u003cbr\u003e-Star Trek: The Next Generation, Will Riker/Deanna Troi\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*For the record, Terry Goodkind does not approve of fanfic being written about the\u003cem\u003e Sword of Trut\u003c/em\u003eh book series. Also for the record, I have read all published books in the series and seriously, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eseriously\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e wanted Richard and Kahlan to have a lot more sex. If you are of a similar mind, I think we can work something out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout my inspiration:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy inspiration generally depends on a few different factors.\u003cbr\u003e1. Time. While I\u0027m working at both full-time and half-time jobs simultaneously, I have very little time to spend writing.\u003cbr\u003e2. Energy. If I\u0027m working over 60 hours a week, that takes a lot of energy, and I need to sleep and eat sometime.\u003cbr\u003e3. My muse. My muse will sometimes focus exclusively on one story or one set of stories. My energy is best spent on that story.\u003cbr\u003e4. Feedback. Feedback inspires me to work on and complete stories when I might not otherwise. The same thing goes for knowing that readers are specifically interested in a prompt or a story.\u003cbr\u003e5. My OTP. Nancy/Ned stories are, by far, the easiest for me to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout suggesting prompts:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing able to simply suggest prompts is super important, because:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eknowing that someone specifically wants to read a story based on that prompt encourages me to write it\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI participate in various challenges and battles throughout the year, like porn battles and bingo cards, and it\u0027s good to have a list of possible story scenarios available\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eyou\u0027ll also be able to vote for other suggested prompts, and if several people vote for the same prompt, that will be even more encouraging for me\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy a suggestion and not a request?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy muse is fickle and doesn\u0027t latch on to every prompt I read.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSometimes requested prompts include material I don\u0027t feel comfortable writing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSometimes a prompt inspires me to write something that isn\u0027t exactly what was requested.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout you:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m grateful, and humbled, that you would consider contributing to my writing this way. If you aren\u0027t able to contribute, please know that providing feedback on my stories means a lot to me too. Kudos are great; feedback is incredible; this is beyond anything I could ever imagine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you contribute, you\u0027ll be helping relieve some of the pressure on me so I can spend more time writing, which I love. I appreciate that more than I could possibly say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan patrons make a one-time pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e Pretty much.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204606215-Can-I-make-a-one-time-donation-\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAccording to the Patreon FAQ\u003c/a\u003e, you\u0027ll be charged at the beginning of each month for as long as your pledge is active, so you\u0027re only locked in for the first month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill stories be updated off Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e Yep.
