    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eWelcome to my Patreon!\u003c/h2\u003eKatie here! I\u0027m the face and costumer behind Nerd Girl Cosplay. Thanks for visiting and considering your support for what I do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, my cosplay is a small business that I hope to grow with time and support. I create costumes, provide content such as tutorials and I also make and sell custom hair accessories and plush. With your help, if you so choose, I am first and foremost grateful, but I am also looking forward to growing my business with you and your input. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: All rewards will be distributed after payments have been cleared at the beginning of each month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy should you consider supporting this Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003eEvery small business depends on the support of those around them to thrive and this is no exception. I\u0027m grateful for any kind of support you can offer me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am limited in what content I can provide to the community. I spend a large amount of my time creating on product and with the potential support of patrons, I can spend more of my time on content such as costumes, tutorials and modeling. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been working towards sustainability as a creator, but a bit of support could help bring me closer to that goal. Attending conventions, creating costumes, making product to sell, and producing tutorials and videos costs time and money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow do I do it now?! I currently make/sell hair accessories as well as fabric designs on Spoonflower. These sources of income help to ease the costs of cosplay; materials to travel and lodging. But it\u0027s still a struggle. A large part of my earned money goes back into materials to make more product.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a great community of followers via my social and I do not intend to cease or slow down my involvement there. Instead, I hope to create more content across all of my networks. Patreon will allow me to have a more personal connection and a more serious dialogue with the people who choose to invest in me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat have I done that might make you want to support me?!?\u003c/h3\u003eI have a background in fine arts and continue to teach others in that discipline. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been cosplaying since 2011. I am based out of Akron, Ohio (Home to The King, LeBron James, and me!) and attend conventions across the country, but largely those in the midwest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making costumes and started in 2004 by making historical costumes. The love of art and sculpting led me to the more inclusive hobby of cosplay. This also helped me to express my love of popular culture and all things geek. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an educator, I love helping to teach others what I already know or have struggled to figure out. This has awarded me with the opportunity to be a guest, panelist, and judge at many conventions where I offer panels on everything from cosplay positivity to armor making and costume distressing. I love chatting with other cosplayers about how we make our props and bounce ideas off of each other. I also run costume contests locally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy costumes and photographs have been featured on several websites and online magazines. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMy Costumes \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e30/Katie_Starr/BeFunky%20Collage_zpsouedgicz.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
