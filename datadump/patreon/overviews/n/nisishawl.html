We love it here, but recently had our total rent increased an astounding $750 a month! The price hikes take effect in June 2018, and are contingent on signing a year\u2019s lease. Going month-to-month would mean an increase of over $1500 per month in rent!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoving is so disruptive to a writer, because in addition to the time it takes, it means reference books, technological tools, habits, and contacts get misplaced and lost.  Moving is also extremely confusing to an 82-year-old who has lived most of her life in a small Midwestern city (Mom).  In order to keep living here and writing speculative fiction centering the presence and contributions of African-descended people, I started this Patreon in the hope of getting ongoing financial support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan is to leave the Patreon up for at least 18 months so Mom and I can figure out what to do next.\u003cbr\u003e"
