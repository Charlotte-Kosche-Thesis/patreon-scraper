    "summary": "First and foremost, THANK YOU for wanting to support singer-songwriters and independent music!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Artist\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Nate Bernardini (vocals/guitar/harmonica) and I\u2019m an American singer-songwriter based out of Berlin, Germany. For over 17 years, I\u0027ve been performing and writing songs. The goal in sharing my songs with others has always been to\u00a0encourage positive change, challenge the listener or shine light on something perhaps overlooked. Even today, I continue to create and share new music with my audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince writing my first song in 1999, I\u0027ve managed to publish original compositions on three albums: 1) Inside the Mind of Nate Bernardini 2) Bellevegas and 3) The One Day Fly. Each album required a great deal of time, communication, teamwork, networking, collaboration and commitment. For 2018, I\u0027d like to record a solo album. I\u0027ve played countless concerts in the United States, Germany and Europe and still continue to perform on a regular basis. Although I have a BA in German studies, an MA in translation, and years of experience teaching English and German as a second language, in my heart of hearts, I am a musician through and through. So I\u0027ve decided to listen to my heart for once and pursue my dream to make a humble career out of songwriting and performing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m slowly starting to get rooted in the music scene in Berlin. I\u0027ve met some talented musicians here and we started a project called \u0027Nate B. and the Hidden Keys\u0027 (\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/natebandthehiddenkeys)\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/natebandthehiddenkeys)\u003c/a\u003e. When we aren\u0027t practicing or performing, I spend a lot of time organizing gigs, performing street music, networking, writing new music and growing more online presence. My most successful project at the moment is \u0027The One Day Fly\u0027, a folk/rock/blues band made up of four members (www.theonedayfly.com). We released our debut album in June of 2017. Each song on the album are compositions I wrote on guitar, but the members were free to express themselves as they wanted during practice and in the recording studio. The free, creative expression between musicians is what I love most about collaboration; the song evolves into a shared creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter releasing the album \u0027The One Day Fly\u0027, it became clear to me that independent musicians who want to make a living creating music can no longer do so by recording and selling their art. It may be profitable for a time, but hardly sustainable, especially as a band member. Although musicians are happy to share their music with anyone wanting to listen, it\u0027s platforms like Patreon that have the potential to allow underground singer-songwriters to work full time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn other words, what you are reading here is literally my application for a job as a full-time singer-songwriter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are literally my employer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA donation of 1$ a month isn\u0027t much to give, but it helps a great deal. Once I have 1000 patrons, I\u0027ll considered myself hired.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a patron for the singer-songwriter Nate Bernardini? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, it\u2018s not because I\u2018m looking for handouts or easy money. In short, my goal is to WORK full-time as a singer-songwriter, make videos, record songs, write a blog, perform, produce albums and hopefully make enough money to get by, not rich. As a patron, you\u0027ll get exclusive access to my music and be the first to hear newly released content. I\u0027ll also keep you informed on my development as an songwriter and performer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will be the start of a beautiful relationship!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is it important to support musicians?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy choosing to financially support a musician, the community shows a demand, value and appreciation for new, original music. With there being so much free music at our fingertips these days, many local and underground musicians struggle with making enough money to even get by. Music is something we can stream for free. Venues rarely pay well (if at all), and royalties for online streaming isn\u0027t enough to even buy a week\u0027s worth of Ramen noodles (That is unless you control the global airwaves. Then you can eat whatever you want!).\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBecause of the way the music industry has changed over the years, many artists end up throwing away their dreams and potential as an artist to work a job that meets their needs. I think artists should have more options than either staying poor or going mainstream. There\u2019s clearly a demand for local songwriters to write and perform. The challenge is making a decent living off it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does art benefit the community?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen musicians are able to financially support themselves, their music is able to impact culture in a much more powerful way. Their art develops to its fullest potential because they can afford putting the time and effort into creating and performing. In sharing their art with others, people come together and, if the art is effective, it sparks conversation that can lead to change in society. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeeing that my goal is to make the world a happier place through music, by supporting my project, I can share my music with more people and make the world a bit brighter! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty cool, right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you want to work as a musician, Nate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0A music project demands a lot of work! There\u0027s always something to do; the problem is that managing and building a music project can only pay my bills if I have support from my audience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking music a career may require living off Ramen noodles for a couple years, but that\u0027s ok with me; I love Ramen noodles anyway! Nonetheless, I know that my dream can only become a reality with the support from the people who believe in me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am asking you for my dream job. I\u0027d be truly thankful if you did. As a motivated singer-songwriter and performer, I won\u0027t let you down. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace, love and all the best,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNate\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePayPal Tip Jar\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to throw some support into my PayPal Tip Jar or avoid paying Patreon fees, my PayPal account is \u003cstrong\u003enate.bernardini@gmail.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also happy to send you your rewards via e-mail if you prefer PayPal over Patreon. Just send me an e-mail and let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING ME!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
