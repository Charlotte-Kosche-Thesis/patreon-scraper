    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Noreen and I have been creating cooking tutorials on YouTube for nearly 10 years. \u00a0I have been able to take this opportunity and give people an understanding of how easy it is to cook for themselves. \u00a0I have learned a lot of things since my first video. \u00a0We have upgraded equipment. \u00a0Learned about proper lighting, learned a lot about what to do and what not to do. \u00a0I have made friendships and contacts that I never thought I would have made in a million years. \u00a0I have learned a lot about myself in the process and a lot about others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis medium is amazing. \u00a0It helps me to help others. \u00a0The truth it, this is not an easy or cheap prospect. \u00a0This all costs money. \u00a0Everything has a price, from good wholesome, ingredients to lighting to camera equipment and computers and editing software. \u00a0It all has a price.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe costs and time associated with a channel are unending and if you have never done it you have no idea. \u00a0I do not say this to garner sympathy, only to let you know that this all does not happen without a tremendous amount of time, dedication and financial input. \u00a0Some of you may say, \"but you get ad revenue on your videos\". \u00a0This is true, but only to some degree. \u00a0If I were to add up the total number of hours spent editing, uploading, maintaining and posting across all social media as well as interacting with all of my awesome subscribers, I probably make far less than minimum wage. \u00a0Everyone loves a good cooking video presentation and that takes lighting, great cameras, editing software, a computer not to mention quality ingredients and time. \u00a0So that being said, we love you all for supporting us via subscriber ship and follows on social media. \u00a0Without you NONE of this would be possible. \u00a0In order to keep moving forward and taking our channel to the next level and execute things that we have in mind for future endeavors to bring all of you, we would love it if you would consider supporting us a little further by becoming a Patron of our channel. \u00a0We do not want any of you to do this if it does not fit into your budget and we love you nonetheless because you are the foundation that keeps our channel strong. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. \u00a0My request to you is, that if you value the work I am doing and the information I share, please consider contributing in support of this channel. \u00a0It will go toward making more, amazing videos that will help everyone live a better life through better food. \u00a0Knowing how to make it, is just the first step. \u00a0Shop for it, cook it, serve it, share it. \u00a0Nourish another body and soul and nobody leaves hungry for food or for company. \u00a0In the end everyone knows they are loved and cared for. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being a supporter of this channel and having a desire to be a part of what we are building here in our kitchen!"
