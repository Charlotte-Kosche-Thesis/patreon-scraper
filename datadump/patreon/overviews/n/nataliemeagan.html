    "summary": "First of all THANK YOU for coming through for me in all ways available. You guys are the reason I get to continue doing what I love, and have the ability to branch out and try new things as well. You rock!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0026lt;big\u0026gt; \u003cem\u003e\u0026lt;big\u0026gt;A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME\u0026lt;/big\u0026gt;\u003c/em\u003e\u0026lt;/big\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\nI am Natalie Meagan and I\u0027m an artist, designer, podcast voice/producer, mental health advocate, crybaby \u0026amp; mother of 2. I started my small business venture in 2016 when I founded \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.thecrybaby.club\"\u003eThe Crybaby Club\u003c/a\u003e, an all inclusive collective intended to destigmatize sensitivity and encourage unapologetic expressing of emotion. I enjoy pastel colors, listening to podcasts, true crime, lemon flavored anything, making people laugh, \u0026amp; spaghetti. Give me all the spaghetti. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u0026lt;big\u0026gt;\u0026lt;big\u0026gt;THE CRYBABY CLUB\u0026lt;/big\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/big\u0026gt;\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI started The Club in 2016, and with the help of friends and social media, it grew into a community, brand and online store based around my idea that even though you cry, you can still get things done. As I type this, we have 22,000 followers on Instagram and it continues to grow. While some of the products in our shop were designed by other artists, most of the products are designed by me and ALL of them are paid for, ordered, packaged, and shipped by me. This is essentially a one woman show. Every purchase made, the profits go back into The Club. Aside from the obvious expenses (the products) money goes to shipping materials, fun extras to put in packages, backing cards, packing tape...you get the idea. It\u0027s a lot, but so worth it. I truly get to do what I love to do, I have met so many amazing people in the process and just, it is a dream. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0026lt;big\u0026gt;\u0026lt;big\u0026gt;VENUS ENVY\u0026lt;/big\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/big\u0026gt;\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am currently recording the first season of \n\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/venus-envy/id1362844374\"\u003eVenus Envy\u003c/a\u003e my first podcast intended to ignite and inspire a female narrative on a too often taboo topic: sex!
