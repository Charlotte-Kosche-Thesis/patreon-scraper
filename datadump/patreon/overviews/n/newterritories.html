Architecture as a discipline is on\nthe verge of a decisive moment: automation and artificial intelligence will\nbring more change to the entire practice than even the revolutionary\nintroduction of computational tools did in the last quarter of a century. This\nbrings along an entire set of questions, which \u003cem\u003eDigital Disobedience\u003c/em\u003e\nattempts to ask. The answer is not the main issue here, rather the set of\nopportunities presented in the critical interrogation of our current, and\nfuture relationships to novel ecologies emerging in society, economy and\ntechnology. How will we, as architects, respond to this rapidly progressing\nchange? Is being docile, in expectance of the best a sufficient position to\nmaintain? The collective of architects on display here refuse to be usurped by\na neoliberalist position on computational design and architecture and rather\nsupport an idea that fosters a speculative approach to the future. A position\nthat embraces change triggered by technological progress in the methods of\nmaterializing architectural entities. A future in which robots and human form\nnovel modes of machines infused with aspects of morality and inquisitive\nintelligence. A post-capitalist future that embraces the radical change in our\nsocial texture triggered by the possibilities of a world governed by\ndeterritorialized entities in which we expand, repurpose or accelerate aspect\nof our culture and technology for the benefit of our world at large. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nHow is one to digitally disobey? Would the ultimate\ndisobedience be to automate design, to automate intuition? While the profession\nwould decry the idea of automating intuition anathema, to a laymans eye such\nintuition has already been automated. Turing-complete neural networks are able\nto intuitively (a justifiable term as even their programmers do not fully\nunderstand the logic of their working) synthesise everything from Monet to\nShakespeare, creative works that would be impossible to describe with conventional\nprogramming. To a philistine, Van Gogh might appear to have been automated.\nArchFakely proves poor architectural writing has been automated in a literary\nproject that has no aspiration to be read, as no-one reads the text of the\ndata-set on which it is modelled anyway. As cultural content is generated\nfaster than we could ever consume it, and content that does make it to an\naudience is consumed instantly, do we really find pause to absorb its meaning?\nIs digital disobedience this acceleration? The the skimming of\nlatent-space in order to shift from \u201ccomputational design\u201d to the\n\u201ccomputational derive\u201d through a snowcrash of endless difference? Have machines\nalready learned to model the tastes and desires that might guide this meander?\nIs digital disobedience a reluctance to be spoonfed? A resistance to the state\nof the art? After forgetting how to code and critically engage with the\nmachines that generate their visual culture, will architects forget their own\ncanon? Will fake histories emerge, channeling popularly held belief and melting\nwhat was once thought to be immutable historical fact into a toxifying\ngenerative adversarial goo?\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is a shift from imposing our\nwill/intention on, or within, the systems of computation, to embracing the\ndissolution of the binary distinction of the intuitive and systemic. While\ncomputational design seeks to embed intuition into the self-organizing\nalgorithms of complexity theory, this is being superseded by the emergence of a\ncomputational intuition \u2013 \u2018what kind of subjectivity the heuristic bits dreams\n?\u2019 Rather than computational architecture\u2019s attempt to shift from invention to\npseudo-orchestration, this shift/glitch questions the subjective/objective\ndivision established between architect its technological matrix.
