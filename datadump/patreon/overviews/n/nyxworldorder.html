    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/h2\u003eHi! I am Umay and I like writing a lot. In my blog \u003cem\u003eFantasyland of a Dreamy Girl \u003c/em\u003eI often write about video games, writing, music and everything I can be a nerd about. Sometimes I write about politics, especally LGBTIA+ issues.\u00a0 I sometimes venture into fiction with short stories too. I am trying to make readers aware of niche media, making them think about ideas behind creation of works, informing them about serious issues. And at this stage, I am experimental on both my writing style and topics I cover. My blog is \u003ca href=\"https://nyxworldorder.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I am on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eI wrote with great joy until I started high school, I even set myself to be an professional author. Later however, my parents convinced me of having a \"real job\" like engineering was more important, which no doubt it is in a way, sadly. But my passion to write never went away, when I started my blog in September 2017, I quickly realized I wanted it to be much more than a mere hobby. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd Patreon gives a me chance to make writing become my \"main thing\". With enough support, I can focus on writing more without worrying about searching other jobs. Maybe one day, I can even have grand projects like a novel, one can only hope.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat You Will Get On Return?\u003c/h2\u003eFor your contrubitions you will gain the rewards you can see on the right side. For an example of 5$ reward, you can visit \u003ca href=\"https://nyxworldorder.wordpress.com/2018/04/07/why-do-i-write-reviewsretrospectives/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am doing my best to stick to a two-tree articles a week, except when I am writing a really long one. You will be fully aware of my working schedule and any possible delays. If delays do arise, I will do my best to make up for them. You can of course, withdraw your money any time you desire, and you can always talk about me about any issues that may arise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, when I undertake some rather grand projects, you will be rewarded appopriately as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThank You!\u003c/h2\u003eThank you so much for reading this! You are extra awesome if you decide to donate, take care and don\u0027t forget that my blog will be always freely avaible."
