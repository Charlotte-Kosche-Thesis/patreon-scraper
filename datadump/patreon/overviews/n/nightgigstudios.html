    "summary": "Welcome to The NightGig Studios Patreon page, For years, NightGig Studios has focused on podcasts promoting graphic arts: webcomics and the artists who make them. There\u2019s always been music in there, too. \u00a0 \u00a0We\u2019re not giving up on the webcomic side of it, we\u2019re just branching out with this new video project, focusing on music\u2026 and the artists who make it.\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a funding platform, kind of like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, but with an important difference. Instead of TONNES of money for one project, it\u2019s just a bit of money for lots of things, all the time. It\u2019s like an ongoing Kickstarter where you can pledge an amount - that you specify - every time we release a new show.\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re NOT charging for content and never will. This will always be free. Always.\nWe\u2019re just asking for a little help so that we can make the best shows we can. \n\nWhat you do is go up there to the left, to the box, and fill in whatever the amount you want to pledge, then click \u201cBecome a patron\u201d.\nYou can also set a maximum, in case you\u2019re worried about paying too much in one month. \u00a0Trust me, we know how it is when money is tight!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou might be asking \u201cHow many shows are you going to do?\u201d, so you can figure out how much you want to pledge and how much your maximum will be. \nAt the moment, we\u2019re planning on starting with one show per week, but plan on upping it to two. \nWe\u2019re also planning doing \u201cNightgig Studios: On Tour\u201d, where we go out to people\u2019s gigs and stream their shows to you. We just recently did this with three shows from the \u201cUncle Elvis and The Flea Bitten Dawgs Go South\u201d tour.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat\u2019s great about Patreon is that, once you become a patron, changing your pledge is quick and easy, so, if and when we do go to two per week, you can adjust if you need to. \u003cbr\u003eWhat we\u2019re hoping is that, with your help, we\u2019ll be able to constantly improve the quality of the shows, with better sound equipment, better cameras, higher bandwidth for the streams, and a budget that will - hopefully - eventually allow us to pay the acts that come through and perform on our stage.\u003cbr\u003e\n \nNightgGig Studios whole mantra is \u201cMaking your Night Gig your Day Gig\u201d. What this means is that we want to help musicians, artists and other creative people to actually make a living doing what they love to do and are good at. \nWith your help, we should be able to do this\u2026 while also allowing us to do what WE love\u2026 which is this.\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking us out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJT Shea"
