NTF has been in the making since early 2014 and has expanded into being our biggest project thus far. We are hoping to bring this project to life soon, but as of right now we are still in the development stage. Despite that, we want to share our development process with you, and together we can bring this comic to fruition. Whether you are a long time follower or stumbled upon our work by accident, we are excited to share our expansive world with you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003eAbout Na Tso Fairytale:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nThe world of Na Tso is governed by a mighty court of thirteen Celestial Gods, each leading their own household of major and minor Gods beneath them. The Celestial Court maintains order among the stars, but even so they often do not get along with each other. When the prospect of war threatens the heavens, one God - an advocate of peace - suggests they find a place of \"common ground.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey search the heavens for a suitable place where all Gods are equal, and eventually they find a desolate planet just outside of the Court\u0027s jurisdiction. It was pitiful, lonely, and barren, but in the eyes of the Gods it was perfect. It became a symbol of hope, peace, and equality, for each of the Celestial Gods contributed something of themselves into this tiny planet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey dubbed this planet Na Tso, meaning \"common ground\" in the tongue of the ancient astral spirits. However, an era of peace can only last but so long... What once was a symbol of hope becomes a symbol of betrayal in the eyes of another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNa Tso Fairytale is a collection of stories that document the many perspectives of Na Tso\u0027s creation. It follows the deceived, the honored, the betrayed, and everyone in between as the Earthling creatures try to discover the hidden truths behind their world\u0027s creation. It follows the death of Gods and the birth of magic. Na Tso is on the pinnacle of discovery and change, and we want to share all of its secrets with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003eAbout the Artists:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCashew:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/_cataxa\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cataxa.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cashewdee.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantART\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTinny:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/tinnypants/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tinnypants.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tinnypants.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantART\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003eCashew and Tinny are best friends and near polar opposites as artists. Individually, they\u0027ve created a wide variety of characters and stories, but could never stick to one for one reason or another. They each have their strengths and weaknesses as artists, but together they make up for what the other person lacks. Together, they decided to sit down and create something from the ground up - something they could focus their collective creativity on to make something great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlas, another thing they share in common is a responsibility to make ends meet offline. Working on personal projects is put on the back burner in favor of freelancing or working long hours just to pay the bills. This Patreon serves as a means to share what we can with the world and maybe one day make a living doing what we love.
