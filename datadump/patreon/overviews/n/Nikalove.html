    "summary": "My loves, so many of you have been asking for so long for me to share more of myself with you. More writing, more of my story, more of my life. There have been requests for me to write a book. To create more, to make my creations more widely available. So here we are. This is where I get to create content that only gets shared with you here. Where I get the support to write the book, share it with you as we go along, and then publish it. This is where you get insider access to me and my creations. And the more support, the more I am freed up from survival worries to simply create and share with you. Not only my writing, but my photography, my nature based and inspired crafts, jewelry, salves, tinctures, whatever creative witchery we can dream up together, and maybe, if I you get very very lucky, some video and livestreaming, and e-courses. This is where you get to support me to step into being a dedicated artist, and teacher, not just when I have the time and energy around my many jobs. And best of all, I get to share it with you. And, as my Patrons, you get to not only support me in what I am doing, you get to help co create what your experience here is. The more support, the more time and energy I have to create. Goodness knows I have at least three books floating around in my head and endless crafts. \u003cbr\u003eYou asked for this. And I listened. XOXO\u003cbr\u003eI am Nika, a dynamic and witchy wild woman who hails from Sonoma County Ca. I am a full time single mama, doing it all. And I mean, doing it all. I am a sustainable farmer both animals and plants, I do regenerative permaculture design, project management, intuitive counseling, house remodels, I even helped build a custom tiny home for and with a friend and client, this year. I am a prolific writer and photographer, I make jewelry, and crafts, from creating beautiful candle holders with bits of nature, to felted creatures, knitting, making altars, wands, and just generally creating beauty. I model for both alternative runway shows and photography and for artists. I make tinctures, and salves, and fermented foods, and all sorts of homemade kitchen goodness, I share recipes, and methods, and helpful hints. I can teach you how to do pretty much anything I do. I talk about intimacy and pleasure and how to have more of both of these things in an ethical and caring way. I talk about relationship dynamics, and poly culture, and sometimes, if you are lucky, allll the innuendo. ;) Basically, I do all the things, and I do them full blown, with heart and soul and sensitivity, joy, playfulness, magic, and a healthy dose of sarcasm and naughtiness. \u00a0And I want to be able to create more, all the time, and share it with you. Really I created this page for all of my amazing people who have been asking me how to pre buy my as yet unwritten books, or crafts, or what have you. So here it is.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love you. \u003cbr\u003eAnd I am so grateful for you. \u003cbr\u003eYou know this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNika"
