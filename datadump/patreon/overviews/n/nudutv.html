    "summary": "Welcome to the New Dumont Television Network (The NuDu-TV)\u00a0Patreon page.  We at NuDu-TV are recapturing the spirit and excitement of independent, entrepreneurial television:\u00a0The willingness to take chances on new and unproven talent.  To show off community events that volunteers work tireless hours to produce.  To help tell the stories that need a voice.  This is only part of NuDu-TV.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe original Dumont Television Network formed in 1946 by Allen B. DuMont and was known for its service to independent programming.  It gave a group of soon to be stars a chance to get their face and story in front of viewers.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"DuMont had its honorable place in television history,\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit went boldly where others would not...\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cem\u003eIt should not be so, because DuMont was as bold a\u003cbr\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprogram service as television would have.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R.D.

While NuDu-TV rents the frequency and bandwidth from KUGB, we are completely independent and not influenced by the owners of the station.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNuDu-TV is not limited to merely broadcasting over-the-air. The channel\u0027s business model already disrupts the traditional television model by broadcasting over various streaming channels such as Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Google Chromecast and Facebook Live. Plus, we\u0027ve developed our very own iOS and Android apps for watching on the go at any time of the day or night. As more and more viewers \"cut the cord\u0027 by discontinuing expensive cable television subscriptions, NuDu-TV already has an edge utilizing 21st Century technology and adapting to 21st Century viewer preferences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNuDu-TV currently self-produces seven independent programs. Our goal is to add an additional four programs in 2018. Our programs showcase diverse talent in Houston--the nation\u0027s most diverse city as noted in professor Steven L. Klineberg\u0027s Rice University Kinder Institute of Urban Research demographics study. NuDu-TV is committed to showcasing diversity in all its bright colors and vibrant cultures. We\u0027re merely getting started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of our programs showcases Crime Stoppers of Houston, a non-profit organization that informs the community about crime prevention and awareness. Another program in development features an up-and coming talent in women\u0027s professional golf. Another program features a woman-owned small business and her team\u0027s adventures performing a very unique job around the Houston metropolitan area.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom under-appreciated and ignored sports teams to independent content producers, NuDu-TV works hard to provide original content that fills the void left by network affiliates.\u00a0NuDu-TV has found that communities want to see independent programming and are eager to support it as long as the production values are professional quality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNuDu-TV provides community focused television wth professional production values. The five team members creating NuDu-TV have a combined experience of more than 125 years of television production, including sports, entertainment and news experience with ESPN, Fox Sports, NBC News in New York and a variety of Houston\u0027s affiliates. Add our hired crew members to that mix and the years of experiences greatly multiplies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well, NuDu-TV teams with area colleges and universities as a production lab to provide real-world production experience to student interns. We\u0027re not talking about getting coffee or merely hanging around to observe. Our NuDu Crew all have been there and done that. We know it\u0027s not the best way to learn--or to teach. NuDu-TV\u0027s interns actually work with professional crew members to perform hands-on duties like camera operation, technical direction, audio, character generator and other positions of live television production. Student interns earn real world production credits that help them build a solid resume prior to graduation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNuDu-TV sells a small number of commercial advertisements, but it\u0027s not enough. We pledge this to the Patreon community: for every $10,000 per month that you, the audience, pledge through this Patreon page, NuDu-TV will decrease 10% of the total advertisements per month. Certainly, $10,000 is more than the average video earns in revenue.\u00a0 NuDu-TV will continue to search for corporate sponsorships to cover the larger portion of production expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the reward--completely viewer supported, ad-free indie content all without receiving one penny of government grants. That\u0027s disruptive!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe a part of disrupting television as its become. Be a part of returning to the pioneering grass-roots, community focused values that television used to be. Become a member of the NuDu Crew!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
