    "summary": "I am a professional research mathematician who is also an award winning educator, and create videos to enable people to learn and appreciate mathematics widely, and to lay out understandings and directions that will move the subject forward into the new millenium. And I am currently laying out a new framework for Calculus with a fully online course which is open to Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\u00a0YouTube channel is \u003cem\u003eInsights into Mathematics\u003c/em\u003e. My videos are designed to explain a wide variety of mathematics simply and elegantly, from elementary subjects through to research level topics. They include introductions to Rational Trigonometry (my own discovery!), Universal Hyperbolic Geometry, Maths Education K-6, and Linear Algebra, as well as courses on Algebraic Topology, Differential Geometry and the History of Mathematics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe MathFoundations series is particularly important to reposition modern mathematics. This series not only exposes many logical weaknesses in our current thinking, but also builds up a viable alternative mathematics which is more solid and has numerous computational and aesthetic advantages. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe new course Algebraic Calculus One, which will have major repercussions for mathematics education, has now started in 2018 on the openlearning online platform. Established patrons (who have contributed a total of $20) will be invited to join this course, which will contain 12 Chapters of 4 Modules each with Notes, Worked Problems and Homework Questions. This is an exciting development which I invite you to contribute to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you become a Patron, you choose what level of support you would like to give per video: I will generally publish one video a week. You are able to cap the amount of support per month. Patrons will have preview access to my videos before ads are introduced, and will know they are contributing to a new direction for mathematics. Your support with also help me to continue creating high quality videos \nthat explain a wide variety of interesting mathematics, face up to the \nlogical problems of pure mathematics, and slowly build up a solid \nlogical framework for the entire subject---accessible to a wide range of\n people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
