    "summary": "July 23rd 2017: Pledgers: we have just posted a lot of content as \"free\" videos - don\u0027t worry, you will only pay for videos marked as \"pay\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Nick May - I am a Brit living in Japan - in Fukuoka. (How do you pronounce Fukuoka? V-e-r-y carefully...) Fukuoka is in Kyushu, the big island at the bottom.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/XHp4RKy6kA42\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGoogle Maps\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been here 25 years. I run a small\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://catnip.or.jp\"\u003eTNR, Rescue and Rehoming\u003c/a\u003e charity\u00a0for cats and - at some point - dogs. We did 6 trips down to Kumamoto in the recent earthquakes, taking food and supplies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFukuoka and surrounding cities have a large number of feral or street cats. Every year a vast number of kittens are born - and every year they die, killed by cars, trucks or crows. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat is - ah - non-optimal...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I am doing something about it - and with your help, I can do a lot more!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe rescue animals that we can rehome and we \u003cstrong\u003eT\u003c/strong\u003erap, \u003cstrong\u003eN\u003c/strong\u003eeuter/spay and \u003cstrong\u003eR\u003c/strong\u003eeplace those that are too feral. (Do a google search on \"TNR\" for more info on this, or see the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap-neuter-return\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWikipedia\u003c/a\u003e article.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n What we do is TNRM - it is important that animals we release will be \"maintained\" by people who will feed them and look out for them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe life of a female street cat is one of continual pregnancies followed by death. Few if any of her kittens will survive. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo we focus on the female cats and the kittens as our first priority, plus any injured animals. Neutering a female street cat is the kindest thing you can do for her. Usually she is too feral to rehome, so the next best thing is to return her to her patch and feed her.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut we do males too - when we trap males they often have wounds from fighting. (I won\u0027t post images of these wounds as I don\u0027t like misery-porn - but some of them are quite severe.) Spayed males fight less, and spray less - which means they live longer, have fewer injuries and makes them more acceptable as \"community cats\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2017 my target is to Trap, Neuter \u0026amp; Return 50 animals. I am going to document that here. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach video I post will - ideally - document the capture and the return of a single cat. So I have set pledges up on a per video - and hence per animal - basis. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nApologies in advance - is sometimes isn\u0027t possible to document the capture - and the release videos may be quite short. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe currently work at 3 main sites, and at some sites it is best that we keep a lowish profile. (Which, being a foreigner, can be tricky.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Also, trapping and releasing tends to take place after dark, at feeding time - which doesn\u0027t make for great videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn same cases the cat-maintainers will do the actual capture as the cats knows them. In others we will hand the cat over after neutering and recuperation, to be released after dark by the maintainers. (Most of our sites are a 1 hour drive from my home.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope to post up to 4 videos (animals) / month - \u00a0about 50 animals for the year. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut that is a target, not a commitment. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI can\u0027t absolutely guarantee that in any particular month we will handle any particular number of animals. We may post more than 4 videos a month - but some will be \"free content\" \u00a0- \u00a0we definitely \u003cstrong\u003ewon\u0027t post more than 4 \"paid\" videos in a month\u003c/strong\u003e - although we may hold some videos over to the next month.\u00a0[I believe you can limit your maximum payout / month - feel free to do that.]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaid videos will all become public 60 days after they are posted - so the perk is really \"early access\" to them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are on our \"Cat\u0027s Whiskers\" tier, you will be able to access some \"behind the scenes\" content. In this month\u0027s, July - I talk about bringing an additional room of our main building (which is an old Japanese barn made of earth, bamboo and wood) into operation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI shall try and throw in a bit of info about the local situation, and Japan generally. The videos will\u00a0be shortish (a few minutes probably - we will see how that goes), and probably won\u0027t be of the greatest quality - so don\u0027t expect Hollywood production values. But any money I receive in pledges will go straight into the TNR project. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(\u003cstrong\u003eNote\u003c/strong\u003e that we shall also post a brief video to YouTube and FaceBook for each cat as part of documenting what we do. \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon videos will be longer and more informative.\u003c/strong\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe will think up some additional tiers as we go along - let me know what you would like to see...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf this isn\u0027t for you, thanks for reading this far! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf it is, please make a pledge now! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRemember: \u00a0the \u003cstrong\u003epledge is per video\u003c/strong\u003e, and it is \u003cstrong\u003erecurring, monthly\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0So if you pledge a dollar a video, you could be charged +up to+ 4 dollars/month if we do 4 cats/videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf we do no videos the following month, you won\u0027t be charged for that month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome final thoughts:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are thinking \"I am not a cat person\" - well, frankly - neither am I.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI like cats, I have several - but I am not doing this out of an excess of gooey sentimentality. I just think that as far as possible animals - all animals - should have a decent life, free from pain.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI treat each site I work at as a \"project\", and deal with a local person who knows the area and its animals. We do a lot of information and education work to explain to the local community what we are doing, and how it will benefit not just the cats, but local people too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRehoming is HARD in this part of Japan - (\u003ca href=\"https://catnip.or.jpt/en/rehoming/rehomed-new/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere are some animals we have rehomed\u003c/a\u003e). I have been doing TNR since late September 2016 - we took a couple of months off in January and February 2017. You can see the animals we have done to date, here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://catnip.or.jp/en/tnr/returned_cats/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTNR\u0027d Cats\u003c/a\u003e. I am committed to it because there is a pressing need here, and in terms of \"bang for buck\" in animal welfare, it delivers a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe more pledges I get, the more expansive the videos are likely to be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am committed to being as open about what we are doing as I possibly can be. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQuestions? Let me know.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*\u003cem\u003eI have been asked how someone from Fukuoka is referred to. \u003cbr\u003e\nWell, obviously, just as someone from London is known as a \"Londoner\", and someone from New York is known as a \"New Yorker\", someone from Fukuoka is known as a Fukuokan.\u003c/em\u003e"
