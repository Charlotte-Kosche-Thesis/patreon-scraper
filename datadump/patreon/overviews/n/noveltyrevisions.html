I\u0027m not here to teach you basic writing techniques, tell you repeatedly how to start writing a book or show you how to succeed in self-publishing. Based on my philosophies and experiences as a long-time writer and creative human, Novelty offers both actionable advice and much-needed tough love for writers who are already committed to putting their ideas into words. Writing is a commitment. You\u0027ll learn how to combine and apply old and new skills to make writing happen using techniques that work for you - whether you\u0027re just getting started or you\u0027re already far down the road to publishing success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNovelty is for any kind of writer or creator - from novelists to future TV show creators to aspiring journalists and freelance writers. You have ideas. It\u0027s time to sit down, unplug, and start putting those ideas into words.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWho is Meg Dowell?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHello! Hi! I\u0027m a professional writer and editor and an aspiring internet creator. I\u0027m just here to help people act on their creative impulses. I\u0027ve never been the kind of person to sit around and wait for inspiration to strike. I\u0027m always creating something, which is why I rebranded my blog and officially launched Novelty in March of 2015. I\u0027m part of the generation everyone assumes is lazy and entitled (and maybe for some, the stereotypes are true). Creativity and laziness don\u0027t mix. If you want to be a writer, you have to put in the effort and make something out of your ideas. That\u0027s what I\u0027m here to do - help you help yourself figure out how to create your own success.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWhy Novelty needs your support\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started a blog in 2009 because Meg Cabot had a blog. I wanted to be a writer, just like Meg Cabot. So I started blogging.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt took six years to develop that blog into something that had a \"real\" audience - people outside my very small circle of friends and family who might read what I had to say.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI didn\u0027t know it then, but starting a blog about writing would eventually help launch my career. If it weren\u0027t for that experience, I wouldn\u0027t be able to do what I do now - help creators put their ideas into words.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNovelty Revisions has doubled in subscribers this year - which means it\u0027s time to step it up and do more for everyone who has come to know and love what I do daily for my audience. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I\u0027ve discovered over the past few months, though, is that it\u0027s taking a lot of time to write great content, respond to comments and plan new things like free ebooks, a writing mentorship program and new site design to make it easier for people to find what they\u0027re looking for.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have always said I do not want to do any kind of advertising on Novelty Revisions. My goal is to help new and aspiring writers. Placing ads on my blog and doing affiliate marketing would take away from that mission. These kinds of things work for some blogs, but not this one. I\u0027m not here to sell you things. However, to spend even 10 hours or more on the blog per week right now isn\u0027t feasible unless I have a little bit more financial stability. That\u0027s where you come in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eHow your support will help\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhether you are a long-time reader, you\u0027ve just joined the community or you just want to support what I\u0027m doing to help writers and creatives around the world, I hope you will consider giving a monthly donation to Novelty Revisions and all associated projects. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor as little as $1 a month, you can become a Novelty Revisions patron and gain access to some awesome perks. As a result, I\u0027ll be able to dedicate more time to bringing you more awesome things on the blog, including:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e7+ posts per week,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA weekly episode of the Brain Rush podcast (currently on hiatus due to time constraints)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVideos, videos, videos,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFree ebooks to help you level up your writing career,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA writing mentorship program that pairs new writers with those more experienced in the industry,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIndependent writing courses to help you build and maintain an online presence as a writer,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd more, based on feedback and suggestions from active patrons.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI practice what I preach. The same way I\u0027m always telling my readers to set and work toward their goals, I have in mind a few goals for Novelty Revisions in 2017 - goals your support will help to achieve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$100 of monthly support\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0exclusively from Novelty Revisions patrons by the end of the year will guarantee that I can continue to publish posts daily through the end of 2017. This will allow me to spend more time developing content that will help you achieve your writing goals and keep you motivated to excel. Also, as you might already know, I\u0027m terrible at responding to comments in a timely manner. That will no longer be a problem once we hit this milestone.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$500 of monthly support \u003c/strong\u003ewill allow me to dedicate more time to developing new projects under the Novelty Revisions brand - books, podcasts, courses, you name it. No, really. Becoming a patron also allows you to ask questions and \u003cstrong\u003esuggest new things you want me to develop on your behalf\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1,000 of monthly support \u003c/strong\u003emeans I can start developing new blogs under the Novelty Revisions brand, specifically focused on teaching freelance writers, bloggers and journalists how to write under more specific disciplines (e.g., health, science, psychology).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery small amount makes a huge difference. Your support, and the perks you\u0027ll get along the way, will enrich your writing experience and help inspire you to keep creating awesome things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eSo what are these perks I speak of?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy becoming\u00a0a Novelty Revisions patron, \n\u003c/strong\u003eregardless of how much you give,\u00a0you will be eligible to apply for a spot in my writing mentorship pilot program (which will be free to all pilot participants) when it becomes available later in the year. You will be able to give feedback on the pilot program as I continue to develop it before its official launch. All patrons who do not get the chance to participate in the pilot program will receive a discount on the full package when it\u0027s available. You\u0027ll also have access to a private Facebook group to discuss all things writing and creative.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll basic content on Novelty Revisions will always be free. I will never make a reader pay to view a post, watch a video or listen to a podcast episode. This is only possible with the support of our patrons. It\u0027s because of you that more creators can learn the necessary strategies to make their dreams come true.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
