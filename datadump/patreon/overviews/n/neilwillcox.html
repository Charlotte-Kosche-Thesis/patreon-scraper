Each one will in theory stand alone (except parts 9 and 10 which are a two-parter) though jumping in at part 13 will require you to get up to speed pretty quickly. In addition every month there will be some background notes on various aspects of the Deep Patrol and life in space in the wake of the Wavefront.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently I have first drafts of \u003cdel\u003ethe first 10\u003c/del\u003e all the episodes so it will run all the way to the end.
