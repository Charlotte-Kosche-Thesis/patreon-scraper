Things became more challenging when I had a child. As I struggled to advocate for my baby, who had birth complications and has FPIES and food allergies, I met other families of color with similar concerns as my own. What began as a small group of about 10 parents of color has now become an organization of nearly 400 families.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am committed to spoiling the children of color, lgbtq children, disabled children, lower income children, immigrant children, and every other child who has been overlooked by Boulder\u0027s white-normative culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bit about current and past projects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMonthly Parent Education Series:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBPiD hosts a speaker each month to educate us about identity, parenting, and community.

I am working in partnership with local health equity and outdoor sports organizations to make sure all kids of all abilities and income levels have equal access to sports equipment and the opportunity and encouragement to safely enjoy these activities\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFamily Leadership Training Institute:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI\u0027ve just completed a 20 week civic training course and have learned the skills to take community needs to local and state government in order to enact policy change.

The opportunity to attend this course was made possible to me because somebody paid for my childcare. In recognizing that systemic barrier, they helped make a leader out of me. I want to be sure I do the same and make it possible for at least one other woman of color to successfully complete this training and serve on a local board or commission.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHealth Equity:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBPiD has connected with several city, county, and state leaders who are concerned about health equity, particularly with regard to maternal health and mental health.

BPiD has become a resource for these women. In 2017, we raised over $600 to get women out of unsafe living conditions and into transitional housing. We cook, offer childcare, help find jobs and more. I hope we can continue to support those who won\u0027t reach out to our local institutions but do need assistance.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet Mamas Rest:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI help connect Black, Latina, and Native mothers to no-cost body care treatments such as massage, acupuncture, rolfing, etc. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Culture Shift:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy grandparents experienced colonization, forced famine, and then partition and refugee camps. They were later shamed for their beliefs when they immigrated to the US. My mother was harassed for her clothing and accent. She was told by western doctors to run on a treadmill instead of do yoga. Then I moved to Boulder where white yoga studio owners have the audacity to try to charge me $17 a class to teach me about the very things their whiteness stripped from my people. Our Indigenous community is treated with even greater disregard on a daily basis. We have seen professional Boulder area psychotherapists dress in black face. We have seen business owners make ableist and sexist jokes. BPiD has tackled and made significant progress in taking down the love and light brigade. Sometimes with some harsh words and sometimes with steady hands, but prejudice, either covert or overt has never once gone unchecked. We have discussions about anti-blackness and anti-indigineity with each other, city council members, other parenting groups, big name business owners, and everyone in between. Things have gotten better over the past few years, and BPiD has done significant work to this end.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need your support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not trying to give myself a salary.

Just $1 a month has a significant impact, especially if you share or tweet and ask 10 other friends to also pledge $1 a month. There are other levels of support, and you can choose whatever feels good for you.
