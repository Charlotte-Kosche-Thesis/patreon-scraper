As you may know (or perhaps not) I have small YouTube channel where I post silly videos relating to video game criticism and stupid jokes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat you may not know is who I am, why I do what I do, or what the purpose of this Patreon campaign is, so let\u0027s talk about that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWho I is?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eEven as a young lad growing up in rural Wisconsin I knew that this hobby of mine called gaming was something much more than just a pastime; that games can convey meaning and express ideas and emotion in a way that no other medium can. And because of this, I believe that video games have the potential to become the most important artistic medium of all time. More important than film! More important than the novel! And yes, even more important than interpretive dance!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the past 10 years I\u0027ve been dabbling in video game criticism, journalism, and freelance writing and in that time I\u0027ve also worked construction, run an eBay shop, studied philosophy and math to obtained a degree, and even worked as a manager at Best Buy, yet the one thing that has fulfilled me the most has been my love for analyzing, collecting, and playing games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd now I want to share that love with the world.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYears ago when I first started working in the industry semi-professionally, I noticed that most of what we call \"game criticism\" is little more than product review and headline regurgitation...and I think that sucks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s certainly a place for this type of content and there\u0027s obviously some overlap, but criticism is more about breaking a piece of art down, placing it within a contextual frame, and determining what works, what doesn\u0027t, how it could be improved, or how it compares to similar works.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCriticism is subjective, opinionated, and opens up a dialogue between author and reader (or in this case, YouTuber and Viewer) which advances the medium forward by changing and challenging how we think about games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThis is what I aim to do.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eMy Content and Release Schedule\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m trying something a little different this year that I think is pretty cool. Rather than grind to make topical, clickbaity, videos to appease the YouTube gods and drive traffic and views, I\u0027m going to focus on the videos that I want to make--YouTube gods be damned!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m going to focus on creating entire seasons of content prior to release so that once these videos are finished I can release them with a set schedule. On YouTube this will be once a week: Saturday at 8pm CST and these will be released ad-free.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce these videos start rolling out I\u0027ll then have however many weeks to work on the next season of content so that by the time the final video of the current season rolls out I should be nearing the end of production on the following season, so there won\u0027t be much downtime in between (and possibly none at all!). At least, that\u0027s the plan--we\u0027ll see how well that actually works out. :D\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy doing it this way I can also give the greatest reward of all to my Patrons by giving them access to the entire season as soon as the first video launches on YouTube. That way, those who can and want to support me have the option of binge watching my content or just watching it at their own pace.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been leery of crowdfunding over the years, but there\u0027s no denying that Patreon has become a revolutionary way for creators to see a return on invested time, energy, and finances (even if it\u0027s only a small one).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd with the continually changing rules of YouTube, the abundance of sponsorship deals, and Adpocalypse ver. x.0 looming overhead, tools like Patreon have become more important than ever.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd, if you\u0027ll allow me to be blunt for a moment, I believe that ads and sponsorship deals--no matter how unobtrusive they may or may not be--only dilute the creator\u0027s message and devalue their content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd I want no part of that.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, as of this Patreon\u0027s launch I will no longer be running ads on any of my videos, nor will I EVER accept a sponsorship deal--so don\u0027t expect to see me rip into a game one minute and then suddenly start hocking Dollar Shave Club or Blue Apron. No siree, not for me!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThere are no chains around this neck.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve always held myself to the same standards I hold all other artists to; especially those in the video game industry. As such, I think the best way to go about this Patreon thing is with a single, $1 monthly reward tier with the same bonuses available to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPledge as much or as little as you\u0027d like: everyone gets everything.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want people to fund me because they \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to fund me, not because they feel coerced or guilty for watching my content for free. So rather than having multiple reward tiers that gate off content, I\u0027ll leave it up to you as to how much or how little you feel like supporting me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd if you can\u0027t afford a buck a month or simply don\u0027t want to support my unpopular opinions, I completely understand; no hard feelings. Same goes if you\u0027re already a patron and no longer able to pledge. Totally get it. There are plenty of creators I\u0027d love to support as well, but simply can\u0027t afford to; that\u0027s just the way it goes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat said, I do want to provide a little extra something for those who are generous enough to support my shenanigans, so here\u0027s what I can offer in a way that won\u0027t impact the production of other videos:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAccess to each season of my content the instant it goes live in one binge-able chunk\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eA monthly short, unscripted, video of me discussing 3-5 games I recommend playing\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eA quarterly Patron-only Q\u0026amp;A video (in addition to the yearly Q\u0026amp;A)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eBloopers and behind the scenes stuff whenever I have something worth showing\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eYour name in the credits/thank you section of every video, with the top five contributors receiving a verbal shout out from yours truly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWhat\u0027s this money funding exactly?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDisclosure is important to me so I won\u0027t hide the amount pledged each month, nor the fact that I will be using some of this money to pay personal bills and expenses as well as improving the production value and quality of my content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will also not hide the fact I plan on releasing my videos on platforms other than YouTube, such as Amazon Prime.
