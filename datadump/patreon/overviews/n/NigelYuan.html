    "summary": "Hello there, my name is Nigel, I come from China and this is the first time I go out of my safe circle and experience different culture. I enjoy writing stories, when I was a kid, I always had a vivid imagination. I used to describe a fantasy world to my friends, give them some characters to join in, and experience some epic adventure with them (When I entered collage I started to realize we were playing something quite alike D\u0026amp;D back then, who knows~). I was try to write them down, but I realized none of them were actually finish. Partly because I didn\u0027t want them to so my friends and I can enjoy more form our \"epic adventure\". I started writing my first long stories when I was in collage. It took me a year to finish, and when I read it, wow... no wonder many people think the first edition is awful. I began to practice my writing skill by writing fan fiction of My Little Pony, and this is what I\u0027m doing now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve written some short fan fiction of My Little Pony since 2014, my story blog is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blog.sina.com.cn/u/3214317921\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e (It\u0027s a Chinese blog). For me, writing story about this world was first considered practicing, but I become more and more enjoy creating this world. Just think of that, eating ice cream with your best pony friend in one of the most popular ice cream shop in Canterlot, wow, soooo relaxing~~ :) so yeah, I wrote lots of fan fiction about My Little Pony, and I\u0027d like to share it with you. Let\u0027s spread the magic of friendship!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, my English skill is still at\u00a0apprentice level, writing in English can be a little bit difficult to me. I was translated two of my stories in English,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category\u0026amp;user=194523\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, and it wasn\u0027t turned out very well. No worry! I will try my best to level up that, how hard can English be, ahahaha~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... yeah, this is pretty much everything in my mind right now. In short, I enjoy the feeling of creating a whole new world under my nib, and share it with others. If you can enjoy them the way I did, weee! I\u0027ll be very happy~\u00a0You have no idea just how much your support means to me. Thank you so much~\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u6211\u4f1a\u52aa\u529b\u7684~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, almost forgot. My stories will not only be fan fiction. I\u0027m planning finishing my very first long story and publish it. I\u0027m working on a website to publish my first draft, it is Chinese too, but... well, it still a great story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, I was planning writing a short story for this introduction part, that will be so cool. Imagine that: In a dark storming night, everyone was in their home, their window was closed,\u00a0board\u00a0Reinforced, but they could still feel the freezing wind.\u00a0The dim light of the streetlight\u00a0illuminates one little girl, she was struggling trough the street, looking at the number beside each door. Nobody knew who she was, she was not from around there, and with a dark hood covered her head, it was rather difficult to tell her face. However, one thing was very clear, she had some kind of tattoo on her neck, it looked like a\u00a0crescent, but it was scarlet...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyeah... probably should do this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(The screen on my laptop was created by \u003ca href=\"http://the-wizard-of-art.deviantart.com/\"\u003eThe-Wizard-of-Art\u003c/a\u003e, link:\u003ca href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/art/Manehattan-Blues-611526678\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e )\u003cbr\u003e"
