And while I\u0027m not the biggest, when someone does request something, I\u0027ll do it. (Within reason, of course.) Because my channel isn\u0027t for me; it\u0027s for you. Make a request for a Game to play, or a video to React to, or even a show/movie to analyse, and I will do it. Because I love you, all of you. Even if you aren\u0027t a patron, I\u0027ll take all suggestions under consideration."
