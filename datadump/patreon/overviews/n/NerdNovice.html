Jim and Megan have been hosting the show for over 1.5 years, talking about their favorite television shows, movies, and books--and entertaining you along the way. The tiny glimmer of hope that we will one day feel worthy of the title of \u201cNerd\u201d is what keeps us on this path of righteousness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can listen to our podcast here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nerdnovice.com/episodes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enerdnovice.com/episodes\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNerd Novice has always been solely produced by us, recorded by us, and promoted by us. We want to take this podcast to the next level. That\u0027s why we\u0027re asking you for help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next mountain that we want to climb is that of convention promotion. We want to bring Nerd Novice to several local comic book and nerd conventions, so we can show the people our shining faces and make them realize how awesome our podcast is. For this, we need your help. We need to be able to not only pay our registration fees, but also bring righteous merchandise to each convention we attend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more support we receive, the more merch we can create, which we can bring to conventions, where we can meet new people and turn them into new listeners. And we love new listeners. We are doing this all on our own, so remember, every little bit helps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much, and keep on novicifying!\u003cbr\u003e"
