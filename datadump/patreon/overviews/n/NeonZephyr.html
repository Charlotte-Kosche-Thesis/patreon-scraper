    "summary": "First off, thank you for stopping by, regardless of your choice today. Even just a visit here means more than I could ever say, no matter how many drafts I script~!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing prose and various other forms of fiction for over a decade. While I am working on becoming a novelist, I am also continuing to produce written work for free for you to enjoy. However, the current economy limits how much I can focus on these instead of my day job(s). Support here will help me to focus on my writing more, improving my craft and releasing works more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am best known for two ongoing fan-fictions,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/works/889500\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSilver Blood\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/works/2037930\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSegments of Blue\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. While these have both been on haitus for a while, I am happy to announce that both are scheduled to resume updating in January of 2018. I also have an original Science Fiction novella in early stages that I will be publishing online as an ebook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strive to keep my public work from being behind a paywall. Save for anything that becomes professionally published (which would be done separately from my work shown here with you lovely patrons), everything published online will be available to you, eventually. Patrons may get access to things earlier than others, but nothing is planned to be exclusive to Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, if you like what I do, and want to see it grow and improve and be released more frequently, consider throwing me a dollar or more, and earn my undying gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Art Credits: Avatar by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://fini-min.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeebs/Fini-mun\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e"
