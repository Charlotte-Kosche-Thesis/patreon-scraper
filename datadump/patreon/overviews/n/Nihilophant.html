Time taken per figure is intended to be under a half hour. The level of detail will vary.\u003cbr\u003e-Refined Color digital paintings are like what you see in my comic series AYLIUMS and Nun\u2019s Corruption and may have multiple lighting sources. You may request specific dimensions for the image size but the limit is 1200X1200p.\u003cbr\u003e-Supreme Quality digital paintings may have atmospheric effects, special multi-source lighting/shadows, water and other distortion effects, detailed background and foregrounds with foreshortening/perspective.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-It is explicitly understood by the patron upon the delivery of the finished work that \u003cstrong\u003ethere are no refunds\u003c/strong\u003e. Also, this bears repeating, \u003cstrong\u003ethere is no hard-copy\u003c/strong\u003e (physical painting or drawing) of the art the patron is paying for, only a digital file. If a patron is dissatisfied with the completed work they are encouraged to request additional work, within reason, be done on the art work in question at no extra cost. For a patron contributing at higher tiers they may request rough preliminary sketches to review and determine that the poses, action, and composition is satisfactory before the significant portion of work is done. \u003cstrong\u003eWork on the final revision of the art piece(s) will not begin until after patreon has successfully charged the patron for that month\u003c/strong\u003e. While creating art is labor/time intensive there is no guarantee of how long it may take. Typically, a single figure in a refined color digital painting takes 2 to 3 days but additional figures will add about 1 day per figure. Bigger commissions will obviously take longer. You can expect to be updated periodically (usually every couple days if it\u2019s a refined color digital painting) on progress or email requests to see progress to reassure good faith in the transaction. If for some reason you do not receive some kind of update on the progress for a period longer than 5 days just email me or message me. If after another 5 days I still do not respond I encourage you to seek a payment dispute. Thus far in all the years I\u2019ve been doing commissioned art I\u2019ve never had a dispute filed against me. Also understand that I do work a full time job besides being an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(191, 191, 191);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(216, 216, 216);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(216, 216, 216);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 63, 63);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(191, 191, 191);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eAll characters/figures depicted in my artwork are age 18 years old or older and because they are artistic renderings/depictions drawn/painted by hand from the mind of the creator and do not actually exist they are exempt from the Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a72257(h)(2)(B)(v) and 47 U.S.C. \u00a7230\u00a9 requirements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDMCA Fair Use disclaimer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny characters/figures that have the likeness of a public person (such as a famous actor) alive or dead is not intended to slander, defame, deprive, confuse with the original, or otherwise infringe any copyrights. \u003cstrong\u003eThese are drawings/paintings that are parodies protected as fair use under DMCA that meet all four factors of fair use\u003c/strong\u003e.
