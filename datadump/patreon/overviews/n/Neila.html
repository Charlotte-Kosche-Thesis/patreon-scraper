For\nmost of 2015 my dominate arm was wracked by pain and I was unable to\nfeed myself with it let alone draw and I didn\u2019t learn until mid\n2015 what was wrong with my arm. In that time I lost the job I had as\na comic colorist assistant (flatter) and wrote with my left arm here\non Patreon to bring in a little to help ease the burden of bills. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\nhave been unable to work a \u2018traditional job\u2019 at say a pizza place\nor grocery store, even part time, because my arms (both are affected\nby the tendon condition I have) ache and become tired with repetitive\nmotion which also affects my ability to grip things. I can write and\ndraw only by taking lots of breaks, massaging my tendons, and icing\nthem pretty much nightly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs ability to manage my tendon\ncondition improves so too does my ability to produce art which brings\nme to what I\u2019m working on in 2017. I\u2019d like to work more on\nproducing a comic. In 2016 I was fortunate enough to get some work\ninking a couple issues of an indie comic called Hero Cats of Stellar\nCity which helped to show me that I can create comics again.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThroughout the worst of my arm troubles I spent time\nwriting Beast: Cottonmouth and publishing all 21 chapters of the\nhorror/science fiction/fantasy novel here for Patrons to read. \u003cstrong\u003eBeast:\nCottonmouth,(which follows Use Leid, Interdimensional Gremlin\nDetective, as she hunts down a monster that has been possessing and\nkilling humans on\nEarth)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/beast-ch-21-7881845\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/beast-ch-21-7881845\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\nare you making in 2018, Neila?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDue to a backlog of commissions I now owe and my health limitationds from my arm problems I am switching this patreon back to primarily prose in 2018. I will still post Magic Remains comic pages here before they are on Tapas as I get them done but it is apparent I can not manage to do that monthly with my current work load. In 2018 I will be serializing draft 1 of book 1 of my space opera \u003cstrong\u003eParagon Ketch.\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eYou can read it as well as everything I\u0027ve posted the last couple years including short stories, comic pages, sketches, and draft 1 of my novel Beast: Cottonmouth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy\ngoals this year are:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*\nProduce pages for my dystopian magical girl comic Magic Remains which\nyou can read on Tapastic here:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://tapastic.com/series/Magic-Remains\"\u003ehttps://tapastic.com/series/Magic-Remains\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nand\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*\nWrite a novel to serialize on Patreon.

She wanders the globe looking for\npeople in need of her magical powers and meets Sparky, a cyborg who\nis fleeing from a magical girl named Honey. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe comic\nwill update Mondays on Tapastic and Patrons will get access to pages\nhere on Patreon as soon as each page is done. I hope to build a\nbuffer thanks to funds from Patreon freeing up my time from drawing\ncommissions. There is only a limited amount of things I can do each\nday before my arms begin to ache such that doing daily tasks become\ndifficult. If I don\u2019t have to do commissions and can focus on\nproducing comic pages I can produce the comic more quickly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBy\ncontributing to this Patreon you\u2019ll get access to Magic Remains\npages early, exclusive sketches, access to first drafts of prose I\nwrite, and access to other artwork I produce for both projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\nis Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon\nis a site that helps people support their favorite creators with\nmonthly donations to help them continue to produce the projects you\nlove.
