I will not be uploading original game files. This project focuses on games long out of print, largely by developers and publishers who disappeared equally long ago. I have no intent on working on anything which may cause or be interpreted as causing a loss in profit to the developer or publisher.\u003cstrong\u003e If a rights owner can be found, I do my best to contact them and make them aware of this project before releasing anything. \u003c/strong\u003eShould I receive a takedown request for any individual project (or general request from a rights owner/developer), I will gladly forfeit all progress to the issuer to do with as they please.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe \u003cstrong\u003eNEC PC-98\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0series of computers is one of the most important systems in computer gaming history. It was a Japanese-only line of computer systems, gaining a large amount of popularity with developers and really kick-starting the indie or \u0027doujin\u0027 gaming scene in Japan, resulting in literally thousands of games coming out in its lifespan.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, the vast majority of these games have never been remade, translated, nor ported to other platforms. It is a library largely lost in time -- unknown to Western audiences as most are untranslated, or ignored due to stereotypes of games with sexual content. I believe this is a tragedy, as the PC-98 represents a unique and brilliant era in gaming and programming history. Beautiful dithered graphics and little to no restrictions on content (as a result of independent publishing and development) resulted in a plethora of unique, beautiful, and fascinating games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/c4kYV6I.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePossessioner (1994), Queen Soft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, as a result of being largely unknown by Western audiences, there is currently a deficit of translated games (perhaps 15 at most). These games vary wildly in structure, and take significant time and effort to hack, translate, and test the game files. Very few people have the ability to do this, especially coupled with the love of the library and dedication it takes to do so. I believe this is where I come in, as I am a die-hard fan of the system, its library, and also happen to be a programmer who can understand Japanese.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal is to translate as many PC-98 games as I can to English (not just a few select games I enjoy), and expose the world to many fantastic games that would never be granted attention otherwise. As Japanese is a context-based language, it is impossible for machine translations to ever adequately represent the tone or intricacies of the language.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith every translation that I create, I will learn new tricks about how to hack these games, and my grasp on the Japanese language will improve. In other words, the more time I can dedicate to translations, the faster future translations will become as well. \u003cstrong\u003eMy first goal is to translate 100 different PC-98 games.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI personally vow to \u003cstrong\u003enever censor any games that I work on\u003c/strong\u003e, and do my best to create translations that relay the original tone and content as best as possible. I will strive to ensure that my translations are bug-free and without spelling or grammatical errors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever,\u003cstrong\u003e I am still a college student working part-time jobs\u003c/strong\u003e to earn enough money to live and pay off college bills. As much as I would love to pursue this dream, I am held back by\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003emuch of my time being taken up by work. I still do my best in my free time, but if I were to have funding from Patreon I would be able to set aside time exclusively for this goal, and be able to produce many more translations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you very much for reading, and my sincerest thanks for any contributions to this project.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
