    "summary": "Hi! I have been designing casual strategy board games for more than a decade. It\u0027s time to take that from a hobby to a career. My plan is teach part time, and supplement my income by publishing games. Part of this will be releasing web-playable versions of the games on my website, nemorathwald.com. That\u0027s the free content which this Patreon will support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of a single 40-hour-a-week day job as a software developer, I have decided to pursue teaching software development, and a variety of short contracts. This will free up time to finally complete my goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been a software developer for three years-- specifically, programming web applications. As I continued to grow as a developer, I started and re-started my browser-based game projects multiple times. Each one was executed more professionally than the last. At this point, it\u0027s ready.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have contracts to publish my physical board games made of cardboard and wood, as you expect from a typical board game. But I believe in a try-before-you-buy philosophy. I negotiated terms in my contracts that would allow me to also bring each board game to you, my Patreon backers, in your web browser.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been designing board games for more than a decade. Each of them has years of playtesting behind it. One of the ways they can become even better is to have an AI play against itself, to discover overly-dominant strategies, or overly-weak strategies, which need to be balanced. That will be one of the side benefits of creating a software version.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I started my software development career, I had ten years of experience as a graphic designer-- and it shows in the careful layout and lavish illustration of my games. The visual appearance of the game equipment makes it easy to see how to play. (Similar principles apply to designing a user interface for an app.) One of my next steps is to showcase all that artwork for you on nemorathwald.com, as a foretaste of what is to come. You will know that these games will look exceptional.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExpect an announcement here soon of the first project! Thank you for backing me!"
