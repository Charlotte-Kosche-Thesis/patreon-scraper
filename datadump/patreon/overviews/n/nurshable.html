    "summary": "Nurshable is all about finding joy (and success) in gentle parenting. I try to take things past the generic advice that is so easy to find and into the practical nitty-gritty of the day to day moments between a parent and child. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGentle parenting is ultimately not a to-do list or a bunch of techniques. It\u0027s not a method. It is a way of approaching a relationship. Since every relationship is different, the things that will help a parent and child connect... will be different. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been sharing various real life scenarios, snippets, and ways to reframe/view common situations. Right now Nurshable is a collection of these snippets spread out between my Facebook page and nurshable.com. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to take Nurshable to the next level. I would like to organize it better, make it more searchable, and copy all the content from Facebook over to the blog so that it can be better organized. Ultimately I would like to finish compiling it into a book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ability to do this while continuing to run the blog and Facebook page.... Depends on funding. I\u0027ve tried a variety of ways to help Nurshable become self sustaining in the past, but they have all rubbed me the wrong way. I do NOT want pop up advertisements. I do NOT want every important word in an article to become a hotlink to advertise something that I don\u0027t stand behind. I\u0027ve had a few community supporters purchase small banner ads, but selling advertising takes time that I would rather devote to helping people on their journey to gentle parenting. I do NOT want to limit the support that I provide to people who can afford to pay a parenting consultant or buy books. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter Patreon. It allows people to sign up to support Nurshable directly, contributing as little as a dollar per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s see what we can build Nurshable into. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
