    "summary": "Hi, Nawal Here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been Teaching Yoga and Bellydance in my community since 2009.\u003cbr\u003eI am using Patreon as a platform to extend the physical availability of my classes to people who live close or people who live far. And to help me be able to \u00a0create \u00a0FULL TIME! I am hoping that through Patreon I will be able to create some BONUS content for my long time and loyal Students. BONUS CONTENT INCLUDES: Recipes, FOOD TIPS, Cross training tips and Life Hacks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBased in Saint John, New Brunswick , Canada, a city of about 60,000 people . Since I have began teaching I \u00a0have driven all through out rural NB teaching workshops and classes- now that my Daughter is older I simply am not able to hold classes 7 nights \u00a0a week anymore. Past students always say that they wish they could keep up with their body maintenance, and when I suggest a Teacher in their area the insist that they only want MY class (which is flattering, but doesn\u0027t keep them moving) . So through Patreon we can stay connected. It also give me the opportunity to share content with fans and friends world wide!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am interested in sharing my knowledge with folk who CARE- care to live care to try new things and care about themselves!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will have YIN Yoga Series as well as some more flow style yoga and,of course, Finger Cymbal Drills and Bellydance Combinations and maybe even a Few of my favorite American Tribal Style Combos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYin Yoga WIll be suitable for all levels- The bellydance Content will be working Suhaila Level 1 or higher- and include combinations with Cane (assaya), Finger Cymbals (aaaand Rock\u0026amp;Roll Finger Cymbals ) and Sword. I am also open to requests for content-\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNawal\u0027s Classes \u0026amp; Combinations contain nomenclature and concepts learner from the Salimpour School of Bellydance. She is Level 3 in the Suhaila Salimpour Method and Level2 in the Jamila Format working her way to Level 5 in both Formats .
