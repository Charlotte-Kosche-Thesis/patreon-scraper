I also dabble in music covers and crochet amigurumi -- both of which I intend to do a lot more of in the future -- and I stream (mostly Zelda...) once a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this Patreon as a way for you to get a\u003cstrong\u003e little bit of insight\u003c/strong\u003e into what goes on behind the scenes (as well as\u003cstrong\u003e early access to videos\u003c/strong\u003e when they\u0027re up early), while \u003cstrong\u003eat the same time\u003c/strong\u003e covering some of the costs of running the channel. I have a lot of ideas for my channel, mostly involving fan-made music relating to the Let\u0027s Plays I\u0027ve made, and I want you to be a part of it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach tier has a different reward, so make sure to check them out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you\u0027ll help me to keep making the videos, music and amigurumi I make (whether it\u0027s for better equipment, more games, new consoles or yarn) and I\u0027m eternally grateful for all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, though, I just want to \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e for not only watching my videos but also just for taking the time to check out my Patreon.
