My name is CJ and I started this project in January of 2017 with some smaller ideas that eventually snowballed to what this is, now, in May of 2017. I started my journey toward owning the medium-sized Japanese dogs in 2010 when I met my first Shikoku Ken, and then my passion grew in 2011, when I met my first Kishu Ken. Without the strength and activity in the Nihon Ken Forum, I would have never had unbiased, accurate information on the breeds in order to decide that I wanted to get involved and share my life with these dogs.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is my way of giving something back and honoring the community that helped me find my perfect dogs. This small magazine will be a way to promote accurate breed information and share the Hokkaido Ken, the Kai Ken, the Kishu Ken, and the Shikoku Ken with the world. Whether you are an already active enthusiast or new to the lesser-known Japanese breeds, I hope this provides something for everyone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTentative Release Schedule\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSpring Issue: March 1st, 2018\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSummer Issue: June 1st, 2018\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFall Issue: September 1st, 2018\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eWinter Issue: December 1st, 2018\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for your support!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
