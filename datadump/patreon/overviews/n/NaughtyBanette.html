    "summary": "Hey everyone, thanks for stopping by to check me out. I\u0027m an amateur smut-peddler and writing hobbyist that usually works with forum based stories where the readers have some level of input into the plot of the stories. I write, first and foremost, as a hobby, a way to get all the ideas that swirl about in my head distracting me from daily life down on some concrete medium to share with the world. It\u0027s not a job for me, but a passion, something I do simply because it\u0027s something I do anyways, and I absolutely thrive on feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stories I write couldn\u0027t exist without the feedback and input of the readers. Your support, your direction, even your criticism when I don\u0027t do a good enough job, all of it inspires me to hit the keyboard each day, to stick with current projects when new ideas constantly pop into my head. In all honesty, I avoided getting a Patreon for a long time, fearing the guilt I\u0027d feel if my readers gave money for a story they loved, only for me to drop it on a whim. It\u0027s something I\u0027ve been working on, finding the motivation and determination to press on through floods of inspiration and droughts of writer\u0027s block, and I\u0027m proud to say I\u0027ve come a long way in the last year or so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be blunt, I write smut. That is to say, most of what I write focuses heavily around adult content and sexual situations, they comprise a large portion of the driving force behind the plot and character development. That being said, I adore writing characters, setting and plot, and do my best to never sacrifice any of that for the sake of smut. I love coming up with characters, fleshing out their backgrounds and personality, having them interact with one another in meaningful ways, seeing them grow and develop and take on almost a life of their own. I love exploring the implications of fantastic societies, venturing into the murky philosophy and ethics of such things, finding logical reasons for events that do not snap the reader\u0027s suspension of disbelief. In short, I try to avoid \u0027porn logic\u0027 at all costs, though some times it\u0027s fun to read characters getting it on just because.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yeah, this isn\u0027t a job for me, and I don\u0027t expect I\u0027ll ever make enough money to consider myself a full time writer, and that\u0027s fine. What this is, in essence, is a way for my readers to give back if they choose to. I\u0027m not asking for my readers to pay for content, I\u0027m not holding updates and progress hostage behind a pay wall, I\u0027m just leaving the hat on the floor, so to speak, so that anyone who enjoys my writing might throw a dollar or two in once in a while. I couldn\u0027t do what I do without the feedback of my readers, this, I suppose, is just another way for them to show support.\u003cbr\u003e"
