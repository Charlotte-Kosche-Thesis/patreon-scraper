    "summary": "Hi! My name is Nikki Burnette. I am a fantasy artist and\nhave been professionally selling my work online and at shows since 2006. I draw and paint all sorts\nof fantasy art in watercolor, most of which contain a central female figure\nincluding witches, mermaids, fairies, steampunk, zombies, vampires and more. My female characters tend to be cute and sexy with just a touch of darkness!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAlong with\nselling my original paintings, I also sell a variety of different products\nfeaturing my art. I make prints, stickers, magnets, bookmarks, greeting\ncards, pocket mirrors, buttons, keychains, postcards, notepads, ID holders,\nnecklaces....I could go on and on! All of these products have been designed, created and handmade by myself in my studio, right down to the packaging.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have an endless number of other paintings and creations that I would love to make, but I need your support! As a patron of my art, you can have a huge impact on helping me to grow my business.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThink of Patreon as sort of an ongoing Kickstarter campaign. Instead of\nbacking a particular project, you are backing the creator and helping them to\ncontinue doing what they do best...creating what they love and what you love\ntoo! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I asking for your support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eRunning and growing my art business takes money...lots and lots of money! I\u0027m always shocked at the expenses involved with what I do. When I first sat down to do this professionally, I thought to myself \"some paintbrushes, paper, paint...maybe some envelopes to mail the paintings...good to go!\" But the reality is art supplies, materials for products, printers, printer ink, postage, art show equipment, etc...all add up to be an obscene amount of money. That\u0027s why I\u0027m asking for your help! I love doing what I do and want to continue to do so. Your patronage will help me buy the things I need to keep going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the reasons I love Patreon is because it provides an awesome way for those of you who may not need or want a painting in your home to support my art. I\u0027ve often had people come into my booth at shows and say that they really love my art, but don\u0027t need a painting, so they\u0027d like to make a donation to support me instead. Now Patreon provides a wonderful way to make the same kind of donation online!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m asking for a pledge amount per painting I create. I\ncompleted 12 paintings in 2013 so expect me to complete 1-2 paintings a month. The paintings range in size from mini\npaintings (2.5x3.5\") to much larger works (11x14\"). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou are charged your pledge amount at the beginning of the month and rewards are sent out as soon as the funds are received! Keep in mind that your amount charged will depend on how many paintings I finish during the month. You can change your\npledge amount and/or cancel at any time. You can also \"cap your\npledge\" to make sure you don\u0027t go over budget.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy gratitude first and foremost! I am so honored to wake up every day and make money doing what I love most. What an awesome job!! I couldn\u0027t do it\nwithout your support, so THANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBeyond just my thanks, you also get lots of cool gifts!\nJust read all the details below. Every pledge tier has different rewards, so choose the one that\u0027s right for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWant to see more of my artwork?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.nikkiburnette.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eVisit my website here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/aurella27?ref=si_shop\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eVisit my Etsy shop here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
