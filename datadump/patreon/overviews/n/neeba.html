    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, my name is Neeba.\u003c/strong\u003e You might already know me \u0026amp; my work from various \"ecchi sites\" (hence the reason why you\u0027re here:), I\u0027ve been drawing naughty fanarts since 2015. \u003cbr\u003eBut in case you did not, let me introduce myself (or to be more exact, the art I\u0027m creating): \u003cbr\u003eI draw mostly adult-oriented parody fanarts of various animes (mangas), cartoons and games with my main goal being to make them look as close as possible to the original source in order to create an \u0027illusion\u0027 of such (ero-) scenes actually happening. I strive to make them feel like a part of the shows we all love and enjoy, to a point where they\u0027re almost like actual \u0027screenshots\u0027 taken from them. Unless my clients are insist on changing certain details, I try never to differ too much from the main source, let it be the size of body parts, general looks, colors, etc. For me it has paramount importance to make every character 100% recognizable to provide the best \u0027experience\u0027. For this very reason alone, one of my main future goals is to create doujins (parody comics) which would be an even better way to portray\u00a0our beloved characters through actual mini-stories, finding themselves in all kinds of naughty situations. ;]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy to become a Patron of mine though, you may ask? What are the benefits?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 First, you\u0027ll have access to all my high-quality patron-only pictures, which will consist of my otherwise private commissions (many that never got published before), entirely new patreon-exclusive pieces, and likewise improved versions of my older pieces,\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 You\u0027d help me in a big way to dedicate more of time into drawing \u0026amp; improving, which would allow me to produce and post more pictures here as well each month,\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027d be prioritized on my list when it comes to commissions\u003c/strong\u003e (see more details about this below) and also get a discount compared to my non-patron clients,\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 You\u0027d support me to start drawing doujins (and maybe even short animations) eventually, and at the same time participate in polls which will determine the plots and characters in them,\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 And last but not least, you\u0027d get access to my DISCORD channel where I\u0027ll keep you updated post sketches \u0026amp; WIPs and so on,\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs for the COMMISSIONS:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ll still be available for private commissions, but from now on - like I\u0027ve mentioned before - I\u0027ll prioritize my Patrons (put them further up on my list whenever I have open slots, which means their requests will be done a lot sooner) and even provide them a discount. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these will be dependent on your \"Rank\" (Tier). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFeel free to email me at neebapixxx@gmail.com about all the details and questions regarding your commission! Or you can also contact me via Discord at Neeba#3439.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll upload a Commission FAQ soon about my exact prices, details and what not, but until then you can always ask me whenever you wish via one of the above mentioned ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll the commissions will be posted here eventually, unless the commissioner \ninsists on keeping them private (which would require them to pay a slightly increased prize).\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e And \nplease do NOT repost any of my work if possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHuge thanks\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ein advance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e for everyone\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, who\u0027re willing to support my work (thus the otaku world :D)!\u003cbr\u003eBest regards, Neeba\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
