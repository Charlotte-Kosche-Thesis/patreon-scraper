I\u0027m Scott, and I make videos about comic books and superheroes every week over on my YouTube channel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/nerdsyncproductions\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNerdSync!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery week, I critically examine comic books as an art form and tool that can teach us about real-world science, philosophy, history, and culture. \u003cstrong\u003eWe strive to make informative and thought-provoking videos on the little-known trivia, fascinating stories, and mind-blowing theories surrounding the thing we love most: Superheroes!\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BPxAnBN.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong story short: \u003cstrong\u003eYouTube doesn\u0027t favor videos like mine.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you may know, YouTube is becoming a tougher place for creators unless we upload videos daily. So if I want to play the game, I have to sacrifice video quality for video quantity. Lower quality editing, less time on research, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI do not want to do that.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to take my time with videos. Publish one a week and put all my time and effort into making something I\u0027m proud of for you. Since YouTube won\u0027t promote NerdSync unless I post three or more videos per week, I need your help here on Patreon to keep spreading the academic side of superheroes and comic books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SgQXaVO.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe have some great rewards for you!\u003c/strong\u003e The tiers start at just one dollar per weekly video with additional perks for those of you with the desire and ability to give more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can get access to the private NerdSync Discord server where you can chat with me directly as well as all the other beautiful Patrons! You can\u00a0get a monthly Twitter/Instagram shoutout where I will likely mispronounce your name! You can even get that beautiful name of yours on screen at the end of our videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter how much you decide to give, know that I am grateful that you invite me and my videos into your life each week to listen to me ramble about comics. Your support and encouragement allow me to continue this journey I started 5 years ago. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to check out my Patreon page and for supporting NerdSync, you wonderful nerd!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
