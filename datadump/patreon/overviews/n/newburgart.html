I make kids books, comics, fine art, fanart and more, and now I\u0027m here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h1\u003eI\u0027ve been writing stories and painting other people\u0027s stories for a few years now, and I love doing it. The problem is, I have a family, and bills, and every time I sit down to draw, the thought isn\u0027t about connection, it\u0027s about money. How do I sell this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I want to do is tell good stories and tell meaningful stories that people need. A lot of you that follow me online have been waiting forever for more fanart from books, and the main reason that hasn\u0027t happened, is because I\u0027ve been chasing around my paycheck and doing a lot of work that isn\u0027t fun, and isn\u0027t meaningful to me. I want to change things up. I have several story ideas I\u0027ve been hoarding for the off chance one of them will get published through a major publisher. I want to stop doing that, and finish the stories, and send them to my patrons. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFOR FREE\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Every story and finished product will be a digital download. Every book will be available in print.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat can you expect from this Patreon?\u003c/h1\u003eI\u0027m kind of all over the map. I do life comics, I do short stories, I do kids books, fine art, fanart, tutorials, vlogs and art advice videos, I\u0027m working with a woodshop in my town on some cool ideas, I\u0027m doing a tattoo design. It\u0027s all over the place. I am primarily a storyteller, but since I don\u0027t always work consistently, and my projects change, I will be posting whatever is happening in my life at the moment, and will be charging per thing, rather than per month. Patrons will be able to cap how much they want to spend per month, and will still get access to ALL patron only posts in their tier, even if they\u0027ve stopped paying that month because they\u0027re cap is reached. Want to pay $1 per thing, and only $1 a month? Even if I make 5 things that month, you\u0027ll only get charged $1 and still get to see all 5 projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to be a patron, thank you so much. I will be posting an intro video very soon, so look out for that!\u00a0"
