    "summary": "I work hard to make animations. Its only me, myself, and I who makes my videos; so far, I\u0027ve done all the editing, animation, coloring, voice acting, etc. Seeing my latest creation being de-monetized every time due to not being \"advertisement-friendly\" is just an absolutely, ferociously unpleasant experience. I don\u0027t animate for money; if I wanted a quick buck I would just stream video games or make react videos. I animate because I love to do it (though I question myself when I\u0027m up at 4 a.m. for the 7th night in a row). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsing Patreon isn\u0027t about generating a source of revenue for my animations, but rather for giving me more time to do so. One year ago when I was a Sophomore in college, I had to get jobs such as being a cashier at K-mart to make my money. Doing such a draining, mind-numbing job didn\u0027t allow me as much time to make animations, on top of double-majoring in college for subjects completely unrelated to animating. Basically, my anus was defiled everyday by customers while the lube that is animating was running dry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etl;dr\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m using Patreon because 1. I don\u0027t make a lot of money from YouTube due to being de-monetized and 2. I really don\u0027t want to work at K-mart again and would rather spend my time animating. I\u0027ve set the donation/payment option to per-video, since I don\u0027t trust myself to release content frequently enough to justify a per-month subscription. Think of this as a tip jar; I\u0027m a beautiful waiter bringing you your meal of an animation, while you are the customer who tips me for my amazing/horrifying work. Thank you my chode monkeys!\u003cbr\u003e"
