    "summary": "If you had a baby when Nintendo World Report first started, that baby would be in high school now and driving a car. That baby could have a baby of its own. That baby could be writing for our website now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, Nintendo World Report (or Planet GameCube if you go way back. Or Planet N2000 if you are a true OG) has been around for a long time, and in that time, the way the Internets and websites work has changed drastically. Basically, it\u0027s all way less dependable and much scarier. We\u0027d like to set ourselves up to be in a position where we can just worry about producing strong content that our readers will love as opposed to worrying about staying afloat, serving ads, and getting mad clicks. That\u0027s why we\u0027re using Patreon to try to fuel the future of Nintendo World Report. We want to be able to deliver the content \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e want directly to you without any of the nonsense.\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DG9rec6XsAAniEf.jpg:large\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start, we\u0027ll be giving you more insight into the behind-the-scenes world of Nintendo World Report. You\u0027ll get to see what we\u0027re working on before it is posted and directly interact with the staff. If you pledge for the $5 tier, you\u0027ll also be a part of the site\u0027s content directly, letting you vote and nominate different games and subjects for monthly features. And if you pledge the highest tier, you can chat and play games with us online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the rewards and stretch goals, we also have a renewed commitment to making more original content. Alongside this Patreon, we\u0027re launching (or relaunching) a few new recurring features.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst up is Cube Fight, which is where Neal and Andy bicker over the quality of every Nintendo-published GameCube game in an effort to both look back on the GameCube and determine what games from that group are totally rad. You can check out the first episode very soon if you become a Patron (it\u0027ll be out for non-Patrons in a week or two).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s also the Know Your Developers series, where John Rairdin (and his crack team of researchers) recount the people behind the games. In 2015, we went over Nintendo\u0027s (now defunct) EAD Groups. Our episode covering the Star Fox series will be out for Patrons soon (and coming out for non-Patrons shortly after that). This year, we\u0027re planning to cover Next Level Games, Intelligent Systems, HAL Labs, and much more. And hey - if you\u0027re in the $5/month tier or above, you can even directly recommend developers and series for us to cover!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur resident King Nintendo Fanboy Justin Berube will also be debuting a regular video series where he\u2019ll show off his extensive Nintendo collection. Join Justin every so often as he highlights his ridiculous and exhaustive amount of Nintendo memorabilia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s only the tip of the iceberg of what we\u0027ll be creating over the next months and years. Depending on how much this Patreon grows, we will be able to do more and more, but that all depends on how much support we get. But no matter what, we\u0027ll have \u003cstrong\u003ehot\u003c/strong\u003e E3 coverage when we get to that event in June (Note: so uh, maybe E3 won\u0027t be quite as cool this year. But we\u0027ll still have as much coverage as possible!). As a Patron, you\u0027ll get to see more of the behind-the-scenes mayhem and get a peek at our coverage before everyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you very much for taking the time to read this. Whether you have followed us for years and just stumbled upon us recently, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Nintendo World Report first entered the world in March 1999 as Planet N200 and then Planet GameCube. Back then, we were all about finding out everything we could about Nintendo and their games, and we\u0027re still all about that now, having been around for the launches of the Game Boy Advance, GameCube, DS, Wii, 3DS, Wii U, and the Switch. Over the years, our staff has changed (and some of our former staffers are working at game companies, game sites, and beyond), but our passion for Nintendo and their games has remained constant.",
