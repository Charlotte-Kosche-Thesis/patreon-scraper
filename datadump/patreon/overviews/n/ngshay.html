I\u0027m Nate Shay (my real life irl name), though some of you may only know me from facebook or amtgard, in which case you might know me as Nate Chop, or Bleys, or any number of nicknames. I write poetry, and I enjoy writing poetry. I have a degree in writing things from Towson University, and I spent the vast majority of that degree writing essays and writing poems. I came to Patreon specifically for two reasons. I wanted to have a centralized repository, and I wanted a schedule. On top of that, people seemed willing to give me a meager amount of money in exchange for my work, which seemed interesting. So here we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy schedule, starting out, is going to be a poem published every 2 weeks, averaging out to about two poems a month. I will not have a paywall for these poems, and if I do institute something like a paywall, it will probably only be for a short period of time on newly released writings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd hey, thanks again!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2764\ud83d\udd25"
