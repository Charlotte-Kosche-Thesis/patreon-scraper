    "summary": "You might be asking, \"Yo, Nick, you\u0027re terrific but why the f#*$ are you asking for money?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, let me indulge for a second. If you\u2019re new to this, you\u2019ve stumbled across it, or you just want to know a bit more about me. I am Nick Bleeker. I\u2019m a writer, podcast host, netball and basketball tragic. I have been writing for eight years, and currently write at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-after-thought\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Afterthought\u003c/a\u003e, a blog I run. I have been podcasting (hosting and producing) for more than three years with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/definitely-not-popcorn-podcast/id997351649?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Definitely Not Popcorn Podcast\u003c/a\u003e, and now I produce and host a few other shows every single week,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/the-goal-circle/id1097370246?mt=2\u0026amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Goal Circle\u003c/a\u003e with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/listen-up-idiots/id1161672377\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eListen Up, Idiots\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now you\u2019ve got a paint-by-numbers idea of who I am\u2026 this is what I\u2019m asking for:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney to help cover costs of hosting and producing these podcasts as well as writing up reviews for Game of Thrones, The Bachelor, a tonne of music features and so on. A question you might ask is \"Why are you reviewing The Bachelor... just stop!\" Well, last year The Bachelor recaps I did were some of the most popular things I\u0027ve ever written, and I plan on continuing that because people engage with it, and I happen to love engaging with others about entertainment, sports and everything, really.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth is doing all of that while working full time is rather taxing and\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ehosting and creating a podcast\u003c/strong\u003e is not an entirely cheap and easy thing to do. All of this involves a tonne of hours to research, a few hours per episode of editing down (despite Skype being insanely difficult, if not, impossible to deal with) and a few hours a week to actually record it. I host these and there\u0027s a few guests that have been staples of the show for the past two and a half years, but one depressing fact in the last eight years of writing and the last three years of producing these podcasts is that I\u0027ve made exactly \u003cstrong\u003ezero\u003c/strong\u003e dollars. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I don\u0027t feel like I am entitled to earning millions for what I do. But I am a big believer of creatives getting paid for what they produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not leaving you in the lurch if you drop a dime; I\u0027m not going to high-tail it outta here with your money! I want some interaction, so if you back this I want to open the floor up to things for me to review / cover on the podcast and the website. Whether it\u0027s questions, movies, TV, music, whatever, we can approach and produce it and we can even drop some advertising for you before the podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant an episode entirely devoted to the NBA? Then say the word and we\u0027ll do it (truthfully, something I would LOVE to do). Want us to marathon a set of movies in retrospect? Like, say, a Disney marathon? Say the word and I\u0027ll do it. Did you like an album and need some gratification? I\u0027ll listen and review it in writing and on the podcast. Hell, did you want a weekly recap of The Bachelor in podcast form? Guess what, that\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003ehappening this year (FOR BOTH SEASONS).\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to stress to you that all of this will only go to covering costs for hosting, equipment upgrades and the literal hours of my (and my guests) week that goes into making this content as excellent as we can. I\u0027ve been paying for these costs for years (with the help of Hugh and Tom, who frequent the Definitely Not Popcorn Podcast) and this is designed to bolster our forces and improve the quality of life of all the shows and writing. For the podcasts, this means the more money, the better we can make things sound overall (they\u0027re not too bad, I have to admit) and the more episodes we can produce on a regular basis, because we want to do it more often! And for the writing, it means we can write more, more often, and cover as many topics as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s not a dishonour to ask for help. I feel it\u2019s important that creatives get paid, because a product is being put out into the world and a lot of people read and listen to it. I love what I do, and I am proud of what I do. That\u0027s not to say that if you don\u0027t donate that it\u0027s all going to stop, because I\u0027ll still be doing this all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe free stuff isn\u2019t going away. \u003c/strong\u003eInstead, by contributing you\u2019re actually assisting me in\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaking what I produce every week better quality and;\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaking more of it. If you can help support me, and the gang that are part of this, you\u2019re one of us. So you can tell me what you want to hear more of or read more of and I\u0027ll work to make it a reality.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it stands I\u0027m currently producing, overall, per week, two to three episodes of each podcast and I\u0027m working on a few short documentaries for the Brisbane theatre communities. I would love to add another episode or show per week to the podcast so that means chatting more about TV shows, more movies, and more pop culture. \u00a0And the same for my writing and reviews. I\u0027m absolutely ready to hear what you want me to make for you, so let\u0027s make a dynasty.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
