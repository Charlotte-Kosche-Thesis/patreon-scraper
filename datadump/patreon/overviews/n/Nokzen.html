    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGreetings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI go under the name of Nokzen on YouTube, and I\u0027ve been making gaming videos\u00a0on Youtube\u00a0with No Commentary.\u00a0I do this\u00a0because\u00a0I sometimes feel that its nice to not have some \"funny\" guy yelling in my ear and ruin the experience and atmosphere of the game, Sometimes its good with commentaries aswell, but i want to deliver the alternative.\u003cbr\u003eI post a new video every day (Sometimes more),\u00a0ranging from Horror, to Platformers, to random Trailers of Upcoming games i find interesting, and that think my audience find interesting too. I love creating videos for people to enjoy, and I genuinely enjoy the process of it all as well. I want to continue to keep doing what I have been doing, except I want to get better and do more. To do this, I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of my channel is to be self-sufficient and allow me to pursue my dream of content creation. YouTube Currently demonetize almost all my videos cause of them not being ad friendly and being a very small channel\u00a0i\u0027m not earning close to enough to do anything special with it.\u00a0With Patreon, I can have a consistent stream of support to help fuel my channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does my money go towards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support goes directly into what is needed to run my channel, both in terms of what you see, and what you do not. Things such as, Upgrading Hardware to make sure i can provide quality videos of all kind of games, buying games to show on the channel, would love to have more AAA games aswell,\u00a0I still need to be on the look out for the latest games releasing on Steam.\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is also to get consoles, to get videos up of those exclusive titles coming. You support goes directly into keeping things behind the scenes working, as well as what you see online. More and Better giveaways would be awesome too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce you become a Patron, you\u0027re done. Patreon will charge you between the 1st and 5th of every month. If you ever want to stop supporting my channel, you can simply stop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
