I think the name is very apt for a channel that does video essays on thematic devices in film.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, there\u0027s \"now you see it\" as in, we explored how this cinematic technique contributes to a certain theme, and not the technique makes a little more sense. \u00a0A \"now you \u003cem\u003enotice\u003c/em\u003e it\" meaning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, there\u0027s \"now \u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003esee it,\" as a sort of command. Go out there and see for yourself\u00a0what you think the technique conveys.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, there\u0027s the beginning of the common phrase \"Now you see it, now you don\u0027t\" which is usually reserved for something magical. And that\u0027s what film is: magical. But it\u0027s also a cruel irony because the title of the channel implies that sometimes you see a technique contributing to a film\u0027s theme, and sometimes not. Sometimes you see it, sometimes you don\u0027t. And it\u0027s true: movies don\u0027t follow a rulebook on how to convey a theme. But that doesn\u0027t mean movies are all chaos and they can\u0027t be analyzed. Movies definitely have patterns and use recurring techniques to convey a theme.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to find those patterns and bring them to the surface.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho are you and what do you do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Jack, and I\u0027m studying at the University of Virginia. And I make video essays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo Essays About What?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThematic techniques in film. I look at how certain techniques or symbols contribute to the overall theme of a film or for film in general. Here\u0027s a quick example of how I look at flight in Forrest Gump:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/zHQm7lmVcuI?t=35s\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/zHQm7lmVcuI?t=35s\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the general idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m trying to find the pattern. What does flight symbolize in film?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI started this channel over the summer, and I had ample time to work on it then. Now, school is in full swing, and I simply cannot financially afford to spend as much time on videos as I did during the summer (Probably 20 hours a video, not including research). I need income to sustain the channel. My goal is high, and I do not expect to get there anytime soon. But once I reach that amount, this channel will become my part-time job during school. I will be able to make videos at the same rate as I did over the summer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often was that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI made 10 videos in my 3-month summer break. So now, during school, 2 a month. With my goal met, that could be possible. I would guarantee one every two weeks, except maybe finals week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything else?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn case you were wondering, my favorite film is probably Juno (2007). If you have not seen that movie, then what are you doing here? Go away and watch it. Go. Now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
