    "summary": "Hi there you beautiful beasties! And for anyone new to our little group here\u0027s a quick rundown of who we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA couple of 30 something New Yorkers that decided we didn\u0027t want to wait until our hair was (completely) gray and our knees were bad to see the world. Why wait until you retire? Do you really NEED to work the 9-5 hustle? Live for the weekends while each year melts away? Hell no, you don\u0027t! In June of 2015 a plan slowly formed... to quit our jobs, sell everything, and travel for as long as possible. Nearly a year and a half later we \"clocked out\" of our NYC lifestyle, got engaged, then left on a 1 way ticket to Colombia. It\u0027s been 8 months and it\u0027s been one hell of a ride (check out our Youtube channel to follow along \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/markamanda).\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/markamanda).\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started out as a hobby (making Youtube videos and taking photos) has turned into a passion that we love. There\u0027s something very satisfying about clicking the \"publish video\" button on Youtube, and we\u0027re constantly growing and learning new ways to share our experiences around the world with you. Why? Because everyone NEEDS to know how beautiful this place, we call Earth, is! Because everyone NEEDS to know how different AND similar people are across the world. Because everyone NEEDS to know that it\u0027s possible for them to take a leap of faith and chase down whatever it is they really want in life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth is this, we\u0027re not entirely sure where we\u0027ll be one year from now... it is very likely we\u0027ll be back in NYC daydreaming about our adventures today, but we\u0027re going to fight like hell to see as many cities and experience as many cultures as we can before that day. We\u0027re already very thankful for the support we get from our loyal beasties and honestly, we don\u0027t expect or assume any of you to contribute, but if you\u0027d like to be a part of this adventure with us, just know that we\u0027ll be forever grateful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe decision to create a Patreon account wasn\u0027t easy. But after a few of our subscribers asked us why we didn\u0027t have one yet, combined with the fact that when other travelers ask us \"how long does it take to make a video\", I\u0027m a little embarrassed to say (6-8 hours). At this point, it\u0027s truly a labor of love, but if we started to make enough money to buy a coffee to caffeinate our bodies for the \"edit-fests\" that happens quite regularly, we\u0027d be very happy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, this adventure has been quite unique and an amazing opportunity. What is the biggest surprise\u00a0though? The amount of people that ask for our advice regularly. The people that tell us we\u0027ve inspired them. Those are the intangible gifts we\u0027ve received that have made our journey unforgettable! We\u0027ve had a positive impact on people lives and it makes us feel great. I think that value is definitely worth something, especially when all you see and read about is negativity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe understand that not everyone is able to support us financially. So, if you can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to, that\u0027s fine, because having you watch, like, and comment helps us out as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you DO want to be a patreon, we\u0027ve got some small perks for you! Plus, know that you will be having an incredible impact on our lives, and it just makes us feel good when people appreciate what you\u0027re doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve got big pals, goals, and aspirations! Either way, drop some \"F-Bombs\" with us and keep rockin\u0027!\u003cbr\u003e"
