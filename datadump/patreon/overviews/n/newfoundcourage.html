    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I and what am I doing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHello! My name is Curtis Campion. In February 2018 I left my job in tech, got on a plane and flew to Montreal to start building an indie video game. I had, and have one single vision in mind: I want to create a video game that I would have wanted the teenage version of me to play. This needed to be a game that he could play as a character he would identify with: one that is gay. That game is Newfound Courage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Newfound Courage about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn Newfound Courage, I will tell the story of a gay hero, Alex. Set in the future, the story begins shortly after Alex arrives as a refugee in the strange and mysterious cliffside town of Silverpine. With few young people of their own, Silverpine quickly accepts Alex and sends him to help at The Vault, a mysterious institute that contains the knowledge of a long-dead civilization. Alex must use The Vault to protect his new home from a terrible fate, while learning to understand and accept his feelings for another young man named Jake.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is this game for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis game would suit fans of games like To the Moon and Stardew Valley or Stories like Call Me by Your Name and Love Simon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat platforms will Newfound Courage be available on?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy first goal is to get Newfound Courage on Steam supporting PC and Mac. After that, and depending on support, ports to the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, iPhone and Android will be considered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen will you be releasing Newfound Courage?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am hoping to release Newfound Courage in Q1 of 2019.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support this project?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs a supporter of Newfound Courage on Patreon, you will receive regular updates, exclusive rewards and individual recognition. In addition, you\u0027ll get unprecedented access during the creation of the game, which I hope to make a collaborative and interactive experience - including opportunities to give feedback every step of the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA final note\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you do decide to support me in creating Newfound Courage, I would like to thank you endlessly. Together, we are going to create more diversity in video games and create a game with a strong gay hero who many of us will identify with.\u003cbr\u003e"
