    "summary": "Hey Guys and Gals! Welcome to my Patreon Page. This is something that I wanted to start using for a while now but had mixed feelings about it. But I decided that I should take the bull by the horns and go all out. \u003cbr\u003eAs you know I have been looking for ways to better my channel and myself. There are a number of things that Are options that are open to me with this service.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Hottest Game: being able to get the new games that are on the market will help bring in more entertaining games and content. Thus Widening my Channel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Updates: updating mouse keyboard and Getting software that is not free will allow me to output better quality content on my channel. I can achieve this by Buying software to edit and record. Alone with Drives to store and record to that are faster and allow better Recording FPS. With this I can Also take classes to learn programs that are harder to use at a local collage\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Office Space: being able to have an Office would help in so many ways its unreal. As of right now I\u0027m doing Everything in the Living room so that means when I want to or need to record I have to chase out or wait till fiance is at work. This puts a Strain on the relationship and her ability to do what she wants. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-New Equipment: With the Ability to get new equipment I can Update my current Build and be able to maximize its output. Plus I can Build a \"rendering PC\" allowing me to render and record at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Moving out: With the burden of Over priced rent payments It makes it hard to get a home that I can Really turn into a \"Place of my own\" property is pricey. With this I can get a house and Make a Studio there and be able to to what I will with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Quit My job: I have had a job since I was 14. I have NEVER Quit any of my jobs. This I would so to allow more time for content and editing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see I have a Lot on my plate and some pretty big decisions to make over time. I am leaning towards the \u0027Move Out\u0027 option, which is why I am looking into ways in which I can top up my income to ensure that I can move out sustainable and without putting myself into any bad financial issues. But to tell the truth I Don\u0027t want to talk about money anymore cause it is rather boring and I like to entertain you guys. I hope this is a hassle free way for those who want to support me can do it. So I hope you Like my Patreon page. \u003cbr\u003e"
