He strives to become a better dancer, teacher, choreographer and human each passing day as he explores the wonders of this world. May these videos bring you value by showing you his journey, the climb, the struggle, the hustle, and patience to get whatever it is you put your focus on. There will be no such thing as \"luck\" or even being \"an overnight success\" as these videos will present his grind day in and day out. He only hopes you would #createyourself for yourself, #createhappiness within yourself, then choose spill that back out into the world. As this is, the #SaneLifeofNsanity\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been dancing since 2009, a slow process, yet it\u0027s a process indeed. The video below is an example of the training I get from taking other people\u0027s classes. Currently, I\u0027m not able to post these videos on a consistent basis. Sometimes I\u0027m able to post three times in one week, other times once a week and unfortunately some weeks I\u0027m just not able to post at all. Due to the fact I use both my time and energy to create sustainability just to be able to train and take these classes, put these video up and have the bare minimum left for this thing called - life.\u00a0However, with your help and many others, I\u0027d be finally able to consistently push out these videos without having to worry how I\u0027m going make the last few bucks stretch till my next paycheck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuuRxpDm8dY?list=PLzBarHGap8TZmDcgerlUFLj2hySthzyvz\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuuRxpDm8dY\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet Me Love You by DJ Snake | Brian Abadia Choreography\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we get further as a community and deeper as a fam, I\u0027d be able to bring back the concept videos that I\u0027ve put a lot of effort into. If you take notice of when the concept videos are published apart from each other, you\u0027ll see that once again there isn\u0027t a consistent flow of work. Asking starving artists for their creative skill set while being a starving artist myself just means that it\u0027s more out of pocket money for me. This will help fund their cinematic skills, any other dancers, locations, my creative mental juices and etc. Further more as we get through the list of goals it will only get better and I\u0027d be able to give back to the community who have provided so much for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Launch Goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$5000 - 3 videos a week.
