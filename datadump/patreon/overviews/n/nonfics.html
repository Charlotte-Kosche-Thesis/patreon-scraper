    "summary": "When we started Nonfics four years ago, we aimed to fill a huge gap in the art of film criticism by specializing in nonfiction cinema. Since then our output of reviews and other discussion pieces has decreased, as it has gotten more and more difficult for our team of documentary experts and enthusiasts to contribute regularly, unpaid.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope that by going to our readers and fans and the documentary community directly rather than depend on advertising that we can return to fuller, more regular coverage of all things nonfiction film, including more reviews, news, interviews and more. The insight is still here, we just need the ability to post it. And we will be a lot more able if we can decrease our contributors\u0027 other, more mainstream movie writing gigs elsewhere so that we have the time to concentrate on this site.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to eventually post reviews of every major and a lot of minor documentary releases, in theaters and those that are direct to TV, video and streaming. That\u0027s ambitious, for sure. Additionally we would like to continue to offer only the best conversations with nonfiction filmmakers, the most authoritative documentary lists and recommendations and the most fun and thought-provoking features, including our celebrations of famous documentary fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, we also intend to resurrect our podcast, The Realness, which has been on hiatus for far too long.\u00a0And develop a core community of doc fans with exclusive content for and interaction with our most devoted patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone who has supported and read us over the past couple years and to everyone who will support and read us going further."
