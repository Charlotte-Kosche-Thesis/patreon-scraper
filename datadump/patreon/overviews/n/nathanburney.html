My name is Nathaniel Burney, and I make the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lawcomic.net/guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIlllustrated Guide to Law\u003c/a\u003e webcomic. It\u0027s all about debunking myths and explaining complex ideas with a bunch of silly pictures. So far I\u0027ve covered all of criminal law (stuff like entrapment, murder, conspiracy) and right now I\u0027m plugging away at criminal procedure (search and seizure, confessions, etc.) Constitutional law and plenty of other topics are in the works! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic\u0027s a lot of fun to do, and it\u0027s gotten tons of praise from the likes of Cory Doctorow, Harvard Law School, and the media. My readers have some really cool discussions in the \"class participation\" section, which is an added bonus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you\u0027ll be ensuring more frequent updates. This comic isn\u0027t my day job, and sometimes it can be days or even weeks until the next page can go up. A little extra cash would free me up to spend more time on putting out some quality work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will also get various rewards, based on their pledge level. Feel free to suggest other rewards you might like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry, the comic is still free to read -- I can\u0027t abide paywalls. Just think of this as a nicer kind of tip jar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support, and keep on reading!"

     "about": "Nathaniel Burney studied law at Georgetown University, where he was an editor of the American Criminal Law Review and a student practitioner defending juveniles in the District of Columbia. In between classes and the library, he worked at the Supreme Court as personal assistant to retired Chief Justice Warren Burger, and jammed in a bar band called The Ambulance Chasers. After law school, he moved to New York City to be a prosecutor in the Manhattan DA\u0027s office. After several years in Special Narcotics, he moved on to the famed Rackets Bureau, where he investigated political corruption and cleaned up a mafia-controlled labor union. Meanwhile, he lectured on criminal law at New York City schools and coached student mock trial teams. He did not play in a band, which was probably for the best. In 2006, Mr. Burney returned to the defense side, focusing mostly on complex cases like wiretaps, securities fraud, antitrust, and loitering. In addition to his Illustrated Guide to Law webcomic, he also teaches the \"Hope for Hopeless Cases\" series for West LegalEdCenter, and is training his kids to be rock stars.",
