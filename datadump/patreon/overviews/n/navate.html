    "summary": "Hello! \u00a0My name is Lauren; you may also recognize me as Navate, my online handle since I began posting my artwork online over 15 years ago.  I am a freelance dark fantasy and horror illustrator.\nI am also a veteran tutorial writer, working for ImagineFX magazine for over 6 years and also creating a series of free online tutorials, the most notable being my unfinished tutorial series on painting skin. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe goals of this Patreon account are simple:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eto support my career as a freelance artist\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eto fund  the creation of my tutorials, including expanding on and finishing my long-awaited skin tutorials\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThroughout my career, the paintings that resonated with people the most are the ones I created for myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/565b32f6e4b0c668da66a21b/t/57ad387459cc684a27efa19b/1470969972922/patreon_img1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy personal brand of fantasy and horror goes against what clients consider \u201cmarketable\u201d. Jobs are difficult to come by. When I do get client work, I\u2019m frequently trapped between giving them what they need and staying passionate about what I\u2019m painting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is a life-long dream to support myself on my personal artwork, to paint what I want and how I want instead of being constrained to what mainstream fantasy and horror demands. To share my darkly beautiful, quietly intense vision with the world; and to develop my personal IP, the Dhuriiehm, a universe I have carried with me for nearly 15 years. To make a living without the stress of being \u201chireable\u201d overshadowing my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, that dream can become a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFreelancing is not easy. Jobs come in erratically; month-to-month income is never consistent. My career was upended recently when a chronic illness kept me from working for over three years.\u00a0Now that I\u2019m well again, I am inspired and eager to\ncreate\u2014but still forced to juggle \u201creal\u201d painting jobs with my personal work. The\nprojects that inspire me to paint in the first place are left\nlanguishing on the sidelines because they don\u2019t pay my bills. I want to break\nthis cycle and make my personal work a valid and viable source of income.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis\nPatreon isn\u2019t just about giving me the freedom to create my own art. It is also\nso I can create for YOU.  Because the bottom\nline is, I could not have come this far without the support of my fans. You believe\nin what I do. The knowledge that my art inspires you, that my tutorials help\nyou, is a powerful force.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, my art is for you.  I am\nhonored for you to be a part of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e-\u00a0CREATING NEW TUTORIALS -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/565b32f6e4b0c668da66a21b/t/57ad377f44024318564d656c/1470969728471/patreon_tutorial1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMany years ago, I created a series of skin painting tutorials as a thank-you to my fans. These tutorials exploded in popularity, well beyond their intended audience. I never imagined they would become as popular as they are, and I was never able to finish them\u2014in planning the series, I bit off more than I could chew. \u00a0Life got in the way, and the time it took to put them together became prohibitive since I was offering them free of charge.  But through the years I continued to promise people I would finish what I started. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI intend to finally make good on that promise.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon will allow me to create tutorials step by step, compensated along the way, so that I can finally release them to the world.  I\u2019ve drawn up detailed plans to revise, expand, and complete the Skin Tutorials, keeping the meat of them free of charge to the public, while offering in-depth supplemental material for my Patreon backers.  Once completed, these exclusive sections will be available for purchase on Gumroad along with layered .PSD files, hi res step by step images, and possibly video (I need to meet my $100 goal to afford a computer upgrade to make this possible)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s a overview of my plans:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eExpanding\u00a0Part II: Skin Tones \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n -\u00a0revise and expand upon the original text \u003cbr\u003e\n- repaint the existing image examples \n\u003cbr\u003e\n- add 6 additional natural skin tones\n\u003cbr\u003e- add \"fantasy\" skin tones\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFuture Sections:\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0- Part III \u00a0will cover tonal variation and pigment shifts in both light and dark skin\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0- Part IV will cover how fat, muscle, and veins affect skin\u2019s appearance, how to paint skin folds, wrinkles, scars, freckles, blemishes, and texture variation across the body\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0- Part V will cover how light and the overall palette of your image affects the skin\u2019s color (for multiple skin tones)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon support I\u0027ll be able to create tutorials on many other subjects too, and you\u0027ll get a say in what I cover. \u00a0I am excited to return to the essence of an ImagineFX Q\u0026amp;A artist without the constraints of word counts and limited image steps that writing for a publication require. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e-\u00a0WHAT YOU GET AS A PATRON -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/565b32f6e4b0c668da66a21b/t/57ad385403596e14a97e0d6a/1470969941020/patreon_tutorial2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor now, my rewards are simple and affordable.
