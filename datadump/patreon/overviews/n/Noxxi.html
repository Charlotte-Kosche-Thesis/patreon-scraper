    "summary": "Hai there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was about time to update my Patreon page since a while now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo my name is \u003cstrong\u003eNoxxi Greenrose, the \"Noxxian\"\u003c/strong\u003e as some of you know already. I\u0027m a green obsessed weirdo who likes to make entertaining videos. I mostly do this because this is my life, not exactly videos or being a \"youtuber\", but to entertain people in any ways I can, and to also help people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA good year has passed since I created my Patreon page now, so I finally had time to update it and I\u0027ll keep it short and simple :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u2665 Reasons:\u003c/h4\u003eSo the few reasons I ask for support is because I wish to pursue my dreams, to entertain people and currently this happens in form of videos I make. I won\u0027t really stop this, because I really enjoy these and it also cheers me up to work on them.\u003cbr\u003eLike as I said in my Patreon video too, I won\u0027t lie as of why I need the support. While it helps me toward my dreams, I also need it to get my life together and move away and possibly be able to do this whole thing as my job, as my living! It might be a big dream, but I don\u0027t let anything stop me from reaching it... even if I have to ask for support for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a big dreamer, but I would like to change this world a bit, I wish to entertain people, make them laugh and smile. I wish to inspire a lot of people and to help them out. i wish to make people to be more open minded and have more of the now slowly uncommon \"common sense\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut for now, I wish to focus on entertaining via video making and editing, I would like to improve more and more as I go on, I wish to learn more and to create better and more awesome stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo become a bit more personal, which I mostly include for \nunderstanding my situation (even though it probably just induce pity). I\n currently have a job, but it\u0027s a job I do, because I must. i work about\n 56 hours a week for a nice sum of $500 a month, where I support my \ndisabled mom with $350 a month, the rest ~$150 what I got to keep and save as much as I can. The tricky thing is, my company will be moving away and switches to 12 hour shifts next year summer, which means I\u0027m going to lose my job/quit, because that\u0027s beyond of what I can keep up. Now you might understand why I still have financial issues regardless that I work. Also takes away a lot of my time and energy to create videos, hence I\u0027ve been pushing out videos much slowly since last year. But I try my best to keep up c:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother big reason I ask for support is because I really wish to leave this place and begin a new life, pursuing my dreams still, which would hopefully allow me to do all what I do as a living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u2665 My offer:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs some of you know, I like being equal with people and I dislike giving and offering special and exclusive content to group of people solely because they pay me or support me. While it is greatly appreciated, I will never make any content, that you have to pay for to see or enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever in future, depending how it goes, of course, I might be able to give a few new reward tiers which would just yield a couple of cool IRL gifts or such thing. I love gifting so that won\u0027t be a big problem, but for now, I can\u0027t solve such thing out of my own pocket.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for now, there is currently nothing special I can offer other than what I do currently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you again for all the support I\u0027ve gotten so far, I genuinely and really really appreciate all the support and help I\u0027ve got from all of you people, let it be any kind of support.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThank you \u2665\u003c/h3\u003e"
