    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eWelcome to the official Patreon of New Fury Media. Why should you contribute to us? Read below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi. Bradley here, I run New Fury Media. For those who may not know \nus, we\u0027re a music website dedicated to bringing you the latest music \nnews, in-depth interviews with your favorite artists across the \nspectrum, and our specialty - in-depth editorial pieces about classic \nalbums, most of which have had a profound influence on what you listen \nto now. Founded in 2013 after the dissolution of \nIntroduce Yourself Magazine, New Fury Media aims to promote intelligent \nconversation by going in-depth with both new and established musicians, \nhighlighting the albums you should be listening to, and looking back at \nthe albums that shaped the music scene. We also cover video games (mainly retro, but also newer games!) and sports, to a much lesser extent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWe do all of \nthese things and more on a, well, tiny budget. I personally work \nfull-time and then some, and much of what you see on TNF was written at 4\n AM during a 12 hour shift while working. All of our staff is volunteer, and they are highly appreciated. While I\u0027m blessed to work in a\n field that allows me to multitask, it\u0027s also not a profitable one - \nrunning this site has not made me much in the way of money. Hell, I \ndon\u0027t really know how to code or really do more than primitive web \ndesign. If anything, it\u0027s been the huge influx of traffic and the bands \nwe work with that keep us going. We have a vast staff of excellent \nphotographers and writers, some of which have gone on to write for \nbigger sites like Get Alternative, Post-Trash, and many more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the day, our mission statement is to enable music fans to discover the latest music other publications won\u0027t cover, dissect and discuss classic albums that changed the music scene, and write longer-form editorials and breakdowns that often go unseen with smaller publications. Nobody likes paywalls, and even fewer people enjoy being bombarded with intrusive advertisements. Unfortunately, one (or both) are necessary to bring in any kind of funding to websites that aren\u0027t already massive in scope - so that\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the breakdown of where the money goes to, and/or where we want it to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Server fees and hosting - we\u0027ve outgrown our server already, and are in need of a dedicated, private one to work with our growth and growing ambitions.\u003cbr\u003e*Paying staff members - TNF is a volunteer force of people who believe that high-quality photography and writing are paramount. With more contributions, our staff members would be able to get out to shows more often, and dedicate even more time to writing.\u003cbr\u003e*Advertising - growing our reach, especially on social media, costs money. \u003cbr\u003e*Podcasting Equipment - currently, we have very primitive equipment right now. Even an upgrade would be huge, and would help secure high-profile guests, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we want to do with the money, if there\u0027s enough interest:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*TNF Merch - printed t-shirts, buttons, stickers, patches, all that fancy stuff.\u003cbr\u003e*Dedicated podcast space/office - a bit of a pipe dream unless (or until) we get as big as, say, Kerrang! - but working out of a space that\u0027s not my bedroom would be beneficial to all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eLuckily,\n that tide is starting to shift. TNF is growing at a very fast rate, and\n I take pride in knowing we do things differently - but to gain even \nmore headway, we need a bit of support. I personally dislike sites that \nhave intrusive ads plastered all over, but I do realize it\u0027s a necessity\n to make any kind of money. However, I just can\u0027t bring myself to enable\n them. I also don\u0027t like hiding content behind a paywall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI know I speak for all of our staff when I say\n that doing this for a living would be amazing. I personally want to pay all of my hardworking staff members who dedicate their time and energy to something greater. Beyond this, there are also server fees and domain hostings that need to be paid, and we\u0027re in great need of a dedicated server to help support all of this. If you are interested in\n extremely high-quality music writing and want to see us cover even more\n amazing music, consider whether contributing to our campaign is the \nright move for you. If not, that\u0027s okay too! You sharing our articles \naround and being a fan means the world to us. But with just a few \nhundred dollars a month coming in, we might be able to even the score - \nwith a full-time weekly podcast, mini-documentaries, newsletters, and even more of \nthe editorial coverage you\u0027ve come to expect from us, the sky is the \nlimit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThere\u0027s plenty of incentive for you to contribute. We\u0027re starting a podcast and have a list of bands, musicians, and industry people both established and new ready to hop on as guests. We want to expand, grow, and become a leading light in the scene by doing it the right way - avoiding clickbait. By supporting us with even a $1 donation every month, you\u0027re helping to keep the lights on, and with further support, you\u0027re enabling us to pay our writers, provide even more high-quality content, and even get a few exclusive cool experiences that you can\u0027t find anywhere else. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you\u0027re not into supporting this or you\u0027re on the fence, we\u0027ll continue to stay on. We\u0027re not going anywhere. Even sharing the campaign helps a ton. But if you do choose to contribute, we\u0027ll make it worth your while by upping our game even more. A monthly (or even weekly!) newsletter? Exclusive guests on our podcast? Giveaways? All of the above. By contributing, you\u0027re supporting our continued efforts to provide high-quality music writing. You\u0027re also inspiring us to create more interesting articles. And isn\u0027t that something to feel good about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re also heavily into what our customer and fanbase wants to see for possible rewards. So, if there\u0027s something you don\u0027t see offered with the perks that you think should be, drop us a line at newfurymedia2014@gmail.com. We want to hear what you want. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, here\u0027s a few other Patreon campaigns that we either support ourselves, or think have a lot to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDan Sugarman (ex-As Blood Runs Black guitarist) is doing some cool things. 12 songs in 12 months featuring some acclaimed collaborators (Alex Hofmann of Fallujah, Angel Vivaldi, and many more). $1/month gets you a download of each song, and higher tiers get you the videos, playthroughs, even 1 hour lessons with Dan himself. Whether you\u0027re a beginning guitarist, an expert, or even a fan of the music he\u0027s creating, you can find a price tier that works for you.
