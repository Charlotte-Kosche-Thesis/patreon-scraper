In order to make more of what I make,\u003cstrong\u003e I need a room of my own.\u003c/strong\u003e Specifically, I need an artist\u0027s live-work studio which allows me to move smoothly from one form of art-making to another, and which is tailored to my cognitive disabilities and chronic medical conditions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have \u003ca href=\"http://www.fmcpaware.org/aboutfibromyalgia\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efibromyalgia\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/adult-adhd\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eADHD\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://study.com/academy/lesson/nonverbal-learning-disorder-in-adults.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNon-Verbal Learning Disorder\u003c/a\u003e.\n I manage my health in part through good food, and that\u0027s how I started \nfood blogging from time to time. Because food that\u0027s good for you should taste delicious! I love experimenting with food, modifying recipes, trying new tastes and combinations, and telling people about it.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/15/cf/af/15cfafcb617723e1b522ca15651979bb.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027ve said, I\u0027m more than a writer. I\u0027m a\nmaker. And all my life, I\u0027ve been doing it in inadequate spaces which\nare big challenges to a brain and body such as mine. Those challenges are becoming harder as I age and develop the added aches and stiffness to which flesh is heir. My\napartment is small, cramped, and not designed for someone whose work\ninvolves laying out yards of fabric one minute, operating a table\nsaw the next, working away at my computer for a bit, and then\nspending an hour fossicking about with messy cooking ingredients. In\nthis apartment, I write with a laptop on a corner of my bed. That was\nfine when I was younger, but nowadays it causes painful spasms in my\nhips. When I want to sew, I have to ferret my fabric and sewing tools\nout from the various boxes and bins hidden under things all over the\napartment. In order to cut fabric, I have to clear floor space in the\nliving room which is also the dining room and the main entranceway --\nnot an easy task. If I don\u0027t finish the cutting right away, we\nhave to step over it in order to get to anywhere else in the\napartment or even through the front door. Pins and needles go missing\nwhile that\u0027s happening, and I\u0027m forever misplacing my scissors. My\nlarge cutting mat is currently cracked irregularly in half, because\nthat was the only way to store it in the space I could find for it, which is wedged between my bed and one wall of my bedroom. In order to get to it, I have to clamber across my bed, and frankly, some days my wrists hurt too much for that. My sewing machine lives under the\ndining room table, which means I don\u0027t have room for my feet when I\nsit to table. My table saw is in storage; no working with wood for\nme at the moment. I had to stop making anything that requires adequate ventilation;\ncan\u0027t harden polymer clay or bake shrink plastic in the oven, because\nwe cook food in that oven. Can\u0027t use epoxy, because the only place\nfor the toxic fumes to go is into our lungs. Can\u0027t cast in resin for\nthe same reason. My inventory of my novels for sale is...somewhere,\nin boxes, I think maybe under...something. I have nowhere to file\ncontracts and manuscripts. My printer is sort of beside and sort of\nunder the dining table, against a wall. And yes, I have dropped food\ninto it. Pens, pencils, paints, glues, paintbrushes, solvents?\nThey\u0027re around. Buttons, rivets, elastic, specialty needles? Some of\nthem are in a toolbox on the wall in the kitchen. Some are on a\nshelving unit in my bedroom that\u0027s shared with clothing and books.\nFor the past few months, I\u0027ve only been able to find two of my many\nsizes of crochet needles, so projects are going unfinished. I have so\nlittle counter space in the kitchen that it\u0027s a wonder I cook at all.\nMy pots and pans are overflowing the shelving unit I managed to cram\nin there, and there\u0027s nowhere to mount my knife-sharpener.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2011 I became a university professor at the ripe age of 50. Before \nthat, my partner and I were homeless and hungry for a couple of years, \nboth too ill with different undiagnosed chronic health issues to \nwork. But now I make a good income. With it, I support the two of us while my partner works towards better functionality. I pay the many medical expenses for us both where my insurance plan doesn\u0027t cover them. I send some \nmoney every month to my mother in Canada, who has her own health issues \nand whose pension is not quite enough to make ends meet. Financially, I\u0027m doing a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e better than I was. We eat well, not the one meal per day that was so often the case in the hungry years. I can afford basic art materials and supplies. What I cannot do is save enough to get myself the live/work space I need more with every passing year. The paycheque\u0027s gone by the middle of the month, and then I\u0027m coasting on deficit, i.e credit. And that\u0027s not bad at all. I can keep living like this, as so many people do. But I cannot become a more productive artist this way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why I\u0027m so thankful for my Patreon supporters. With the top-up I receive each month from you folks, I was able last year to retain a part-time\nvirtual assistant to help me manage the administrative details of life as an artist. (Those are a huge disability barrier to someone with my brain\nchemistry.) She\u0027s amazing. It\u0027s probably no coincidence that since I found her, my productivity has noticeably increased. I wrote and sold a passel of short stories this past summer and fall. I\u0027ve been commissioned to work on two new exciting writing projects! No, I can\u0027t give you details as yet. It\u0027s killing me to keep quiet, but I must. I also created two sewing patterns for felt mermaid dolls and put them up in my store. I\u0027ve become better at creating syllabi and lesson plans for my courses, which means I\u0027m much less stressed and frazzled, which means I hurt less (stress increases fibromyalgia pain). That\u0027s the difference a monthly boost of $300 to $400 makes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next improvement I\u0027m working towards is a proper live/work space; an artist\u0027s studio, not\nan apartment. Someplace where I can move smoothly from writing to\ncooking to photographing my food to sewing to art, because I\u0027ll have\ndedicated spaces where I can set up my tools and store my materials.\nWhere I can have a cutting table at the right height, so I don\u0027t have\nto sit in the splits on the floor, hunched over yards of fabric. (Believe me, when you\u0027re 57, that\u0027s not a position you\nwant to be in for hours at a time.) Where I don\u0027t have to delay\nstarting or finishing projects, because I won\u0027t always be misplacing\nmy tools and materials. Where my dining room table is ready to lay\nmeals out on because it\u0027s not piled a foot high in paper, tools, and\nhalf-finished projects. Where once every year or two, I might have an\nopen studio and sale of the objects I\u0027ve made. Where I can invite my\nfellow authors to join me for regular writing dates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I want to buy instead of rent, you ask? For one thing, I\u0027ll\nneed to be able to alter the premises. Landlords tend not to look kindly\n upon their tenants taking a sledge hammer to the walls, no matter how \nnon weight-bearing those walls are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Some of it, anyway)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--finish Blackheart Man, the novel-in-progress.

I\u0027ve written the first 25 pages of the script. I need to have all my research material for it organized and in one place so I can work on it without losing hours to sifting through the melee of our apartment.\u003cbr\u003e--create a small sculptural tableau inspired by \u003ca href=\"http://beastsofthesouthernwild.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBeasts of the Southern Wild\u003c/a\u003e. The idea for it has been tapping on my shoulder for two years now. Just today I finished a maquette of one of the pieces. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/b9/41/e1/b941e19c43465ea1603191297f6d0d55.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s about 1/5th the size I imagine the actual piece will be, and it looks more like a pig with horns than an aurochs, but hey; maquettes are for working out details like that. Besides, it\u0027s all huggable and squishable. I\u0027d love to have a proper cutting table for cutting out the pieces, somewhere to use my sewing machine, and a working surface with tool storage and a nearby sink so I can do the messy work of making the wire armature and stuffing, painting, gluing and sanding the elements of the tableau.\u003cbr\u003e--do better photo documentation of my cooking for my food blogging. That needs a properly lit light box and a surface to put it on.\u003cbr\u003e--do simple cooking videos.

It allows people to give artists ongoing encouragement for doing what they do. And that in itself is a priceless gift.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs to what I\u0027ll do via my Patreon site, I\u0027m making this up as I go along. I will share snippets of and information about the stuff I create in all media with you. I\u0027ll make more of my recipes and cooking methods available, in more detail, with better documentation. When I do so, I\u0027ll give my Patreon subscribers advance release of new recipes and videos, and make them public a few months later. I may release audio recordings of me reading food-related scenes from my fiction or the fiction of others.There may be the occasional high-resolution digital food photo, or a chapbook with some of my recipes collected in it. I\u0027ll blog here from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my supporters will get advance peeks at my writing-in-progress; snippets from novels and short stories, hot off the press and largely unedited. (They have to be; if I release final versions out into the world, I won\u0027t be able to get them published, because editors consider that a first publication, even if only a few people see it.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://nalohopkinson.com/uploads/4/2/0/9/4209008/75353_orig.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
