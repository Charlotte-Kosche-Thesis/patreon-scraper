    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eI am a writer, working on non-fiction books helping people harness their creativity and discover their full potential. Several years ago, I went through a goal exercise for 6 months. Many times a week, I spent an hour or more writing out what I wanted my life to look like in 5 years, 1 year, and 6 months. Authoring several self published books was the single highest goal repeated again and again. I am writing because \u003cstrong\u003eI refuse to give up on my dreams\u003c/strong\u003e, or simply sit back waiting for them to happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I have worth sharing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was 6 years old, I was diagnosed with ADHD and slight Dyslexia. Did that stop me? Is my ability fixed, or can it grow? After 8 years in college, I finally graduated with my bachelors degree, while learning valuable techniques and strategies to focus my creative brain. The doctors diagnosis did not stop me! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to neroplacticity and the brain\u0027s ability to literally rewire itself, \u003cstrong\u003eour capacity is NOT FIXED or static\u003c/strong\u003e, but is limited by our willingness to grow and learn. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs it possible to change the way our minds work? Can we increase our ability to focus, or even harness creativity? I have been pushing into those questions most of my life, reading countless books, trying out new techniques, and talking to other creative people in my pursuit for answers.  This book will document those techniques I have found effective. \u00a0I will also overall strategies to tap into your creativity while focusing it towards your pursuits. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will this book evolve?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach week I will \u0027publish\u0027 up to three chapters of my working draft via google docs. All of my supporters in Creative Community levels and above will be able to read and immediately implement the techniques and strategies from that chapter. You can also comment right on the page, suggest edits, and provide overall direction for the work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI need your help to make the best book possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of the written content, Video Sponsors and above will get a weekly video companion of each chapter.
