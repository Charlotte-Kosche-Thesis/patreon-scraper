No, not the pretty one beside you, you. Because you, dear viewer, could become my patron. However much you care to donate/patronize, it will help both with my crippling caffine addiction, and to help make sure I can write instead of doing those icky grown up things, like get a job. I intend to stay a child for as long as possible, and I think with a little help I can keep it up until I\u0027m at least done with college. The best idea, probably not, but tally ho and sally forth!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if anypony can think of some reward they would like for any donations more than 5 dollars, let me know. I\u0027m open to ideas, as long as they fall in my woefully limited skill set.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a secondary note, I\u0027m going to keep a running list of all active stories.

I\u0027m a total geek, and will chatter at you for hours about random Star Wars trivia (screw you, the EU still exists), and how it relates to the way the Borg caused the Butlerian Jihad. I try to avoid any kind of political groups, since none of them fit well with my worldview, and I\u0027m a confirmed pessimist. That\u0027s about all the information you need to know me, I\u0027m not a very interesting person outside of the limited spheres I move through.",

If I can make 100+ for what amounts to about a chapter worth of writing, then I would be able to not only set aside a good chunk to help pay for college, I can also put funds towards upgrading stuff. Honestly, most of that upgrading would be selfish, like modifying my computer setup to one more integrated and mobile, it is very possible that being able to work on stories in more places, more often, I may be able to increase my production rate. This is not a sum I\u0027m willing to make promises for, because I honestly don\u0027t expect it to be reached at any point.
