    "summary": "Since January 2016, Nerds of Prey has been working diligently to bring you a show that provides an added, necessary voice for nerdy Black women/women of color within the podcasting atmosphere. Since our premiere we have watched our platform slowly, but steadily, grow into a reputable voice within the Black nerd community. We sincerely want to continue to bring our audience a fresh perspective on comics, gaming, anime, movies/television, cosplay, and all of the things that encompass nerd culture, for as long as we possibly can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNerds of Prey has proven to be an incredible experience for us as well as a worthy investment. Not only have we made ourselves heard, we\u0027re cultivating a very special community of thoughtful, brilliant nerdy friends who want to see necessary changes within the culture that we all hold so dear. We\u2019re off to a beautiful start! However, the four of us \u2013 Shannon, CG, Lauren, and Mel \u2013 want to see our labor of love grow into something as unstoppable as our voices. We need your help in order to make that a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePodcasts are free (this one is, at least\u2026and it\u2019ll remain that way). Producing a podcast, however, is not. We would love to be able to raise enough money to not only cover the cost of production, but to improve the quality of a show that is so full of passion, knowledge, fun, and entertainment. Any donation you can provide would not only be an investment in Nerds of Prey, but a show of support for a voice that is too often marginalized and overlooked in nerd culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo! With all that in mind, here\u2019s what we need!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduction:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are in definite need of an upgrade in terms of both hardware and software. Bare minimum: we need a reliable Skype recorder ($28.00 + tax). We are currently using a program that works\u2026sometimes. The four of us work during the day and have other projects that require our attention. We don\u2019t have an excess of time to re-record when the program fails to do its one basic function. A reputable, reliable program would make this less of an issue! In addition, we could use a decent mic ($70.00)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are so many voices that need to be heard and we want to reach them. As we aim to expand the Nerds of Prey name, we would love to have equipment that allows us to record on-site interviews during conventions and events ($400.00 total)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFile Hosting:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA Libsyn membership that allows all of our episodes to be accessible is $20/month. This works for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMedia:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a website ($8/month). It\u2019s simple. It\u2019s full of great stuff. We would love to upgrade, expand, and fully protect it ($200/year).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFan-based content\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003eNerds of Prey is often asked to review comics, games, and movies outside of our personal budgets. We aim to give the good people what they want, but trips to the movie theater, comic book shop, and Game Stop are not cheap. We\u2019re not asking for funds to cover the entities that we were already planning to consume, but we\u2019d be far more willing to\u2026 a-hem\u2026\u003cem\u003eexperience \u003c/em\u003emovies like Batman vs. Superman with your help.  When you include additional comics and games, we\u2019re looking at $300/year, minimum, between the four of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrimary Composer:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe music you hear on our show is by a phenomenal artist named brandon*. It\u2019s gorgeous. brandon* is a passionate, knowledgeable musician and we\u2019d love to be able to pay him deservedly for future Nerds of Prey endeavors! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrowth Goals:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore content from the Nerds of Prey and paid contributors! Traveling to conventions around the nation! Merchandise! Events! We want Nerds of Prey to be an international voice and hangout (and to be able to cover important costs as they come along)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we reach our overall goal, we will broadcast a celebratory LIVE Drunken Sound-Off!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know that with your help, Nerds of Prey can reach amazing heights. Let\u0027s be awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003eNerds of Prey\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e**Please note: all perks are one-time only (unless otherwise stated) and are dispersed after the first payment is successfully drafted**\u003c/strong\u003e"
