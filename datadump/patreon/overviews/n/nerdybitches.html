    "summary": "Hey B*tches!! We are Liz and Heather, co-creators of Nerdy Bitches Podcast, and our show has been around since January 2015 and we absolutely LOVE podcasting our way through geek culture! Our show focuses on pop culture (including movies, TV, nerd news), books (Book Club!), and all other aspects of Nerd Life! We frequently have other nerdy bitches on the show to bring in other experiences and also to learn about areas that we don\u0027t currently know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also love interacting with our listeners, other podcasts, and the entire nerding community! We are always looking for ways to expand our show and to give back to the podcasting community! And we need your help!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, we would love to get to a point where the basic show costs are covered so that we can focus our energy (and money!) on growing the show and continually striving to improve the quality of our show, from both a content and technology standpoint. Your support beyond the basic costs of the show will allow us to design more merch, hold giveaways, and generally market ourselves to a wider audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of our goals is to give back to other shows that don\u0027t have the support they need to do awesome things in the world at large. \u003cstrong\u003eWe plan to put 20% of our \u003cem\u003enet profits\u003c/em\u003e from any donations or sponsorships straight back into the community by giving directly to another independent show each month to help them also grow and prosper!\u003c/strong\u003e We will let you know any time we donate money to another show so that you will know that you have helped that show flourish!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have some big ideas for the future and really want to see what we can do to make a difference!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisit our website at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nerdybitches.com\"\u003ehttp://www.nerdybitches.com\u003c/a\u003e to listen and subscribe in your favorite podcast app!
