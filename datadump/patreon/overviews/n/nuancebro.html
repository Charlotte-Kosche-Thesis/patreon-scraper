    "summary": "Welcome to the Nuance Bro Patreon page! Thank you so much for your consideration in supporting me and my channel. I decided to make this Patreon because all of my videos have been demonetized at some point or another and this makes it harder for me to keep up financially in order for me to make videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have created an award tier system and have added Discord awards! If you don\u0027t know what Discord is it\u0027s an app that allows us to talk in real time with our Mics similar to programs of the past like Teamspeak and Ventrilo. I\u0027m pretty much in the Nuance Bro Discord whenever I am on my computer so consider joining and be a part of the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways with your support on Patreon I hope to bring you more high quality content more frequently. I\u0027m looking to expand Nuance Bro to be able to travel across the country covering events and possibly internationally should any important events be happening. So please consider supporting this channel and counter YouTube censorship!\u003cbr\u003e"
