It has always been my biggest dream and goal to be a singer. My first time I went on stage was at our local church when I was three years old. I fell in love with music. I remember when I was a little girl and I would always be singing throughout my day, even at school. Lol. I put a hold on my dreams when a series of unfortunate events unfolded before my very eyes. I lost everything and everyone I knew. It was the darkest hour of my life. But as through every troublesome moment in my life, I decided to stay strong and never give up. God helped me through every single bump in my road. He sent me one beautiful hearted person who from the second he met me believed in me no matter what. He helped me remember what a strong fighter I am for my dreams. I have been through the worst of days to the best of days. I have seen the most horrible things to the most wonderful things. I don\u2019t just want to be a singer, I want to make a change that is definitely needed in today\u2019s society. I want to be there for people who may be struggling through the same things I struggled through. I want to make a difference in the world. I know the best way for me to do all this is through my singing. My music is real, I write about things I\u2019ve seen and experienced myself in life. I\u2019m not planning to hold back in my music. I have endless ideas and projects. I write my own music, my own words, I compose each song my self, produce it and record them myself as well as edit each video. My goal is to make singing my career! My platform is YouTube currently. With your help I will be able to make my dreams come true. I will be able to put at least three videos on YouTube having a constant flow of new creative ideas. As I always say everyone who helped me, I will help them too. I will remember all of you wonderful people when my dreams come true, and most of all I will be eternally grateful! Thank you from the bottom of my heart to potential and current Patrons - Or in other words my friends! -Natalie Merdame\u003cbr\u003eYouTube:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3QWZAgc7gH8nc2n0R0hOSw\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3QWZAgc7gH8nc2n0R0hOSw\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTwitter: @NatalieMerdame \u003cbr\u003e\nInstagram: @nataliemerdame\u003cbr\u003e\nSpotify: Natalie Merdame\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nCDBaby:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/nataliemerdame2/DiamondBlue\"\u003ehttps://store.cdbaby.com/cd/nataliemerdame2/DiamondBlue\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
