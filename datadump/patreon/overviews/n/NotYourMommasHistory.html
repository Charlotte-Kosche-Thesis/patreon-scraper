    "summary": "Welcome! I\u0027m a Historical Interpreter and Living Historian.\u00a0 I have interpreted stories of enslavement in 26 states, 87 schools and over 45 sites.\u00a0 My goal is to tell the story of enslavement throughout America in schools, museums and historical sites using my specialized programs, lectures, costuming, touch objects, hearth cooking and interpretation.\u00a0 Representation of accurate portrayals of Africans in America on 18th and 19th century sites is an important step in creating and maintaining a well rounded narrative.\u00a0I spend anywhere from 20 to 32 hours a week researching and sewing, 15 to 25 hours a week interpreting and lecturing, and an additional 12-20 hours a week traveling to programs and sites.\u00a0This has turned into a full time job for me, and to continue my work I need the help of patrons.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a monthly membership that has the potential to fund all that I do. I want to go to schools and historical sites that cannot afford\nto pay for my travel or fee, I need to maintain and replace my historical clothing (remember I am\nin costume 3-5 times a week, 47 weeks out of the year and I go through socks and shifts like water), I want to increase the production value of my YouTube videos so that I can connect with wider audiences, I hope to continue learning through conferences and workshops, and I need overhead (keep the lights on and the sewing machine running).\u00a0 I hope to do all this with the patronage of those who support my work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many different levels of patronage from $1 to $500 a month, and as a thank you for your patronage I offer rewards at each tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are unable to become a patreon at this point remember\nthat support comes in many different ways. \nMy youngest supporters send me their art, but most of those who follow my work support me by just sending an encouraging message or email. It has taken a village to get me this far, and it was done through hundreds of small acts of kindness.\u00a0 Thank you for all the support you all have given me throughout my career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
