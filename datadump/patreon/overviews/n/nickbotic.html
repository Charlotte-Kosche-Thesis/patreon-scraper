    "summary": "You know that feeling you get when you\u0027re walking up your basement stairs and it feels like someone, or something, is right behind you? Or maybe the feeling when your toes are hanging off the edge of your bed, and the thought runs through your head that at any moment, something could grab you? I\u0027d be remiss if I didn\u0027t mention the feeling that surely everyone has felt at one point or another, the feeling that you\u0027re being watched?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Nick Botic, and I\u0027ve made it my life\u0027s work to instill those feelings into people. I want my words to be the reason someone checks their closet or under their bed before going to sleep, to make sure there are no long-dormant monsters or entities of unfathomable terror lurking within. I want my stories to encourage people to double and triple-check the locks on their doors and windows, because the thought that some masked psychopath with ill-intentions could be prowling their neighborhood is nearly too much to handle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, I write horror stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027ve been writing for, roughly, the last 15 years, it wasn\u0027t until just two years ago that I began taking it seriously, that I really found my niche. As a long-time avid horror fan, I began finding myself underwhelmed with the offerings we fans had been receiving in the way of TV and film. I then began browsing around the dark cesspool we all know and love to hate, the Internet. There, I found multiple communities dedicated to horror stories. At this point, I hadn\u0027t written anything substantial in a few years, so I thought I\u0027d try my hand at a short horror story. To my surprise, the story reached nearly a million people and won several accolades from different online outlets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was after not only that small taste of success, but truly, the comments I received on the story that made me want to write full-time. \"Thanks, I wasn\u0027t planning on sleeping tonight anyways!\" \"Welp, that\u0027s what I get for reading this at 2 am in the dark.\" \"U just gave me my new biggest fear\" (all copied and pasted verbatim from different postings of the story).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thought that I was instilling this fear, this most primal of insecurities into people was intoxicating. I knew the feeling of sitting in the dark watching a brand new horror movie, the anxiety I got when awaiting something to jump out of the shadows that surrounded the poor protagonist, and I realized that THAT is what I want to do with my life. I want to entertain, I want to SCARE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince my first story took off, I have started a website (nickbotic.com), and have amassed a few thousand Twitter followers with whom to share my work. My stories are amongst the most anticipated on the popular horror-themed subreddit \"NoSleep\" (to whom I owe everything. Without NoSleep, I never would have realized what I wanted to do with my life. I love you all.), and have had my work narrated by some of the most talented voice actors YouTube has to offer. As of just recently, however, the narrator MrCreepyPasta and I have decided to work together, and he is now officially the \"voice\" of \"Nick Botic Horror\". I also self-published a book, an anthology of my earliest work called \"The First Collection\" (clever, right?), which I will be offering in my rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I\u0027m on Patreon to implore you to spend your hard earned money on me is simple: I want to write full-time. I want to make this a career. Many ventures have gone through the mess I call my brain in the past, but this, writing horror, scaring people, is the one that makes the most sense to me. If you aid me in my quest to write full-time, I promise that I will return the favor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please, join me on this quest to scare and be scared, to entertain and be entertained, to work, to create, to tease those things that hide in the shadows and go bump in the night. Join me as Nick Botic Horror becomes a recognized name in the world of fear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love you all,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNick Botic\u003cbr\u003e"
