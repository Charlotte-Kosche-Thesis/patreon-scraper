    "summary": "Dear friends,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nwelcome to this new venture of mine and thankyou for reading these words. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a painter and I also own and operate my own radically sustainable fashion \u0026amp; jewellery brand, Raintower. Me and my colleague Karin make everything by hand using recycled textiles only which makes Raintower one of the most progressive and earth friendly fashion options out there. Read about our methods and policy in depth\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://raintower.se/shop/sustainability/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and read the story of the brand\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://raintower.se/shop/story-process/\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to give patrons the behind-the-scenes version of everything I do as an artist -- you\u0027ll see more of my studio, my supplies, sewing machines, creating jewellery and more! I\u0027m a bit of recluse and private person by nature but it\u0027s becoming clear to me that with the current state of the world community and sharing is more important than ever. I\u0027m convinced it will be amazing and allow me to develop as an artist and activist and become person who can give back more and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this page is a\u00a0step towards pursuing my soul cause which is contributing to a caring, connected and sustainable community of human beings who listen to one another and take care of mother earth. I believe that halting consumerism and the alienation it brings is a very important part of this process and hope to make this idea as popular as vegetarianism and veganism because it\u0027s just as important to the planet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn the spirit of honesty and openness \u2014 I\u2019ve been earning way below minimum wage ever since i\u2019ve been a full time creative, which is many years now. I make art, garments and jewels that go out to people all over the world. But because everything is personally and ethically handmade production is small and it\u2019s very difficult to reach an income level that bears any resemblance to what most people consider reasonable. Even when sales are good. A monthly income from patreon would enable me invest a little bit in my art and my brand, something I have never been able to afford!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour voice will be just as important no matter your monetary contribution (if any) and I will not be putting pay walls on my content with the exception of occasional posts that have a more personal nature. I\u0027m not here to make you pay for stuff, I\u0027m here hoping to build something, share art and ideas. If you are able to contribute financially and would like to do so that is completely amazing and I\u0027m beyond words grateful. But you don\u0027t have to in order to be part of this and I am very sympathetic to the fact that not everyone can\u00a0\u2665\u00a0Contributing any amount is huge and warmly appreciated no matter the number.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eNothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.\u003c/em\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003eVictor Hugo\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, monsieur. And I truly believe the time has come for this idea -- downshift, emphasis on art and softer values (love!!!), away from opinions and divisiveness and onto visions and togetherness. Thankyou."

     "description": "living the art life hones your frugality skills something fierce! this is my monthly expenses and that includes everything, rent, bills, food. i love rice, potatoes and ramen which helps ;) i worry about this number every month though so getting this level of support would be an absolute dream come true and enable me to take a next step in my work. i\u0027ll discuss with patrons but here are a few things i could do with this type of monthly support:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- buy a \u003cstrong\u003esewing machine\u003c/strong\u003e that can handle delicate fabric and finally get raintower underwear / intimates going. i have so many ideas for this and it\u0027s super important because i would ofcourse make everything from pre-loved and gently cleaned fabric that doesn\u0027t come with all the chemicals of newly manufactured textile. chemicals you don\u0027t want near important body parts o__O\u003cbr\u003e- invest in \u003cstrong\u003eart supplies\u003c/strong\u003e and create bigger, juicier paintings! i love working with watercolour and as long as you keep the format small it\u0027s not a pricey medium. i do dream of creating large scale works though, and at this level that would be possible!\u003cbr\u003e- create \u003cstrong\u003ejewellery backstock and grow my collection\u003c/strong\u003e. due to the cost of precious metal my jewellery line is small and mostly made to order. this means it\u00a0can take \u00a0weeks to ship certain jewels, especially rings because of sizing consideration. this level of support would enable me to have a couple of everything in stock at all times and be a lightning fast jewellery shipper and creator. i would love that!",
