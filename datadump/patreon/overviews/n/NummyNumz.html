I am a free-lance illustrator, making her way in the world with part of her work coming from a lovely little community that likes to see things find themselves in...peculiar situations! I have been drawing since I was a little thing, but only really got into the endosoma (or vore as it\u0027s mostly known!) side of art just a few years ago!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI absolutely love to create art for others through commission, it makes me really happy to bring ideas to life for others! I would love to continue doing that, and I hope I will for a long time!! However, I am a full-time artist, and because of this my time gets swallowed up (oop!) by non-personal work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhy a patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a people pleaser, and love making people happy. However, I\u0027d love some time to draw for myself! And also to do requests for others that can\u0027t quite afford a full commission! With your help I can make it more likely to push out more personal pieces and popular requests! \u003cstrong\u003eThe only catch is...it\u0027s all SFW, clean and non-fatal vore!\u003c/strong\u003e I like the fluffy, harmless side of things. Each month I plan to make a poll based on requests I get, and folks can vote on what they\u0027d like to see! My plan is the higher the pledge the more your vote counts! But ANYONE who pledges has the ability to have their voice heard!\u003cdiv\u003eThis patreon will also include sketches and full resolutions of my art each month, including commissions! These will be handed out via a download link, to prevent false pledges from reaping the benefits off of other, honest folk!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eSo how does the process work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u2022 Each month I take suggestions for ideas on patreon! Patrons and even non-patrons can put in their ideas!!\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Folks will also chime in, letting me know which of the ideas they like the most! If they suggest an idea already suggested, I will add that back to the original idea posted ahead of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 I will pick between five or six ideas with the most votes, and they will be entered into the final voting stage! Then, the final ideas will be up for voting by patrons only! The higher the pledge, the more votes applied to the one you favor!\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Once votes are tallied, the winner becomes the finished piece of the month!!\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 The higher the amount I earn a month, the higher the quality of the piece!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what if you reach $500 a month???\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWell, that is a HUGE DEAL. In that case, I\u0027ll host a request stream every month! Folks can request fanart ideas to be done! And I\u0027ll do sketches or colored sketches!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really want to thank everyone who has supported me so far.
