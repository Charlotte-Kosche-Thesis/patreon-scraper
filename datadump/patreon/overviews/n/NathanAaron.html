It\u0027s a tale of risk, adventure, faith, struggle, and of course hope. Joniah moves through several dangerous, and frightening situations as he comes to understand that the universe truly is working in his favor if he will but believe and follow the signs that he is given. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cem\u003eCurrently seeking publisher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecond Manuscript\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Women of Jackson County\u003c/em\u003e -  This is a story about 3 women residing in Jackson County, West Virginia (loosely following a time period between the 1950\u0027s through the late 1980\u0027s), who have been given spiritual gifts that are associated with mediums and channelers rather than those of the \"Bible Belt\" in which they live.  It\u0027s a coming of age story that follows two young women and their grandmother throughout their lives and tells the story of how each of them personally reconciles these gifts in a time and place where it is less than popular to have them, and how they come together as a family to use their gifts to help heal the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cem\u003eCurrently seeking  publisher.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Big Gay Hymn Sing\u003c/strong\u003e is a safe place for those who have felt excluded and rejected by their spiritual homes because of who they are, yet still want to sing hymns that brought comfort so long ago. This is not a professional choir, as we are an informal community of gay, straight, trans, men, and women who want to come together to reconnect with the music that has made up the fabric of our faith. We meet quarterly for events 4 times a year.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSee the link to our \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TBGHS/\"\u003eFacebook Page here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe American Peace Walk\u003c/strong\u003e is a new project that is in the development stage.  Our mission is to gather people from all religions, races, genders and creeds to create a safe space to walk by setting an intention of peace for our communities, our cities, our states, and our country. We at the American Peace Walk believe that change begins right where we are and by doing the next right thing. It is our hope that as we come together to walk as one group with the intention to spread peace that it will help to change the collective consciousness in some small way.
