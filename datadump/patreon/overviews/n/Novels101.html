    "summary": "So, as you may have guessed, my name is Neil Herndon. I am a best-selling author with novels in several genres. I have a Masters Degree in creative writing. I\u0027m a contributor at Forbes.com, my work has been seen at USAToday.com, and I\u0027ve been the subject of an article at Publishers Weekly. Before entering high school, I won the Illinois Young Authors short-story competition four times. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have extensive workshop experience, helping other authors find imperfections and plot holes in their work, as well as seeking to remedy issues in my own. This, combined with my advanced degree, my publishing history, as well as a healthy addiction to movies, TV, and video games, has given me the tools to identify and accentuate traits that make a good story great. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is about helping \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0write.\u00a0Have you always wanted to write a novel? Do you have a project in the works and need some help? Let me lend a hand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs publishing reaches wider markets across new technology, it\u0027s easier than ever for an author to get their work out to the masses. Along the way, everyone, including myself, could use some assistance. A good ear to bounce ideas off of, working out a story issue, or for some, build from the ground up. Whether your project is already going, you haven\u0027t started, or simply don\u0027t know how to begin, my tips will give you an edge. At the higher levels, you get\u00a0all the benefits of an advanced degree without the hassle of going to school.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a lot more to writing a full-length novel than most people realize. Point-of-view, genre, character, story arc, conflict, resolution, sequels, outlines, dialogue, the ending, detail, setting, description, style, and probably ten more vital components, each of which requires understanding and proficiency in order to use them properly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of this as a masters class for writing. The more you pay, the more in-depth your class will be. Don\u0027t need that much help? That\u0027s fine. Ready to dive into the deep end of the pool? Sign up. Questions will be answered. Journeys will be taken. How far we go is limited only by your imagination.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t have to get a fancy degree to be a great writer, but that doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t get a little help along the way."
