    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003e on hiatus \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst off, \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e for your support.\u00a0 Presumably you got here from my email, or maybe my Facebook page, or because you stumbled across me somewhere on the far reaches of the Internet.\u00a0 However you got here, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA little more than two years ago I decided to get over my fears and stepped out on an open mic stage for the first time.\u00a0 I had finally learned two cover songs and felt like I could play them with a reasonable degree of proficiency. Turns out you can\u0027t die of fear and so I kept going.\u00a0 Fast forward to now and I\u0027ve recorded and released a self-funded EP that\u0027s been played on radio stations across the country (and Europe!) and helped me earn opportunities like opening for Joan Osborne and playing festivals with dozens of other songwriters.\u00a0 More importantly, it means that my songs are getting heard, and hopefully, HOPEFULLY, helping other people with their feelings.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I recorded that EP, I picked the three strongest songs I had at the time and got them down in a day.\u00a0 I was fortunate enough to have Justin Douglas at the helm and we made the EP the best we could with the constraints of time and budget we were facing. I\u0027m ready to start work on a full-length project.\u00a0 I\u0027ve got some of the songs written and I\u0027m constantly working on more.\u00a0 I\u0027ve got studio time set and a tentative release date in late April.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut here\u0027s the deal: I\u0027m an independent, emerging songwriter.  What those fancy-sounding words mean is that I\u0027m somewhat reliant on the support of those people who like what I do.  That support can take dozens of forms from \"Liking\" my Facebook page, coming to see me play live, telling your friend/co-worker/random acquaintance that likes folk music about me, and (but not limited to) pitching a few dollars (or a twenty) in the tip jar. You could think of this like a digital tip jar. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you sign up to be a patron, you\u0027ll get access to new songs before anyone else does.\u00a0 You\u0027ll see some of the behind the scenes stuff that goes into the making of the record that won\u0027t be published anywhere else. If enough people join in, you\u0027ll all get to hear the record before anyone else, and maybe we\u0027ll even have a nice online party to listen to it together.\u00a0 No matter what, you\u0027ll be supporting your local, independent, emerging artist in a very direct way."
