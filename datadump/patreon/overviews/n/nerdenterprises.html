If I help as many people as possible get what they want, then I will have everything I ever want in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat was in 2009, and now I can share with you that my mentor was right. I have a good life, and I am surrounded by good people, and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for the life I have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have moved on from my previous subscription based site.
