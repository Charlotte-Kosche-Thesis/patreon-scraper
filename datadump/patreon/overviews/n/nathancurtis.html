    "summary": "I\u0027m Nathan Curtis, aka Tortoise. I make puzzles. I\u0027ve been mashing words (and numbers, pictures, shapes, etc.) together for the amusement of others casually since 2006 or so, and more seriously since 2011. My primary areas of expertise are variety crossword types (of the sort you might see in the Sunday \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/index.html?page=home\u0026amp;_r=0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNew York Times\u003c/a\u003e or the Saturday \u003ca href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/puzzle/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWall Street Journal\u003c/a\u003e) and puzzle hunts (of the sort you might see at the \u003ca href=\"http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMIT Mystery Hunt\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://playdash.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDASH\u003c/a\u003e, or in \u003ca href=\"http://pandamagazine.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eP\u0026amp;A Magazine\u003c/a\u003e), though I also dabble in math and logic puzzles. Some of my puzzles have appeared in Will Shortz\u0027s WordPlay and the Enigma, and I have helped write and edit puzzle hunts for the \u003ca href=\"http://momath.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNational Museum of Mathematics\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"http://www.baphl.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBoston Area Puzzle Hunt League\u003c/a\u003e. To find out more, you can check out some of my puzzles over at my website, \u003ca href=\"http://www.tortoiseshellstudio.com/puzzles/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTortoiseshell Studio\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, there aren\u0027t many outlets for freelance constructors to get variety puzzles published. The newspapers and magazines out there only publish so many puzzles a year, and they have hundreds of submissions (thousands if you include standard crossword puzzles) by dozens of constructors to pick from. If I want to get more puzzles out there, self-publishing is the way to go. And that\u0027s where you and Patreon come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be writing puzzles, and every two weeks or so I will release a pack of puzzles to my supporters. Each pack will contain at least two puzzles, and with a couple exceptions, I will publish no more than three puzzle packs per month. The exception to the every-other-week rule comes into play if I write a puzzle hunt, which I might break into two or more packs to be released in quick succession. I anticipate writing a puzzle hunt of this nature maybe once a year, so most of the time you can plan on weekly releases. Most of the puzzles will be variety crossword types as I mentioned before; examples include Marching Bands, Pathfinder, Some Assembly Required, and cryptic crosswords. I will also throw in the occasional logic puzzle or whatnot to mix things up, but variety crosswords are my bread and butter, and you can expect to see at least one in each puzzle pack.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should you support my puzzle-writing habit? For one thing, I think I\u0027m rather good at it. I\u0027ll be the first to admit that my early puzzles were a bit rough, but I\u0027ve been at it for a few years, and based on the progress I\u0027ve made, I\u0027m continuing to improve. If you like crosswords but wish they came with more of a twist, I think you\u0027ll enjoy my puzzles. And while I will continue to post puzzles for free on my website, supporters will see more puzzles, and get them sooner. Also, your support will allow me to employ test-solvers on a regular basis, smoothing out the wrinkles that were in some of my earlier puzzles. In the long run, if I can maintain a consistent output and there is sufficient support, I may move to a monthly subscription model, and perhaps even get an editor to go over my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s it in a nutshell. If you like puzzles, I hope you will consider supporting my work. And thanks for taking the time to check me out!\u003cbr\u003e"
