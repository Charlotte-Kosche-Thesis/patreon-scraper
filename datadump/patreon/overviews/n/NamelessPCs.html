I make comics about everything from whats going on in my life as a new father to movies, comics, roleplaying games, and a slew of other nerdery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://namelesspcs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014-10-27-DD.jpg\" style=\"width: 636px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I spend my time between my day job, freelance, and creating the comic. Patreon allows me to cut down on the first two and focus on what you all (hopefully) love, the comic. The money raised here will be used to pay for supply costs (such as web hosting), and will give me a chance to have more room with the comic to hopefully push it on to bigger and better things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange for your hard earned cash, you\u0027ll get rewards such as access to a blog with all my rejected comics, thoughts behind some of my comics, and maybe every now and again a terrible ukelele song. Also, the more money raised the more projects I\u0027ll be able to add to the backers queue, such as weekly sketch comics, printed books of the comic (which all patreons will get a high res PDF of), and some alternative zines/outer projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://namelesspcs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015-01-28-Mario-Waits.png\" style=\"width: 630px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell thats my pitch. Hopefully, you\u0027ll help pledge to this comic and make it the best it can be, but if not, no worries. I appreciate you checking out the page and giving my comic even a bit of your time. Rest assured, that Nameless PCs will always be free and on the web.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again and have an excellent day."
