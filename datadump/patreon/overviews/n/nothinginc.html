    "summary": "If you already know us from our live comedy shows, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat or Youtube- That\u0027s awesome! We can\u0027t really take any steps without your help. This is a great way for you to support us even more with just a couple of dollars here and there and help us grow even bigger. Watch the video at the top of the page to see what super hot rewards we have for contributors. That\u0027s you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Nothing Inc podcast is all about making your day fun. We make fun of each other, other people, and other people\u0027s beliefs. Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s all very blasphemous and easy to take part in. You guys already showed us so much support, and we are forever indebted. We somehow retardedly got to number two on the Itunes chart after our first podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rdQKKqI.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you haven\u0027t heard much about us ( wtf are you doing with your life you noob LOL), we\u0027re very humbled you stumbled across our page. We\u0027re Elliot Loney, Khaled Khalafalla and Lewis spears. The three of us are Stand-up comics with varying degrees of fame, intelligence, looks and general well being.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElliot Loney began his foray into entertainment as a male stripper. Where his anatomy let him down, he relied heavily on charisma and stage presence to summon the excitement of married women. He\u0027s since garnered hundreds of thousands of fans on social media with character sketches, and insta-condensed life commentary. From an explosive social media presence, he woo-ed commercial networks and made appearances on almost every major Australian television network, before building a few basic non-stripper skills in Australia\u0027s most lucrative shock-jock radio station.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLewis Spears is stupidly young. He first dipped his stupidly long foot into social media pranks as a teenager. Amidst a sea of online trolls however, Lewis stamped himself as the megalith of ruining people\u0027s lives. He soon moved onto taking jabs at television hosts in online commentary videos- before actually appearing on the very shows that spoke against him as either himself or a character designed to ruin the entire shows structure. Some people say he\u0027s an asshole (most people), but his penchant for creating the beautifully woven narratives of destruction built him an empire worth half a million followers, ready to pounce at his command. He\u0027s had lawsuits, arrests, bounties on his head (no really, there is a campaign to get his National tour cancelled by a bitter ex-cop who once had to deal with him) and is now ready for the next big project- this recorded talking thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKhaled Khalafalla is brown. What he lacks in whiteness however, he makes up for in freakish stand-up talent. He\u0027s won every major live comedy competition he\u0027s entered, sold thousands of tickets, toured the globe, appeared on every major Australian TV network, worked in TV and Radio as a personality, created online hits, performed in several stadiums, opened for the biggest acts in the world, and has had his live work broadcast from the Just For Laughs franchise internationally. You haven\u0027t heard of him, because all of this happened in less than four years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, we\u0027re all incredibly talented, and can\u0027t hold down a job because we\u0027re Gen Y yuppies with a dream. Let\u0027s face it, the entertainment industry is incredibly difficult to create free content for, and the only way we can get money to grow, is through an investor, a grant, or a station that may want to air our stuff. All of these options would mean we\u0027d have to tailor our content more to them, and less to you, which is why we\u0027re going directly to you, the people, to try and grow as much as you want us to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/9PJKInm.jpg\" style=\"width: 458px;\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
