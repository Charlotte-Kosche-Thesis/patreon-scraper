    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my Patreon page! I\u0027m very pleased you found my dark little corner of the interwebs, and hope you decide to join me in my quest. What is it and why should you, you ask? Well let me first answer the question you didn\u0027t ask: who the bloody hell am I anyway?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHi. I\u0027m Nick Westwood, and I\u0027ve been writing for fun \u0026amp; grades since I was knee-high to a (quite tall) grasshopper. It\u0027s one of the few things that have really stayed constant in my shifting array of hobbies and interests. I\u0027ve had a couple of small things published, and have written two full-length novels which I self-published through Lulu.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow I\u0027ve joined Patreon. There are two reasons for this: one, getting paid to write is The Dream, and this would be a great start to that. But the main reason is to prompt me to put down the games more often and actually \u003cem\u003ewrite something\u003c/em\u003e. I have a problem with motivation, and this is, in part, designed to give me the swift and regular kick in the backside I need to buckle down and tap out some fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou are therefore invited to help me and support my writing by becoming a Valued Patron here. I\u0027ll be aiming to make regular content - my minimum goal is one short piece of fiction every week - so I hope to make it worth your while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContent-wise, you\u0027ll see some science fiction (the place I call home) and some fantasy (taking some sojourns here to see if I like it enough to buy a place). A lot of the sci-fi will be based in the world of the Unity Chronicles, the universe in which my two novels are based. You don\u0027t necessarily need to know anything about this universe to read and (hopefully) enjoy these stories."
