I have been working in \u003cstrong\u003einterpersonal relationships\u003c/strong\u003e and understanding \u003cstrong\u003esexuality down to the instinctual level through the fetishes\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u0026amp; \u003cstrong\u003eworking through MyFreeCams.com since 2013\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026amp; I started working in the\u003cstrong\u003e erotic imagery industry\u003c/strong\u003e in very late November 2010. I have been a \u003cem\u003eporn addict\u003c/em\u003e since Probably \u003cem\u003e2004\u003c/em\u003e to be honest if not earlier it peaked in \u003cem\u003e2008\u003c/em\u003e and when I was 15 years old in \u003cstrong\u003e2007\u003c/strong\u003e I took an \u003cem\u003eAdvanced Placement 2D art\u003c/em\u003e class and we had to choose a concentration for a period of time to make a body of work and my choice was sexuality. Since then I certainly haven\u0027t stopped learning about sexuality but I also have \u003cem\u003etried not to overspecialize\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I have learned about many other things and I know that we never stop learning and I don\u0027t know it all and I won\u0027t know it all day that I end my living life on this giant complex rock thing flying through space that we live on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I want to \u003cem\u003emake art\u003c/em\u003e that has always been my goal ever since I drew \u003cstrong\u003ePikachu\u003c/strong\u003e when I was seven years old my cousin who was 30 years old was living with me and my mother for a time and he had a comic book collection and he used to draw I watched him and saw a few of his drawings and he made me realize that it\u0027s possible to create images; it wasn\u0027t not some mysterious thing that can\u0027t be understood after that point you know he was a family member of mine and you know I wanted to get to be as good as him or better and well it\u0027s been a long road since that day that he showed me his collection of drawings and then I tried to draw the Pikachu and I did a good job and then it fueled years of drawing practice and then getting into magnet art school a year late 13 years old for seventh grade. It was a tough transition sort of in a sense that I missed the foundation year of 6th grade but only because I didn\u0027t really have a good work ethic interest in some of the stuff that they were showing me like you know some boring sculptures at least I thought it was boring to play with clay at the time I wanted to do anything else haha. From there I went onto a\u003cstrong\u003e Dreyfoos School of the Arts\u003c/strong\u003e it was number 19 in the Nation at the time for high schools. After high school I was accepted to the college of my choice they offered me $6000 scholarship and I was going to go but then I went on a little adventure and well you know adventures have good and bad consequences of course and you know it and I said to myself I really don\u0027t want to go into a quarter million to half million dollars of loan debt you know just to go do what I had just finished doing which was six years of studying art on a college level (\u003cstrong\u003eINTENSIVE Drawing, Sculpture, Photograpy, Printmaking, Multimedia, \u0026amp; Exploration in Sound and Textile arts\u003c/strong\u003e) I said to myself you know I really \u003cstrong\u003edon\u0027t want to be in that much \u003cdel\u003eDEBT\u003c/del\u003e \u003c/strong\u003egoing in and out of\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003efine arts \u003c/strong\u003ejust to get a \u003cem\u003eBFA degree\u003c/em\u003e you know I just want to be an \u003cem\u003eartist\u003c/em\u003e and I wasn\u0027t sure how was going to do it but was confident in my skills and wanted to invest my energy into something that I thought was a good thing at a time which was helping other people with my resources (unwisely as not the right people [I thought everyone was as cool and understanding as my art school hippie smartie buds then] but e\u003cem\u003every story has its morals\u003c/em\u003e....) long story there I was young I was 19 you know I \u003cstrong\u003eleft home at 19\u003c/strong\u003e and thought I knew it \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eAll young goofy decisions aside\u003c/span\u003e -\u003cem\u003eI have been making my own advertisements, videos, webpage design(html and CSS) however rogue/homebrew it looks, Brand Marketing (had to study marketing a little bit since I wanted to be relatively good at that) and exploring philosophy and you know studying Perma culture, Health, Psychology, fundamental college Physics (thank you internet encyclopedia and teachers, and colleagues for solidifying the understanding for me that the internet is an important learning tool when used properly) and just being really loose and trying not to over specialize but also not stagnate while spending my time not in college things get in the way too often of the art for art making process but I\u0027ve got all this other stuff that I\u0027ve been doing for so long now. \u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I want to explore comedy a bit which has interested me a long time (people always comment about my wit). What I really would like is to get support of people who are interested in experiencing my work (any and all of it) and share that work with as many people as I can because that\u0027s the point of art you know it\u0027s to share it and change people or not you know but it might make you feel something maybe or maybe you won\u0027t like it but that\u0027s the point of it is to share it get other people to experience it and feel SOMETHING because without people art has no meaning. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d really like to \u00a0do a little bit of traveling \u003c/span\u003e--- which I honestly haven\u0027t done much of it all in my life due to the family being lower lower middle-class \u00a0(I think they\u0027re lower middle-class... and I\u0027m not really sure)- never went on trips with my family out-of-state ever the only trips I ever went on out-of-state were school scholarship provided from academic and artistic merit; school trips like Washington DC in fifth grade was my first out-of-state trip, then I went to Boston in eighth grade on a scholarship that I didn\u0027t think I was going to be the only one to win but I won the first place drawing award for these extremely sexual (for me) drawings that I did from photos of someone I had only heard about not seen. I took another 3 day trip to Boston to see colleges when I was 16 and then spent the summer in Boston when I was 17; I have been to Mexico and lived there 6 yrs and I\u0027ve  been to California twice for once for a couple weeks and then once for two months but that\u0027s it as far as traveling goes and none of them after the school trips were specifically for artistic enrichment - I had to worry about work and other things (like the guy and taking care of him foolishly...)- I HAVE been enriched but you know the point is I would really like to do the aspired traveling to see my art friends who said I could spend time with them and they understand my circumstances in detail so there are no doubts about that! - make NEW art - streamline the aspects of sexuality I enjoy in it - make it genuine - explore new things and share it with you guys and start up a cycle of just general positive artistic production and of course it would be highly appreciated if you guys helped in anyway in dollars per month 1-3 \u0026amp; 5 or more add up! I might set it up to be per creation at some point but I think that per month would most likely be sufficient I\u0027m just not sure you know how many people would want to help but do know if you did it would be amazing it would mean the world and it would enable me to do what I have been trying to do for over a decade am I am 24 years old now and I first started this art thing when I was seven years old it\u0027s been a very long time so thank you for reading this and I hope that whether or not you help I have maybe perhaps giving you a better understanding of art and how it comes to be have a great existence and be safe out there.\u003cbr\u003e-Queen V\u003cbr\u003e"
