    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://thetroughblog.com/\"\u003eThe Trough\u003c/a\u003e is a joint effort between my wife and I, she creates the visual content and I handle the words. I\u0027m a husband and father to 4 beautiful children which we home school. Since 2002, I have and continue to serve the church in many capacities such as Associate Pastor, Bible Teacher, Missionary, Youth Minister, and Retreat/Conference Speaker. As an English major in college, one of my biggest passions has always been to write and this blog gives me the outlet to do so while also being one of the ways God outworks his calling on my life. In addition, I am currently a middle school teacher who works in the inner city while attending seminary online. It\u2019s safe to say, we\u2019ve got our hands full constantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I felt very strongly that the Lord was leading us to create The Trough. There seems to be a mass exodus many Christians are making from the Bible. They  replace it with community, emotions, singing, and social improvements. There is nothing wrong with these things but when the Bible is disregarded, misused, or treated as a novelty, something has gone terribly wrong. It is my desire to see God\u2019s people come back to the Bible and to God. \u003ca href=\"http://thetroughblog.com/\"\u003eThe Trough\u003c/a\u003e exists to show off the glories of God and His Word through articles, podcasts, creative videos, art, and more. This site serves to provide spiritual nourishment for His sheep. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Trough is young and we need support. My desire is to be able to write, speak, and teach the Bible full time while supporting family and your help would make this possible. Currently, The Trough is entirely self-funded. God\u2019s Word is for all his people to enjoy, would you consider becoming a patron of The Trough and help us encourage God\u2019s people to love God because of the Bible, not in spite of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOur current goals and projects:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo be able to create more high quality audio, visual, and cinematic content on The Trough.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFinish a book I began entitled \u003cem\u003eNow Unto Him\u003c/em\u003e. This book is being written to show how the Bible and worship go hand in hand.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m pretty big on the home being the main place where discipleship takes place. We have been doing family devotions for awhile now and it is my favorite part of the day. I\u0027ve talked to a few people and many are unsure of what to do or how to start doing this with their families. We want to create a resource to help families wanting to do family devotions in their homes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy wife creates all the graphic design work, videos, keeps up the website and more. Right now she is renting equipment as needed. Your support would help us get the equipment we need to use our gifts to Feed His Sheep.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
