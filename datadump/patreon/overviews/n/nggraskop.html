    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eSo, why a Patreon Page?\u003c/h4\u003e\nI\u0027m ministering to a small town congregation of 90 members, of which most of our members are either pensioners or unemployed.\u00a0 They do not have the financial capacity to afford a full-time pastor; let alone other ministry expenses and maintenance.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce, many years ago, they were a fairly big congregation, but due to demographical, environmental and other macro financial changes, they have gradually shrinked and found themselves barely \"\u003cem\u003esustainable\u003c/em\u003e\".\u00a0 Sustainable in inverted commas, because God sustains His church, despite demographics, financial difficulties or projections.\u00a0 Not that we shouldn\u0027t utilise these skills, but we should never underestimate the transfroming power of God, through the Holy Spirit, to expand His Kingdom on every breadth of this world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWait, Im digressing.\u00a0 The once big congregation had to prioritise and utilise their finances according to the changed environment they found themselves in.\u00a0 \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, recenty we were shocked after we\u0027ve done some inspection on our buildings, how far we fell behind over the years.\u00a0 Doors falling apart due to exposure to rain and sun, ceilings, roof leaking, etc.  It made us realise that we have to prioritise maintenance this year.\u00a0 Recently, one of our members fell on the slippery floor after some rain - a risk we would not want to take any longer, let alone the lack of accountability of the buildings entrusted to us.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSo, why a Patreon Page?\u003c/h4\u003e\nTo source funds for our projects, starting with fixing and maintaining our church and facilities.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut wait, there\u0027s more!\u00a0 We have done Strategic Planning by the end of 2016, and decided that...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eVision\u003c/strong\u003e: we would like to be a community of faith in Graskop, which is a \"\u003cem\u003ewindow on the Kingdom of God\u003c/em\u003e\".\n\u003cbr\u003eYes, its a tall order, but we would like to be such a community through which people would get a glimpse of the Kingdom of God; by looking at us, being with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo achieve this vision, we have chosen to be part of the \u003cem\u003eMissio Dei\u003c/em\u003e, the mission of God, to proclaim \u003cstrong\u003elove, peace, reconciliation and justice\u003c/strong\u003e though which we hope, God will be glorified and His Kingdom will come in Graskop.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTherefore, our work will not come to an end after the maintenance project.\u00a0 We need to continue with our projects to bring peace, love, reconciliation and justice, (\u003cem\u003eaka, the Kingdom of God\u003c/em\u003e)\u00a0 to Graskop.\u00a0 That\u0027s why, we created this Patreon Page.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for our Patrons?\u003c/h4\u003e\nUnfortunately, not much :-0.\u00a0  Seriously, we would love to offer all kinds of offerings some other Patreon Creators do, but we would not want to create an expectation we can\u0027t fulfill.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, what we will do though, is to share with you our congregation, our people, our messages, our sermons, and feedback on our projects.\nIt reminds me about Peter in Acts 3 saying to the disabled begging for money... \"what you want, we can\u0027t give. But we can give what we have...\" the grace of God, the love of Jesus Christ and the presence of the Holy Spirit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd lastly, we will provide our sponsors with proper financial feedback like good stewardship would require of us.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd lastly, lastly - English is not my mother tongue.  Any feedback or suggestion in improving this text, or any content which will follow, is more than welcome!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod Bless!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
