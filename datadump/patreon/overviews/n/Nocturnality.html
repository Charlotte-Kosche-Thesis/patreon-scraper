Be it cosplay-related, drawing, painting, building, making tutorials etc. I was born and raised in Norway and lived there the 25 first years of my life, but recently moved to Sweden to pursue new adventures and opportunities.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy biggest passion in life is creating and the art of cosplay has become a big part of my life. I spend a lot of time sketching, sewing, gathering materials and scrolling through endless pictures and guides on cosplays and how to make them. I started cosplaying in 2013, where I attended my first convention and really got sucked into to cosplay world. Since then Ive created several cosplays from many different universes. I cosplay mostly from games I have played (or still play) alot. World of Warcraft, Skyrim and League of Legends to mention a few.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a great place for artists of any kind to share more and give more backm offer something special and to keep growing as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever sum of money you choose to support me with will help immensely, covering everything from materials such as fabric, foam, worbla, paint and glue to wigs makeup, travelling expenses. your support goes directly to everything I need to create more content. Our first goal is to reach 100 dollars a month, if we do, ill buy a polaroid camera and send out personal polaroids to every follower as a thank you - with a personal note too if you want! I will also start doing more frequent updates and more cosplay progress overall. I currently have a full-time job so trying to find time to do everything I want to do, can be a challenge. \u003cstrong\u003eYou will always get something back for pledging!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSHOULD YOU SUPPORT ME?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that I do \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e expect anyone to feel pressured to support me, I simply see that as a great big bonus and a chance so share tips, walkthroughs, tutorials and everything else related to my progress. Giving something back to those who choose to support me is a great way of showing gratitude and love to you awesome people! Supporting me will give you my eternal gratitude and a lot of hope and motivation to grow as a creative person. I spend alot of time and money on this hobby BUT that is because I want to and choose to do so, your support however will make a big difference in how many cosplays I can do, both of better quality and in quantity. There is many perks that just you as a supporter get!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLinda \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
