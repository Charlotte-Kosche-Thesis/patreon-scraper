Why? Well, because for the first 25 years of my life, I was either wanting to be, or was being, a professional sportsman. And then it stopped. At 25 years old, I became an ex professional sportsman which, to be honest, was pretty scary, as I had no idea what I could do nor wanted to do for the rest of my life. Nearly twenty years later, and I\u0027m I still not sure! However, I do know what I love doing....which is helping other people to fulfil their potential. Ps I\u0027m Nathan by the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eWhat I do\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eSince finishing sport as a player, I re-entered sport as a coach, and over the last two decades, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of being a coach, mentor, and consultant to a diverse range of athletes, coaches, parents, and organisations, all of whom have challenged my beliefs, broadened my perspectives, and fuelled my desire to keep on learning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eMy big question\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eFrom the moment I transitioned from player to coach,\u00a0I\u2019ve been obsessed with finding the answers to the question, \u201c\u003cem\u003eWhat makes great athletes great\u003c/em\u003e?\u201d. Even as a highly qualified and experienced performance coach, I don\u2019t claim to know the definitive answer as to what separates the greats from the rest. Does anyone? But I do have a passion for helping as many people as I can to unlock their unique secret to success...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e...which is why I now write\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI love being a coach, but there\u0027s a limit to how many people I can be of service to. So now I also write, with the sole intention of inspiring and educating many more people to become who they want to be. And this is where \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e comes in. Writing, as I\u0027ve discovered over the past year or so, takes time. A lot of time. Time I can\u0027t really afford - remember I wasn\u0027t a superstar sportsman on a superstar salary!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eSo here\u0027s my plan\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eGet lots of teeny weeny little donations, from lots of great people like you, which will then allow me to carry on creating lots of new and wonderful content so that lots (think I\u0027m now slightly overdosing on the \u0027lots\u0027) more people can become their very best sporting, or *non-sporting versions of themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Not all my content is about sport you know. Some is, and some isn\u0027t. But pretty much all of it can be transferred to many different areas of work and life. Just wanted you to know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd what do you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWell, apart from joining my exclusive community, which is (partly and potentially) responsible for elevating the performance levels of those in sport, business, music, education, show business and so on and so forth, you also get access to this great content either earlier than the rest of the World, or even to stuff that no one else can get. You may even get some free goodies too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eBut wait...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThere\u0027s more. I believe in \u003cem\u003eGiver\u0027s Gain\u003c/em\u003e. So if you give more, you\u0027ll gain more....in the form of personalised advice, either via email or face-to-face. Well, perhaps not face-to-face because we may live thousands of miles from each each other, which frankly, and as much as I like you, is a bit impractical. But we can definitely Skype, not matter how far away we are! Take a look to the right to see all the bounty of rewards on offer \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u279f\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eFinally\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eSo that\u0027s it. The basic gist of it.\u00a0I know I\u0027ve rambled on, but if you\u0027ve got this far, thank you for your persistence....which is a trait of highly successful people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks also, if you decide to, for any support you can offer - a little bit goes a long way, and a little bit more goes a little bit further :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
