I grew up as a depressed child and in my adult years I fell to many addictions and couldn\u0027t control my mind or process my emotions healthily. One day I decided that I didn\u0027t like my life and I couldn\u0027t bare the thought of my future so I started to take action and change my life. I am now in full pursuit of my dreams of being a photographer/blogger and adventurer. After going through struggles I would like to dedicate my life to helping other young men and women who are struggling. With the support of all of you I can fully realize this dream and continue to grow and learn and share with others. Thank you!"

If I could get just 100 people on this tier it would make doing all these videos worth it. I dont make videos often so $1-3 dollars per month would be max you pay out on this tier.
