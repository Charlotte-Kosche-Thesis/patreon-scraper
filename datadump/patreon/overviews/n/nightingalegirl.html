    "summary": "Hi my name is Natalie Hathcock, and I have been singing before I could even talk. My nickname is Nightingalegirl, because my grandmothers friend group always commented that I was their nightingale girl. Music has always been a huge portion of my life and I love to sing. In the past I have won several competitions, and I have traveled on a private European singing tour with my vocal coach. I have recorded a demo CD with BBC star Alan Hawkshaw in his private studio with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. I also have been apart of a 16 part singing acapella group called Hands in Harmony where we also played bells and did sign language while singing. As you can see I have done a lot in my short life, and I am very excited to start posting videos of my music on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any more questions, feel free to email them to me @ \u003ca\u003enightingalenataliesinging@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, I would greatly appreciate your support even if it is a dollar!\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much!\u003cbr\u003e-Natalie\u003cbr\u003e"
