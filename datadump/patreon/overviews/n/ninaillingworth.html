    "summary": "Every revolution needs a Thomas Paine; unfortunately you\u0027re all stuck with me instead. I write about history, politics, philosophy, civil liberties, justice, the media, progressive issues, socialism, bigotry, war crimes, Imperialism, anti-capitalism and corruption in a style I like to call \"Gonzo Lite\" but that\u0027s probably just because I can\u0027t afford the really good drugs Thompson was tripping on. Foul-mouthed, but insightful and honest to the core; I\u0027m on Patreon to help fund my site ninaillingworth.com and collect enough tips to allow me to work on it full time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure, I could get a job in the corporate media - but then I wouldn\u0027t be able to tell the stories my readers want to hear in the honest, acerbic and often-times humorous way they\u0027ve grown to love. The simple truth is there really isn\u0027t a whole lot of cash in socialism; which suits me just fine. My expenses are meager, but even so, it\u0027s very difficult to devote the necessary time to follow all of the stories I want to follow, comment on all of the situations I want to comment on or provide nearly as many scathing rebukes as I\u0027d like to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy influences include Hunter S Thompson, Assata Shakur, Noam Chomsky, Emma Goldman, Soren Kierkegaard, Edward Said, Marshall Mcluhan, Malcolm X, Mark Twain, Hunter S Thompson a second time, Jeb Lund, Naomi Klein, Jane Mayer, Hermann Karl Hesse, Evelyn Waugh,\u00a0Socrates, Albert Camus,\u00a0Bouddicca, Zhuge Liang, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, John Stuart Mill,\u00a0Voltairine de Cleyre, Charles Pierce, Martin Luther King, George Orwell, George Plimpton, Bertrand Russell and the little voice inside my head that keeps screaming \"liar\" whenever any politician, banker or media personality is speaking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn closing, I should mention that I\u0027m a 39 year old post-op transgendered woman who is not in any way particularly attractive. I live with my boyfriend and five cats; all of whom are patiently waiting for the fall of capitalism just as surely as I am. I\u0027m a bleeding-heart socialist, a feminist and a possessor of multiple delinquent library books. Finally, I\u0027m probably the only human being on earth who owns the entire song catalogues of both D12 \u0026amp; The Cure. Let\u0027s make the world goddamn amazing together my friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- nina\u003cbr\u003e"
