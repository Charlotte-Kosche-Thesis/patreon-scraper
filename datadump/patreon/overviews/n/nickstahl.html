Through my entertaining videos, you\u0027ll have access to my healthy, well-balanced fitness lifestyle. I aim to help people overcome insecurities, and become the person they\u2019ve always wanted to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy fitness journey began in the 8th grade. My middle school crush said my head was too big for my body\u2026 That lit a fire within me. Embarrassed, I was determined to build muscle on my skinny frame. I then sought my dads help, and he set me up with his old school weight set in the basement of our home. There was no looking back, I followed Fitness Icon\u0027s like Plitt and Zyzz. RIP to the real ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to reach the level of success that they have in my own career. Join the movement as a Patron. I\u0027ll be here to support you in living a well-balanced, educated and successful life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMuch Love \u0026amp; in good health!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNick Stahl @nickstahlofficial\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
