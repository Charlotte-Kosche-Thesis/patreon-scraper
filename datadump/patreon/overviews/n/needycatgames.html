    "summary": "Needy Cat Games is a teeny-tiny tabletop games studio in Nottingham, UK. It is a collaboration between James M Hewitt, a published game designer who most people know from his time with Games Workshop and Mantic Games, and Sophie Williams, another tabletop industry veteran with a passion for managing creative people. What a team!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been going since July 2017, but February 2018 has seen a shift in gear as we moved out of the spare room and into a proper office. The move\u0027s been fantastic - there\u0027s room to work on multiple projects at once, we can playtest to our heart\u0027s content without having to clear space for meals, and it just generally feels like we\u0027re a serious, grown-up business (more or less). The only downside is that our monthly costs have increased significantly. We\u0027re covering the bills by taking on additional freelance work for other studios - that\u0027s fine (we love working with other people!) but it means we have less time to work on our own games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause, yeah, we want to design our own games! Between us we\u0027ve got maybe a dozen fleshed-out plans for board, card and roleplaying games, just waiting to be put into action. It\u0027s just a case of finding the time. Unfortunately, to keep the lights on we pretty much need to be doing paid work non-stop. If only there was another solution!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been aware of Patreon for some time (and support a number of existing creators), but hadn\u0027t considered it as something we could use until we realised it\u0027s possible to accept monthly donations instead of tying them to regular content releases. After all, the nature of tabletop game design makes it tricky to release \u003cem\u003eanything\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0on a regular basis! Now we\u0027ve looked into it in more detail, it looks like it might just be a possibility.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are. We have no idea whether this will work, but we\u0027d love to give it a go. So far, people have been incredibly supportive of what we\u0027re doing, and if a few of those people think we\u0027re worth the investment it could start making a real difference. If we can get to the point where we can afford to write games for Needy Cat as well as for other companies... well, this whole thing will feel like it\u0027s really got legs, and we can\u0027t tell you how amazing that would be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you in advance for even clicking through to this page, let alone considering a pledge! Your support could help us get closer to truly realising our dreams. Not many people can say that, and we really do appreciate how lucky we are.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eJames and Sophie\u003cbr\u003e"
