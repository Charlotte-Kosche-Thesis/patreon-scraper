Firstly, I am a singer and songwriter, but I\u2019m also a blogger and\nillustrator. Find out all about it at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.nikkiloy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.nikkiloy.com\u003c/a\u003e \u2013 I\u2019m an all round passionate creative! I have already been creating music for 5 years, I\u2019ve done over 700 gigs in that time and had loads of fab opportunities. So, I know you guys really value my music and creativity and you want to see that\npart of my life take off even more. I love you so much for that - Thank you! Thank you for\nwatching my videos, showing up to gigs and generally being so supportive\nalready - Mwah!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY IS IT IMPORTANT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was a teenager when I first realised the power of music to affect my emotions, and that how I feel affects my entire life. So I started choosing my music consciously. When I began writing songs I approached it the same way, asking \u0027How do I want this song to make the listener feel?\u0027. That matters to me soooo much more than silly categories and genre. I want my music to meet people where they are at, help them express what they want to express, and lift them. I also want to help them understand themselves better, and hopefully this will help improve their lives a little - Music is a powerful gift! So you\u0027ll find all sorts of songs in my collection because as humans we experience all sorts of things in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou know it\u2019s pretty tough to be a singer-songwriter in today\u2019s music industry but\nit\u2019s also the most exciting time to be an independent musician. There are no\ngatekeepers anymore! We can get out there, make albums, gig, love our fanbases\nand have careers in music without a major label - yay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \n\nPatreon\nis an awesome service that helps enable that! If you don\u2019t already know,\nPatreon is platform a bit like Kickstarter, which enables folks like you to\nsupport folks like me who create songs, art and articles and put them out there\nfor the enjoyment and benefit of others. But where it differs from Kickstarter is that\ninstead of raising funds for one big project, you can support an artist on a\nmonthly basis!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis\nis fantastic news for me because as a songwriter I write a new tune and post it\non the internet every week, I also write 1-5 blog posts a week, and sometimes\nshare my artwork too! Later on I develop these into bigger projects to share\nwith you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW CAN YOU HELP?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut\nyou know it all takes time, space and inspiration to consistently create and\ndeliver\u2026 So, if you were to become one of my patrons, you would enable me to\nhave mental space to think, and breathe, and create great songs, and other\ncontent, and not worry so much about making ends meet\u2026 And the more folks\nbecome patrons of my work the further I can take this thing\u2026 It means I could involve\nmore people and help their dreams come true too\u2026 I could hire a band, I could\nwork more with the folks who already help me - other musicians, artists,\nphotographers, web developers, sound and tech people - and we could create soooo\nmuch more! That would mean the world to me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnyway,\nI\u2019m getting carried away with the possibilities\u2026 So, you can become a patron\nfor as little as $1 a month, or even $500, - as much as you want or anywhere in\nbetween! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAND WHAT DO YOU GET IN RETURN?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, you get to become a Patron of the Arts!!! :) Depending on your level of\npatronage you could also enjoy more insight into my creative processes and\nsneak peaks into my sketchbooks, all my future releases as digital downloads or\nautographed CDs, my own art postcards from wherever I am in the world, private\nhouse concerts, input into choosing which songs get on the album, free tickets\nto shows, I could even write you a song! And much more\u2026. (Details below)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a fluid, trial and error kind of thing. If something isn\u2019t working for you or for me, we can always chat about it and change it so don\u2019t feel you\u2019d be locked in to something you don\u2019t like. We\u2019ll \u2018suck it and see\u2019 and keep making changes until it works for everyone. So\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nFINALLY...\u003c/strong\u003e I would love, love, LOVE IT if you wanted to become a patron but let me make it\nvery clear: You are under absolutely no obligation to give, you can cancel at\nanytime, and I don\u2019t want you to do it if you can\u2019t afford it! You just keep\nenjoying the free content, and spreading the word, that\u2019s enough and I\u2019m\ngrateful for that\u2026 and if you can afford it, well THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH for being\nalong for the journey and making this dream a reality! \u003c/div\u003e"
