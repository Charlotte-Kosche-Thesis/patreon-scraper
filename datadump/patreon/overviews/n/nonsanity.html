    "summary": "I love mixing mods together to take Minecraft automation to silly and unbelievable extremes, and I\u0027d love to take you along for the ride\u2014or just show you how to do the same thing yourself. When first playing with a new mod, finding good, real-world examples of how to use all that it offers can sometimes be difficult. Even then, the videos you are most likely to find are: \"Here\u0027s block A and how to craft it. Now here\u0027s block B and how to craft it.\" That\u0027s usually the last thing you actually need since that information is already in the game. We can do better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I want to make Let\u0027s Play series and mod tutorials that go beyond what\u0027s in a mod and how to craft it and instead take you along to see some practical uses for those blocks, particularly when mixed with other common mods. To focus on progression instead of random lists of blocks. And I want to automate everything, mixing together the many possibilities each mod in a pack provides to make wild and wonderful contraptions possible. We can go smarter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I play modded Minecraft and I need a little of some resource, I\u0027m not happy until I have several orders of magnitude more than I need. I need a stack of silicon? I create contraptions that make thousands instead. Need an endless supply of sulfur? Easy, and using nothing but cobble and water. Need mob drops in abundance? I\u0027ll rig up hot-and-cold-running mobs on demand. Enough just isn\u0027t enough. We can build bigger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve seen there\u0027s interest in such videos, something different from the usual fare. There are more than enough bumbling (in a good way!) entertainers out there for everyone to watch. I want to bring my own style to the table, and you can help me do it. Lets go better, smarter, and bigger\u2014together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you can do a lot with very little. You make a big difference with just a dollar or two. When we hang out for a half hour or so through my videos, your pledge (far too solemn a word) is like buying me a drink to say thanks. (I like Diet Pepsi.) As with many creators, its the thrill of the act of creation that keeps us going. And money from sources like Patreon not only helps pay the bills, but it can carry the creator through tough times when inspiration might otherwise be going dry. Sometimes that lone voice with a fist full of ones is the difference between going on and giving up. And for that, I and all content creators thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, the only option here is basic support\u2014your \"thank you\" in small bill form\u2014for my videos. But expect new possibilities and levels of support in the coming weeks. I\u0027ll try to come up with fun ideas to further our interaction\u2014because that\u0027s why I do this\u2014and I welcome such ideas from you. What other special treats might you like to see me offer? Exclusive videos? Skype calls? Server cameos? If you want to be a \"super\" patron to me, I want to find the perfect way to thank you and pay you back in fun, creative ways. Share your thoughts! :)\u003cbr\u003e"
