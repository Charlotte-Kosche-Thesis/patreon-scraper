    "summary": "For starters I guess i\u0027ll talk a bit about myself. I grew up mostly in isolation, playing video games by myself in my room starting from GameBoy Colour all the way to Xbox360, and pretty much any new generation console that came out. I would build legos and bionicles in my room and sometimes look over and admire my Pok\u00e9mon cards. My family wasn\u0027t too harsh on me for that, but I didn\u0027t receive very much attention growing up from them and since my parents got divorced, I didn\u0027t really have a great childhood in terms of having a \u0027normal\u0027 family life. I have always been a passionate gamer and I always dreamed of becoming a livestreamer and content creator, but never thought it could be possible. And because of my past and even my current life struggles i\u0027v been inspired by God to create the Brah Nation, with the goal of spreading love, positivity, joy, and community to the gaming world, and to reach out to those who are struggling and are looking for friendships and encouragement but aren\u0027t finding it in their day to day lives. My goal is to be able to do this full-time, and move out of my current living situation which isn\u0027t very healthy, so that I can pursue this even further and with even greater passion, allowing for new doors to be opened along this journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mainly stream Oldschool RuneScape on Twitch, but as the community is growing and expanding, we are easing our way into other games as well to draw in new people who are in search of a community. Streams are every day starting anywhere between 12PM-4PM (Pacific Standard Time) @ \u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/natebra.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.twitch.tv/natebra\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eFeel free to contact me and stay up to date with everything on my Twitter as well!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Nate_Brah\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/Nate_Brah\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
