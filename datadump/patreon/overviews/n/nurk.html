    "summary": "FPV is more than a hobby. The longer that anyone is involved with FPV, it becomes a way of life. It consumes you. You think about it when you\u0027re resting, when you\u0027re driving you view the world in terms of places to fly, and when visiting with friends, it\u0027s hard to talk about anything else. FPV is transcendent -- flying is a near out of body experience, taking you places you could only believe were true in your dreams. And yet, here it is!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thefpvlivestream.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC02549-e1468883833549.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://paulnurkkala.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/20232696_10155675402344432_5785278141167822078_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite all this, starting FPV and becoming an FPV pilot is hard. Very hard. Hours of practice and discipline go into learning how to fly and how to fly well. Racing, freestyling, and content creation are all intricately combined in this sport that mixes media, skill, discipline, technology, and practice in ways never before seen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd because of that, it\u0027s going to grow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of that\u0027s great, but why should you support me? Because there is such a high barrier to entry, it\u0027s often difficult or impossible for users to get into the hobby. The cost is prohibitive, the skills are technical, and the time to spend building is demanding. But, when you tie everything together: building, flying, crashing, repeating, a story evolves. THIS story is what drives me. I want to tell the story in creative and fun ways, sharing my experience, skills, learning, and knowledge in any way that I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thefpvlivestream.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cropped-F3Expo_2015-1688.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://paulnurkkala.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Atlanta-Podium-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you are not committing not just to send some dorky guy money to be dorky, but instead to allow me to continue to be an ambassador and proponent of the FPV community. With your help, I will continue to push hard at telling stories, creating content, and teaching everyone. If you have ever been influenced and helped by a youtube video or a blog, you recognize how much work, effort, time, and money went into building that content for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thefpvlivestream.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cropped-DSC00346.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://paulnurkkala.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19800917_10155635123899432_4743717083525462024_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is your chance to give back. Become a sponsor. Share an idea. Together, we\u0027ll push forward the hobby.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
