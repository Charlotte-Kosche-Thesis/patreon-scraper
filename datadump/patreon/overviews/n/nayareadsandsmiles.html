    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0My name is Naya, I\u0027m a \"Booktuber.\" Which is just a fancy term for someone who loves reading and shares that bookish joy via Youtube. Thank you so much for checking out my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0I decided to join Patreon because I really enjoy creating content that inspires people to read more. From book\u00a0reviews to reading vlogs and everything in between. Overall my happiness stems from just sharing my experience as a consumer of stories. And supporting authors as well as other people like myself in the book community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0As a full-time student and working gal, I often times have to choose between spending a day working or making Youtube videos. As much as I enjoy what I do on Youtube, School and other work is often a priority. By having a Patreon, it will allow me to spend more time doing what I love for you guys, and create more videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Even though I post videos (as regularly as I can) on Youtube. I didn\u0027t want to start a Patreon unless I felt like I could genuinely offer people who are going out of there way to donate their hard earn coins, something in return! Something more than just my gratitude and thanks! So for everyone who is going out of there way, I will be sharing a Reading Vlog made just for you guys! Every month I will upload a video exclusively for Patreon supporters. You guys will get to pick which book out of 3-4 I share on here that you want me to read! Whichever you guys vote on, I\u0027ll read it over a weekend and share all my thoughts (possibly tears) for you in long Vlog!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0I am super excited about having a Patreon. I feel like not only does it help me, but allows you guys to\u00a0actually decide on a book for me to read! I know there are hundreds of books out there. And I get recommended\u00a0so many amazing authors to check out. Sadly I don\u0027t always have the time to read them all! This way helps me to create more videos on my channel, and continue persuing my passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of Love!\u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003eNaya:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
