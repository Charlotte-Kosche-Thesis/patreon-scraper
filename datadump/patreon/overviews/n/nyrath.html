Information is scattered thinly, the terminology is confusing, the implications are left as an exercise for the reader, the math is hard.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m here to help.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"float: left;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.projectrho.com/xfer/AtomicRocketLogo100.png\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nMy\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAtomic Rocket\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e website is one-stop shopping for science fiction based creators, containing tutorials, advice, ideas, quotes from SF literature, equations and diagrams that does all the heavy lifting and quickly gets the creators up to speed. The information is concentrated and categorized, the terminology is explained using simple English, the implications are explicitly stated, only the vital equations are presented and the math is carefully explained with examples. Plus it is lavishly illustrated with relevant images from 1940\u0027s pulp SciFi magazines to make it more entertaining to read than dry walls of text.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/atomicnovel.php\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYou may have heard about it\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"float: left;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.projectrho.com/xfer/AtomicRocketSeal100.png\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nWhy am I doing this? I really enjoy reading novels and playing games where the science is accurate and well integrated. Which is conspicuous by its absence nowadays, especially in media science fiction. I figure if I want such content to be produced, the least I can do is give the content creators some help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"float: left;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.projectrho.com/xfer/rocketCatAvatar100.png\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nThe problem is, I currently have approximately a \n\u003cem\u003efive-year backlog\u003c/em\u003e of material to add. Worse: science marches on so new material appears every day and existing material become dated or obsolete. But unless I can find a way to fund all the time it takes to do this work, it will only be done slowly or not at all.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is where \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon \u003c/strong\u003ecomes in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"float: left;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.projectrho.com/xfer/patreon_logo_shine100.png\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nPatreon is a crowdfunding site similar to Kickstarter, but instead of one-time donations toward a single project, it allows supporters to make small monthly continuing donations toward a stream of ongoing creations. It is sort of like an internet version of the patrons who supported Leonardo da Vinci and allowed him to create. Here is the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/a\u003e. Note that unlike Kickstarter, this is a tiny donation that happens every month instead of a huge lump sum that happens just once.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour patronage will give me the breathing space to regularly update the Atomic Rocket website, and to integrate the backlog into the site. Not to mention helping to defray the cost of hosting the site. Updates will be \u003cem\u003eat a minimum\u003c/em\u003e of once a week or four times a month.\u003cbr\u003eThe patronage is a monthly amount, not a \"per-piece\" pledge, so you always know how much you will be paying. You can change (or cancel) your pledge at any time. There are more details\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd to be clear, the Atomic Rocket website will continue to be free to view, with no paywall, and free of ads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will also have access to the activity feed, where they can see my progress and comment on it. Only the bare basic feed will be visible to non-patrons, patrons will be able to see more detailed information according to how much they pledge."
