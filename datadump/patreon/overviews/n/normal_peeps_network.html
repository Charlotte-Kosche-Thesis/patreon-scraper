We\u0027re a group of 4 people currently, including The Drakman, GOHO (GameOverHandOut), HemoPreston, and Lukisforgets. We\u0027ve actually been YouTubing... YouTube-ing? There we go.. Sort of. Well either way, we\u0027ve been making videos for about 3 years now, but to be honest anything before 2017 was crap and we\u0027ve actually removed it from the channel!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re Here on Patreon because we know this is what we want to do, making videos is the best creative outlet and we\u0027d love to do this for a living. In exchange for your support the content you\u0027ll be getting is more of our current shows, those being Mortal Mondayz, Sw!tch, and NPCs. You\u0027ll also be getting our new in the works show \"Prove it!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, we plan on moving the channel\u0027s focus away from video games (not that those will go away!) and to Television as a whole, we can\u0027t say much now, but trust us when we say big changes are coming, there\u0027s lots of room to grow, and we\u0027re ready to tackle our dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want a taste of what we do, head to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC57UzcK2A6lWwnsFXJdLSwg\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e or to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.normalpeeps.network/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eour website\u003c/a\u003e!"
