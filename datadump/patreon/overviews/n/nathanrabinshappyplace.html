    "summary": "Hello! If you are reading this it means you probably know who I am, and are at least open to the idea of giving me money. Huzzah! Those are both beautiful, beautiful things, and I probably should have updated this description some time within the last six months so that it\u2019s no longer a semi-inaccurate description of what I intended to do but rather an accurate description of what I\u2019m doing, what I\u2019ve done and what I\u2019m going to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNathan Rabin\u2019s Happy Place was founded on the conviction that if I, Nathan Rabin, had complete creative freedom and a solid base of support, both financially and emotionally, I could create something special and unique and even, dare I say, essential in this crazy-making world of ours. I like to think the last six months have proven that conviction true.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBefore I started Nathan Rabin\u2019s Happy Place on my 41st birthday, I had worked in pop culture media for two decades, primarily as the head writer of the \u003cem\u003eA.V Club \u003c/em\u003eand then as a staff writer for Pitchfork\u2019s late, much-loved film site \u003cem\u003eThe Dissolve. \u003c/em\u003eI\u2019d also written five books, did an AMC TV show and coined the phrase \u201cManic Pixie Dream Girl.\u201d I was lucky to be able to make a living as a pop-culture writer but day by day that living grew more perilous.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis was driven home when, a few days before my birthday and the launch of Nathan Rabin\u2019s Happy Place, I got an email from my editor at\u003cem\u003e The A.V. Club \u003c/em\u003ewith a sentence about how due to declining page-views and the ever-shifting needs of the pop culture landscape, My World of Flops was being cancelled.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eTo freelance is to exist forever in a state of anxiety and uncertainty. Learning that easily the most popular and influential and long-lasting thing I\u2019d ever done professionally was being killed for not being popular enough sent me into a bit of a psychological spiral.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I got laid off from \u003cem\u003eThe Dissolve, \u003c/em\u003ewith a six month old baby and no real freelance career to speak of,\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eit meant the world to me to have so many readers tell me how sorry they were for my misfortune, and how they wish there was something they could do to help me. The beauty and magic of Patreon is that it allows you to play a concrete role in allowing me to continue making a living as a writer. Even a dollar a month makes a difference in allowing me to live and write on my own terms. Every little bit is appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHaving my most popular feature, my signature feature, be killed for not being popular enough by a publication I\u2019d been writing for for twenty years (indeed, I was its third full-time employee) and that was itself a decade old, underlined the need to take control of my life and career and finances. Nathan Rabin\u2019s Happy Place has allowed me to do just that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI am happy to report that \u003cstrong\u003eNathan Rabin\u2019s Happy Place is the new home of My World of Flops.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy World of Flops is consequently the core of the site, and I\u2019ve been able to really play with the format and experiment with the column with popular entries on Hillary Clinton\u2019s losing 2016 Presidential campaign, Rachel Dolezal\u2019s memoir (and life, pretty much) and the coke-fueled insanity of \u003cem\u003eMaximum Overdrive.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat else can you find on Nathan Rabin\u2019s Happy Place? Glad you asked\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Weird Accordion to Al: \u003c/strong\u003eI literally wrote the book on (and with) \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic in the form of \u003cem\u003eWeird Al: the Book. \u003c/em\u003eSo when I learned he\u2019d be putting out a career-spanning box-set I had the idea of writing a 174 part series on every single \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic song in chronological order.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re something like 86 entries into the series, which Al has assured me he\u2019s reading. He\u2019s even volunteered to fact-check the series before I turn it into book form and with Al heading out on the road in 2018 to play almost exclusively originals and obscurities, this column has never been more useful or timely.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eControl Nathan Rabin: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is a column where I let the people who pledge to this page decide which of two terrible-looking movies I must see and write about. A typical contender, for example, might be \u003cem\u003ePurple People Eater \u003c/em\u003eVS the \u003cem\u003eMonster Mash \u003c/em\u003emovie in the battle of novelty-song-themed kiddie fright flicks, or \u003cem\u003eLeprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood \u003c/em\u003eversus \u003cem\u003eGingerdead Man Versus Evil Bong. \u003c/em\u003ePledge to this page on any level and you get to vote on my various torments \u003cstrong\u003eand \u003c/strong\u003eget one patron-exclusive Control Nathan Rabin a month. Neat!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLukewarm Takes: \u003c/strong\u003eFor about 18 years I was a full time film critic. Then I got fired from a film site and stopped not only reviewing movies professionally but seeing new ones in general. I was depressed and discouraged, but thankfully there are a whole bunch of big movies I consequently have not seen that I write about for Lukewarm Takes, like \u003cem\u003eGhostbusters \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eSuicide Squad \u003c/em\u003eand various other box-office monsters. But there\u2019s so much left for me to see and write about!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Big Whoop: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is a personal blog that runs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. I use it to write about literally anything that I find interesting, but it tends to go heavy on politics and parenting and mental health and mental illness. It\u2019s cathartic and challenging to have to write a substantive blog post almost every week day, but it\u2019s been great, and readers have really responded well to the personal nature of the site in general but the blog specifically.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClickbait: \u003c/strong\u003eI\u2019m fascinated by Clickbait, so I\u2019ve made a point of regularly including irreverent parodies of Clickbait like \u201cWhy Hollywood Won\u0027t Cast Andie MacDowell Anymore\u201d and \u201cShady Things Everyone Just Ignores About David Hyde Pierce.\u201d These pieces are almost suspiciously popular, but I love having an outlet for my various satirical urges.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiterature Society: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is a catch-all for any book coverage. I love writing about show biz memoirs in particular, and this is a great place to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis looks terrible! \u003c/strong\u003eMy wheelhouse is writing about things that look terrible because they \u003cem\u003eare \u003c/em\u003eterrible, and I got to do that with this column.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDream Girls: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is a column on Manic Pixie Dream Girls I really need to do more regularly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExploiting the Archives: \u003c/strong\u003eI\u2019ve been around a very long time and done a lot of great work. This weekly column highlights particularly noteworthy and memorable articles from my decades in the business. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s honestly hard to know where to stop with Nathan Rabin\u2019s Happy Place, since I\u2019m always introducing new ideas, but if you want to know what the site is like don\u2019t take my word for it: please read the archives of \u003ca href=\"http://nathanrabin.com\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enathanrabin.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eEvery week I post somewhere between eleven and fifteen articles, with a mandate of \u201cNo garbage content.\u201d Not everything is transcendent or important but you should know that I put my heart and soul into everything on the site, and don\u2019t do anything just for the sake of page-views or clicks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m really proud of the work that I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019m super grateful for the pledges but as tends to be the case, pledges have hit a bit of a ceiling, and consequently are growing very slowly. This month, for example, I feel like I did great work, in great amounts, and I am grateful for every dollar we receive, but October is nearly over and we\u2019ve only picked up 10 patrons and 47 dollars in new pledges so every new donor is super important.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eRight now Nathan Rabin\u2019s Happy Place is more or less a full-time gig, but it only pays about a half salary. I\u2019m super grateful for the five outside columns I\u2019m writing and am dependent on the income from them to support my family, but Nathan Rabin\u2019s Happy Place is my dream, and it is a beautiful thing to realize a dream. I just need your support to make this a feasible business and not just an extraordinarily time and labor-intensive hobby. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I just wanted to thank everyone who has contributed to this page and to the site. You\u0027ve made it possible for me to do what I love for a living. I will never stop being grateful for that. You\u0027ve saved my career if not my life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is my Happy Place. I want it to be your Happy Place as well.\u003cbr\u003e"
