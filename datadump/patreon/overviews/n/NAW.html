Donating to this Patreon \u003cstrong\u003edoes not\u003c/strong\u003e guarantee whitelisting to the community or the server, although applications will be available at a later date.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis should aid in keeping things orderly and setup, while enforcing goals for those running the server to maintain and upkeep it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunds will only be charged after at least one server-wide event occurs or a sizable update has been made to the server that month. Even if there\u0027s 5 updates in a month, only the first one counts. This is to help prevent stagnation in development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll funds donated that exceed the costs to run the server ($30/mo) will be kept aside as extra wiggle-room just in case. Higher-tier goals have this kept in mind so that the cost of running a more expensive server does not outpace itself.\u003cbr\u003e"
