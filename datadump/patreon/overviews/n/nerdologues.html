If you\u2019ve listened to Your Stories, you\u2019ll know we have some pretty rad original songs in the can. We also have lots of comedy. We want to put effort into producing this stuff professionally and giving you a polished recording mix of both we can be proud of. We promise this will be funnier than the skits on morning radio.",
