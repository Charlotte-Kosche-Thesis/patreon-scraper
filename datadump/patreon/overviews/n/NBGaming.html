    "summary": "Hi guys! \u00a0I\u0027m Jonimus and you might know me from my YouTube channel, N\u0026amp;B Gaming (\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/nbgaming.\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/c/nbgaming\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making YouTube content for several years now and it\u0027s really become a passion and a defining hobby of mine. \u00a0I absolutely love doing it and I\u0027d really like to take the channel to the next level, which is going full time with it. \u00a0There is one problem, though, and that is that I absolute could not afford to pay the bills right now were I to pursue YouTube as my only means of income, especially after the #Adpocalypse which has resulted in my channel taking a tremendous hit in ad revenue (I\u0027ve lost about 3/4 of what I used to make in a given month, even though views are continuously rising). \u00a0What this means is that I can\u0027t really rely on YouTube to have my best interests as one of their priorities, as they\u0027ve somewhat demonstrated in their shift away from certain content.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA fairly frequent request I receive is to put out more weekly videos. \u00a0Believe me, I really want to. \u00a0However, time is a big constraint for me. \u00a0Currently I work a non-related full time job in order to pay the bills. \u00a0After working for the day, I usually come home and spend the rest of the evening editing until late at night. The weekends are also similar, where again, most of my free time is taken up putting together my weekly video(s).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where I\u0027m hoping you, my viewers, come in. \u00a0I don\u0027t require a lot to pay the bills and I don\u0027t generally like asking for money, which is why I\u0027m keeping pledges for this tier low at only $3. \u00a0By donating towards my Patreon, you\u0027ll be helping me achieve my goal of going full time with YouTube. \u00a0What that directly translates to for you, is a large increase in weekly videos I\u0027m able to publish for your entertainment, along with much more frequent Twitch streams. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I put out a weekly video every Friday and stream on Saturdays. \u00a0With the freedom to pursue editing as a full time career, I\u0027m confident I could put out at least 2 or 3 videos a week and stream multiple times throughout as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy joining my Patreon, you\u0027ll be directly contributing to increasing the amount of content I\u0027m able to produce every week."
