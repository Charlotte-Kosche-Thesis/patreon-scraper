I\u0027ve spent roughly ten years as a professional actor in film and television, and I\u0027ve been making videos on the Internet, in some form or another, since 2006. I started making the documentary web series \"No Small Parts\" in 2014, and the YouTube channel has continued to grow. In 2016, I started making shorter versions of \"No Small Parts\" as well as other various videos for IMDb. Fast-forward to now: I\u0027ve expanded the YouTube channel from \"No Small Parts\" to \"No Small Parts Productions\" as an effort to include other videos I\u0027m excited about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSPECIFIC TYPES OF VIDEOS\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eNo Small Parts\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eA video essay/documentary series about character actors. You know, those actors with faces you know you\u0027ve seen, but you\u0027re not sure from where. Most of the episodes are comprehensive biographies of a particular actor or actress, but some are a little off the beaten path. Every episode is made with one goal in mind: to shed some lights on Hollywood\u0027s lesser-known talents.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt Wasn\u0027t That Bad\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eA video essay/documentary series about the redeemable qualities of so-called \"bad\" movies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWalken 101\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA series of short commentary videos relating to the podcast \"Walken 101,\" in which my friend Kenny Johnson and myself watch every Christopher Walken project in chronological order and dissect his performance. In each video, Kenny and I will discuss, in-depth, one particular topic relating to Christopher Walken, whether it be analyzing a movie, discussing acting method, or the evolution of Walken\u0027s hair. For more info, go to Walken101.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eActing Oddities\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eA reaction series exploring odd acting roles in film and television.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I said, this was originally a Patreon page for \u201cNo Small Parts.\u201d Since I\u2019ve expanded the channel, I\u2019ve broadened the Patreon page to \u201cNo Small Parts Productions,\u201d which can include other videos that aren\u2019t \u201cNo Small Parts.\u201d I have, and will continue to make these for free. Even if nobody donated anything, I would still make them. However, Patreon provides me with a small budget that I can use for any of the following:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- renting a lot of old TV shows and movies on Amazon so I can screen capture them for a video\u003cbr\u003e\n- if something isn\u2019t available to stream, I\u2019ll get it on DVD, or even VHS \u003cbr\u003e\n- the occasional prop or updated piece of equipment\u003cbr\u003e\n- travel funds in the event that I have to fly/drive somewhere to interview someone for a particular video\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAny money donated simply increases the production value of any videos made for the channel. If you like the videos but can\u2019t donate, spread the word! The \u201cNo Small Parts\u201d series alone has spread through word-of-mouth, and I wouldn\u2019t be where I am without its fans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW OFTEN DO YOU RELEASE VIDEOS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEpisodes of \"No Small Parts\" and \"It Wasn\u0027t That Bad\" are particularly time-consuming. They could take four to eight weeks to make, sometimes longer. The shorter videos are more regular.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW CAN WE HELP?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only way this channel can continue to thrive is through viewer support, and really, I\u0027m happy that people are simply watching this stuff. The fact that I actually have a decent amount of subscribers watching the videos is amazing to me, and a comment or a \"thumbs-up\" on something I\u0027ve put this much work into means so much more than a \"haha funy\" comment on a Strange Faces video. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like the channel and you\u0027re willing to support it with a donation, know that you\u0027re helping me create episodes at a better pace, and also a better quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
