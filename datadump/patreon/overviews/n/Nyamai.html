If you support me here on patreon, I\u0027ll be able to upload content much more steadily\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, I\u0027d like some new equipment.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been using the same microphone since I started on Youtube in 2012. The top of the mic is beginning to break and the USB chord is very damaged. It makes recording difficult because the chord needs to be angled a certain way or else the microphone won\u0027t connect to my computer. Sometimes the mic will disconnect mid-record, so I\u0027ll have to start over the section I was working on. It makes recording new content much more tedious and tiring than it should be.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been using a sock as a pop filter for about 3 years, so a new pop filter would be amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThird, I\u0027d love to be able to put out higher quality content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to be able to commission artists and animators for my covers instead of using the original MV.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI love this community dearly. \u003cbr\u003eThere are so many people out there with incredible talent that they spend countless hours perfecting.\u003cbr\u003eIt would be amazing to be able to collaborate with such people while giving back to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really want to continue the work that I was once able to do for this community.\u003cbr\u003eI want to improve myself and continue singing for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for the support that you\u0027ve given me, even through my hiatus.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so grateful to every single one of you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re able to or wish to donate, any amount is enormously appreciated.\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
