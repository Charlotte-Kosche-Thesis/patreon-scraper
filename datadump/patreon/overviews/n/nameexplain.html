    "summary": "Hello all! My name is Patrick, and you most probably know me from my YouTube channel Name Explain. If you are just here to read this with no intention of donating that is more than fine! I don\u2019t expect anyone to give me any of their hard earned cash. Just watching my videos is more than enough support from you. \u003cstrong\u003eWhat I want to talk about first is what will change on the channel if you don\u2019t donate, very very very little. Name Explain will go up on the channel every other Friday with no early privileges to Patreon supporters.\u003c/strong\u003e The only reason I say very very very little will change as oppose to nothing will change is due to the videos that\u2019ll be made at the highest Patreon tier, but that can be something those interested can look into themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay so who\u2019s still here? \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re still here with interest in supporting the Patreon thank you so much! I\u2019m sure this has been said countless times on this site but ever since I knew it was a career choice my dream has been to become a full time YouTube content creator, and I am aware of how much of a challenge that is. YouTube ad rates aren\u2019t that great (especially when they demonetise your video with no option to review it) and are hard to live off. That\u2019s where you guys come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn an ideal world I\u0027d live entirely off small contributions from supporters of the channel and videos. The beauty of Patreon is the constant amount. Just living off YouTube ad rate money means a different amount month to month depending on how well you\u0027re videos have done. Meaning you end up trying to make the video you think will get the most views as oppose to the video you have the most passion towards. The set amount of money I\u0027d receive on Patreon would give me the chance to make more unique videos (not chase for clickbait views) and more importantly piece of mind. \u003cstrong\u003eKnowing I have x amount of money a month would mean the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease only donate if you have the free money.\u003c/strong\u003e Like I said before I don\u2019t expect anyone to support me on Patreon, least of all those who don\u2019t have the financial opportunity (I\u2019m looking at you poor students) and that is fine. \u003cstrong\u003eOnly donate as much as you feel comfortable donating. Perhaps donate the amount of money you wouldn\u2019t mind loosing if it fell out your pocket or something.\u003c/strong\u003e Just know that no matter how big or small your contribution is. It\u2019ll all be hugely appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all honesty guys I don\u0027t ever expect to make a full time living by \"doing YouTube\" but you awesome people can help change those odds. If I could just go to my local pub with my friends, by a round of drinks, and knowing it was being paid for by doing something I love, that would be amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrick Foote\u003cbr\u003eName Explain"
