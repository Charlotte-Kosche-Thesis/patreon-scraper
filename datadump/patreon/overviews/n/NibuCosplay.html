Who knows XD\u003cbr\u003eI jumped into the Cosplay world head first and since then, my life has been filled with excitement, love and happiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn regards to my work itself, I specialize in Gijinka creations and armored cosplays. \u003cbr\u003eEhhh.... Gaj..Giji... Gojank-what???\u003cbr\u003eGijinka are humanized versions of non-humans concepts like animals, creatures, monsters, objects, etc.  All my Gijinka cosplay are designed, created and made by me.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, well..
