My work focuses on survivors, lesbian/queer narratives and healing. \u00a0I\u0027ve been writing my personal zine, Mend My Dress since 2005 and taught workshops on zine making and writing to heal from trauma. With\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.mendmydress.com\"\u003eMend My Dress Press\u003c/a\u003e I publish and distribute works by other artists of different marginalized identities. I believe in the healing powers of shared experiences and solidarity. I also have been studying magic and spell crafting for over 20 years, with a focus on protective and healing magic. I work with plants and stones along with other natural elements. Color therapy, candle magic, and in the last three years the tarot have all been supportive tools for me. I draw my upbringing in a neo-pagan home, and research I have done on the historical magical practices of the cultures I have\u00a0descended\u00a0from. I look forward to sharing my art, creative process and knowledge with you. Thank you for reading, and thank you for your support! I will send out rewards to those who pledge once a month.\u2728\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
