It has taken me over 10 years to find what ignites the flame of passion within my heart, and finally this passion has revealed itself to me. What brings me the deepest joy in life is the opportunity to help others out of their suffering. This can manifest itself in many forms but my inner guide has led me to help the most oppressed beings on our planet, non-human animals, and also to help human animals on their own journey to find health and happiness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eMy Activism\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnonymous for the Voiceless\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u00a0 As the West Coast Regional Organizer, and solo Organizer for the San Francisco Chapter of Anonymous for the Voiceless, I volunteer my time to the general overseeing of 30+ chapters within 6 US states (Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Alaska, and Hawaii), I organize all of the Cube of Truth events in San Francisco that occur at least once a week, rain or shine, and host workshops to train my volunteers to be effective outreachers.

I went through a great transformation that began in October of 2017. A hard point in life propelled me forward into an intense period of growth. I learned how to love myself and with that came great care for my body and mind. When I cultivated loving-kindness in my heart, I also discovered how to let that flow out into other areas of my body and my life. At this point, I found meditation and mindfulness practice in Buddhism and began a weight loss journey. I lost over 50 lbs in 8 months and gained a new perspective on life. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My weightless journey was a result of eating a High Carb Low Fat Whole Food Plant Based Vegan diet. Goodness, thats a mouthful! But really it just means I ate whole plant foods in the balance human bodies were designed to accommodate. A bit of healthy movement that resulted mostly from the healthy eating (rather that being forced by a desire to lose weight), and a continued journey of loving myself fueled this physical transformation. \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0Now, I help others to obtain self-love, a healthful body, and a natural minimalist lifestyle through online coaching, YouTube videos, E-books, recipes, product reviews, and inspiring Instagram posts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0I have found my flame, please help me fuel it by supporting me on this journey!
