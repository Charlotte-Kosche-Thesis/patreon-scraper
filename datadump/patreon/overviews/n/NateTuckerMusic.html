Sometimes they even lived with them. But through the 20th century, artists started to make a living from playing concerts and selling albums, vinyl, CDs and other merchandise. When this became such a boom, artists veered away from needing high-profile community patrons and relied on their fans and audiences to sustain themselves, their music and their art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that streaming music and art online for free is such a huge part of our culture in the modern world, artists need the support of their community more than ever.\u00a0 And the cool thing is that today, anyone can be a patron. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the PATRON HIVE\u003c/strong\u003e, a new way to support artists\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003ewhile being involved in the artistic community and process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a Patron, you\u0027ll be supporting projects and collaborations in my studio and around Boston, like the most recent collaboration with Josh Knowles (see the \"Posts\" section for more info).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll receive all the awesome benefits that come with supporting art, including access to exclusive, unreleased music and videos, getting secret show invites, special merchandise, and much more!\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e (check out Rewards Tab for more info!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eSo, thank you for checking out the Patron Hive and supporting the arts in any way you can.

I\u0027m very excited to get moving on so many projects that have been on the back burner.
