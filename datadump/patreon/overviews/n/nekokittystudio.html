I am an artist that loves making cute cat plushies and drawings of cat (I have six of them!). I also love anime and you can often find me vending at various anime conventions along the East Coast. I also stream my drawing and creation process on Twitch.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cimg height=\"200\" src=\"http://orig06.deviantart.net/a266/f/2016/024/d/d/plushie_lot_by_nekokittystudio-d9p91i1.jpg\" width=\"600\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently have a website set up with Shopify, so you can buy my plushies from the comfort of your own home. I also have some designs up on Redbubble where you can custom order my artwork on t-shirts, mugs or other knickknacks. This is just the start of my kitty themed plot for world domination and I want to do even more!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo why Patreon?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI am so grateful for the fans and followers that I have met over the years and your enthusiasm continues to inspire me. I have so many ideas I want to purrsue, but only limited resources at my disposal. With your support, I can bring more of these kitty creations to life which means more cute cats for everyone! To show my gratitude, I have some super snazzy rewards that are exclusively for my Patreon backers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
