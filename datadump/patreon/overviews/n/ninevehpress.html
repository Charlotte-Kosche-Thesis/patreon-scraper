If you want to support Nineveh Press, thank you! But this\nis not asking people for donations, I don\u2019t believe a publisher should ask for\nmoney. If you support me and my work, you should get\nsomething in return. What you get in return is high quality publications about\nAssyrians. Nineveh Press is devoted to editing and publishing old unpublished\nworks and giving new and aspiring authors a possibility to publish and\ndistribute their works. In fact, it\u2019s a lot of value for what you give.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince August 2016 I have invested time and effort in establishing Nineveh\nPress and publishing books. During this time, I have realized that this\nbusiness will never bring the economy required to make the work sustainable in\nthe long run. Until today I have worked with Nineveh Press mainly in my free\ntime and at leisure. But with more finances, I would be able to spend more time\nand work, and hire professional translators, proofreaders and the like.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u2019d like to help me keep doing what I do, and\neven do more, become a Nineveh Press Patron today. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy becoming a Nineveh Press Patron, you are contributing with a couple\nof dollars (minimum $1) a month \u2013 or whatever amount you feel is appropriate.
