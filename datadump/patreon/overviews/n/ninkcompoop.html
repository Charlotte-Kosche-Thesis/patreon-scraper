I am a Media Graduate trying to find her own little place in the big wide world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoving image has always been a primary passion of mine -\u00a0to have the chance to do this for a living would be a dream come true. Working from home has been a blessing and I find that working on projects in my own home is far more relaxing. Being able to work in the comforts of my own control to my best of ability is something I would be eternally grateful to do...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to be able to continue working full time on my YouTube channel. I have hopes to begin running two full time channels as my next step, which would easily need my full attention! This Patreon has been set up so that whatever you have to give, can go straight towards my content and support the content that I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not ALL about me though! On this page you can see all the things that you will get in return for donating a small amount every month. There are rewards such as handwritten letters from me, my exclusive blooper videos and an early sneak peek to my future videos! Take a look at which ones take your fancy :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever... it is so so important for me to stress that if you are not able to help out, then THAT IS OKAY. The support you have given has got me here in the first place and I am already very thankful every single day. See this webpage as just a tip jar, and nobody is entitled to contribute unless they fancy it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove and hugs, Ellie x\u003cbr\u003e"

I cannot guarantee to improve a problem or solve an issue. I do not have the talent to communicate with the supernatural so cannot provide you with any information regarding past ones. Simply pop me a message on Patreon whenever you are ready to receive a reading! A video of your reading should then be ready for you within a week. Please feel free to let me know which parts didn\u0027t connect well with your situation - I will most certainly not take any offence as this will just help me look again and try to make more sense of what appeared in your cards.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e",
