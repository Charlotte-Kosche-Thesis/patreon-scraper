They are forever weaving in and out of our minds.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kerry and I\u0027ve been a writer for as long as I can remember. I\u0027ve written everything from literary fiction to romance to science fiction \u0026amp; fantasy. My SFF work has appeared on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://expandedhorizons.net/magazine/?page_id=3942\"\u003eExpanded Horizons\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.glittership.com/2017/03/22/episode-35-cooking-with-closed-mouths-by-kerry-truong/\"\u003eGlitterShip\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, \u003c/em\u003eand I\u0027ve self published shorter works such as folktales and flash fiction. In addition, I self publish my romance short stories, which, in case you can\u0027t tell from my Patreon, are gay. Very gay. These self published works can be found below!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are my stories gay? Because I\u0027m a queer, non-binary femme boy and it is vital to my existence to have stories that reflect my experiences. I\u0027m happiest when writing about romantic relationships, whether they\u0027re set in a secondary world or in our own world. My stories revolve around characters and the connections they form with the person who will understand them and be their partner as they navigate the difficulties of life (and have sex. Yes, I write about that too).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorldbuilding is important to me; character development is \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0important to me. It\u0027s just that these things don\u0027t exist in contradiction to the kind of stories I want to tell. Which is what brings me to the next thing...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWhy Am I Here?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI\u0027m here on Patreon because I want a sustainable way to grow my writing career the way I envision it. I love supporting and submitting to smaller SFF magazines, but what I\u0027m committed to is self publishing my own work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve tried out many different pathways for publishing fiction throughout the years, from my first Fanfiction.net account way back in the way to a short-lived stint as a MFA student, and what I\u0027ve learned is that self publishing works best for me. I write at my best when I don\u0027t have the pressure of meeting a word count or worrying whether my story will fit what other people think is good writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u0027t to say that I don\u0027t hold my fiction to a high standard of quality. I\u0027m always working to improve my storytelling, and each of my stories goes through several drafts before publication. It\u0027s just that I want to be able to do it my own way, at my own pace, so that my writing can grow strong. Plus, I\u0027m a big believer that at the end of the day, your writing is something that you should have fun with! That\u0027s what makes it fun for your readers as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, in order to do this, I also need to, well, live. Which is where patronage comes in! If I\u0027m able to make a steady and predictable living, then it\u0027s easier for me to dedicate my time and efforts to creating the stories that I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do You Get By Supporting Me?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGay fiction. So much gay fiction.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.shousetsubangbang.com/mirror/tiger-prince-thorn-witch/\"\u003eA tiger prince and the beautiful foreign bride she brings home to try and solve a curse put on her\u003c/a\u003e; a lesbian Jane Eyre retelling with Vietnamese characters; a non-binary witchboy trying to fight off the evil magic that\u0027s possessing his best friend. There will also be other stories, like folktales and fairytale retellings and good old sword and sorcery, which aren\u0027t specifically focused on romance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here\u0027s the thing: I grew up with fandom, so I love playing with the same universes and building them up. That means that if you liked certain characters or a certain world, there\u0027s a high chance that you\u0027ll get to see them in another story! From short stories to drabbles to chaptered fiction, you will get a chance to explore worlds and get to know characters from a variety of different viewpoints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of these stories will be available to the public, but I will also include author\u0027s notes, deleted scenes, and \"pilot\" versions of stories exclusively for my patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027ve got a craving for fun gay fiction (and I know you do, because I sure do), watch this space! It will always be growing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
