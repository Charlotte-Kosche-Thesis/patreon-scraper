    "summary": "Hey it\u0027s me, Gerrit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I am a woodworker, a former professional frame-maker / restorer, who had the privilege to work on the frame\u2019s of some worldwide famous paintings, my heart goes out to fixing the, often thought to be, unfixable. Not only do I enjoy making new from the old, using reclaimed wood, shop-made tools and other skip-found unloved materials, I love wood in general and when using new timber, I want it to be harvest locally. Just the fact that you\u0027re here tells me that you\u0027ve thought about the time, creativity and effort that goes into making a living with a small workshop on a lonesome hill in central Portugal, while sharing all ups and downs, successful projects and mistakes on a Youtube channel.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eWhy Do I Need Funding?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning a small workshop, in an area where recycling and upgrading used materials is still far away from being a normality, could be seen as a hopeless endeavour. Still, with every project, new insights and possibilities bubble to the surface and it\u2019s those solutions that I want to share with others. It takes time... lots of time and although I can\u2019t think of anything else I\u2019d rather do, it\u2019s just not financially rewarding. I am on Patreon to help fund the workshop activities and provide even better, more regular content on the Not Just Sawdust Youtube channel and to sometimes replace tools that are broken beyond my skills of fixing. By pledging to Not Just Sawdust you\u0027re helping make my dream of running a recycling and woodworking shop come true!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting Not Just Sawdust on Patreon will allow me to do things like getting locals involved, go out and show interesting projects, make more frequent videos and get out of the survival mode which forces me to take on jobs that are so much in contrast with the environmental responsibilities I would like to stand for. There are so many projects drawn out on the back of shoeboxes that deserve the experiment, so many skip-found items that should be turned into something beautiful and a lot of alternatives to be proven. No, it\u2019s not about sharing expensive or technical complicated projects, my goal is to present solutions on a low budget scale without making compromises on beauty and usability. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 179, 215);\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003eNot Just Sawdust, N\u00e3o S\u00f3 Serradura, because it isn\u0027t just that. It\u0027s the evidence reflecting the relentless urge to create, the proverbial blood of that beautiful material nature provides us with. It\u0027s the sharp teeth that cut, the subdued mind that finds out what a piece of wood harbours in itself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eHow? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral appreciation levels allow you to tailor your subscription. I would like to convince you to choose one, even at $1, so you have access to the feed here at Patreon where you\u0027ll find a weekly update about uploaded videos, blog posts and more, accompanied by some detailed information. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eWhat? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to go above and beyond to help me do things like invest in some highly needed equipment, create a weekly blog, put historical perspective on used materials and processes and taking time to do research, inviting or visit others with good ideas to share their projects, preparing educational workshops, (contribute to the food and bill budget every now and than) and most of all make more video\u2019s you would like to watch.... picking any of the larger support levels will certainly help do these things! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe it goes without saying that I would greatly appreciate your financial support. I\u0027ll say it anyways though. Thank you. The Patreon model has us place rewards here to entice you to donate, but I hope you\u0027re here because you understand what I\u0027m trying to accomplice with the Not Just Sawdust workshop, Youtube channel and website. I\u2019m very pleased with your interest on the adventures of a somewhat strange Dutchman on that lonesome hill in rural Portugal. \u003cbr\u003e"

The meandering paths away from that straight highway, leading to the unavoidable coffin, made him see the most breathtaking views, pass the dark corners of society and brought numerous kinds of unexpected encounters with the good and the bad. A, not always understood, but inexhaustible and relentless creativity made him enthusiastic for 12 trades, resulting in 13 accidents before realizing that one doesn\u0027t need to travel on ready made roads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rock \u0027n\u0027 roll hair is cut, the bandanna\u0027s dropped in the big bin of rags, blue suede shoes exchanged for steel nosed boots. A 300 year old ruined building was transformed into a workshop, the garden into an open air stage and the little cottage on that lonely hill in the vicinity of rural Portugal, turned into a home. Doors are open, clock\u0027s don\u0027t count hours and food is cooked instead of brightened up by micro waves. Old things become new things just by treating them with a little passion, some 12 trade tricks and compassion for that little paradisiac spot on the planet.\u003cbr\u003e",
