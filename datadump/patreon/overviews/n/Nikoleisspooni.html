A feast for the eyes. :wink: And we\u0027re appreciative to have yours.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe is an Artist.\u00a0 She is also a storyteller who prattles on about fanciful tales full of beasts and hunts and people who have no business wielding power in her novel series known as The Story of the Universe. She is also a game developer and designer, working with mod communities and tabletoppers. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhy be a patron?\u003cbr\u003eBecause we\u0027re building a book...and sheets....and leatherbound journals to go with them...and anything else that fits in with owning a bright shiny new sourcebook for Dungeon Masters that run a 5e D\u0026amp;D game based in her world.\u003cbr\u003e1. She will post 1 to 2 entries into the Sourcebook per month. THAT\u0027S RIGHT...there will be sekrits revealed here! \u00a0Sekrits only patrons can see.\u00a0 Like seriously...WE are building this book.\u003cbr\u003e2. As a patron you\u0027ll receive perks based on your specified tier.\u003cbr\u003e3.\u00a0You will determine what Entry she releases next\nbased on polls.\u00a0 Spooni* will post 4 or 5 prospective thumbnails to be worked up, you\u0027ll get to vote, then she\u0027ll finish up the illustration, the entry and any statblocks that may correspond.\u00a0 Some pieces may be a bit suggestive but they\u0027re always SFW.\u003cbr\u003e4. You\u0027ll be party in the creation of Spooni*\u0027s universes and books based on them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince she will be posting\u00a0at least one completed entry per month and since you show your support Per Painting, it ensures she doesn\u0027t sit around doing nothing all day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEND RESULT:\u003cbr\u003eThe sourcebook will be printed, yes, when it\u0027s done. $5 Patrons will receive a fresh and lovely hardcopy as a part of the deal. $10 get access to the constantly updated .pdf and a Hardcopy of what we\u0027ve done.\u003cbr\u003eFUTURE!FORWARD:\u003cbr\u003eCosplay Contests,\u00a0 Radio Plays, CCG...etc.\u00a0 Spooni has ideas.\u003cbr\u003e"
