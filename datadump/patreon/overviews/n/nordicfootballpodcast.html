    "summary": "The Nordic Football Podcast was launched in May 2017. We appreciate everyone who has listened so far and thank you all for your support. We averaged around 500 downloads per episode, much more than we expected, and featured special guests including some of the top managers and players in Scandinavian football. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to really develop the podcast and take it to the next level, though, we are appealing for some financial support from you, the public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything we have done on NFP so far has been for free, using our own time and resources. Whilst we would love this to continue, realistically we have to acknowledge it would be difficult without some extra backing. The top quality product we strive to bring you requires time and effort, not to mention extras like podcast hosting fees etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why we are appealing to you, the public, and our listeners, to ask if you would consider supporting us for a small fee each month. We have three tiers from which you can contribute. You can back us with an outlay as little as $5 a month (less than \u00a31 per episode), whilst we will also be bringing some added podcast extras for those willing to pay a little bit more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, we will continue to produce the best possible podcasts we can - better than ever before. Our in-depth coverage of the Swedish and Norwegian leagues will continue, in addition to our varied range of special guests and exclusive interviews and content. Long term, our ambition is for the podcast to increase its download and listener base, improve the overall quality and to attract a wide array of sponsors and backers to support the podcast financially - allowing us to continue bringing you the best English language coverage of Nordic football there is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePut simply, the more you help us out, the better quality of podcasts we can produce and develop for you. For less than the cost of a few beers a month, your support will help to keep us going throughout the exciting 2018 season and beyond. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance to anyone who is able to contribute, it really is appreciated. Steve and Jonathan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
