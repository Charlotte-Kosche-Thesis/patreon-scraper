If you are even the slightest bit interested in the Meraki mission and my music, I am so appreciative. Dreams can come true, Wahoo! Maybe you are wondering what this whole Patreon thing is. It is a crowdfunding platform. But, what does that mean? It means this is creator to community direct.  IF you like what I am creating and want to support me creating/developing t\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003ehe Meraki mission/ new songs/ poetry/ music videos/ motivational pieces etc.,  first of all, THANK YOU for even considering! Secondly, this is the place where you can support me directly. I would LOVE to be able to continue to create music and build the Meraki mission with all of you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is the Meraki Mission? Why am I doing this? The short version is because I was really unhappy with the way my life was going and I needed a big change. I\u0027d say my breaking point was when my little brother was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. This changed my perspective on life and the way I view time. I realized that I need passion and purpose in my life daily. I wanted to be able to smile for no reason other than being alive. I wanted to LOVE my life and share this joy with the people in it. So, I created this thing called the Meraki mission. It started with a connection that I felt to the word \u0027meraki\u0027. Meraki means to do something, anything with passion and creativity or soul; to leave a piece of yourself in your work. I try to do this with my music. 2 years later, this has developed into a mission with purpose. The Meraki mission will share peoples\u0027 stories and their passions for making their life better. My hope is that by sharing these stories it will help others find their Meraki mission too. For me, I choose to create music. For others, it is poetry, painting, dancing or even sharing their story is enough to motivate others to not give up on happiness. Through Patreon we can build this community of positive people doing passionate things. If you or someone that you know has something they are passionate about and want to share their story please email me at ....\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what about the music? Maybe you\u2019ve heard one of my songs or seen a video. I hope that you enjoyed it and are inspired, also THANKS for listening. Everyone has their own way of healing and music happens to be mine. Everything that you see so far has been created from my own resources. Working three and four jobs at a time, sleeping five or so hours a night. I am ENTIRELY independent. I am not complaining! I love to create and to share my work. I am inspired by passion and love, which is why I decided to call my project the Meraki mission. I tend to dream big. I would love to be able to see all my ideas come to life and SHARE them with YOU. The problem with this is that I am only human, I am only one person. Self-releasing isn\u2019t easy. I am dedicated to my project and will continue to create but a little extra help would be AMAZING!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon? I decided to go with Patreon to see if I can connect with anyone that enjoys music/ videos and stories from the Meraki mission that I share. I interview real people and share their passion! The direct support will allow me to continue creating and sharing. In order to take things to next level, I need a budget, I do need support. There are so many costs involved: recording studio, engineer, musicians, videographers, equipment etc. To do these things at a faster pace with consistent deadlines I need help. If you like what I am doing and if you want to hear more music that I create please consider joining me on Patreon. I have so many exciting things planned. I understand there is a lot of trust that is taken into account here, which is why I have started everything on my own, without asking for support to prove that I can and will create. I have also set up my Patreon page in a way where I will be in communication before anything is released and if you decide to change your mind, you will be informed before being charged and can easily back out. (I will miss you but understand that we all have priorities and responsibilities) Also, don\u0027t have money right now? Check out the Q+A for other ways to be involved without signing up for Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e...............................................................................................................................................................\u003cbr\u003eQ+A SECTION\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: I have a question about your Patreon, who can I ask? \u003cbr\u003eA: Email me at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:patronhelp@nishaemusic.com\"\u003epatronhelp@nishaemusic.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What is Patreon and why should I support you here?  \u003cbr\u003eA: Patreon is a crowdfunding medium. This is a direct way to support my art and the Meraki mission. You could support me if you like the music I create and would like to see more. If you would like to see insider information on how, who and where I work, I will make all of that available here with special surprises along the way. IF you would even consider this, I humbly THANK YOU and promise to create to the best of my ability with my truest emotions. I will keep my values aligned with my purpose. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ:  How do the rewards work and what do the Tiers mean? \u003cbr\u003eA:  Should you choose to support me (this makes me so happy I could cry) the rewards are what you get for your chosen level of tier support. The tiers start at $1 and go up to $1,000. At each level I am offering a different amount of \u201cstuff\u201d or rewards. The more information you want about the project and my work the more rewards you will get with a higher level of Tier support. Some of these things include early access to music and videos, insider content about my life, my work, access to my personal life and what motivates me. The more you choose to support, the more I get to create for you. It means I can create LOTS of stuff!! You can see the specifics on the sidebar to the right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What does it mean to support you \u201cper thing\u201d? \u003cbr\u003eA:  Some Patreon pages are setup for support monthly. I am choosing to ask for support per \u201cthing\u201d. This means you ONLY  get charged when I create. This way, If I haven\u2019t completed a project yet for that month, you won\u2019t have to pay for something that has not been finished. I wouldn\u2019t feel right asking you to pay for something you have not gotten to see or hear. I never want to feel guilty about not being on time with creating. By doing things this way I will only ask for your support when I have \u201cthings\u201d to release.  I want this to be a mutually beneficial relationship. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What is my commitment when I support you on patreon? \u003cbr\u003eA: The commitment is totally and completely up to you. You can choose the tier level you want. There is also an option to create your own tier if none of the preexisting options work for you.  After you sign up, I will always send out an email BEFORE you get charged, letting you know when I will be releasing stuff and reminding you that you will be charged. This way, you get a bit of a warning if you decide you can\u2019t afford it this time around.  I also have a one time support option through PayPal on my website, link HERE. \u003cbr\u003eWith per creation, creators manually select whether or not they\u0027d like to charge patrons for a post. At the start of the month patrons will be charged for all the paid posts from the previous month. To give patrons more control over how much they are charged, we provide an option for them to place a \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203913729\"\u003emonthly max\u003c/a\u003e on their pledges. This means that if you make 5 paid posts in a month and have a patron pledging $2 per creation with no monthly max set, they\u0027ll be charged $10 on the first of the following month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: How often are you releasing \u201cthings\u201d? I want to support you but don\u2019t know how often I will be charged.\u003cbr\u003eA: No more than once a month. You will not be charged more than once a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: I want to support your art but I can\u2019t commit for an ongoing amount, what can I do? \u003cbr\u003eA:  I have a one time pay option as well as non-monetary options. One time pay through my website using PayPal. You choose the amount. You are in control. ANYTHING is appreciated! Thank you, thank you! Link HEeerreee$$\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: I can\u2019t spend money right now, how else can I support you? \u003cbr\u003eA:  I completely understand if a monetary support is not an option. There are other ways to be a part of this! I have a free email newsletter option if you would just like to know what I am up to. You can sign up hereeeee...$$ I will send updates about releases and shows etc. This will be similar information that is posted on my social media. You can sign up for that through my website HERE. Let\u2019s connect on the gram and the book. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
