    "summary": "Thanks so much for checking out my Patreon page! I truly feel honored when I win a new reader or keep an old one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing about faith and politics. Government is important, but the Gospel of Jesus Christ is much more crucial and amazing! So we need to put our faith above our politics by submitting our sentiments to the scrutiny of scripture.\u00a0Yet I know from experience and observation how hard this can be - for conservatives and liberals alike. Thus my writing theme is \"from the flag to the cross.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince earning my B.A. in History from Cedarville University in 2005, I have written 200+ articles for many national and local publications. During that time, my focus, methods, and audience have evolved. But as a grateful husband and father, I need to justify my writing hours by earning a steady income for my family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is where you come in!\u00a0Patreon is a membership platform which makes it easy for creators to get paid. As a patron, you join me at any reward level you desire, and I match your commitment the best I can. One example is my \"Senior Partner\" reward for $10, where you\u0027ll gain access to all my articles and I will tell my readers about your projects and interests - so we can boost each other\u0027s audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really want your input - and not just in cash. First, please pray for me! Then\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=1251165\"\u003echeck out my rewards\u003c/a\u003e for how involved you can be as one of my patrons (or pitch in with a few others as a group). I am excited to offer my content to God and you - and to share some of your ideas as well!\u003cbr\u003e"
