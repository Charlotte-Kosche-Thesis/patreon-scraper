A lot has changed since then. Steampunk has gone mainstream. Dieselpunk is now recognized as a genre and a subculture in its own right. We have seen blogs and webzines come and go. \u003cem\u003eThe Gatehouse\u003c/em\u003e went through various iterations and for a couple of years published its own printable magazine, the \u003cem\u003eGatehouse Gazette\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it\u0027s time for the next chapter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn February of this year, we (Hilde Heyvaert and Nick Ottens) relaunched \u003cem\u003eThe Gatehouse\u003c/em\u003e as \u003cem\u003eNever Was\u003c/em\u003e. With a crisp new look and our own domain, we are upping our game. We want \u003cem\u003eNever Was\u003c/em\u003e to be more of a magazine than a blog, with long-form stories about art, architecture, history and genre theory as well as the event, book and movie reviews long-time readers have come to expect of us. We hope to reach not only existing dieselpunk and steampunk enthusiasts, but readers who are interested in (alternate) history generally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat means an investment on our part. Hosting the website is relatively cheap. The main investment is time -- to research, write, edit and promote stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhich is why we\u0027re here. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eNever Was \u003c/em\u003ehas always been a hobby for us and always will be. But being able to earn some money from it would go a long way to justifying the time we put into the magazine, plus it would be enormously motivating to know that people value our work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth of us are freelancers. The more we can earn from writing for \u003cem\u003eNever Was\u003c/em\u003e, the more we can write and the less time we need to spend on other projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetween us, we write about 75 percent of all the content on the website. We also occasionally receive contributions from a team of writers. Being able to pay them on a story basis would be a dream come true.\u003cbr\u003e"
