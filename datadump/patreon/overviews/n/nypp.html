Not Your Pastor\u0027s podcast is our \"pulpit\" which we open up for our guests and listeners alike to speak about Jesus and influence church culture in a way you most likely wouldn\u0027t hear on Sunday morning. Please don\u0027t just listen to us, join us in building a voice! Sure, money helps us build this platform while we can, but sending us a 5-10 minute recording of how Jesus worked in your life helps build a more complete picture of Jesus for the church which is an invaluable contribution to society. We can\u0027t thank your enough! - Alex and Jason"
