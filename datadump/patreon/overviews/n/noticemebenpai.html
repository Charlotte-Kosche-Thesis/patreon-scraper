    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for stopping by my Patreon page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make stepcharts for the 4-panel DDR/ITG community, under the name of Benpai. I started making charts in early 2016 and was graced by a win in an online chart-making tournament, called Technical Showcase 2, which helped me to connect and collaborate with popular FA charters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eowo What\u0027s this, you ask?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is just an idea that David McNeil gave to me a while back, saying that new upcoming step-artists like me should be showcased and supported.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, I have a few main reasons for making this Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy motivation to make content has always been not just for myself, but for other people as well. I want to reach out to those who want to see certain songs charted.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ve been open to doing commissions and have done a couple, but having no other way to ask for commissions or contact me other than through Facebook can be frustrating.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHaving goals of releasing content gives me motivation and ups the quality of my work.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is also a bit of a test run to see how many people would actually be willing to support step-artists in this community, as this is probably the first of its kind on Patreon. If this Patreon doesn\u0027t turn out as successful, I will still continue to make content for this community (up to a certain time) and life goes on.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if\u00a0you want to support me in making more charts, I would be immensely thankful. College debt is still looming on my back, but again, it\u0027s not a main reason for this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who do decide to support me, I have set up some (tentative) rewards as a basis.\u003cbr\u003eIf you do not have the capability to support, don\u0027t worry! Just sending a message to me saying that you appreciate my work is often enough to motivate me. \u003cbr\u003eCanceling your pledge due to financial reasons or for other reasons is also understandable, feel free to remove your pledge at any time. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of how much you decide to pay, every bit of support is greatly appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLinks to packs I\u0027ve been involved in:\u003cbr\u003eNotice Me Benpai: \u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/vwxinzd2ebe58tp/Notice%20Me%20Benpai.zip?dl=0\"\u003ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/vwxinzd2ebe58tp/Notice%2...\u003c/a\u003e (will re-release with full difficulties at release of Notice Me Benpai 2)\u003cbr\u003e3guys1pack:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://xrgtmx.github.io/3guys1pack/\"\u003ehttps://xrgtmx.github.io/3guys1pack/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe link for my Twitch streams (for when I chart or play ITG possibly) is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/iamyourbenpai\"\u003ehttps://www.twitch.tv/iamyourbenpai\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInformation about commissions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have something that you would like me to make, but you\u0027re hesitant to ask because of the music genre, BPM, or style (technical, stream, footspeed, gimmicky, etc.), don\u0027t worry! I can do (or at least try) whatever you would like to have a chart for.\u003cbr\u003ePrices (tentative): It varies mostly on the length of the song and partially on how easy it will be to chart it. For example, if the song is drifty in its tempo due to it being older or live, then it will definitely be more work for me to get every single note on point. If you commission me and want a 10+ minute chart, I will definitely ask for more than, let\u0027s say, at least $50.\u003cbr\u003eAs for the lower bound of how much I request for a commission, I\u0027d say $10 to $15 is reasonable. If you\u0027re one of my patrons, then the amount will drop to probably $5 to $10.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions, don\u0027t be afraid to send a message to me!\u003cbr\u003e"
