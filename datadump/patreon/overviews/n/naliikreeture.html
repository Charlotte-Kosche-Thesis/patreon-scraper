    "summary": "OLA BEAUTIES \u0026amp; BEASTIES!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly thank you for making it this far! I really appreciate you taking the time to check this out, with an open mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve started on a brand new adventure which began February 2017. It all started from an Avant Garde submission for an assignment when I was going through my Diploma of Specialised makeup, the submission was a unicorn, thus my love of unicorns was born. I then birthed the idea of the project after completing a live body art exhibition for an event fund raiser called \"Gaia\". I loved the creative process so much I felt I needed more of this in my life. 2017 turned into a multifaceted gem of amazing works of art, collaborations, creations and many networks and connections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI named the project The Unicorn Academy, because of the correlation between the birth of my love for unicorns whilst studying in an academy, and the transformation process of my subjects from blank canvas to glorious unicorn. It just sat with me and so it was. I was later dubbed \"The mother of Unicorns\" I assume, due to my addiction to Game of Thrones and well, UNICORNS!! \u003cp\u003eMost of you already know that I\u0027ve been self funding one of the most monumental projects I\u0027ve ever created to date; 12 models, 8 team members including myself (so far) which gives you the heart of THE UNICORN ACADEMY!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is The Unicorn Academy?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts a creative, magical place where I as the Director and my talented team of artists transform the most normal everyday person into their magical unicorn archetype.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently have 11 beautiful women, and 1 handsome man. I\u0027ve made over my models for a preliminary release to the unicorn set, that I will be working for each of my chosen models Commencing May 2018. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe unicorn creations will take place individually. Originally I had planned to create one each month until all completed, with the first to take place this February. However the universe had other plans for me, and I have left the end date open, until funding comes through, which then will give me a better idea of when I can get everything completed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am aiming for a calendar and artbook release after the completion of the project. Which will also be incentives for the patrons whom partake in the crowdfunding, along with many other little gifts and perks. I will be running primarily from Patreon as well with Patreon only incentives and rewards, however I\u0027m using an additional Australian platform to raise an initial 5K to buy the project a high quality camera, without one, this project would not exist.\u003c/p\u003eHaving this camera will allow me to exactly portray the image as I imagine it without alternative influence skewing the point of focus. I will be able to deliver fine art for your aesthetic pleasure, capturing all the behind the scenes in high definition, the love, the passion the laughter, and crazy antics and also the contrary, the blood, the blisters, the sweat, the tears. All of the trials and tribulations that contribute to the entire journey that is The Unicorn Academy!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "OK re assessment of the goals and things! If you didn\u0027t see my most recent blog, go sus it out. I\u0027m creating an art book. It is going to be the most amazing thing I\u0027ve ever done EVER. Here is a little breakdown:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Grandiose art book \nwith a large body of eclectic works. Catharsis - Off with the Faeries is\naptly named, as it is the coming together of emotions, the healing, my medicine\ndepicted in art in many different shapes and forms. Delving into my distraction\nas a young adult, transitioning through to the \"adult\" realm, whilst\nstill holding on to the naive wonderment of the world, childlike dreams,\nimagination, and the undeniable compulsions to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book itself, is a storybook with little dialogue, a\njourney into the imagination, avoidism, distraction, the fantasies \u0026amp; dreams\nconcocted in the mind of an eccentric creator.  Capturing the tales of a little wildlings life,\ntraversing through a wonderland, the abounding nature, abundant love, the wild\nfantasies, the deepest depths of pain and sorrow, the odyssey through grief and\nartistic remedies, the explosive joys and highs in life, the divine feminine,\nand masculine all illustrated in saturated hues, bright colours, where you can\nget lost and find yourself in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEach page will tell a different tale, each tale takes you on\nan emotional journey, where you can relate, and project your own experiences\nonto, the concept is to facilitate a feeling space in which you can reflect.\nThe tales in the book compile of several different mediums, including but not\nlimited to; paintings, sketches, photographic art, drawings \u0026amp;\nillustrations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the centre of the book will be an intricate pop out\nsegment, with wild illustrations that dazzle the mind and evoke the inner child\nthat lives deep within each of us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe imagery will be beautiful, wildly beautiful, free from any burden of self criticism\nand self doubt, after all it is Catharsis. For too long, I\u0027ve been in my own\nway, I\u0027m using this book as not only a means to deliver a message and to hold\nspace for reflection, but a way to liberate the inner child that I have\nalienated, from myself for my entire adult life. I hope to potentially bring\nawareness to other souls who find themselves riding the same waves that I am. \u003cbr\u003e",
