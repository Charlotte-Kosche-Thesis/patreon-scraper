I grew up as my city became one of murals--they told each neighborhood\u0027s stories, paid tribute to their heroes, celebrated their victories, mourned their fallen. In my own way, through my own drawings and paintings, I found myself doing much of the same; I \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etold my own stories of a frightened and confused black queer kid, a survivor of sexual abuse, an adult discovering that the gender they spent a lifetime believing themselves to be simply didn\u0027t feel right anymore\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt life\u0027s darkest times, making art has, quite literally, kept me alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was during my graduate studies at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.goddard.edu\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoddard College\u003c/a\u003e (I graduated in 2015) that my art could be much more than drawings and paintings.
