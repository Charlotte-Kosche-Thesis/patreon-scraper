That\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a small, internationally accredited primary school near Playa Ocotal, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Our quarter acre ground offers space for gardening, exercise and play. We take our students on weekly trips to the beach and focus on creating an engaging learning environment both inside and out of the classroom.
