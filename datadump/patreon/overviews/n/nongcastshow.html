In 2017, we decided to start our\u00a0own podcast, talking absolute shite for free with no listeners. Today we\u0027ve got a few listeners and talk just as much bollocks as that first time we got together. We are dedicated to keeping our podcast free, and free of traditional advertising. The best way to do that is through listener support. Give our show a listen for free and if you like what you hear, consider becoming a patron. If you\u0027d rather not, that\u0027s fine too, just enjoy the free show! Your support can help keep us in cheese and beer. Enough support and we may even do some fucking work. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can listen to the Nongcast Show for free and see if it\u0027s your thing at the following link:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.spreaker.com/show/themongcast\"\u003ehttps://www.spreaker.com/show/themongcast\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr alternatively subscribe to us free on iTunes at:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/the-nongcast-show/id741292419?mt=2\"\u003e The Nongcast Show\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAnother way to support us other than financially is to rate and review us on iTunes.
