    "summary": "Hello, lovely children of the universe! My name is Stephen, and I make ASMR videos as a hobby to help people. I\u0027ll try to make this quick. As many of you know, I\u0027m currently in a rough situation financially (no sob-story, I promise), and before I discuss that, I want to say I\u0027ve been very fortunate in that so many of you have come to support my channel, and I first want you all to know that absolutely \u003cem\u003enone\u003c/em\u003e of you owe me \u003cem\u003eanything\u003c/em\u003e. You\u0027ve all been very supporting of me and just by virtue of being subscribed to me you\u0027ve already done me a huge service. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if you wish to support me further, as a few of you have made it clear that you do, I have chosen to give you the option through Patreon. I am not expecting\u00a0\u003cem\u003eanything from you\u003c/em\u003e, but I greatly appreciate every bit of support you give me. I want to make it \u003cem\u003every clear\u003c/em\u003e that I absolutely\u00a0\u003cem\u003ecannot\u003c/em\u003e say that every cent will go towards improving my videos. I want to make sure that before you choose to give me \u003cem\u003eanything\u003c/em\u003e at all, that you understand this : While purchasing equipment and props to improve the quality of my videos is my ultimate goal, I simply can not promise that I will be able to make that happen any time soon. Your funding will go directly to supporting me financially, though I promise that I will do everything I can to make it worthwhile to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to join me on this journey and you are willing to help fortify the foundation of my channel, then I cordially and humbly invite you to do so, and I want you to know that I appreciate every little bit of support more than you could possibly imagine, and I will do everything I can to make it up to you. Thank you so, so very much!"
