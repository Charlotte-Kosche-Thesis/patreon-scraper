    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eEver since I started riding a scooter in 2003, I\u0027ve had a yearning to make videos. At first, they were amateurish at best, with terrible video quality, shaky footage, bad audio, you get the idea. Well, it\u0027s 2017 now and...to be honest my videos are just as bad! :P That being said, since picking up the sport again in January, my Youtube channel has really started to gain some traction, to the point of making me want to do daily uploads, and seek ways to really improve the overall experience of my channel for my growing subscribers base! That\u0027s where Patreon comes in. With your donations, I\u0027ll be able to upgrade my equipment, making for higher quality video and audio production. I\u0027ll be able to travel and ride more, making for better tricks with great riders across the world. And I\u0027ll be able to do more giveaways and hookup videos, giving back to those in the sport that are less fortunate, and ultimately helping me achieve my goal of being able to make a difference in this amazing sport! For as little as $1 a month, you\u0027ll be able to help shape the Youtube channel with content suggestions and voting on video topics! Thank you all so much for your support!\u003c/div\u003e"
