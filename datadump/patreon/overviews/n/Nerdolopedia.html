    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eWelcome to Nerdolopedia!\u003c/h2\u003eWe are a group of nerds that host a nerdy community and produce nerdy content. Our goal is to supply a center for discovering nerdy content, whether that be our content or one of our partners and friends. It is our mission to create a comfortable environment for sharing this type of content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat we Produce\u003c/h3\u003eA lot. At least for how small we are. Here is a list of all of our existing content:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTales from the Tavern - Our tabletop gaming live stream. Join us as we drink and enjoy RPG\u2019s and board games. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNerdoloPlays - A gaming stream where we all sit on the couch and play games, sometimes coop, but it\u2019s always a fun time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eScribbleNerds - Like NerdoloPlays we all gather on the couch but for this we pull out the drawing software. We get 15 minutes to draw something from a prompt.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArticles - We have a few writers who talk about their favorite topics. Our two big ones are about tabletop games and horror content.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNerdoloPaints - sit down and enjoy a quiet stream of miniature painting\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFriday Gaming w/ Katie - Before Tales from the Tavern, Katie sits down and plays some more calm games, stuff like Stardew Valley and Slime Rancher.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat Patreon Covers\u003c/h3\u003eOverall it helps with operational costs. Because of the way we are setting up Patreon, by supporting this patreon you are supporting the group as a whole. This includes purchasing new equipment, covering the costs of giveaways, subscription fees, and various other operational costs. It also helps cover projects that are worked on by several members of the group. At this time this covers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTales from the Tavern\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eScribbleNerds\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNerdoloPlays\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting this patreon you also give us leeway to work on additional projects, covering start up costs and funding experimental content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat this Patreon Doesn\u2019t Cover\u003c/h3\u003eThis does not cover the content that is produced by a singular member of the group. Some of our members have specific talents that don\u2019t go towards any specific project. While their content may be used in some Nerdolopedia content, it is not exclusive to that project. This includes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMiniature Painting (by Jacob)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDigital Artwork (by Erica)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArticles (by Jacob and Michelle)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAudio Production (by Bailey)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor that content we will be creating separate patreons for each of our members that produce content. We will keep you up to date as those are released.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRewards!\u003c/h3\u003eFirst we are going to put your name on our website for as long as you are a patron. We believe that every patron deserves some recognition. You will also gain access to our Patreon only section. This section is not exclusive to just patrons of this account. If you follow any of our other Patreon accounts, you will gain access to this patreon-only section.\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
