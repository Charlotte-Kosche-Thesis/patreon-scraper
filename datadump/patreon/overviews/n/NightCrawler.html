Not knowing how it was supposed to be done, I just kind of winged it and figured out my own style of getting the job done. I recorded and released my videos on YouTube as a comedy documentary of how one man became Hiker Trash and loved it. Now I want to Thru Hike The PCT and film the experience to share with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhy should I pledge my money to you?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge as little as $1 you will enable me to Thru Hike The PCT and bring you six months worth of content. I have learned a lot on what I want to record and how I want to capture those moments. I have learned to be at ease in front of the camera and realize that this is only Season 1. Most good shows keep getting better until at least season 4 or 5 when Ill figure out some way to Jump the shark. So what Im saying is that this can only get better or stay the same, because it very well cant get much worse\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish become a patron, you just enter the amount you would like to pledge per month.  You can pledge as little as $1.00 or as much as you desire. You will be charged automatically at the time of your pledge and then on the first of the month thereafter. You can cancel at any time you wish, just as easily.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat do I get out of it?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be posting things here that I dont put on YouTube or Facebook, that only those who have pledged on this site will have access to. When I upload my videos in advance, I will allow access to them here first. Also, this being a smaller venue than YouTube, Ill see your members only comments and get back to you more regularly.If there is enough support for it I could possibly come up with a tier system with tier related rewards, maybe autographed pics of my junk for $100 a month or something like that, but we\u0027ll see where this leads.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
