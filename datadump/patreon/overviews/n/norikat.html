I started this patreon when I had high hopes and thought dishing out constant content would be manageable with some hard work but unfortunately it proved to be far too much to handle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t really offer much right now as rewards, which is why there\u0027s only one tier and it\u0027s there purely for those who wish to support me and my dreams out of the kindness of their hearts. Obviously I didn\u0027t expect anyone to stick around on here, but I am so incredibly thankful to those that do. You guys have kept me going in many rough times, sometimes just knowing that your support is there is enough, and other times I have truly been saved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite how 2017 has been going, however, I do want to work as hard as I can in 2018 to get back to a point where I can offer more on Patreon and actually have the money and time to make some awesome cosplays! Until then, thank you for those who stick by me! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfile picture and Header pictures by:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jasonmcneilphotography\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJason McNeil Photography\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nicolaistudio\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNA Studio\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Kaze.Photography\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eKaze Photography\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
