    "summary": "Hi there! My Name is Noah Eberwein. I\u0027m a theater student who loves to entertain. One of those ways is through music. I LOVE making music! Here at school, I\u0027ll act in a film major\u0027s film and then write the music for it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I Started\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always liked messing around with music. Apparently I was a very musically inclined child back in the good ol\u0027 days of not paying bills. Ah... that was the life... Anyways, I used to always mess around on the piano, sing, and I always liked the guitar despite not being able to play it. I would even turn my birthday presents into a drum set. (let\u0027s be real though, who hasn\u0027t done that in at least one point in their life?) When I was 13, my friend introduced me to video game making. I liked it a lot, but I wanted to be original about everything I did, so I started trying to compose my own music. Since then, my love of video game creation has faded quite a bit, but music became an ever growing part of my life. for the past 6 years, I\u0027ve been writing music and teaching myself how to better myself. I\u0027ve never taken music theory, or any other class that would teach me how to make music, but apparently I do good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/261967732\u0026amp;color=ff5500\u0026amp;auto_play=false\u0026amp;hide_related=false\u0026amp;show_comments=true\u0026amp;show_user=true\u0026amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are\u00a0you here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are. I\u0027m in college now writing music both for fun and for other student\u0027s projects. If I\u0027m doing all this, why do I need a Patreon? Well. I know what it\u0027s like to think something is cool and not have it or be able to get it, so I like to put my stuff out there for free. Having a Patreon is like having a tip jar where the person you\u0027re tipping gives you some extra desert \u0027cause you\u0027re so nice. You don\u0027t have to, but it really helps me. Who knows, maybe we\u0027ll have a good time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of stuff will make this worth my while?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood question.
