    "summary": "I am on a mission to create more joy in the world! I believe that by first experiencing more joy ourselves that we positively affect the people around us, and then they positively affect the people around them, and so on out into the world. As Mother Theresa said, \"Peace begins at home.\" First by doing what gives me the best, most giddy, high on life feeling (making art!), I nurture my Soul. Then, my family and friends enjoy this positivity, and even those whom I\u0027ve never met can benefit because of the wonders of the internet. You can experience more joy by having the product of this work in your space, using it for daily inspiration or even meditation. You can also learn to make my style of art in the same way so that you yourself have the serotonin boosting benefits and by learning some of my self-care methods. Let\u0027s make the world a better place by healing our hearts and recognizing our Souls as beloved channels of Divinity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt can be tough, being human. There is a lot to navigate. So, I\u0027m ever so grateful that the style I incorporate into my work honors the textures and \"imperfections\" (we are actually Truly perfect) that art and life give us. This allows me to relax and see more beauty in the world. The more art I make, the more I appreciate what is loose, juicy, and vibrant because that is what I like to see on my canvas. You can have this too, and create the same inspiration for yourself and humanity. Thank you for your support of this mission and for raising the vibe!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have seen my work in Somerset Studio Magazine, or elsewhere throughout the inter webs. You can also check out the galleries on my website: www.NarahKimberly.com"
