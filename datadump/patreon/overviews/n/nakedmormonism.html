     "about": "First off, I need to offer a little background on me as well as the podcast. I was born and raised in Northern Utah and was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (the LDS church) until around the age of 15. I was faithful to the LDS church, better known as a true believing mormon, or a \u0027TBM\u0027, but I slowly became apathetic toward it, like most teenage mormons do. I was also dissatisfied with various answers I would get to seemingly important questions about the doctrine, but I just figured every doubt could be explained away and I was going through a doubting phase much like all my friends, family and church leaders told me I was. \u003cbr\u003e   However, the doubt and apathy conspired to eventually corrode my will power for church attendance, so I just stopped going to church around 17, much to all my friends and families\u0027 dismay. Even though my attendance at church declined, I still attended Seminary class throughout my freshman-senior years in high school. Seminary is more or less mormon speak for bible study during school hours that the church sponsors. They fund a separate building off of school property, within walking distance of the school, and the class is called \"released time\" for legal purposes, of course.\u003cbr\u003e   After high school, I ended up graduating seminary, but, out of loathing the church, I virtually severed every tie I had in the community. I still spent time with my closest friends, but everybody else became very distanced from me. Fast forward 5 years, and I\u0027m living in another state with essentially a new life. I\u0027m now a moderately \u0027out\u0027 atheist and I want to examine the cult I was raised in.\u003cbr\u003e  Now, please don\u0027t think I\u0027m just using that word for shock factor, honestly, I try not to shy away from the word \u0027cult\u0027, as the root of the word refers to a \u0027culture\u0027. Now when I say culture, I mean that it\u0027s an entire way of life to structure the TBM\u0027s life around, much like any fundamental religious sect is. It wasn\u0027t just the church I went to on Sunday, it was also the meeting place for youth activities once or twice a week. It was the place that I saw my closest friends and classmates, and associated with them under reverence for the Lord. It was a place of where my youth soccer coach, was also my bishop (Pastor essentially). It\u0027s the building I devoted countless thoughts, feelings, and hours to, and of course, these thoughts and feelings that can\u0027t resist revival every time I drive past the ward building or see a member of my old ward. But most of all, the church provided the entire support structure, on which the person that is \u0027Bryce Blankenagel\u0027, was built. That\u0027s something I don\u0027t take lightly, and I\u0027m thankful for.\u003cbr\u003e   I can\u0027t deny that the structure was beneficial, and I agree that it takes a village to raise a child, which is heavily embedded into the church\u0027s doctrine. However, teaching a child, or any person for that matter, what to think, instead of teaching them how to think, is not something that should be considered a good thing for the child, or society in general. So that\u0027s what I\u0027m advocating against. Let\u0027s look at the evidence provided about the Mormon religion, and see what the people that were there in the early days had to say about it.\u003cbr\u003e",
