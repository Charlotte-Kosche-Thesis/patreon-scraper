    "summary": "The Nerdwriter is a weekly YouTube series that \u003cstrong\u003eputs ideas to work\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0in the form of 5 - 10 minute video essays.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/2ldy247.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi. My name is\u003cstrong\u003e Evan Puschak\u003c/strong\u003e. I grew up in Philly. I\u0027ve been making videos as The Nerdwriter since 2011. Early on,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7BOGuxrhNw\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy video on The K.I.N.D. Fund\u003c/a\u003e landed me a job at MSNBC, so I moved to New York City. Three years later, The Discovery Channel asked me to move to San Francisco and write/host a show on their digital network. Both gigs were good, but I didn\u0027t really enjoy them, mostly because I hate offices and pointless meetings (so many pointless meetings). So\u00a0after a few months at Discovery I left to pursue The Nerdwriter full time. Patrons on this site enabled that transition. They\u0027re the reason I\u0027ve been able to make this project into a career. I\u0027ve never worked more, but I\u0027ve also never been more fulfilled in my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/16953tj.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy show covers a variety of subjects: film, politics, music, painting, poetry, culture, sociological concepts and more. I\u0027d get bored sticking to one thing. I believe life is moral, psychological, artistic, scientific, and that what is worth knowing is worth entwining into a web, or a \u003cstrong\u003eworldview\u003c/strong\u003e. If I\u0027ve made a video about something, it\u0027s because I wanted to learn more about it. An organizing philosophy of the show is that \u003cstrong\u003ewe learn by saying\u003c/strong\u003e. I learn best by making videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/263as5u.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m aiming to make \u003cstrong\u003e2 videos a month\u003c/strong\u003e, so 24 videos for 2018. I\u0027ve reduced my output (from previous years) in order to focus more on each video. I think people appreciate the show because it\u0027s always getting better, and so I strive to top myself video by video. At a certain point I maxed out what I could do with one week. And since I\u0027m not really interested in hiring people to edit or write for me, the only variable I have is time. I\u0027m excited to see what I can create with more of it. As always, you only get charged for what I make (per video).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i68.tinypic.com/dgkx1e.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Nerdwriter is written, produced, filmed and edited by me alone, and my income from this channel comes in three ways. First and most importantly: \u003cstrong\u003ethrough Patreon pledges\u003c/strong\u003e. This is my most stable form of income. Second, via Google Adsense on my videos. This is typically a relatively small number per month (even for larger YouTubers). Third, I generate income from sponsorships. I negotiate these the same way every time: it has to be a product or service I sympathize with, and the brand in question can have \u003cem\u003eno editorial influence whatsoever\u003c/em\u003e on the content of the video\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Sponsorships usually appear on endscreens a few seconds after the video is completed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/6h6b00.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThe Nerdwriter would not be possible without your help. Like I said before, patrons enable my career. I feel an enormous responsibility to deliver great videos to them -- to you -- and I work tirelessly to do so. I want this project to be something special. I want it to be a show you look forward to every week. Since the start, I\u0027ve tried to improve, innovate and push the boundaries of the format. I\u0027m interested in what YouTube can be, and I want to make the kind of content that could only exist there. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for your help.\u003c/strong\u003e Really. Making this show has been the joy of my life. I won\u0027t stop trying to impress you with every new episode.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
