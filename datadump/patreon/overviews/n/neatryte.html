In that year we produced \u003cstrong\u003eover 400 shows and nearly 500 hours of free content\u003c/strong\u003e. We are hoping that maybe during that time we\u0027ve made some friends and entertained some supporters. With the number of shows we have and ideas for new content we would like to have some more and better equipment, we would like to be able to travel for special events to offer more coverage to our audiences, and we would like to make sure that the network is self-sufficient. For the time being we do not generate ad revenue, we hope to never have to. It would be incredibly awesome for you to donate \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eeven as little as $1 a month to help us create a bigger and better Neat Ryte Network\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. We appreciate your support so very much."
