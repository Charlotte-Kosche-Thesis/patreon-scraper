I\u0027m\u00a0Nicole Grotepas, an \u003cstrong\u003eindie sci-fi/speculative fiction writer\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m the author of several books, such as the dystopian, high-tech thriller\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Feed-Part-1-Nicole-Grotepas-ebook/dp/B007R0IQM0/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFeed\u003c/a\u003e (\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Feed-1-Fooko-Nicole-Grotepas-ebook/dp/B012U1WEIC/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Fooko Series\u003c/a\u003e) and the YA sci-fi, bio-based-android romance\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B0ADUW4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlue Hearts of Mars\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo. I normally sell my short stories on Amazon, like for example\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Cities-Sun-Nicole-Grotepas-ebook/dp/B004JN0W9S\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis fun little one\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s a favorite of mine. I have also been known to share them\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/enjoy-free-story-5420245\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efor free through Patreon\u003c/a\u003e, like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/freebie-story-6122927\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis one\u003c/a\u003e, but usually they look really awesome on your digital bookshelf, like the one\u00a0pictured below. Sweet cover, eh?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.nicolegrotepas.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/File_000-682x1024.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess you could say that I like to experiment with all the different short story venues available to authors. So,\u00a0If you haven\u0027t read my stuff, those links will take you to where you can try it out if you haven\u0027t already.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr . . . here\u0027s an idea . . . you could read my new stuff BEFORE anyone else does by becoming a Patron. How does that sound? Brilliant!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.nicolegrotepas.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WhyPatreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI did a Kickstarter once. Setting it up was a lot of work. A lot. It was a great learning experience, but that\u0027s all that it was. Because in the end, I overestimated my goal and came away with nothing for the time I invested in the project. I still wrote the book I was trying to fund and so ultimately, it had a decent resolution and I really appreciated the fans who turned up to support me. If you were one of them, thank you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, for the amount of work I put into the campaign, I found walking away from the investment empty-handed a bit unsatisfying. It taught me that successful Kickstarters are made or broken based on social networking. And luck. And both must happen within a very limited window. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, it\u0027s likely that a great Patreon experience is built the same way--a well-timed confluence of luck, skill, and fervor on social media. And yet, it seems to me the beauty of Patreon is that it never has to end. It\u0027s like the patron system of yore sans the Medici or the Queen, which, although those had their downside, they did support starving artists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHold on . . . am I starving artist? I kind of think so . . . yeah. I mean, I haven\u0027t \u003cem\u003eliterally\u003c/em\u003e starved . . . yet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoes not being able to afford a large iced mocha every day count as starving?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll kidding aside.\u00a0I spend a lot of my time creating stories alone at home or in a secluded corner of a coffee shop. The opportunity to meet and connect with fans or other writers is important to me. I\u0027m succeeding when I know people read my work and enjoy it. If you\u0027ve come to this page to consider offering support or encouragement, thank you so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help me afford things that will increase my visibility as an indie writer, such as allowing me to pay for a cover designer, hire an editor, or fund blog tours. Better visibility means a bigger network of people reading my stories. More people reading my stories means more demand for my stories. More demand means more writing, means me becoming a better writer, means me submitting stories to more publications. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs this called economics? I think so . . . yes. Kind of?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, the short story market is competitive and there are loads of crafty and skilled writers out there who weave intricate, life-changing stories. Sometimes that\u0027s me--the one producing a mind-blowing, life-changing story. With your support, I will be able to do that more. With your support, I\u0027ll be able to say, \"Thank you. This wouldn\u0027t have been possible without my patrons,\" as I stand there, with my Oscar, smiling into the bright lights and cameras. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, hang on a minute . . . that\u0027s for my other job. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActress. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo. All kidding aside. I hope to see a time when I can thank my supporters like that. Not just in the acknowledgements, but everywhere writers go--I mean like conventions. And book signings. And libraries. And book festivals, because, you know, writers live it up!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.nicolegrotepas.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WhatYouGetPatreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mean, besides my eternal gratitude? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell. If you become a supporter, I\u0027ll turn into a short-story writing machine just for you! Some of the work will be submitted to journals, but you will see it first as one of my Patrons. Doesn\u0027t that sound awesome? Doesn\u0027t that sound enticing?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut\u00a0I offer \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(yes, more!) than just digital copies of my short stories as rewards. Other levels include such awesome, swanky things as me using your name as a character in my book, actual postcards written by me mailed straight to your door, you Photoshopped into \u003cstrong\u003ea picture of the two of us eating at my favorite brew-pub\u003c/strong\u003e, exclusive Spotify playlists, vlogs, and other swag as my thanks. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the various levels of patronage I offer to see what fits for you. And remember, everyone who supports me gets \u003cstrong\u003ea digital copy\u003c/strong\u003e (with digital cover!) of every story supported by this Patreon (no less than 6 per year, no more than 10) and \u003cstrong\u003etheir name included in the acknowledgements\u003c/strong\u003e. There are various levels of support, and because I am paid PER story, \u003cstrong\u003eyou only donate for each story\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re here and you love to show your support with something more tangible than distant transactions through far-removed digital markets, please accept this invitation \u003cstrong\u003eto become my Patron\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd . . . thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNicole\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

They usually involve concepts of surveillance and how it effects human behavior, colonization, AI, robots, and a bunch of other impossible but cool scenarios. She studied folklore in college and believes that the best parts of any story touch on these living, changing elements of culture. For example, food and drink. Expect to be hungry or thirsty after reading one of her books.",
