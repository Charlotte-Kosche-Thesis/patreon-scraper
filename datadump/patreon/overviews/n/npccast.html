The main difference is that a Patreon page is tailor made for creatives\nthat do a bunch of small things, while Kickstarter is better suited for\nsomebody doing a single, larger-scale project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other big differences are that Patreon pledges are recurring, and they are only paid AFTER content is delivered.\u003cstrong\u003e Think of it like a future \u201ctip\u201d for us releasing stuff you like.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127,127,127);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(127,127,127);\"\u003eSo basically, I have\nto pay for NPC Cast now?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo.\u003c/strong\u003e Ugh, never. Gross.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the reasons we feel that Kickstarter doesn\u2019t work as\nwell for podcasts is that it sometimes feels like the content is being held\nhostage. \u003cstrong\u003eWe love making NPC Cast. We are going to keep making NPC Cast.

Many of our patrons messaged us letting us know that they simply wanted to support the show and didn\u0027t have an issue, but we decided to put the page on hiatus and come back with a more manageable campaign. Because of this, we streamlined the rewards and decided to rid ourselves of physical items and complex give-away stuff.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ePeople want to support us, and we greatly appreciate that fact.

On this go round, we felt that it\u0027s much easier to understand a \"per episode\" model. You know exactly what you\u0027re paying for. \u003cstrong\u003eWe put out ONE episode of NPC Cast each week, and you will only be charged for that.\u003c/strong\u003e TPK episodes, or any other bonus content we throw out there will not count.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(127,127,127);\"\u003eFine fine fine.

However, even $1 an episode is greatly appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond that, we are offering some neat individual rewards for those who are able to pledge more, which you can read more about below. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo the left, we\u0027ll be adding Milestone Goals as we receive more donations. These goals affect everyone because if they are reached we\u0027ll be able to do some pretty ambitious things and everybody gets to benefit, regardless of pledges! (Except the people that hate us. There is no tangible benefit to those people.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn closing:\u003cstrong\u003e Pledge if you want, tell a friend if you can, and as always - support your local game store.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf there is anything else you would like to know, feel free\nto email us at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:thenpccast@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethenpccast@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e or just ask via Twitter:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/npccast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@npccast\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest Regards,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nChris\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNPC CAST\u003cbr\u003e"
