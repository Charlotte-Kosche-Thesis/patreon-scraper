When I began to have my own understanding of situations that were happening in my life and how to transform those situations so that I no longer felt bad about them, but instead found lessons in the situations in order to help me in my life, I knew that I wanted to share those experiences with the world.\u00a0There is no better teacher than learning from others mistakes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI was asked once what my special brand of magic was. As I stared in the mirror at myself and asked that same question, the answer became evident. My special brand of magic is being a mirror of unconditional love and support for those that seek my help and services. It\u2019s special because not many people these days can love a stranger. Not many people these days can listen to a stranger\u2019s story and not be triggered to judge that person. Or think nasty and reactive thoughts about that person.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eNo. Not every person even in the coaching and healing communities can come from a place of love after battling their own dark hours of people rejecting them even when all they have done is be themselves. Not every person sees that they can\u2019t help others if they aren\u2019t working on their own shit.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBut I can, and I do. That\u2019s what makes me special. That\u2019s my special brand of magic. To love and serve and help people from a place of true genuine caring to see that they can have the life they wanted. The can create happiness in any and all areas of their lives. They can be empowered to step out fully to be who they want. That\u2019s what I offer. A mirror to self-love. I am the embodiment of unconditional love. I return love to those who forgot what it felt like to be loved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to help support me but a monthly membership isn\u0027t your thing, hey, I get it, funds are tight, or you want to buy stuff. There are many other options that you have. You can share my posts on your pages, or make one time donations as you please. You can buy a piece of my jewelry for yourself or a gift for someone you know.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so appreciative\u00a0for all your support in any way you provide it. Thank you\u003cbr\u003eNadia\u003cbr\u003e"
