    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your interest in my Patreon program!\u003c/strong\u003e I have wanted little more from life than to be a dedicated artist. Unfortunately, it is difficult to succeed in the arts industry outside of commercial jobs and even more difficult to get ahead. My income is modest and I hope Patreon will help pad that out so I can better contribute to my household while attempting to enrich the lives of those around me with my visual art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy long-running comic Ninja Monkey sprouted from the name of the studio that I picked one night a generous patron offered to buy me websapce. I had been an artist by commission some time before then, creating character portraits for fellow role-players and visitors to my online gallery for years. To this day, that is my greatest joy! It is so fulfilling to help character creators realize their vision! However, I had an itch to make something I could truly call my own. The comic is a stab at that and I have learned a lot in these past two years working on it! I hope it will lead to new series and more characters!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, this is where I need your help. Donating even a dollar a month helps so I can dedicate my time to art. I can focus on the comic and take more time with commissions from clients. The money helps feed and clothe my children and to a lesser extent, my corgi. He doesn\u0027t go through clothes nearly as quickly as my human kids :p I am grateful for the assistance and to show my appreciation, I hope to offer patron at higher tiers perks for their contribution to my life. If you have any requests or suggestions, I\u0027m glad to hear them, but in the meantime, thank you for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind more of my art at:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ninja-monkey.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.ninja-monkey.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://the-z.deviantart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://the-z.deviantart.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://ninjamonkeystudios.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://ninjamonkeystudios.tumblr.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
