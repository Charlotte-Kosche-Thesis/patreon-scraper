    "summary": "The initial goal of my presence here is to manage somehow to survive, and get the big brain surgery done. After that, who knows? Maybe I will keep on creating cute music with VOCALOID, maybe I will push further my sound and get some mixing/mastering done, maybe more Fan Made Vocaloid Concerts to be participated in their creation... But for now, the main goal remains. Thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges are per month and not per video/content created. This is because where I produce more content, you won\u2019t get an unexpected amount billed. I think is safer this way, and also, the numbers won\u0027t look so scary anymore either!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf it is possible to achieve the second goal, that\u0027s where the \u0027normal life\u0027 begins, I will be able to save for the brain surgery which will remove part of the tumors and replace the damaged skull bones! But for that to happen, I need also more work to do, so please hit me up with mixing/mastering tasks! (especially if you like the sound I make!)
