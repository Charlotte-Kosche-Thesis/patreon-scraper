    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page! (NightHawkInLight)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by! My name is Ben. On my YouTube channel, NightHawkInLight, I create lots of videos about inventions, science experiments, and tutorials for a large variety of projects. I\u0027ve been creating and filming these things since 2006 and have had the amazing privilege of seeing my projects bring happiness to millions of people. In the last few years you (my viewers) have allowed me to earn enough through these videos to pay for some really cool equipment that has improved the way I am able to film projects and improved the quality overall. I would love to continue improving, especially by way of being able to make videos more often and to afford more ambitious projects. This involves the purchase of some new equipment, and especially I would like to hire an assistant camera operator and editor. This is why I\u0027ve come to you through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to these things, Patreon may soon be essential to continue producing videos into the future as I have in the past. As YouTube advertising drops lower and lower in value it has become difficult to even cover the few hundred dollars in supplies that my projects usually require. With enough Patreon support the continuation of my channel will be assured, whether or not I can find sponsors to help cover costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou will never be charged without getting a new video in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have this page set up to work on pledges on a per-video basis. Patreon has a second option to allow pledges monthly, but I chose per video because that means my patrons will never give to my channel without getting a new video as an instant reward. In addition, when you pledge to my channel you will have an option to limit your total number of monthly contributions so you will never contribute more than you intend to if I post a bunch of videos in a row. Just to give you an idea of how many videos to expect, I usually post 2-3 per month. You can limit your contribution to a maximum of only 1 video per month, or to any number up to unlimited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you can\u0027t become a patron yourself, thank you very much for checking out this page! I appreciate all the support you have given me through your views and comments. It\u0027s a highlight of my day to read your feedback.\u003cbr\u003e"
