I understand it isn\u0027t easy to \"advertise\" for me because I don\u0027t stick to one topic or make people feel outraged. Liking/Sharing posts helps too, because \"sponsoring\" posts for exposure doesn\u0027t make sense unless I write something with mass appeal (outrage). STOMP is what gets the likes/shares, so unless everyone makes an effort to promote Things Which Aren\u0027t STOMP, all we\u0027ll have left is STOMP.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt may feel like you\u0027re sharing too often, because if people liked it they would follow on their own, but people don\u0027t do that. We rarely follow content to the source, and instead trust the original sharer to share again if there\u0027s more good stuff. I\u0027ve seen the same names Like many of my posts from their friend\u0027s feeds but they\u0027ve never sought out my page. As \"the rich get richer\", the famous get more famous; which means, seeing as I\u0027m neither, I appreciate all the help I get.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re not getting my posts in your Facebook feed: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eLike \u0026gt; See First \u003c/em\u003eandor \u003cem\u003eNotifications\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0This won\u0027t even guarantee it\u0027d appear in your feed (Facebook really wants people to pay). If you check my page a few times and like a lot of posts, it\u0027d turn up more often.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I of course appreciate everyone who has all of my books, what really helps is lending them to people and getting new readers. Writers, like places to eat, only get customers from fame or recommendations. I don\u0027t have fame, the recommendations is up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eReviews on GoodReads would also be really nice (say something I can put on a cover).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI came in the reader door and now I wish to join your cult. \u003c/strong\u003eHuat ah!
