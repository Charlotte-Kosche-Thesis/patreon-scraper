Thanks for stopping by. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m all out of tea, but would you be interested in a cup of random awesomeness instead? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou see, I\u2019m a huge fan of all things retro gaming, from the Atari 2600 to the PlayStation 2 (and yes, I consider the PS2 retro). As such, I write a whole host of articles about it, ranging from reviews of games to long-form analysis of the gaming industry\u0027s history. I also create a Weekly Retro gaming series on YouTube, where I play 30 minutes of classic games, whilst discussing their style, gameplay and more! Here\u0027s an example:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zpTN6blOoc0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut anyway, I haven\u0027t really answered the question, have I? This, right here, in my Patreon page; a place where you can support \u0026amp; validate the content I create. You can also help that content improve and grow too!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.16bitdad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/about-2.png\"\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYep, that\u2019s the next big part of this, isn\u2019t it? So, in short, it helps me run my blog and generate the content that you want to see. In other words, it\u2019ll help cover the expense of running the website as well as purchasing the various items I will be reviewing. But that\u0027s all pretty boring, really, isn\u0027t it? Where\u0027s the good stuff? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWell, you\u0027ll get to take control over my Weekly Retro series, choosing what games I feature each week. On top of that, you can also get early access to my videos (24 hours before everyone else), the chance to take control over my monthly History of Gaming articles, and even the ability to get some cool merchandise as well!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDoesn\u0027t that just sound so awesome?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.16bitdad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/about-3.png\"\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eYou know, I might actually call them that from now on. Anyway... With your help I can expand and improve my videos on YouTube. This will be done by getting better equipment (like capture cards), as well as bigger and more exciting games! Your support will mean I can do the following;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eExpand my videos to include PS2, GameCube, PS3 and various other controls that are hard to emulate.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIncrease the number of games I am able to feature.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdd guests to some of my videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImprove the sound quality of the videos, so they are easier for you to watch.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty cool, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.16bitdad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/about-4.png\"\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eWith your support, I\u0027ll be able to launch and run a podcast covering retro gaming, anime and all sorts of other geeky stuff. I\u0027ll also be able to include a variety of guests on that podcast, making it fun and exciting to listen to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.16bitdad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/about-5.png\"\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSo, does that help you?
