My name is Nicholas and I\u0027m an artist and animator from the San Francisco Bay Area. I\u0027ve been posting my art online since 2007, graduated community college with an AA degree in digital art \u0026amp; animation in 2014, and now I\u0027m aiming to graduate with a BA in entertainment design by this spring!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work part time at Starbucks and do freelance when I can; juggling two jobs has always been difficult, especially between needing to put in hours at school. But I\u0027ve always loved being able to create fan content for you guys, and it\u0027s been such a fun time that I\u0027m happy to take on a little extra stress if it means doing not only what I love, but that you guys seem to love as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon would be a way for 1.) you guys to support me even if you can\u0027t afford things like commissions and the like, 2.) me to earn a little extra income so that I can make for cool stuff for y\u0027all!! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to be able to expand into doing for elaborate rewards and such, but for now what you\u0027ll mostly get to see here are WIPs, progress videos for animatics, and maybe some free sketches each month!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethanks so much for stopping by \u0026lt;3"
