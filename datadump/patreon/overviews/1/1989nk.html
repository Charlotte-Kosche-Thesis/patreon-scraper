He\u0027s pretty content living a frugal life in his single room apartment, except for his anime hobby which he tends to spend a lot on. He is a compulsive maladaptive daydreamer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHiroki is a gay trans guy, but is still searching for what really defines him as that.

He tends to try to mask this by being a little bit of a goofball and a people pleaser. He works very hard at his job at a computer software company, and has the favor of his Boss, Jirou. This combined with his poor health tends to have his coworkers side eyeing him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHide is gay. He\u2019s the submissive type.

He got married out of family and social obligations, and often finds himself seriously lamenting never having been with a man.

I also want to give reassurance that stories about them can be happy, romantic and about finding love JUST as much as they can be about the tribulations and struggles of being queer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOf course, the story is meant to be a positive, feel good story BY a trans individual, specifically aimed at an LGBTQ+ audience in general.
