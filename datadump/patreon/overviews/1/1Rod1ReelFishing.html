    "summary": "I was introduced to bluegill fishing when I was 8 years old, and became obsessed with bass fishing at age 11 after I saw a fisherman catch the biggest bass I\u0027d ever seen in my life from my local pond. When I started bass fishing, I had no clue what I was doing, and no one to teach me, but I loved the sport regardless. Ever since I was a kid, I\u0027d spend every weekend or everyday (during the summer) riding my bike to any lake/pond/river within a 5 mile radius of my house. I enjoyed every minute I spent in the great outdoors, even though I\u0027d go hours or sometimes even days without catching a single fish. In an effort to improve my fishing prowess,  I spent countless hours reading fishing articles and watching youtube videos trying to learn as much as I could about bass fishing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"1Rod1ReelFishing\" was created August 14th, 2012. The reason why I started making fishing videos is simply because I thought, \"if a picture is worth 1,000 words, how much would a video be?\" Since I was young, I would always take pictures of the fish I caught so that I could remember that moment forever. If you flashed any picture of me holding a fish, even if it was taken over 10 years ago, I could tell you what bait I caught the fish on, how warm it was that day, what time of the year it was, and where I was at. A lot of my friends/family say I have a selective memory, and I\u0027d have to agree with them. Case in point, I only know the birthdays of two people off the top of my head, mine and my girlfriend\u0027s, but if you asked me to name the 50 color patterns available for a strike king red eye shad, I could recite them in less than a minute no problem :P \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, I started filming my fishing sessions for two reasons. The first was so that I could relive the moments when I caught really cool fish, like my 42 inch muskie or personal best bass. The second was to record data of my fishing sessions so that I could use that information in the future to help me be a more successful angler. That\u0027s the main reason why I include so much information in the video description such as the date, time fished, air temp, water temp, ect., so that I can repeat successful patterns year after year and build upon them using the new knowledge I gain every season. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis may disappoint some of you, but I initially started uploading videos on youtube for myself and my friends to see, I didn\u0027t expect them to get views from anyone else :P However, this changed during the spring of 2015, when the video of my Centennial Lake tournament where I got second place went somewhat viral. My channel started getting a lot more attention, and before I knew it, I grew from 3,000 subs to 10,000 in the span of a month! During this time, I started getting a lot more comments on my videos. Questions flooded in about how to catch certain species, what types of lures to use, what places to fish, ect. I also got comments from people saying how much they enjoyed watching my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is when my channel started to change. I still fished just like I always would with a gopro strapped to my head/chest, but now I started talking to the camera explaining what I was doing, and teaching viewers about certain techniques or locating fish utilizing the thousands of hours I\u0027ve spent fishing/learning about fishing online. The views and subscribers continued to grow, and for the first time ever, I received a check from youtube. I couldn\u0027t believe it, I actually received money for fishing. My first check was almost nothing, but it felt amazing to get paid doing what I loved most in life, fishing!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMonth after month I kept getting checks from youtube, and the amounts slowly grew. At first I thought, this is awesome, I can use this money to help pay for school. I was scheduled to start Optometry School during the fall of 2015, I had always planned to follow in my dad\u0027s footsteps and become an eye doctor. But as the end of summer approached, I shocked my parents with what I told them. I said that I was going to postpone going to school, and I was going to pursue a career as a professional youtuber so that I could continue to fish on a regular basis and do what I loved. They were appalled by my impulsive decision since I worked so hard during college to get into optometry school. Even though my brain knew that being an optometrist was the safer career decision, my heart wanted something else. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt first it was really scary withdrawing my application to school and making videos full-time. I had worries about money, if I could make enough to pay for all my living expenses, if I would make enough to support a family I hope to have sometime in the future. But after a short period I knew without a single shred of doubt, I had made the best decision of my life. I was doing what I loved everyday, whether it was fishing or promoting the sport of fishing. I honestly spend about as much time answering questions/comments as I do actually fishing, because while I\u0027m obsessed with catching fish, I truly enjoy helping other learn how to fish too! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring an average week, I\u0027ll fish 3-4 days (I wish I had time to fish everyday :P), spend 15-20 hours \u00a0answering comments on youtube, snapchat, instagram, facebook, twitter, ect., and spend about 12-15 hours a week editing videos. I cherish every single second of it. I\u0027m truly blessed to be able to do something I love for a living. If I can, I plan to continue making fishing videos for everyone to learn from and enjoy for the rest of my life! I can\u0027t thank each and everyone of you enough for your support and helping to make this possible, I truly mean it :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTight lines and fish on! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMichael Hsiao - 1Rod1ReelFishing\u003cbr\u003e"
