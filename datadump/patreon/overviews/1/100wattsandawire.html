Everyone is welcome.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eIt\u0027s about getting back to our roots and those things that brought us to amateur radio in the first place.

The show reflects my life and journey while the community represents the diversity of our collective interests. Although everyone is different, there is a synergy. The common thread we share, is radio.
