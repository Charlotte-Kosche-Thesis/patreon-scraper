    "summary": "Hi there! I\u0027m Peter Millard from 10minute workshop, where 10 minutes in the workshop is never enough, it\u0027s never 10 minutes, and it\u0027s never 10 minutes wasted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a carpenter and cabinetmaker from London in the UK and I have a small but growing YouTube channel where my weekly, down-to-earth how-to guides, quick tips and occasional tool comparisons help inform, entertain, educate and have inspired more than a few new woodworkers to have a crack at some of their own projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, over the nine months that my channel\u0027s been live, it\u0027s grown considerably, but a bit like having kids, as they grow they become more demanding of both time and money, and I\u0027ve set up this Patreon page to help fund the ongoing cost of putting out these regular free videos on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWhen you sign up as a patron, you\u0027ll be asked to select how much you want to pledge per month, and this money goes directly into funding the associated costs of my YouTube channel - for example, all the tools I review I buy from a regular store, with my own money - just as you would, and I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t have to tell you just how much that all starts to add up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge is entirely voluntary, on a monthly basis, and wether you see my videos as entertainment, as practical advice on techniques, or as money-saving tips and jigs, have a think about what they\u0027ve been worth to you, what value you\u0027ve gained from them. Would that be the price of a cup of coffee a month, perhaps? Well, that\u0027d be very welcome - milk, no sugar, thanks!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eHere at Patreon I\u0027ll also be posting exclusive content just for you, my Patreon supporters, with the emphasis on longer-form, multi-part videos that are popular, but time-consuming to produce, as well as behind the scenes clips from the regular video shoots. Project plans will also be freely available here for each of these builds, so you\u0027ll have absolutely no excuse for you not to get stuck in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, nothing has given me greater pleasure over the last 9 months than when a subscriber messaged me to say they\u2019d left school with no woodworking skills, but thanks to my channel they\u2019ve just made a dozen replacement kitchen cabinet doors using the loose tenon technique I described in my very first video.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWith your help and support I look forward to making many more videos to come, so that together we can reach as many people as possible who want to make things, but don\u0027t know how.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll look forward to seeing you next time. Take care. Peter\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
