I\u0027m putting in another 10-15 a week researching, writing, recording, EDITING, and PROMOTING the show, and I could easily double that to keep improving. The long-term goal of 15 Minutes in terms of funding \"success\" would/will be for us to gain sponsors and/or be picked up by a larger entity, perhaps one of the podcast networks that are growing like wildflowers (well, that or to remain utterly creatively independent and supporting our production/promotion/development costs and a staff of 2 completely through people like YOU!).\u003cbr\u003eThe short term goal, though, for as long as even the first few years of this, will be to allow Ed (15 minutes engineer, not working, like me, as a volunteer) and me a bit more time to do more and better of the tasks you see above, to continue to grow and improve and make 15 Minutes a consistent weekly endeavor (the goal for year one is to get out 40 episodes, and we\u2019re on pace to make it) that we can be proud of and you can enjoy.\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the show, think it\u2019s a worthy endeavor, and want it to continue, please pledge, as much as you can/want, or as little as a buck an episode. (you can always opt out later).\u003cbr\u003eAs we proceed, perhaps there will be t-shirts, coffee mugs, other more inventive 15-Minutes-branded materials to reward you with, but for now, supporting the show will have to be its own reward. ***Actually, as of this posting, there will be a reward, a beautiful 15 Minutes sticker donated by our friends at I Made This Vinyl (find them on Etsy).\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m brand new to Patreon. In the past few years, though, I\u0027ve dug deep to give something, even if it\u0027s just five bucks, to numerous albums, books, art projects through GoFundMe and Kickstarter and IndieGogo, and it has always felt great when the artists I supported reached that goal, printed that book, made that album, what have you. By supporting 15 Minutes, you can have that feeling nearly every week! I kid, but I also kind of mean it - I\u2019d love to have you on the team, and I think you\u2019ll like knowing you\u2019re part of every episode.\u003cbr\u003eLast, your pledge per episode, even if it\u0027s the tiniest amount, will let us know that you\u0027re out there, that you\u0027re listening and enjoying, and that is worth a ton in and of itself. With that in mind, and our future financial development, PLEASE pledge and also subscribe/rate/review us on iTunes or wherever you listen to podcasts.\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, thanks for listening, and thanks for pledging!\u003cbr\u003e-Jamie Berger\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

It is not a celebrity-chat endeavor, but more of a fun, but also incisive, maybe even therapeutic, exploration of fame and what it means to us, how it helps and hinders, how it affects how we define success, . . . . . In our first four months - 15 episodes! - we\u0027ve had on everyone from the relatively famous - Eugene Mirman, John Hodgman, Annie Duke - to the utterly anonymous - the point isn\u0027t (just) to hear from acclaimed folks, it\u0027s to address fame itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI call 15 minutes a podcast about fame, but really, it\u0027s about fame and success and dreams and artmaking and teaching and mentoring and collaboration and our public versus private selves and the control we try to have over them and so much more, and about whatever other digressions happen in conversations with, yes, the relatively famous people I\u0027ve mentioned so far, but also with decidedly unfamous people of all sorts, from high-school students to octogenarians, from those who dream of fame, to those who do their best to ignore its very existence. The show can be insightful, fun, silly, whatever, depending on where the conversation happens to go. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://15minutesjamieberger.com/\"\u003ehttp://15minutesjamieberger.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a recent article in our local paper, The Greenfield Recorder, in which I go a bit more deeply into it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.recorder.com/15-Minutes-4996757\"\u003ehttp://www.recorder.com/15-Minutes-4996757\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*** \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy give me money:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, I work 50+ hours every week at, you know, jobs. I\u0027m putting in another 10-15 a week researching, writing, recording, EDITING, and PROMOTING the show, and I could easily double that to keep improving. The long-term goal of 15 Minutes in terms of funding \"success\" would/will be for us to gain sponsors and/or be picked up by a larger entity, perhaps one of the podcast networks that are growing like wildflowers (well, that or to remain utterly creatively independent and supporting our production/promotion/development costs and a staff of 2 completely through people like YOU!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe short term goal, though, for as long as even the first few years of this, will be to allow Ed (15 minutes engineer, not working, like me, as a volunteer) and me a bit more time to do more and better of the tasks you see above, to continue to grow and improve and make 15 Minutes a consistent weekly endeavor (the goal for year one is to get out 40 episodes, and we\u2019re on pace to make it) that we can be proud of and you can enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the show, think it\u2019s a worthy endeavor, and want it to continue, please pledge, as much as you can/want, or as little as a buck an episode. (you can always opt out later). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we proceed, perhaps there will be t-shirts, coffee mugs, other more inventive 15-Minutes-branded materials to reward you with, but for now, supporting the show will have to be its own reward. ***Actually, as of this posting, there will be a reward, a beautiful 15 Minutes sticker donated by our friends at I Made This Vinyl (find them on Etsy).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m brand new to Patreon. In the past few years, though, I\u0027ve dug deep to give something, even if it\u0027s just five bucks, to numerous albums, books, art projects through GoFundMe and Kickstarter and IndieGogo, and it has always felt great when the artists I supported reached that goal, printed that book, made that album, what have you. By supporting 15 Minutes, you can have that feeling nearly every week! I kid, but I also kind of mean it - I\u2019d love to have you on the team, and I think you\u2019ll like knowing you\u2019re part of every episode. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast, your pledge per episode, even if it\u0027s the tiniest amount, will let us know that you\u0027re out there, that you\u0027re listening and enjoying, and that is worth a ton in and of itself. With that in mind, and our future financial development, PLEASE pledge and also subscribe/rate/review us on iTunes or wherever you listen to podcasts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, thanks for listening, and thanks for pledging!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Jamie Berger",

Paint them a picture of what you can work towards together.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s all true. The short and sweet of it is that there is no specific initial goal. I (Jamie) have costs for equipment, various internet-related costs, and promotion that I\u0027d love to recoup, but beyond that, as I said in the video, the money you pledge will help me devote more of my time to continuing to make the show, and make it better and better. And promote it, and eventually, promote and support other podcasts as well. And, who knows, maybe even make t-shirts and coffee mugs and hoodies for you all someday! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t really put a dollar amount on it all, but since Patreon made me, there\u0027s one, because 9 is my lucky number. Whatever I (and Ed, and Anja) make by making from this show we love will be a blessing. If you can help with that, or even help move us toward making it a profession, that would be amazing.
