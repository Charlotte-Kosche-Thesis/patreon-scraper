    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS THE 1001FESSES PROJECT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince November 2014, we have been collecting the beauty of the female form in an attempt to address a widespread obsession: hating our backsides. We are trying to create a visual poem by taking pictures of all kind of women\u2026and bums ! We already have about 275 pictures taken. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have more than \u003cstrong\u003e4000 women volunteers \u003c/strong\u003earound the world (and still counting) waiting to be photographed and be part of this real beauty mosaic. \u003cstrong\u003eThe problem is\u003c/strong\u003e: it\u0027s so hard to be an artist in this world, especially with a project that brings so much censorship on social medias like Facebook and Instagram who are always shutting down our \u00a0communities. We wish to visit you all, beautiful women of South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and America, wether you are tall, chubby, wise of age or fit like an olympian! In order to do that, we would need to have more time...and who says time says funds so that we wouldn\u0027t have to work so much in our side jobs that are not always promoting our real ideas and values. \u003cstrong\u003eWe wish\u003c/strong\u003e to fund these trips across the world in order to encounter the stories, bodies and lives of those courageous models from abroad. \u003cstrong\u003eWe need an active community to move forward and complete our goal of 1001 bum pictures of any shape, origin, age and color!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to take part in this body diversity project in order to help women feel better about themselves and free their bodies from the strict standards we are used to, you can become not only a partner but a very important body-positivity-promoter as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO\u0027S BEHIND ALL THOSE BEHINDS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are two female artists based in Montreal named Emili Mercier and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Marseille. We have been best friends since we were 12 years old and growing up together was quite an adventure. We have seen our bodies change from childhood to adulthood and this intimacy in our friendship made us think: why not collect pictures of all kinds of bums ? Maybe we would discover how crazy it is to hate our own bodies and simply see how unique each and every woman is. And, this way, start loving ourselves a little bit better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW DO WE PROCEED, WHAT KIND OF ART WE DO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese pictures are always taken in daylight with a Mamya 645 120mm film camera and we never show faces or identify images, always with natural light. By photographing anonymous bodies, we try to picture the beauty in every shape, the beauty in female identity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANKS!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOKAY! Really, you (and your beautiful bum) are so inspiring to participate in any way in this bum-revolution. Being a patreon has been a very important part of the art industry for many centuries and in our contemporary world, internet and strong communities like 1001fesses project\u0027s one can make a tiny idea like \"loving your bum\" travel worldwide and create not only nice images, but change the way some people feel about themselves and others. YOU ARE NOT ONLY HELPING THE PROJECT, YOU ARE THE PROJECT!\u003cbr\u003e"
