    "summary": "Welcome, fans of the creepy, disturbing, and unexplained! First off, both of us here at the 13 O\u0027Clock Podcast would like to thank all our awesome and supportive listeners, who have made our show grow much bigger than we ever imagined it would.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTom and I started 13 O\u0027Clock in mid-2016 as sort of a lark, partly as a vehicle to promote my writing, but also simply to amuse ourselves by discussing and cracking wise about various topics of interest to us, such as weird paranormal stuff, true crime, cults, conspiracies, historical mysteries, and horror movies.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe love doing this show, and with the help of our fans, we can make the channel the very best it can be. With your support, we can make 13 O\u0027Clock a full-time concern, purchase better recording equipment and software, make more merchandise, and focus more time and energy on researching and producing the weekly podcast, as well as producing our sideline movie review series, 13 O\u0027Clock Movie Retrospectives.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd don\u0027t worry, your offerings will not go unrewarded. Your support will give you recognition in the credits of each episode, and access to periodic Patreon-only content. Greater support will get you more free stuff, like the occasional gift of t-shirts, signed books, show swag, and any other promo materials we have lying around.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo thank you once again to all you crazy kids out there who have been tuning in to our weekly weirdness. We hope to keep making more shows for you guys well into the next year and beyond!"
