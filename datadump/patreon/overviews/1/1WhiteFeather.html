    "summary": "Hey Everyone, Whatsup Patreon!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am here on a mission! I have to tell you that this has been the challenge of a lifetime but I finally let go of my fears and took the leap! I am here because I want to make films and TV for a living; and I want to make them ethically beautiful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have this epic dream to own and run a revolutionary motion picture production company. I would make deliciously thrilling Independent American media that has all the spirit and freedom of HBO with the deep conscious effort toward self evolution that OWN has. It would be ethically conscious of women and minority groups. It would make anime, and narrative feature length film, and all things Thriller, Adventure, and Drama. That\u0027s the dream and on August 12, 2016 I took the leap and registered 1WhiteFeather.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was scary and I still fear not making it, but I can\u0027t turn back now! Besides, how do you take on anything huge? One step at a time; no?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo ... I\u0027ve been working a full-time job to fund and progress the company. But I have to say, between school bills and living expenses I haven\u0027t gotten as far as I\u0027d hoped. Their are fundamental things businesses need, and while I am creative, the are points and places where creativity is honestly a stretch. One such place is having savvy people\u00a0 on your team. A lawyer and accountant definitely fit into the \u0027savvy people\u0027 category. In this industry going without a lawyer or accountant is like purposely losing money on your investment. Not only does it make the company seem amateur, but it put the company in a position fail. That would just kill me; we\u0027re to young to die! Your patronage gets me savvy people and paid school bills. Yey school bills!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage also helps me get a start on producing 1WhiteFeather\u0027s very first, original, screenplay. I\u0027ll be able to pay a Producer to help me select actors and get all of the odds and ends together for the shoot. Without one, I\u0027m on my own :( ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn any case I just want to say thank you for any support you can muster. This dream and the film are very important to me, they\u0027re my everything. So, having you apart of it is more than an honor, it\u0027s a prayer come true. \u003cstrong\u003eThank You\u003c/strong\u003e for all of your support.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
