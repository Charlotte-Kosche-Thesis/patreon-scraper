If you have not been to our YouTube channel, you can visit it\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/18summers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to welcome you here and give you some information on what we are doing and why we want your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS 18 SUMMERS?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e18 Summers is the amount of time we get with our children. Typically by 18 they are fairly\u00a0independent and moving\u00a0forward in life. As parents our role diminishes more and more as time goes on. While that is happening, we spend more and more time at work\u00a0planning for some future point in time where we be able to enjoy retirement.\u00a0In my opinion this is a flawed model.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what can you do different? Capitalize on the time you have now and use it to build into your children. This is exactly what we are doing. We wanted to do something before we missed all of our time with our children. Find within your family the opportunity to change your balance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO ARE WE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe are the Khalafs. We are a family of 8 (6 at home) embarking on a four year journey around the country. Our goal as a family is united in spending more time together and building into our futures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore specifically the six of us on this journey are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHal, with over 17 years in restaurants \u0026amp; kitchen management, Hal has been the breadwinner for our family and is a dedicated father. As the owner of a printing company and a partner in a few other companies Hal\u00a0brings a business sense to the family. Hal enjoys cooking, graphic design, video editing, and being outdoors in cooler weather.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRandie is an awesome mom with a heart for helping. Her role is not glamorous as she is often cleaning up after young kids, wiping bottoms, doing dishes, or folding laundry. One thing is for sure though, we could NOT survive without her. Randie\u0027s biggest love outside of family is her horse. She enjoys riding wherever she can. Quite frankly she enjoys everything to do with horses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlima, ahh the teenager of the group. If it has to do with horses or dragons, she is interested. Taking up lessons in photography, she is looking to expand on her abilities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHalim our oldest son. Cars, legos, cars, skateboarding, cars, hiking, and did we mention cars? Halim can name almost any car on the road including the rare exotics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSteven, named after our two best friends Steven and Paul, is an imaginative child with a love for anything fun. Though, he does have a strong affinity for legos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCalvin the mischievous. This one is a handful. Often found with his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, you can usually find him somewhere he isn\u0027t supposed to be.\u00a0Calvin has been known to be standing over a mess and when spotted, point to Hobbes and proclaim \"He did it!\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT ARE WE DOING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are embarking on a four\u00a0year journey around the United\u00a0States to see this beautiful country. From national parks to historical sites, from west coast to east coast, we want to experience the amazing diversity of this nation and meet the people that make it what it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT WILL BE ON OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst and foremost, our focus is our trip sharing our days on the road and what it is like to travel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, story telling. We want to share the story of the people we meet. From the Good Samaritan, to the non profit volunteer, to the small business leader, we want to know what makes them tick.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThirdly, tips, tricks and our knowledge. We want to incorporate what we know into an experience for our supporters. Be it in cooking, design, travel, video, or just general knowledge that we have derived from experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe cannot do this without you and are truly grateful for your support.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
