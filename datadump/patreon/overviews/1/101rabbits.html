I created my YouTube channel in September 2010 after I got my first two rabbits Mocha and Lulu. Like most young, first time rabbit owners, I made all the bad mistakes. I gave my rabbits the wrong care, diet, housing, etc. After doing a lot of in-depth research about owning rabbits, I soon discovered all the mistakes I had made. After completely changing the way I cared for my bunnies, I decided to start my YouTube channel to help educate and raise awareness for proper house rabbit care. My goal and passion from the beginning has been to help inspire other rabbit owners to house their rabbits indoors and give them the best care possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is essentially a place where people can financially support content they love on a monthly basis. You do so by pledging a certain amount each month to help support me and my YouTube channel so I can continue to grow and better my videos. This will help me in the future by helping me afford new equipment and supplies. How does this benefit you as a viewer? First, it will better the quality and production of my videos. It will help me make even better and more interesting content for you all to watch.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver all, I want to give a huge thank you to YOU! No matter if you decide to become apart of the 101Rabbits patreon family or not. Without you, one of my faithful viewers, I would not be where I am today and my YouTube channel would not be where it is today! For that I thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
