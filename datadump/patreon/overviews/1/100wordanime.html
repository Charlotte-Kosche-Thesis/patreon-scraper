Occasionally I throw in a movie or game review but mostly I am focussed on how stories are being created in anime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank those who have already pledged their support and I am continuing to work toward providing quality content for you. All current patrons are able to request a free PDF copy of the ebook that contains all of my reviews from 2017. All new patrons during 2018 are also able to request this and I will email it to you as a thanks for your support of the blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, I am open to feedback and suggestions about how I can make this a more rewarding experience for my patrons. Please contact me if you wish to ask any questions or have any concerns.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMy goals on patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want to work toward making my blog my full time job and ultimately increasing the quality and quantity of the content as well as the range of content available.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn the short term I am working toward increasing the amount of audio content with a monthly podcast exclusively for patrons and eventually some video content. Actually, forget eventually, I want to make video content. I just need the time to do it, so as soon as I\u0027m able to earn an income I\u0027ll be cutting back work hours to put time into this. Those who know me, know I\u0027m a pretty hard worker, so all it takes is the time to do it right.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAt reaching $100 a month I hope to remove WordAds from my site which means that patron only posts (episode reviews that have been voted on by patrons and patron audio posts) will be advertising free as I do not link to anything in patron posts.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe sure to visit 100wordanime.blog\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
