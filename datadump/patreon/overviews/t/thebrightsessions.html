I\u0027ve loved radio for a long time and after becoming obsessed with podcasts like Welcome to Night Vale, I just had to sit down and write my own audio drama. Amazingly, I was able to get some incredibly talented actors and record a 9 episode first season. The first episode premiered on November 1st, 2015. Those first episodes were so much fun that we just kept going. Since then, we\u0027ve been featured on iTunes, inspired fan art, and been downloaded over six million times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy make a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am constantly striving to bring our audience better, longer content - this requires better sound equipment, more actors, a sound producer, etc. Now that we have these things, I want to make sure that everyone gets paid fairly for their incredible work. As I\u0027m not being paid to make the podcast, this is something that I dedicate all my free time to. The more money we get for the podcast, the more time I can spend on it, which means more stories for you all to listen to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is making this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is the brainchild of me, Lauren Shippen. I write and direct all the episodes and - up to episode 17 - did all the sound producing. Thankfully, we now have sound producer extraordinaire, Mischa Stanton, doing all our sound effects. And of course,\u00a0there are the phenomenal actors that provide their voices, their encouragement, and some incredibly useful character and plot inspirations. They are (in order of appearance): Julia Morizawa, Briggon Snow, Anna Lore, Charlie Ian, Alex Gallner, Ian McQuown, Andrew Nowak, Reyn Beeler, Alex Marshall-Brown, Phillip Jordan, and Alanna Fox.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo take a listen to the podcast, check out our rewards, and consider becoming a Patron! We could not make this show without the support of our patrons and we are unbelievably grateful to all of you for being part of our strange family!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
