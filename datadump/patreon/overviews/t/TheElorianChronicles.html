    "summary": "Hello Everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to view my work. I have a knack for storytelling, but I\u0027ve never really tried making anything on this scale. I\u0027m a little nervous, but I\u0027m hoping to find a supportive community that can help me improve my craft. I have been kicking around this world in my head for the past year now, and it\u0027s something that has come to fill me with a great deal of passion. My goal is to write full-time, in order to create a series that both entertains its audience and acts as an outlet for all the ideas in my head. I would greatly appreciate any support in accomplishing that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not really used to talking about myself, but here goes nothing. I made a lot of life changes over the past year because I was really unhappy. I wouldn\u0027t know where to start going into the details, so I won\u0027t, but now that everything has settled down I have decided to go in a direction that is more true to myself. The most meaningful accomplishment I could ever have for myself would be to have a significant and long-lasting positive impact on another person\u0027s life. I\u0027ve tried to achieve this in a couple of ways, but none of them ever really felt \u0027right\u0027 to me. Then, I remembered my youth spent with my nose in a book, and the meaning some of those stories brought into my life.\u00a0 That\u0027s what I want to accomplish. I want someone to read my\u00a0writing and have my words broaden their perspective, even a little. I just want to pay that forward, and I hope that you will make the effort to join me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAs for the Elorian Chronicles:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSo, I have been dreading this section for a while. I don\u0027t want to overwhelm you with a block of text or give away any big secrets. The Elorian Chronicles are a collection of series that chronicle the events in Elora. The intended collection is pretty big. I would have started my Patreon sooner, but I wanted to be sure I had a plot that could sustain the number of books I intend. The collection is broken down into (as of now) 4 ages: The Age of Wonders, The Age of Magic, The Dark Ages, and The Age of Revival. For everyone\u0027s sake, I\u0027m just going to stick to the Age of Wonders for now, but the plot line has been flushed out well into the Age of Magic.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe Age of Wonders contains 3 trilogies, two duologies, an anthology, and a stand-alone short story. The Age of Wonders follows the Shipwrights, a family of\u00a0four who has been misplaced and separated\u00a0by war and misfortune. Struggling to rediscover normalcy in a strange and dangerous land, this small family becomes entangled\u00a0with Fate and shapes history in the lands of Elora. There is a chronological order, and then the order the stories will be written. The stand-alone short story will be the first I write and it is titled Wind Break. Afterward, I\u0027ll start in with the first trilogy The Lyndermen\u0027s Bargain which centers around the Shipwright\u0027s eldest child, Merilee Shipwright, and her search for identity, purpose, and community in a world in turmoil.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePosting:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan on posting at least 1000 words every Friday from now until June 15, which is when I start my job as a camp counselor this summer. After June 15th posts may become erratic until August when I can rededicate my time to this project. Additionally, I\u0027ll post audio recordings of the story every Monday for the same timeline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoals:\u003cbr\u003eI have three goals. The first is to start building a fanbase. So any suggestions or help in doing so would be great. Secondly, I want audio editing software so I can edit the stories. Until then I\u0027m going to do my best with what I can find online. Third, I\u0027m hoping to go premium on Grammerly. I\u0027m using the free version for now, which is cool, but they have some extra features I think could really help my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
