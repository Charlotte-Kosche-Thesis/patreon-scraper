I am a professional model based out of the prickly, warm Sonoran Desert in Arizona. The Sonoran Desert is the only home of the saguaro cactus, which takes 100 years to grow a single limb...imagine how old the biggest could really be! I love to shoot in interesting locations. I love to hike to locations, to shoot in crazy, interesting, and beautiful places. I love weathering the elements for the art, in fact I prefer it. I tend to put my everything into modeling and if I\u0027m not sore by the end of a shoot, I don\u0027t feel I\u0027ve accomplished my potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m highly experienced and knowledgeable, not just on posing, but also claiming my light as the subject of a photo, thanks to working behind the camera as a photographer and videographer.\u00a0I am employed with three Art Schools in the Valley as a fine art model for life drawing and painting classes and workshops. Thanks to my flexibility and range of motion and poses, I have been very successful with my life modeling. I photograph conventions and events around Arizona as well as models.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am obsessed with fitness. I work out 4-6 days per week. In 2014 I broke up with a lifestyle that left me jaded, overweight, and extremely unhealthy after an adulthood of cigarettes, binge drinking, and pharmaceuticals prescribed for depression...I guess you could say I really had no coping skills...so I had to change, inside and out. I couldn\u0027t stay that same defeatist girl who was okay with giving up on my health and ambition and dreams. Through this process I\u0027ve started transforming into the woman that I\u0027ve always wanted to be. I\u0027ve felt empowered, and through this I really do document my own progression. I\u0027m really glad you\u0027re here to join me in this journey. The support really has kept me with my head held high, even during the rough times!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I have been an artist as long as I can remember!\u00a0My whole life I was told that I couldn\u0027t have art as a job, let alone a full-time career, that I couldn\u0027t have a place in the fashion industry, that I wasn\u0027t pretty enough or tall enough to be a model. I have been drawing since I could pick up a pencil. I have always had an artist\u0027s depth perception, I\u0027ve always had artistic inclination. In high school I was a ceramicist, and I was actively involved in the art clubs...and especially the fashion club. I designed three dresses in my senior year which hit the runway at Scottsdale Fashion Week. In fact, one of my models who walked the runway in one of my designs was later a model in America\u0027s Next Top Model.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m working on my own modeling career and looking to expand into fashion design with my sewing skills that I was able to acquire in high school. I am also working on my skills as an acrylic painter. My great grandmother was, too, a fiery redhead until the day she died, and painted her entire life. I spent summers with my grandma and great grandma in New Mexico and my great grandmother would teach me how to paint (as well as play card games!). I\u0027d like to channel her abilities and hone in my skills just as much as she had in her life. I\u0027m also very passionate about traveling. I told myself my whole life that I would travel and learn as much as I could along the way. I had always hoped that i could combine my artistic vision with my insatiable wanderlust and my career. I had a vision recently of painting women doing yoga in various locations around the world. I\u0027d like to hire models as travel companions and begin a painting and photographic adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate and love support from all of my fans, friends, followers, and fellow artists, through likes/comments/follows on all of my social media platforms. Perhaps you found your way here through one of those platforms... Patreon is definitely made tailored to the people who really love following my journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging, you help me continue to create art and build my fashion label, as well as create an extensive cosplay wardrobe, featured in photo sets for you. You will have inspirational input in my shoots - have a request? Ask away! Have a recommendation? Hell yeah! Let\u0027s do this! I\u0027m always interested to hear what you\u0027d like to see me cosplay/model next!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as the above-mentioned, you get access to my snapchat and behind the scenes content, from shoots, events, workshops, etc. and access to various private dropboxes filled with Sensual, Nude, and Lewd photo and video content. As a top pledge, you will also be given tokens for my website www.pixelginger.com where you can spend those tokens in my live broadcasts! Sometimes I stream from my home, sometimes I shower live, sometimes I live stream my photo shoots as both a model and photographer! I live a very unique and interesting life and I\u0027m super happy to share!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd for my MEGA fans...you\u0027ll get an hour per month one-on-one in a live hangout sesh where we watch our favorite movies, wear our favorite cosplay costumes together, hula hoop, eat wine and cheese, listen to 90\u0027s music, or whatever you wanna get into. I\u0027m pretty damn good at Sudoku if you wanna play that...just saying...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s get weird up in here. I appreciate you making my life art, pure art. Thank you for letting me show you my light.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to give a special thank you to those who I have worked with and the incredible people who have given me the confidence to chase my dreams. I\u0027d be lost without the people who have come into my life and shot with me, mentored me, taught me, and those who were and still are my biggest supporters and cheerleaders. Thank you for allowing me to recognize my own desires in life. I couldn\u0027t have done it without you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know all about my modeling work, but I\u0027d like to discuss my visions for my LIFE work. I have felt, since I was a young child, that people are maybe not correct in their ideologies on how we should live. I feel that people live so inefficiently, that we are working against the intent of nature at an alarmingly unsustainable fashion. I have always understood that we are nature and nature is us. So, to detail my future plans, I\u0027d like to retire on a farm out of country, where I can live in a sustainable environment (solar, farming, raising chickens, etc), build homes for my family and chosen family, live off the land, growing my own food and putting only good things into my body. I want to open a donation-only center in the US for rehabilitation of the body and mind, curing people with naturalistic medicine and creating positive habits that will sustain them long-term. It is possible to cure many physical and mental illnesses without modern medicine profiting from a broken system that doesn\u0027t work. I am also interested in opening a non-profit environmental organization which hires teens and young adults (students) for a few extra hours of work per week, cleaning the trash from our oceans, and the debris from our streets, and which visits elementary schools to teach our future about the harm of pollution. That is what I live for, that is the path I was meant to take as my life work. So, once again, thank you so much to all of those who have helped me, booked shoots with me, and all who have supported me in my endeavors to a brighter, cleaner, more honest future.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eVisit my website here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.pixelginger.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePixel Ginger\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/tanirogue\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tanirogue\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t forget\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tanirogue.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you feel like spoiling me...\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://t.co/twwpAmQLLc\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon Wishlist\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"

When I reach this goal, I will also be able to hire a seamstress to complete the creation of new products!! You are also helping me pay models for quality content that I can deliver to you. I really want to be a different kind of creative in all the markets that I am currently involved in! Thank you for making this possible!!!",

     "description": "I have a few new goals that I am pushing myself towards right now. One of my most important short-term goals is to be enrolled in school (hopefully by August 2018) to obtain my yoga teaching certification. It is really important to me to continue my yoga learning under instructors, but also to be able to share my knowledge. I am going to begin teaching free yoga classes and live streaming those classes to a wide audience. I find fitness to be incredibly important and by having knowledge as well as live streaming capabilities, I will be able to offer that knowledge for free to anyone willing to learn!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy other pressing goal is to upgrade my equipment. I want to purchase a Surface Pro and a Sony A7RIII to deliver even better quality content to you.\u003cbr\u003eMy current camera is 24 MP, The A7RIII is 42.4 MP; The A7RIII comes with weather sealing; 8000 shutter speed; it even comes with nighttime shooting capabilities, as it has a far superior ISO ability. I also would like to purchase the Surface Book for better editing and live streaming capabilities. Thank you so much for your support!!!",

     "description": "One of my overlying and most important goals is to open a studio location to hire models for my content creation endeavors. I operate several sites and would like a home-type location that I can shoot models from regularly. I\u0027ll still continue to rent hotels and AirBnB\u0027s for personal shoots, but my goal is to be able to extend industry and money making opportunities to local and traveling models. If I can support a community that has helped me grow, then I feel I have done my part in making the community a better and safer place for models.",
