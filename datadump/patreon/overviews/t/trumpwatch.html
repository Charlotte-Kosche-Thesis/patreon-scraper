    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003e\"The most valuable thing I read every day...\"\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOn January 20, 2017, Donald J. Trump was sworn in as President of the United States. Hours later, the first TrumpWatch bulletin went live.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTrumpWatch is a fact-based, left-of-center daily(ish) report on the Trump Administration. Our goal is to provide you with one brief, accurate rundown of each day\u0027s hijinx. The Trump White House makes it a point to generate as many outrageous headlines as possible, and we condense them into a critical daily summary. It\u0027s our way of getting you the most important information as it breaks\u2014and keeping an eye on the most dangerous developments.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere is no charge to read the TrumpWatch, and we do not make **any** money publishing it. However, we are grateful to those readers who support us here on Patreon. 100% of proceeds from TrumpWatch will go to pro-democracy or pro-refugee organizations.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTrumpWatch was created by Dr. Ari Kohen, a professor of political science who has written on philosophy, heroism, and human rights. Ari has recently been joined by author Andre S\u00f3lo, who helps manage the site, and a small group of concerned citizens. We are all unpaid volunteers.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll of us on the team enjoy sharing TrumpWatch because it has become our most valuable go-to resource for quick, accurate news. If you feel the same way, we hope you\u0027ll become a patron. THANK YOU to everyone who supports this effort!"
