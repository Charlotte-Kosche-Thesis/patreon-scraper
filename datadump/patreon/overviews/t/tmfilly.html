    "summary": "Yo, I\u0027m a nerdy Hispanic adult from New Orleans, Louisiana with a passion for video making. Around the time I turned 18, I realized that if I wanted to continue my video-making escapades, I\u0027d need to turn it into a career. So that\u0027s what I\u0027m doing. With this. This Patreon. In case that wasn\u0027t obvious. So let\u0027s take a trip on memory lane for a brief spin and discover how your mother Filly is going to use his past to keep on keepin\u0027 on with video making.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround late 2011, I first starting making dumb parody videos with very sporadic release dates. Fast forward five years and I released my first anime abridged parody of The World God Only Knows. Now, I find myself at the helm of creation of parodies, comic dubs, and various other forms of creative video media. Through this Patreon, I seek to be able to continue my passion and be able to turn it into a proper career. Most of the work I create is animated or something along those lines though I\u0027ve also dabbled in live action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that those who\u0027ve enjoyed my videos keep on watching for future releases. Thank you all!"
