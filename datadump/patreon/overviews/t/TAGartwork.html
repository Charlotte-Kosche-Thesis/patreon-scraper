I work extensively for DC/Vertigo on such titles as: HELLBLAZER, VERMILLION, HOUSE OF MYSTERY, CMYK, THE DREAMING \u0026amp; THE UNWRITTEN. I have also drawn Doctor Who comics for IDW.  I also work with other fine purveyors of graphic goodness such as Renegade Arts \u0026amp; Active Images, as well as several creator owned titles.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m probably best known for my graphic memoir THE SPIRAL CAGE, which explored my experiences growing up with Spina-Bifida, a condition I was born with and wasn\u0027t expected to survive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been trying to complete the 2nd volume: MUSCLE MEMORY, for over 10 years, but the pressure of having to take on commercial work to pay the rent, and health problems, meant that I had to put it on hold. Discovering PATREON, via a tweet by Neil Gaiman, has inspired me to have another go.\u003cbr\u003eMUSCLE MEMORY: A survivors tale, is even more of a challenge than the first volume, as it not only continues to look at disability issues, but also addresses my experiences of physical child abuse at the hands of my Father. I want to make it clear that this is not a story of victimization, but a story of survival and of winning against the odds. Their will inevitably be distressing scenes throughout the series, but it is also an optimistic and often funny look at my life, because that\u0027s how I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though this is a pay by page/picture campaign, fear not! you can \u0027cap\u0027 your monthly total, just in case I go crazy and start producing 10 pages a week. I hope you that you decide to support me in what is effectively a life-times work. thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI intend to try and upload 3-4 pages a month, the completed volume 2 will be in the region of 400 pages when finished.
