    "summary": "We are the Holton Homestead. Tyler \u0026amp; Sara. We strive for local, transparent, pure, organic choices. \u003cbr\u003eWe offer poultry (chickens, ducks, geese, turkey, and quail.) We sell eggs \u0026amp; meat, and process for other local poultry farmers. We have flower gardens, a large market garden, and an orchard we manage. We are beekeepers, selling honey, wax, and products made with both. We also offer a Adopt-A-hive program for others who want to support bees, but cant keep them. We offer many classes and do a kids gardening camp in the summer. Classes include topics like essential oil uses, diy cleaning products with essential oils, cast iron cookware, gardening, and more. We are currently at two local farmers markets, Altoona Iowa \u0026amp; Ankeny Iowa. We are looking at joining another local market, or two for 2018. We have a personal goal of doing the Downtown Des Moines Farmer\u0027s Market by 2019. (For those of you not from the area, this is a very large farmers market- with a vendor waiting list.) During the summer months we also run a farm stand at the end of our driveway, for those who can\u0027t make it to the farmer\u0027s markets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAnother service we offer is an egg delivery route. We currently serve just over 30 families in Ankeny. We deliver eggs on a weekly basis, and offer our other products and produce delivered too. This is a very special service that has a waiting list. Only recently we were able to expand and get delivery help from Tyler\u0027s little sister, Reanna.\u003cbr\u003eTyler and I (Sara- I\u0027m the marketer) do all of this on our own (with the exception of Reanna\u0027s delivery help). This year is going to be a little scary for us, as this is the first year that I plan to not have another job. My income will be dependent on the homestead.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e**Side note: The first year, Tyler and I both had a full time job. Last year, I held a part time job working 30 or more hours a week. Currently, I have a very part time job,10- 20 hours a week. I plan to quit in March, to focus all of my energy on the homestead.**\u003cbr\u003eWe are a very hard working and dedicated couple. We love what we do and love sharing it. We have lots of goals for our future. The biggest one currently, and probably pretty far away, is for Tyler to be able to quit his job too, and actually do something full time that makes his soul happy, and feel meaningful.\u003cbr\u003eLooking back, I would have never guessed we would have came this far. We are so excited for what this year holds for us. Thank you for reading and your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
