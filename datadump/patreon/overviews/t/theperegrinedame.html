    "summary": "When I began traveling solo, well before The Peregrine Dame\u00a9 was a public television series -- or even a thought, I would come home to the States and people would ask me a lot of fear-based questions. Was international solo travel safe? Was I ever in danger? Did anything bad happen to me? Wasn\u0027t it scary to be out there all by myself? I knew then that it was part of my responsibility as a global citizen to show people back home that not only is it not scary, the experiences we have while traveling alone can help us shape the future of our communities for the better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Rachel Parsons and I am executive producer and host of The Peregrine Dame, now airing on Amazon and public television stations nationwide. The first season began airing in 2014 and was met with enthusiasm in the public TV realm. It\u0027s\u00a0the first series of its kind and I explore international travel as a lone female: no crew and no\u00a0traveling companions. I meet people around the globe who act as my local guides, friends, and sometimes camera-holders. The series so far has covered destinations and adventures from South Africa to South America to Southeast Asia, and I look forward to bringing you more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you here are familiar with the way public media is funded: through seasonal corporate underwriting and those familiar funding drives that happen several times a year which interrupt your regularly scheduled programming with pleas to donate money. I\u0027ve begun this Patreon campaign to help avoid having to badger the audience that way. With additional funds, the second season, which is in editing now, will get to your local public television station, Amazon, and Youtube quicker.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been touched and empowered by your support, and can\u0027t wait to bring the next season to you to show you that traveling solo doesn\u2019t have to\u00a0be so scary, and\u00a0traveling alone\u00a0doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re lonely.\u2122\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn gratitude,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRachel Parsons\u003cbr\u003e"
