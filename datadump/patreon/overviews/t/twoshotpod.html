    "summary": "For the price of a pint...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHiyer. Y\u0027alright? Thanks a lot for listening to and supporting the Two Shot Podcast. And thanks a lot for looking us up here on Patreon. Seeing as you\u0027re already on this page you probably already know what we do, but just in case you don\u0027t, let us explain... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe (host Craig and producer Griff) travel up and down the country recording these podcasts. We talk to the actresses and actors who we think have a interesting story to share. We visit them in their homes, on set, and in hotel rooms and agency offices - wherever we can grab an hour or so of their time (so long as it has brew-making facilities). We have a chat about the how, why, where and when of their journey into the industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve sat down with some of the finest in the business and have heard some incredibly moving, absorbing and insightful tales of misspent childhoods, drama-school dropouts, lucky breaks and flunked auditions. Now we need your support in getting these stories to you, our listeners.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Two Shot Podcast is currently self-funded. We love making our podcasts but train tickets, petrol, microphones,\u00a0computers, audio interfaces and recording software all cost money. We want to keep making these podcasts and with your help we will.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve enjoyed listening to the Two Shot Podcast, please help us out with a donation and let us keep bringing these unique stories to the people that get so much from hearing them. All we\u0027re asking is the price of a pint at your local each month to help keep our petrol gauge out of the red and producer Griff\u0027s microphone cables free from crackles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, we wouldn\u0027t expect something for nothing, so in return we can offer you, our Pateon backers, a little something extra every episode. You\u0027ll get exclusive video footage, unseen pictures and bonus audio content depending on which level you decide to back at. We know not everyone can afford to donate, so don\u0027t worry, our podcasts will always be free to listen to, but if you could help out, that\u0027d be ace.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNice one.
