    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eWe are a family of four, Karen, Shaun, Esme and Quinn. Before having children, we were always die hard backpackers, that loved adventurous, off the beaten track, destinations. Our first baby was a little surprise and arrived around a time we had planned to do an extensive trip. Initially we thought we would have to cancel and I was quite disheartened by that. Social norms suggest you can\u0027t take little ones on such extravagant trips.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more I thought about it, the more I wondered why? Why not take her with us? My number one passion is adventure and discovering the world so I wanted to impart that with my kids. Of course the way we travel has changed significantly. To me, its so heartwarming that my kids don\u0027t need toys to be entertained. They are mesmerised by the different sights, smells and sounds of new places. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a nurse by background, and I am currently on maternity leave. I used both of my maternity leave years off work to travel. This way all of us can be together, we are not paying an extortionate mortgage and my husband also gets that time to bond with our new baby.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe quality time together, enjoying new environments, is second to none. Back in February 2016, our story of using our first year of parent hood differently, hit the worldwide media. I never imagined so many people would be interested in the hows and the whens of the trip.\u00a0 We have since picked up thousands of followers, that engage with us daily, on social media by watching our Instagram stories, commenting on our photos and reading our content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe feel so privileged that we can inspire other travel loving parents, their travel days do not have to be over. Instead its all about incorporating little ones into their way of life. We write compelling content, develop interesting videos and produce beautiful images to illustrate where, how, when, and why of travelling with a baby as well toddler. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe put hours and hours of work into product reviews, destination guides and top tips for travelling with kids. We would love to do this on a full time basis. However, despite having over 170,000 social media followers between us, we are only making a small annual income from our website and social media platforms. Its not enough to sustain the amount of hours we put in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know people love reading our work so we want to continue to the best of our ability. This is why we are reaching out to our audience to become our patron. If you decide to become a patron, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. It makes us very happy that you enjoy our content so much that you have decided to hop on board.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
