Many of you will recognize me from tumblr or AO3, if not welcome! But since you are all here, reading this lovely description that I\u0027m coming up with on the fly, you will obviously put the pieces together and realize that yes, I have made a Patreon! Yay, go me! Haha. This has been something I\u0027ve been seriously thinking about for a little while now, and eventually my friends just sorta kicked me over here. I\u0027m excited to see who this goes and share with all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/309716256393658378/363854881804517388/why-patreon.jpg\" width=\"100%\"\u003e Anyway, commissions didn\u0027t really work out, and I feel that this was because I\u0027m infrequent on tumblr because of school and work. For example, I used to be filling my queue nightly, and now I have let it run dry and I post when I can. It\u0027s not ideal for me, but there\u0027s not much I can do since school and work take up the time I used to have for making sure my blog was constantly posting content. I\u0027m hoping that this will be an easier way for my followers to support me and encourage me to keep writing. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/309716256393658378/363854406091014154/what-im-all-about.jpg\" width=\"100%\"\u003e Right now, I am trying to get my way through college and earn my degree, and while that isn\u0027t stressful enough, I spend most of the free time I have outside of work, studying, and homework, writing for fandoms. I started writing\u00a0when I was in middle school but never posted anything till my sophomore year of college (2015, holy crap that was awhile ago). Since then, I have moved my way through a couple of fandoms, and currently, I\u0027ve found my home in the Voltron fandom. I\u0027ve made a lot of really great friends and had some amazing ideas for this fandom, and I hope to keep going for as long as I can. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI also have some original works that I\u0027ve been meaning to work on and revamp from my days in high school. I have an original dragon riders idea as well as a fluffy witch universe idea that I\u0027ve been working on with friends. Hopefully, with this pushing me to write more, I\u0027ll be able to work on those ideas as well. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWell, enough about me really and welcome and thank you so much for supporting me and I\u00a0hope you will continue to enjoy the content I make!"
