That\u0027s who I am day in and day out. I first started writing at eleven years old, and I found it to be so much fun that I\u0027ve never stopped. I\u0027ve been working as a writer since 2008, both in creative fiction and in freelance writing. I have a degree in English and I\u0027m not letting it go to waste.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with my writing, I also have a passion for photography, listening to music on vinyl and anything vintage -- which I try to work in to many of my stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Things I Create\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything that has to do with the written word, I\u0027ve probably tried at least once. I don\u0027t like to be confined to a specific style of genre, so my work includes poetry, short stories,novels and creative nonfiction on a wide range of topics. I have published a book of haiku (Unfolding Life), a novel (Seeing What Develops), and two novellas for Kindle Worlds based on Barbara Freethy\u0027s Callaways novels--with a third and final installment coming in January.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I love to work on fiction, I spend most of my working day writing freelance articles and blog posts for my clients.I also run a blog, Truths of a Shy Writer. This is the place where I talk about writing, live writing and sometimes provide a few words of wisdom about writing. I hope that I\u0027ve made at least a small impact on my audience in giving them a front row seat to what it\u0027s really like to be a full-time writer in both the world of freelancing and in the world of fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Chose Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is a difficult world to live in, even if you are a bestselling author. The truth is, even the most successful authors make much of their income outside of royalties--they teach classes, give speeches and do a variety of other activities to pay the bills. That often leaves little time for writing what their audience wants. With the support of readers on Patreon, I hope to be able to speed up that process of getting my best work out there while providing a sneak peek into my writing process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get Out of the Deal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon isn\u0027t a one-way street.
