The Holy Broken Art Experience is about deeply and permanently\u00a0healing life, healing trauma and chronic illness of soul, body and mind. I would not function with health today without dedicating my every moment to healing creativity.\u00a0It is my instinctual desire to spread this healing wisdom. This is about The Art of Allowing for healing the wounded soul and broken body in search for unconditonal Love. It is about healing our muse, the shattered creative soul, the chronically ill art form and the unfolding of the Self into the beauty of life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Holy Broken Art experience is about awakening to authenticity, embracing courage and surrendering into the peeling off of the armour we wear, the barriers and limitations that keeps us small, revealing who we really are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe served by the words of Truth from miracles that had come forth through creativity birthed from trauma and pain, over and over again. Be served by the what it\u0027s really like to step into unconditional presence, the raw-ness of being a wounded human and the light that comes through the shadows of our ego.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI invite you to co-create The Holy Broken Art Experience with me and spread what is truly real and splash some colour into this world. May I answer your burning questions (openly or anonymously) that you have regarding the healing of your heart, soul, creativity, relationships, body, mind and life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo your courage and love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTracey Nguyen\u003cbr\u003e"
