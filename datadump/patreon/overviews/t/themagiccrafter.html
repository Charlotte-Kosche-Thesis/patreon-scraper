I see you there! :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve noticed that you\u0027re very interested in fairytale creatures and are already bringing oodles and oodles of magical goodness into this world. You\u0027re a special kind of individual who has a certain sparkle in their heart. I appreciate that about you! And that\u0027s why I want to ask you to be a special part of The Magic Crafter community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the deal.\u003cbr\u003eI want to help bring more magic, creativity, and positive thinking into this world, but to do that... I could use your help! It takes a lot of time, money, and creative energy to make all of those crafting videos, mermaid videos, fairy videos and the like. As it turns out, being a fairytale creature is anything but cheap! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I do my best to fund all of my videos and their components on my own (I saved up for two Summers to buy my tail!), it would take a lot of stress off of me if you were willing to offer financial support to help me create the best possible content for this channel and to support the development of my business. Any contribution-- big or small would be greatly appreciated, and would be put towards buying equipment, crafts, educational courses, and products for growing and strengthening my channel and my mermaiding business. I would love your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Gift to you! \u2665\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, you may be wondering how this is mutually beneficial to us both? Let me explain how it works! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery so often I will make or do something special just for you and my special group of Magic Crafters who support me here on my Patreon account. If you choose to donate, you will gain access to different types of exclusive rewards such as videos, artwork, short stories and more that only contributors to my Patreon get to see. Patrons at all levels will get access to all rewards, but the more you contribute, the more you help! You\u0027ll also get to hear about big happenings and things going on with my channel before anyone else! Ssshhhh!!! It\u0027s a secret!! ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Quick Version\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, this is a way that you can lend me a helping hand if you like what I do and would like to be a part of helping me, my channel, and my business grow and improve. Whether you decide to pitch in or not, I want you to know that I appreciate you watching my videos, reading my blog posts, and simply being a great source of inspiration and motivation. I hope you will continue to find my content valuable! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eXOXO- Mermaid Phantom of The Magic Crafter\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
