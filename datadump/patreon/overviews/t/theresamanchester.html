You\u2019ll most likely find me romping through the woods, zooming down the freeway or naked on the internet. My true passions in life involve travel, writing, communications and visual arts. I have always taken photos, kept journals and diaries, and dreamed of faraway places- so here I am!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSocial media is not ideal for sharing my work.\u003c/strong\u003e Censorship, algorithms, and limited space prevent me from delivering my huge volume of work to my audience. Patreon solves this problem! My archives include\u00a0EXCLUSIVE high-quality content and thousands of photo and video files never before seen. I also offer a rare behind-the-scenes insight to my personal life as a full-time road model and artistic entrepreneur. Lastly,\u00a0I am pleased to explore my voyeuristic and erotic side on this platform. There\u2019s quite a lot I cannot share publicly on the web!

It gives me the warm fuzzies to give back to the arts - but I also learn new skills (like power tools and painting techniques!), acquire valuable experience (quite snazzy on a resume!) and network within a global community of artists.",
