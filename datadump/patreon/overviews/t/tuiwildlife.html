Because of this, money can be a difficult thing to come by, we don\u2019t receive grants or federal support. All of our funding is straight from the public, and all of it goes back to our animals and educational efforts. To make this money, we have traditionally offered educational presentations or booths to schools, libraries, festivals, and events across the state of Texas. We are still going to do that, but this Patreon opens up so many opportunities!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning a nonprofit is hard work; made harder by the fact most of our team maintains other full time jobs beyond this one. We are working overtime to provide you with content that can enrich your life and the lives of those you care about. Even a couple extra dollars helps bring us closer to new projects, paid staff, and new educational opportunities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re working to bridge the gaps between people and nature in order to engage them with our amazing world, inspire them to creation, and earn their interest in supporting nature conservation wherever they may be. Patreon is a chance for us to try reach new classrooms, connect with people across the country, and maybe make a few dollars. The best part is, we can give you something in return! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e-----\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e$1 Reconnection\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a single dollar a month, you can join our community here and get exclusive access to the ongoing work we do!
