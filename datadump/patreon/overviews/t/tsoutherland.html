Episode One, \u0027Kind of a Normal Day\u0027, is the 60-page pilot and introduces dozens of characters and the general setting of the series. I\u0027m going to try to keep Episodes Two through Ten at or under 60 pages each and it will take at least a year to complete them all. I\u0027ve completed covers for Season One to give you an idea of what\u0027s to come. Subscribers of any tier get each \u0027Episode\u0027 of Morally Bankrupt a week before it publically releases.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rU5qKzv.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://simmer.io/@TSoutherland/morally-bankrupt-some-characters\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI\u0027ve created an interactive presentation to introduce people to some of the characters of Morally Bankrupt, built in Unity with the Adventure Creator toolkit.

I did this on and off until 2007 at which point I felt, through a combination of needing real work and increasingly finding my art skills lacking, I put the comic on hiatus. I\u0027ve wanted to go back to it for years now and hopefully Patreon has provided that answer. Instead of returning where I\u0027d left off I\u0027ve completely started over, remaking the comic from \u0027page 1\u0027. It will continue to be an expanded remake until I reach the same point in the story at which time it becomes completely new (unless you already know the story of Earthbound of course) and will go on for as long as possible. Already \u003ca href=\"http://havebatwilltravel.thecomicseries.com/\"\u003eavailable here\u003c/a\u003e are the first ten pages. It will be published twice and week and \u0027The Lincoln\u0027 ($5) tier subscribers will get them a week before the public.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dZcg7IS.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou might have come across my work elsewhere on the internet or possibly even in the real world/meat dimension.
