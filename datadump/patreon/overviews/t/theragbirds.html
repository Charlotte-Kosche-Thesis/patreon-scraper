    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u2019re a fan of The Ragbirds\u0027 music and you want to support our ongoing efforts to create, tour, and record \u00a0- Patreon is the place. Welcome and thank you for checking it out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Ragbirds have toured in 47 states (+ Canada \u0026amp; Japan) with a contagiously joyous, high-energy live show and an honest message of hope. The folk-rock songs we create are rooted in rhythm, influenced by sounds from all over the world. We\u0027ve independently released 5 studio albums and we\u0027re currently writing songs for the next one.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe continue to work hard as entrepreneurs in a field which is unlike any other business - where the hours clocked in do not correlate to the paychecks received and where experience and skill do not correlate with promotion or perceived value.\u00a0We have traveled a long way to find we still don\u0027t know how to get where we are going. And we\u0027ve learned the hard way that the non-stop touring life is not as sustainable as we thought.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s how we ended up here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is far from a sad story. In fact we are full of gratitude and ready to make a positive, healthy change - one that sustains both the musician and the music.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs the band\u2019s songwriter, I\u2019ve still got a lot more to say and I\u2019m nowhere near done making music. I\u2019ve got over 80 songs in various stages of completion that no one has heard yet. I\u2019ve got a new Ragbirds\u2019 album, a Christmas album, a children\u2019s album, a worship project, and a solo album in my sights for the near future along with a number of art projects and music videos. I write constantly and I want to share it with you through blogs, poems, stories, and songs. There are a lot of costs involved with each of these projects. I\u2019ve got the ideas, the skills, the instruments, the team and the ambition. All I need is to stop my wheels long enough to dig in to this creative work and still be able to afford the cost of living.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInstead of doing a big flurry of crowdfunding for each new project we have decided to take a different approach. We\u2019re rejecting the urgent deadlines, the super-hype complex, the desperate pleading.  We\u2019re rejecting the ad-laced blogs, clickbait tactics, the click-to-vote, and the braggadocio.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want to write and record music at a natural and healthy pace. We want to tour seasonally and not constantly, taking the time to reimagine our live show so we can make it better every single time. I want to tell you more of the stories that I can\u0027t share from the stage, to share the glut of footage and photos and recordings we already have cramming up our hard drives. I want to tackle the ever-growing list of creative projects I keep dreaming up but never have the time or the funding to accomplish.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo DO this I will need support. I need a salary and a budget to work with to\u00a0pay for the recording studios, musicians,\u00a0graphic designers, filmmakers, office rent, crew, gas, food, supplies, promotion, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon offers an alternative to the hype game - a subscription-based model where the value is in the content. The artist\u0027s value is determined by you, and the creators of the content are rewarded for creating engaging content. Our reward is a sustainable living wage - so we can continue creating more content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a patron you\u0027ll be an insider along the journey of creating music, with the joy of knowing that you helped to make it possible. Check out all the incentives, rewards, and experiences we\u2019ve laid out below\u00a0and feel free to ask us any questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/0615adf429499c24717250ca0/images/c6c254bf-7ae5-409a-82b8-2644a8361d29.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
