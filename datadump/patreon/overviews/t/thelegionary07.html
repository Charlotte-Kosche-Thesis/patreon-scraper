    "summary": "Legionary\n is a death/thrash metal band from The Bronx. Legionary once played live\n regularly, but is now a one man band headed by mastermind Frank \nD\u0027Erasmo (Drums/Rhythm Guitars/Main \nComposer). Frank uses the services of some of the best metal musicians \nin the Tri-State area, and is currently dedicated to doing studio \nprojects only for the past 6 years and counting.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e The band was established in 2007 \nby Frank. Although Frank put an album to works immediately, It wasn\u0027t \nuntil early 2010 that a complete line up had been achieved.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e \nLegionary\u0027s self titled demo was released in September of 2010, and \nquickly received high praise amongst NY and NJ metalheads. The demo \nincludes two original tracks \"Deceiver\" and \"Awakening Reprisal\". The \nperformance earned Frank the honor of being enlisted on \"Sick Drummer \nMagazine\" the website (\u003ca href=\"http://www.sickdrummermagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content\u0026amp;view=article\u0026amp;id=2064:frank-derasmo-\u0026amp;catid=64:death-grind\u0026amp;Itemid=100010\"\u003ehttp://www.sickdrummermagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content\u0026amp;view=article\u0026amp;id=2064:frank-derasmo-\u0026amp;catid=64:death-grind\u0026amp;Itemid=100010\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n Legionary\u0027s full length debut album titled \"Arcane Divisions\" (later \nremixed/remastered in late 2014) was released on iTunes in April 2012. \nIt consists of 10 pulverizing tracks, each of which has their own \nidentity. The album continues where the demo left off, but this time \npunishes you for nearly 50 minutes with riff after riff.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e On \nApril 16, 2013, Legionary released a 4 song EP titled \"Path Of Tyranny\".\n The songs are politically themed, average around 4 minutes, and feature\n a new tuning for the band. The songs are in D standard tuning, which is\n a change from their usual C standard tuning. Regardless of the higher \ntuning, these songs were quite possibly Legionary\u0027s most intense to date,\n and feature a more thrashy/\"epic\" feel. The goal this time around was \nto have a more modern sounding mix. Frank feels that this EP once again \nmade a statement to the Tri-State metal scene that Legionary is not only\n one of the best unsigned Tri-State metal bands today, but the best.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n The \"Once And For All\" (EP), released in May of 2014, raised the bar \neven higher. These are the most mature and most technical Legionary \nsongs ever, and feature the return of ex-lead guitarist Tony Barhoum, \nand newcomer Mike Dreher (Bassist for Condition Critical \u0026amp; Lich \nKing).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, Legionary has worked with Bobby Torres (Rhythm Guitarist/engineer @ Northend Recording), and released the \"Dominate \u0026amp; Depopulate\" (2015) and \"The Final Stage of Awakening\" (2017) EP\u0027s, which were the band\u0027s most mature sounding efforts. This Patreon page is up to keep the train moving. Keep us doing what we love to do (CREATING AND RECORDING MUSIC!), and more music like the music you hear on JDfromNY206\u0027s hit YouTube podcast \"Off The Script\" will continue to come out. Thanks to anyone who donates, and even considers to donate!\u003cbr\u003e"
