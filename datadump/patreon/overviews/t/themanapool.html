CEO? MFIC?) of Mana Pool Productions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHey awesome! But...what\u0027s The Mana Pool?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe Mana Pool began way back at the end of 2007 as a weekly Magic: The Gathering podcast focused more on the casual side of the game. We\u0027ve been going strong since then, bringing our own form of dorky entertainment to the internet and keeping our listeners sane while they\u0027re at work. Or driving. Or doing yardwork. Or whatever else they might be doing while listening to a podcast. I try not to pry into their personal lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, Mana Pool Productions has become much more than just a podcast. While we still do the show every week, I\u0027ve expanded into video. I now have a Let\u0027s Play channel on YouTube that uploads several videos a week, a Twitch channel where I stream a few times a week, and Mana Pool Productions is also responsible for the Monday Night Magic podcast on MTGCast every week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWell that\u0027s just great. Why are we on Patreon though?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIn 2014 I fired off a Kickstarter to fund the creation of some super-sweet Mana Pool merchandise and to help me focus on creating content full-time. It went really well and the show of support from everyone out there really made me all warm and fuzzy. After that a lot of people requested that I start a Patreon so they could continue showing support, which absolutely blew me away. So I started it up so I could start the process of turning this content-creation hobby into an actual career!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo to see your stuff I have to pay for it? That\u0027s ridiculous!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eNo no, not at all! The actual content will continue to be free for all to enjoy!\u00a0Think of it like a tip jar. If you like what we do and want to help us out or show us some love, you can sign up as a Patron. I don\u0027t actually EXPECT you to sign up. If you don\u0027t want to or are unable to, that\u0027s perfectly fine! You\u0027ll still have access to all the content all the time. But if you want to help out, that\u0027s awesome of you and I appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon, for those that don\u0027t know, is like a Kickstarter that keeps going. Instead of giving some large amount of money to get one big project done, you can set up a smaller, recurring payment to help support all the usual ongoing projects. For all the information you could ever want (from people who know it much better than I do), here\u0027s the \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/faq\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, I\u0027m intrigued. But what\u0027s the Patreon for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt turns out that trying to turn entertainment into a full-time job from isn\u0027t as easy as you\u0027d think. Or maybe you wouldn\u0027t think that. If it was easy everyone would be doing it, right? There are hosting costs, software purchases, equipment upgrades, and any number of small incidental costs that invariably pop up. The Patreon is meant to cover all those.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon also helps me pay the bills and focus on making all this stuff for you. The more support the Patreon gets, the more time I get to spend actually making content for you instead of driving around (my part-time sporadic day job) to make money to pay rent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo...what\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWell of course you get my undying love and gratitude. And the satisfaction of helping out someone who needs it. But not only that, there are rewards! Since this is an ongoing thing I didn\u0027t want to resort to swag-based rewards like the Kickstarter did. You can find the rewards elsewhere on this page. Be sure to let me know if you think of anything else that might work as a reward tier and I\u0027ll see what I can do!\u003cbr\u003e"
