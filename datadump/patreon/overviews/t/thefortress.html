Do not tie yourself or your reputation down to a specific religious, or ideological group. Look at every issue coldly, logically, reasonably, and without personal bias. Understand that socially applied designations like, \"liberal, conservative, progressive, fundamentalist\" are meaningless labels that limit free thought and hamstring you with a party line you must toe. Defy these designations and be contrarian when it suits you. Be fluid, wear many masks, and adapt to your surroundings.

     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the end of the beginning: a personal essay.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom the dawn of my awakening I have had one purpose, one goal, one \ndrive, and that is to experience life to the utmost extent. To be \npresent for every awe-inspiring, heart-wrenching, agonizing and \nbeautiful moment. To live in harmony with Universal law and truth while \nstill following the base human urge of striving to transcend it. To \nappreciate balance and dichotomy, to strive to find balance in my own \nlife, while understanding that perfect balance is stasis, and true \ngrowth and evolution can only be born from chaos.Thus Chaos is the key \nto personal growth. Challenge and hardship is what forges our character \nto the greatest extent. We exercise our muscles, put them through trauma\n and hardship and they respond by becoming stronger. We endure emotional\n hardship and pain, and as long as it doesn\u2019t break us, we become \nemotionally stronger and wiser. We put ourselves through intellectual \nchallenge, and we grow and become smarter. We see, we hurt, and we \nbecome wiser. We challenge ourselves spiritually, constantly questioning\n the validity of our faith and beliefs, and we find peace and acceptance\n in our fate. Fate is indeed a cruel mistress, but beautiful and often \nmisunderstood. And through our hard-fought lives, we should strive to \nknow her. Everything we do or strive for, good or ill, shall return to \nus in some form or another. Strive for the good. Strive to bring beauty \nand happiness in the world. Not the fraudulent happiness of material \nwealth, shallow image, and of expectation realized, instead foster \nhappiness of our own strength and power, of our own perspective and \nrealization, and of our own pursuit of our true potential. Nurture the \nUniverse in all it\u2019s violence and gentle caress. Nurture the truth of \nwhat is and above all, challenge yourself. The universe is entropy, the \nsteady evolution from stasis into chaos. Truly, if you are standing \nstill, the universe is passing you by. Challenge what is possible and \nnever allow yourself to get too comfortable, for comfort often breeds \napathy, and apathy is death.",
