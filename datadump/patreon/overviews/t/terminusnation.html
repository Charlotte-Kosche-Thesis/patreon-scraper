    "summary": "Greetings, Katamori here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been creating fictional worlds with\u00a0enthusiasm and passion since my early childhood. Now, however, I want something bigger: all my ideas in a single huge world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTerminus Nation Wikiverse is basically an encyclopedia about every aspects of a fictional world I\u0027m working on. I want NOT ONLY to show you, what do I have, but to form an enthusiastic and creative community to fulfill my desire: to build up this world! To make something huge - together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may ask: \"Okay, okay, it\u0027s a fictional encyclopedia, but about what?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, the Terminus Nation Wikiverse describes the future in a slightly altered universe, based on the concept of that the dead people of alternate timelines and universes reborn in the current one, only to live here until eternity, without aging, and constantly resurrecting in other cases of death.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Wikiverse focuses on a very small and isolated, but significant galaxy, known as the Cosmic Disk, and the adventures of an immortal pair, the Goldfire Duo within it, in their quest to find the way to escape to another dimension. It should be noted though, that the Wikiverse itself is timeless in in-universe aspects, so I\u0027m willing to expand past and even some future events, if that\u0027s the case.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://terminusnation.wikidot.com/artwork-gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe site also has a small amount of graphic content already.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m ready to fill the Wikiverse with dozens or even hundreds of articles by myself, but my capabilities in other forms of art (such as drawing, animation, or game making) are barely sufficient to go further than an encyclopedia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I can provide you is the lore that I\u0027m constantly updating and expanding to keep you interested and occupied. It is completely free, and I\u0027m doing it in my free time, but my fincancial possibilites are restricted, making it hard to keep it interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy your support, I might be able to expand the encyclopedia by upgrading the Wikidot site to Premium (it allows functions that may enhance experience on-site), spending money on art requests, hiring enthusiastic indie game developers to work together on a game based on Terminus Nation universe, paying animators to create an animated series in a similar manner - and most importantly, by getting some stability on your support, I may be able to spend more time on expanding and improving the concept. I would not mind even to write a novel, or a series of longer novels taking place in Terminus Nation universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContact me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe whole idea is in very early stages, but I\u0027m keeping on building up the Wikidot site, so if I sparked interest, you can spare some cents on me - I would appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, you can contact me at any time:\u003cbr\u003e- on Reddit: /u/KatamoriHUN\u003cbr\u003e- on Twitter: @KatamoriENG\u003cbr\u003e- on the Facebook page of the Terminus Nation project: facebook.com/terminusnationarmy\u003cbr\u003e- on the forums of the Wikiverse: \u003ca href=\"http://terminusnation.wikidot.com/forum:start\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://terminusnation.wikidot.com/forum:start\u003c/a\u003e"
