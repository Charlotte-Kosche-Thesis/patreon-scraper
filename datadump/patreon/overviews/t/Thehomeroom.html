It is also a story about the Wand Girls, a gang of super powered vigilantes who roam the earth dispensing justice and beatings to anyone who needs them with... mixed results. But most of all, it\u0027s about the mysterious Leena Gallagher who has to live among these crazy people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need funds to cover the expenses of a weekly webcomic.
