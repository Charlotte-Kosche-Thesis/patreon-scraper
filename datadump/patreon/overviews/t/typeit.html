    "summary": "Dear Typists!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking a break from typing stuff to visit this page! I\u0027ll cut to the chase:\u003cstrong\u003e Keeping \u003ca href=\"http://www.typeit.org/\"\u003eTypeIt\u003c/a\u003e up and running takes time and money.\u003c/strong\u003e There are financial costs (such as the server and bandwidth, or the cost of development hardware), but the biggest problem is time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew versions of browsers come out all the time, and \u2013 every now and then \u2013 something changes in a way which makes TypeIt stop working. It could be a bug, it could be just a new way of doing things that replaces the old one. When that happens, I have to: (1) figure out what broke and why; (2) rewrite parts of TypeIt to preserve as much functionality as possible; (3) test TypeIt on 5-7 different platforms (browsers, OS\u0027s, mobile devices) to make sure the newly written code didn\u0027t mess things up in other places.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the nature of the changes, all of this stuff can take \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e of time. To take just one example: not so long ago, a new version of Firefox came out, and I had to spend two weeks rewriting and testing the keyboard support code. Testing is particularly tedious, as it involves repeating sequences of keystrokes and clicks on different browsers and devices, to make sure every feature works everywhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOccasionally, I add new languages and features \u2013 like the feature that saves your text and lets you restore it if you close the browser tab by accident.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I\u0027m the only system administrator this site has, so I have to be on standby in case the server goes down or there are performance problems. If that happens, I\u0027m the one who has to drop everything and fix it ASAP. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll of this stuff adds up to a non-trivial amount of not-so-pleasant work, which is a problem because I have to make a living.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve tried some ways to generate income (Google ads, my Windows app), but these just don\u0027t add up to a satisfactory and predictable stream of revenue (while demanding extra work in themselves).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why I decided to try this Patreon thing. Patreon is a service which allows you to donate a small amount each month to support independent creators you like (that would be me). My hope is that support from users like you will give me the peace of mind to keep maintaining TypeIt for you and everybody else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, \u003cstrong\u003eif you like TypeIt and don\u0027t want to see it disappear, you can help keep it up and running by becoming a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e at whatever support level you\u0027re comfortable with. Only you know how much value you\u0027re getting out of TypeIt and how much you can afford. However much you can chip in, it\u0027s more than I expect and I sincerely appreciate it. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2013 Tomasz\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCOULDN\u0027T YOU JUST HAVE MORE ADS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome well-meaning people have suggested increasing the number of ads on the site. While I\u0027m sure that would boost the ad income, I\u0027ve always rejected that advice, because it would totally ruin the user experience, which is something I\u0027ve always cared about. Frankly, I\u0027d sooner shut down the site than plaster it with intrusive ads.\u003cbr\u003e"
