It\u0027s important for me to use my sincere life-based lyrics to relate to people and potentially sing the stories they are unable to tell. I love music! It\u0027s helped me through some dark times and has always kept me joyful. I want to provide that to others. This project will be FREE to the public. I\u0027ve got some great ideas, including some talented collaborations. I just need the financial assistance to make it possible."
