    "summary": "Hi! A lot of people know me as \"The Workbench\" on YouTube, but the truth is, that\u0027s not my real name. It\u0027s actually Alex Ramirez. \u00a0Also, I\u0027m not actually a bench... But that\u0027s besides the point.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here, then you\u0027re probably well aware that I enjoy working with electronics. I like making videos about topics and subjects with information that I believe may benefit other people, people who also enjoy the DIY side of things. I love sharing knowledge and also learning things from others, and that\u0027s where this Patreon page come into play.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I\u0027m only able to make and release a new video every once in a while as time/funding constraints make it difficult to pump them out at a rate which I would like. However, with your help and support, we could make it a much more regular thing!\u00a0I have a long backlog of pending projects to share, which are on hold because I specifically intend to use them for videos in the future. There are many topics which I would love to share more of with everyone, topics including:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeardowns\u003cbr\u003eRepair of common, everyday electronics\u003cbr\u003eVintage electronics\u003cbr\u003e\"From the ground up\" projects\u003cbr\u003eElectronics demos\u003cbr\u003eMechanical/Motorized projects\u003cbr\u003eVideo game related electronics\u003cbr\u003eand more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunding for videos would go towards parts, supplies, better lighting/audio, equipment/tools, and other minor things necessary to just keep me alive enough to produce quality content. :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary goal is to produce at least one new video a week, but eventually attempt to grow that number, with a secondary goal of increasing the quality of the content, as I\u0027m pretty certain what I\u0027m doing now is a wee bit lackluster and could certainly use some polishing. I feel that an unpolished video may detract from the actual information it\u0027s supposed to convey. The ultimate goal is basically to be able to consistently achieve the first two with little to no hurdles. Even without additional funding, I will still continue to do what I can, so I\u0027m not planning on going anywhere, \u003cstrong\u003eI promise\u003c/strong\u003e! I appreciate all the positive comments and information I\u0027ve received from many viewers over the years, and is what has helped motivate me to try to do better and grow!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile at the moment I can\u0027t offer any particular rewards/perks to patrons, other than continued production of videos, depending on how things go in the future, I\u0027m hoping this may change for the better. However, patrons will get sneak peeks of projects in the works! Also, please keep in mind that the content and methods of production still ultimately remain under my control, but where possible and reasonable, I will be open to suggestions regarding what sorts of things to make videos on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it this far, I thank you for taking the time to read, and if you\u0027re here because you enjoy my content, thank you for watching and your continued support!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you on the \u0027bench!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
