Every month is a challenge, and we live extremely frugally because of it. We owe the bank for schooling, just like many people in Canada and the U.S. do. We scrape by, and what extra money I make goes to things like keeping my website/blog up and running, getting my kid\u2019s clothing from second-hand stores, and keeping our rescued dogs fed and cared for. Any money I make on Patreon goes towards keeping my website up and running, allows me to keep my editing software\u2026 By supporting me, you are supporting a family, and allowing me to keep making content you want to see! I just want to be able to share knowledge :) Thank you for any help you can give!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
