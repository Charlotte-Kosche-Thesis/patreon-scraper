Welcome to my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal with this Patreon Page is to bring you behind the scenes on this new project from the start. I\u0027ve been inspired to create this series of figurative oil paintings in a theatrical setting called \u003cem\u003eTheatre of Duelists\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA little about me...\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a contemporary realist painter from Canada and currently living in Germany. I love creating and feel most alive when painting, primarily oil painting. Inspired by the 19th century realists and classical masters like JW Waterhouse, Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Frederic Lord Leighton and the like. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.ftxl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22046016_10209797050834284_2666933738191802715_n.jpg?oh=da87cc98994ebdaf9f0eb03941e0e077\u0026amp;oe=5A78FF37\" style=\"width: 231px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cEverything in the world is about sex except sex. Sex is about power.\u201d\u2015Oscar Wilde\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThrough this series I aim to communicate the dynamic of human intimacy and the power plays involved. This body of work addresses itself primarily to the inner world of the individual.\n\u003cbr\u003eInspired by histories of actual female duels, I then expounded on that idea by imagining these would be set as a re-telling for a theatre play or opera. What has typically been regarded as a masculine art, I was fascinated to find the actual recorded events of female duels, some rather famous and spectacular. Including one famous one between a princess and a duchess where they both fought topless. There are also tales of women dueling men which I may explore as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to share with you more than just first glimpses at the new work I am creating, but I hope to share insight into more of my thought processes behind these ideas as well as share other aspects of my life as an artist from my creative inspiration, to running an art business, as well as technical tricks and materials.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne of the things that brings me the most joy is when my work inspires someone. I love knowing that my own passion can inspire other people to find and succeed in their own passions as well. If my work inspires you to write, draw, paint and create that makes me happy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BYIbyxFFdFL/?taken-by=linda_adair\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.ftxl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/21078453_10209564059329642_3250978925447813009_n.jpg?oh=9cd40cbbd3b180de4db27a3a8d501c37\u0026amp;oe=5A45270A\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideos\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOne of the things I have wanted to do is to make time lapse and other videos for you of my painting process. This has been tricky for me as I am rather new to working while filming and can be awkward to paint with a camera in front of me. I am excited to start, and with this Patreon, I want to create videos for you. I\u0027d love to be able to share a more in-depth view of some of my processes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother benefit of being a patron will be access to some of the raw sketches and stages of my painting. As an artist on social media, I find I am reluctant to post all stages of the painting process. Most of what we show on Facebook or Instagram is viewed not only by artists, but by potential clients, galleries, and publishers. As such, I tend to show less of the painting process especially when a painting is in \"the ugly phase\" or those less than photogenic steps that nevertheless might reveal a lot about the thought process and decisions that go into the creation. With this Patreon I would like to take you behind the scenes and give you first glimpses of the work as it\u0027s being created.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.ftxl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/21751800_10209710402028118_2529711185840562726_n.jpg?oh=f5c8d0ea364b74b70c28feddb791429d\u0026amp;oe=5A71F85F\" style=\"width: 282px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a subscription-based funding platform that helps support artists, musicians, and creators of all types focus on what they do best. It will help me to focus on this new project. This Patreon will give me the opportunity and time to be able to focus more of my energies on this vision and giving back to you by documenting the process and creating videos for you. With Patreon I can fully explore this more elaborate undertaking of this series \u003cem\u003eTheatre of Duelists\u003c/em\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for stopping by!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n--Linda\n\u003cbr\u003e"
