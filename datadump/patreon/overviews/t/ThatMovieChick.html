    "summary": "Hey guys! Kate here! Though if you made it to this page you are probably more familiar with my moniker \u003cstrong\u003eThat Movie Chick\u003c/strong\u003e. Regardless I am an aspiring writer and lover of films both good and bad. From a young age I have been over-analyzing every movie I could get my hands on which were usually my mom\u2019s VHS\u2019s. Even before I could write words I would create picture books about how those movies made me feel. In 2017 I finally decided to put my words to paper, buy a camera, and start my own review series.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what sort of content will I be providing you with? Glad you asked!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat Movie Chick Reviews\u003c/strong\u003e is my main show where I give it my all to best convey my opinion and give some insight on various films primarily based around story, characters, and themes. From an oscar contender to a camp 80\u2019s flick, I treat all films the same! I will usually be reviewing the latest movies out in theatres but I will delve into older cinema and television shows as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e**Any reviews of newly released films will be free of charge and will not be pinged on your Patreon account.**\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetflix and Chick\u003c/strong\u003e is where I keep my focus on analyzing streaming site\u2019s original content, mainly from Netflix. However I am open to viewing Amazon and Hulu originals if requested. It\u0027s a whole new frontier that deserves some exploration. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eTEMPORARY HIATUS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat Movie Night\u003c/strong\u003e is a more freeform show where I discuss various films/tv shows directly after watching them. I give it a more podcasty (does that count as a\u00a0word?) feel to it. I will always have a guest on, usually my partner in crime, Corey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can check out all my videos on Youtube at: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ThatMovieChick\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/c/ThatMovieChick\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to become one of my patrons well that makes you a kickass amazing person! Even the $1 I receive helps me improve the quality of my reviews and enable me to give you and everyone else better content. Plus you can help me decide on what films and television series I will review next as well as get your name in the credits at the end of each video. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also set your patronage at whatever amount you are comfortable with. It doesn\u2019t even have to be one of the reward amounts. You can also set a cap per month as well. Can\u2019t wait to talk with you about movies, TV, and the like soon! Thank you for your support!"
