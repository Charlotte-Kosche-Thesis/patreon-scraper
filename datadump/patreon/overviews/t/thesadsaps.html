    "summary": "I\u0027m Teddy Coppes. My dream is that I can pave the way for handicapped people like me to have a real shot as entertainers, artists, and anything we dream of doing. Can you think of a singer or musician with a physical disability? Have you ever met a disabled high school teacher, or a disabled health care worker? I live with cerebral palsy, and I hope that I can in my own way make the world a better place for people like me. I want to express what I feel and what I dream with my creative projects but I also know that if I can do this, if I can be successful and have that platform, it could change everything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport me on Patreon and it will help give me a head start at making my dreams come true. Regular employment that is accessible is scarce - most people would be really surprised if they understood just how inaccessible the world is for people like me. I\u0027ve been shut out of at least two dozen job interviews because of my condition. There are lot of places that I just can\u0027t go on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always loved music. I love singing, and I\u0027m fortunate to be able to play the guitar and piano. I\u0027ve never had any role models of disabled musicians, and I\u0027ve always been told that I\u0027ll have less of a shot because of who I am. Venues often aren\u0027t laid out in ways I can perform at, or even go. I believe it can happen for me, and I hope you believe in me too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t just want to make music, either. I have ideas for a YouTube channel where I talk about discrimination and accessibility issues, and make videos of social experiments and real-world examples of how to improve the conditions of our world for people like me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking the world a more accessible place is a good thing for everyone. I hope that by supporting me you\u0027re not just a fan of my music, or videos, or other creative projects, but that you\u0027re also someone who wants to start making a difference in how people like me are perceived and treated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
