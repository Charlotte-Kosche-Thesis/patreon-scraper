    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eEssentially for the cost of buying me a beer once or twice a month, you can enable me to make more and more educational home brewing and wine making videos for you to easily reference anytime!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Hello YouTube, Joe here!\" \u00a0Most of you home brewers and winemakers out there who are on YouTube will probably know by the sound of that welcome that you are in for one of Joe\u0027s home brewing or wine making videos. \u00a0So first and foremost, \"Hello Patreons, Joe here!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page, and 17! \u00a0Thank you so much for taking the time to check all this out and for directly supporting my home brewing and wine making videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have heard from many of you that you\u0027d love a way to help support me and my YouTube channel, but ordering from my home-brew shop is too expensive--and I get it. \u00a0Shipping is a bear (especially international shipping), and my little shop has to compete with the mega-giants owned by AB InBev who can afford to run sales that I couldn\u0027t touch with a 10 foot pole. \u00a0It is tough--very tough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is where Patreon comes into the picture. \u00a0Patreon is platform where individuals, such as yourselves, can make small regular contributions to each video I come out with, no matter where you live in the world. \u00a0This not only helps support me financially (and not the big advertisers), but it also allows me to worry less about having to make money from my shop, and instead will help allow me to focus on making more videos, bigger and better videos, and will give me the ability to expand my channel in ways I have only dreamt about. \u00a0Plus, you can set a contribution cap--so if for some reason I come out with 10 videos in a month, you\u0027ll never go over your contribution threshold. \u00a0This is a great way for anyone who has enjoyed my videos, anywhere on the planet, to make contributions on a video-by-video basis. \u00a0If I\u0027m not producing videos, you pay nothing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI definitely want to thank everyone who has already subscribed to the channel and who has helped make my little corner of YouTube a fun and educational one! \u00a0That is NOT going to change! \u00a0I will keep creating beer-tastic content for YouTube. \u00a0Patreon just allows folks who are able to contribute financially to help me keep doing what I am doing. \u00a0Trust me--the support is sincerely appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat all being said--I have built in some fun contribution tiers to make our Patreon exchange a good one! \u00a0Patreons of various regular amount will gain exclusive perks, and the more you donate, the cooler the perks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for watching, thank you for contributing and finally... CHEERS!"
