    "summary": "I am an intense seeker of \u003cstrong\u003espiritual truth\u003c/strong\u003e! I have been on this journey now for almost 30 years and I\u0027m just staring to get a sense of what lies beneath the surface when it come to Scripture, the origins of the faith and the difficult and sometimes paradoxical history it has produced. My desire is to make complex spiritual things simple and accessible to as many people as possible. God\u0027s Truth was given to everyone so that everyone can benefit from it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHaving grown up in a Communist society (Bulgaria), I have a first-hand experience of what it is to have to whisper in your own home out of fear that the government might have to hear something \"wrong\" you say. I have a heightened sense of how precious is liberty on individual and societal level. I am also convinced that without helping those in need, our preaching and teaching is a \"clanging cymbal\" (1 Cor. 13:1) All of the above is the basis upon which the THREEFOLD MISSION of Threefold Christian Alliance is founded: The Gospel, Liberty and Charity. When those three work hand in hand, the Kingdom of God is truly advanced on the Earth and transformations can occur in the lives of individuals, as well as entire cultures. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI offer the above program as a sample of one of the formats I will be producing over the course of 2018. The MANLY CHRISTIANS PODCAST will be a weekly podcast bringing interesting and valuable teaching, information and resources to men who desire to live godly and meaningful lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can subscribe to Manly Christians using the links below, depending on the platform of your choice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eSubscribe\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://anch.co/get_anchor\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"40\" src=\"https://d12xoj7p9moygp.cloudfront.net/images/podcast/anchor-podcasts-3.png\" style=\"width: 92px;\" width=\"130\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/manly-christians/id1329422211\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"33\" src=\"https://d12xoj7p9moygp.cloudfront.net/images/podcast/apple-podcasts-3.png\" style=\"width: 116px;\" width=\"130\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://playmusic.app.goo.gl/?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic\u0026amp;isi=691797987\u0026amp;ius=googleplaymusic\u0026amp;apn=com.google.android.music\u0026amp;link=https://play.google.com/music/m/I7d7f6vljvdgktvbibhudsdqqvq?t%3DManly_Christi\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"47\" src=\"https://d12xoj7p9moygp.cloudfront.net/images/podcast/google-play-music-3.png\" style=\"width: 77px;\" width=\"130\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1329422211\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"39\" src=\"https://d12xoj7p9moygp.cloudfront.net/images/podcast/overcast-3.png\" style=\"width: 92px;\" width=\"130\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
