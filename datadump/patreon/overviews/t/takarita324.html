I am 27 years old and have been apart of the gaming world since i was a youngin\u0027. 5 years ago I started my World of Warcraft adventure which, 2 years late, lead to live streaming on twitch! I started this journey in Florida, moved to California, Moved back to Florida and am now In New York. Whenever I\u0027m not streaming I\u0027m usually cooking, working out, binge watching Netflix, or missing\u00a0lethal constantly on Hearthstone. I am currently Sponsored by Nvidia, one of the most kind and caring companies i\u0027ve ever had the pleasure to work with. When i\u0027m not streaming on my page I stream twice a week on their sponsored page. So, again, thank you so much to everyone who supports me by watching not just on my page but on that one as well!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I became a full time streamer\u00a0I attended Florida Atlantic University to\u00a0pursue\u00a0teaching. For 5 years I taught musical theater and acting to kids ages 4-17, some of whom were kids with special needs. I am fluent in Sign language. Moving forward from streaming I hope to open up a Performing Arts school for kids with special needs and kids who are deaf. The communities surrounding both have the most incredible and inspiring people that I have ever worked with, and i cannot wait to continue more work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so grateful with all of the opportunities that I have been blessed with, especially all of you. I\u00a0receive\u00a0messages\u00a0all the time\u00a0saying how I have\u00a0distracted\u00a0someone from something bad in their life... I have\u00a0inspired\u00a0them to get out \u00a0in the world and not be shy\u00a0about\u00a0chasing their dreams...but I want ya\u0027ll to know you have done the exact same thing for me. Sometimes I wake up and it\u0027s so hard for me, emotionally, to get out of bed....but I know the second I turn on my computer, start up my stream, pour myself some coffee - you guys are there to make me smile and feel like nothing can go wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you - thank you for inspiring me \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove you guys,\u003cbr\u003eMorgan a.k.a Takarita\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOther Places you can find me\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwitch: twitch.tv/takarita324\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwitter: twitter.com/tacolady324\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInstagram: instagram.com/Morgan_takarita\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFacebook: \u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/seriouslyclara\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Takarita324/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/Takarita324/\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/twitchvancouver\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMerch:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.teepublic.com/stores/takarita\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.teepublic.com/stores/takarita\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEmail: takarita324@gmail.com\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"
