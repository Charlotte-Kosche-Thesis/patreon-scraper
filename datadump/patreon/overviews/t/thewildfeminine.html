    "summary": "The Wild Feminine is a small community run by Danielle Warford. We write blogs, share knowledge on holistic wellness, yoga, post inspiring art and offer tarot reading, distance reiki, private yoga coaching among other things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe we are so grateful for any support during this venture. We are so appreciateive of our tribe on Instagram and all the love you\u2019ve helped us pour into this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cFriends- first off, I want to say a BIG thank you to all of you who have grown with me the last year. I appreciate each and everyone of you, and read every single comments and so glad we could all come together in this space of healing and growth. \u003cbr\u003e\nWith that said, this last year I have thrown my heart into The Wild Feminine. It\u2019s more than an Instagram page: it\u2019s a blog, it\u2019s services such as yoga, reiki, and tarot reading. It\u2019s life coaching, where we provide inspiration and facilitate healing and growth. I\u2019ve put all of my effort and energy into this to grow it to where it is. To say this, as much as I love this community and tribe, it personally has generated no income, which I so needed it to do. It\u2019s one thing to sell products, but that\u2019s not what we do here. We offer facilitated healing, growth, and encouragement along with our modalities. I\u2019m saying all of this because I have just started a Patreon Page, where you can donate monthly if you chose to- this would help me with costs of running this site, business, and all the time and effort I put into it. I have a family, and this too is my baby. I\u2019d love to see this project and community grow and flourish, but need support of my followers \u0026amp; friends. \u003cbr\u003e\nIf this speaks to you in anyway, please consider becoming a Patreon at www.patreon.com/thewildfeminine\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis will help me give back to you, too. Thank you so much.\u201d\u003c/p\u003e"
