We couldn\u0027t be happier with the response the podcast has received but we need your help. Unfortunately the This Is Horror Podcast doesn\u0027t make any money. We don\u0027t have any sponsorship or adverts on the podcast. Just uninterrupted commercial-free content. This was sustainable as a monthly-endeavour but as we strive to deliver more-and-more content it takes up more time and makes it harder to deliver content with no financial reward. On top of the This Is Horror website hosting we pay $15 (plus international transaction fees) to host the podcast. But it\u0027s the time commitment that\u0027s the biggest obstacle. We spend anything from 8 hours on reading and question preparation each week, 1\u20133 hours recording time and 4\u20136 hours editing together the podcast and compiling the show notes. That\u0027s a lot of time spent on the podcast on-top of running This Is Horror and holding down a full-time job. It\u0027s the love of the show that keeps it going and will keep it going, but if just a fraction of you were to pledge as little as $1 per month I could consider making the jump to full-time self-employment and expanding the This Is Horror Podcast further. We\u0027ll also be able to upgrade our microphones, buy new editing software and look into other great ways to improve the quality and final podcast product. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Patreon Is\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of Patreon as a tip jar or a donations page.
