    "summary": "Using free social media platforms, I\u2019ve been helping several people\u00a0a day to progress to a Vegan lifestyle. I also provide constant support to shepherd them as they create new, sustainable habits. I\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours Skype calling, personal messaging and writing out detailed email responses with extra links to videos and articles. I do this all for free, often losing sleep to help others all around the world, and it will always be free because the world needs to hear the truth. \u003cbr\u003eVeganism is the solution to almost all the major problems we are currently facing. It can help prevent, treat and reverse almost all the major diseases, can help us overcome mental health issues like depression and eating disorders. It can help restore the environment, which is being destroyed as a result of animal agriculture. It can help save our oceans which are being ruined by fishing practices. It can help those who do not have enough food or clean water. And\u00a0it can help save the trillions of land and marine animals who are tortured and murdered annually for food, clothing and entertainment. \u003cbr\u003eIt is our last option.\u003cbr\u003eEducation-based digital\u00a0activism is the most accessible, effective\u00a0way of spreading\u00a0Veganism to the masses. But unfortunately, it is a full time job that pays virtually nothing. A well-edited, highly sharable 60 second education video might take 10 hours to create. A 10 minute one will take at least 100. Regardless of the many tedious hours it can take to research and edit, I will never stop creating videos. I have largely\u00a0given up on making vlogs and what I eat in a day videos, I don\u0027t plan on talking about celebrities or making pointless click-bait videos, I want to create resources for\u00a0Vegans\u00a0and not-yet-Vegans alike. I want to create videos to educate\u00a0not-yet-Vegans which\u00a0other activists can use to quickly illustrate their points. My videos are all free to re-upload and share anywhere. \u003cbr\u003eBut at the moment, my activism isn\u0027t sustainable. As soon as I can earn enough passive income\u00a0to eat and sleep, I will commit to Vegan Activism full time 70-100 hours a week. At this point I will be able to help double the amount of people to go Vegan a day and upload twice as many videos at an even higher quality. I am also\u00a0currently creating a full-length documentary, which will be free to share and download everywhere when it\u0027s finished. And I have many other projects in mind for the future...\u003cbr\u003eSo if you are in a position to help support me financially, I would massively appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
