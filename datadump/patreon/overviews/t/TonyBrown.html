I just like it. No other meaning, really.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo...who am I? Let\u0027s just do the official bio I give to the press before gigs...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eTony Brown has been writing for almost 50 years, and publishing\nand performing his work for nearly as long.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e\nA six-time Pushcart Prize nominee, his work has appeared in too many journals\nand anthologies to list here without his being accused of bragging, and he\u2019d\nnever want to do that.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe has traveled all over the country, slammed for the Worcester Poets\u2019 Asylum,\norganized and hosted readings and reading series, and written extensively on\npoetry for various Websites and print journals. His most recent chapbook, \u201cIn The Embers,\u201d was published by Tired Hearts Press (2016).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThese days, Tony most commonly performs his poetry with The Duende\nProject, which includes Steven Lanning-Cafaro on electric and acoustic bass, classical\nguitar, and keyboards; Chris Lawton on acoustic and\nelectric guitar, banjo, and mandolin; and Chris O\u2019Donnell on drums.  They\u2019ve spent almost 11  years performing up and down the East Coast\nand have released five collections of their work.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make most of my living as a self-employed training and development consultant. \u00a0After 30+ years doing that in and out of corporate settings, I\u0027m good at it, and I do OK financially. \u00a0I\u0027ve always been in pursuit of a lifestyle that supported my creative work, and that means I\u0027ve deliberately arranged my time to put poetry first, especially since I went out on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI run a daily blog where I publish all of my completed work.\u00a0Dark Matter is seen by roughly 3000 folks on a daily basis through various outlets. Every poem I complete -- and I try to complete a lot of them -- gets a pretty good chance of being seen by someone.  I like that.  It\u0027s a lot of work, but it\u0027s my calling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, I decided a long time ago that, knowing that there wasn\u0027t much money to be made in poetry anyway, I\u0027d rather pursue the goal of being widely read by a lot of folks than to try and go the traditional route of publishing in small journals and putting out full volumes of work periodically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027ve gotten older, I want to expand what I do there while following the same philosophy. I\u0027d like to put out eBooks of small connected collections, maybe some recordings and creative videos, reinforce the work and income the band pull in, etc., so we have more equipment and options to do stuff without worrying how to support it; I\u0027d also like to travel a bit more to do solo gigs as they come up. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePut simply, I\u0027m getting old -- I\u0027m 57 with a couple of nagging medical conditions -- and I have much, much more I wish to accomplish. \u00a0I think I do good work, important work. I think the band does too. \u00a0I want to get it out there more and do more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in...I hope. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGo check out the blog and the band Website (links below) if you\u0027re intrigued.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://radioactiveart.wordpress.com/\"\u003eDark Matter (the poetry blog)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://theduendeproject.com/\"\u003eThe Duende Project (the band site)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you decide to sign on and become part of the merry band.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do choose to pledge, you have my deep, deep gratitude -- and some rewards as well, of course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose not to pledge, thank you for the time you invested in checking this out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut even if you choose not to pledge, I hope you\u0027ll choose to continue to follow the poetry and the music. The Work -- the extended act of getting what I do out there -- will continue for as long as I can do it. \u00a0It\u0027s what I do. \u00a0It\u0027s what I\u0027ve always done. It\u0027s what I am, really.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to whatever our interaction may be in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eTony Brown\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
