     "about": "My mother was briefly Miss Iceland before she was stripped of her title for drunkenly throwing rotten shark meat at a public official. My father was an oblivious but happy man from Germany who made \u201cspecialty\u201d sausages. They met in Australia where they were both attending an international conference for alternative meat preparation and innovation. They fell in love and immigrated to America to invent their own mobile bratwurst franchise, with baby Piper following 9 months later. My father was a very literal man and moved us around to Florida towns he thought would be most receptive to food-based enterprises: Mayo, FL, Spuds, FL, Two Egg, FL, eventually settling in Dinner Island, FL which to his dismay was not so much an island as it was 34 square miles of vacant landlocked pasture land. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter years of financial ruin, constant fighting, and lizard sausages, I was abandoned but eventually adopted by a lovely Chinese couple. They continued to raise me and put me through school where I was able to earn a degree in Bagpipery from Carnegie Mellon University. Looking for a quiet comfortable life and having the same literal inclinations as my birth father, I moved to Couch, FL, Chaires, FL, and finally I reside here in Fluffy Landing, FL where I enjoy drinking, surfing, knitting, and saying mildly off-putting things on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis story is true. Well not all of it. Actually only the part about me living in Florida. Which in itself is a harrowing experience. I was born somewhere between the release of AC/DC\u0027s \"Back In Black\" album and MC Hammer\u0027s \"Please Hammer, Don\u0027t Hurt \u0027Em\" album and grew up watching old reruns of I Love Lucy, All In The Family, with a heaping dose of Peewee\u0027s Playhouse, which may explain a few things. My experience with making people laugh is limited to friends, family, and befuddled coworkers- and now I\u0027m reaching out to you, because you\u0027re awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy clicking that \"Subscribe\" button on the Piper Bellows channel you could reveal one of five golden tickets granting you a full-access tour of the glorious WONKA FACTORY- uh, no wait, that\u0027s wrong. I fell asleep watching late night cable again. What subscribing to my channel WILL get you is a weekly tour of my brain with a new video posted every Wednesday for ultimate Hump Day relief. You can share in my half-baked ideas, possibly questionable ethics, relatable annoyances, and shareable giggles. Come watch and chat with me in the comments. Your mom already has.",
