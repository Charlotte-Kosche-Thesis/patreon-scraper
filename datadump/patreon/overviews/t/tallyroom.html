    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Ben Raue, and I run\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tallyroom.com.au/\"\u003ethe Tally Room\u003c/a\u003e website. I\u0027ve been running this website since 2008, covering elections in Australia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve focused on publishing useful data and background information to make it easier for my readers to understand Australian elections, alongside my own analysis and predictions. I\u0027d like to think I\u0027m known for being fair and rising above my own biases in my analysis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve particularly specialised in publishing thorough guides to each election, including informative maps for each electorate as well as candidate lists, past results and the history and geography of the seat. I\u0027ve now published such a guide for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tallyroom.com.au/archive\"\u003eevery state and federal election since 2010\u003c/a\u003e. These guides have also been popular places to have discussions about a specific electorate in the comments sections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also been publishing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tallyroom.com.au/maps\"\u003eboundary maps\u003c/a\u003e for every Australian state and territory electoral redistribution over the last decade, as well as local government boundaries for most of the country and ward maps for Australia\u0027s four biggest states.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore recently, I began compiling results from various state and local elections and publishing the results in an easy-to-use format, in my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tallyroom.com.au/data\"\u003edata repository\u003c/a\u003e . A lot of these results are hard to access, published as PDFs or even image files. I\u0027ve aimed to publish them in a single spreadsheet, with matching files listing the polling places with latitudes and longitudes (often not provided by the electoral commission), and full lists of candidates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course I also provide my own analysis and coverage of results, but the niche for this website has always been providing this foundational data which can help everyone do better work analysing elections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis work was not previously sustainable. In the long run I wasn\u0027t going to be able to keep up this work with the level of support I had at the end of 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a big push in late 2017 and early 2018 I now have enough donors to take the occasional day off from my day job to work on my various electoral projects.\u00a0In particular, it is allowing me to keep up with the fickle timelines set by elections - more donors will allow me to ensure the guide to the next federal election is done well in advance, in case the election is called early.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am now publishing my guides to the upcoming federal, NSW and Victorian elections - one seat per day (and if you sign up as a patron for $5 or more per month, you can nominate a seat to be prioritised).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport from my patrons has allowed me to complete these guides ahead of schedule, and further patronage will allow me to take on more ambitious goals. I am currently completing a collection of recent election results as clean complete datasets (and I\u0027d like to dive back into the history books to expand this collection), and I\u0027m seeking more donors to allow me to run an elections podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar helps me achieve this goal!"
