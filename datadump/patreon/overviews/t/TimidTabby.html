    "summary": "\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;Hey there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is your friendly online neighborhood housecat TimidTabby hoping to be bringing you all some media variety goodness...that is if animal/Werewolf transformations, anthro slice-of-life, erotic stories, and goofy amateur Let\u0027s Plays are your thing :-P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never really been one to try and sell my work, yet alone as for donations or handouts, as I\u0027ve felt the quality of my work hasn\u0027t meant the proper standards to that of professional artist or writers or Popular YouTubers.\u00a0 The dream has always been for this timid housecat to create what I like when I can and share my vision of beauty and freakishness to the world for the low low price of FREE.\u00a0 That dream...hasn\u0027t really died, but in this day of age of jacked up prices and horrible economic fumbles it\u0027s getting harder to keep doing what I love when the main job outside of my hobbies can\u0027t support me enough to progress onward (let alone pay off my debts).\u00a0 So...I\u0027m willing to give Patreon a chance to see if I can gather a big enough boost to help support me in my hectic daily life as well as stick the needle under my furry behind with motivation to get old piled up projects finished for once.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll admit this now; I\u0027m not entirely sure what kind of rewards I can offer for my profession except for the sweet satisfaction of getting a ton more material out of me than I have over the past few years.\u00a0 I could offer doing personal drawings of your OC\u0027s, maybe even a short writing at that (though be mindful of my abilities and my themes; some themes I\u0027m not yet really proficient at...or that I will NEVER touch with a 1000ft poll).\u00a0 (I\u0027ll update the list of themes I\u0027m willing to do and willing to DON\u0027T after I figure out more of the inner-workings of this Patreon system).\u00a0 For now; I only hope the best goals you could gain from me is the steady progress of getting my work out to you all faster than before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat goals am I\u0027m trying to reach from this?\u00a0 My biggest goals are in my writing section as I currently have over 20+ different short stories and series I would like to complete and start.\u00a0 The biggest goal I\u0027m gunning for is to restart a very old and very dear Werewolf series of mine that have improbable aspirations in wanting to be publicly published someday, that being the \u003cstrong\u003eHOWL: A Werewolf Story\u003c/strong\u003e series I posted several chapters nearly (or over?) a decade ago on dA.\u00a0 Other series like my \u003cstrong\u003eWolfhood: Reborn\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eWolvesbane\u003c/strong\u003e (mostly erotic stories mind you) will be my current focus though as the first was very well received from its original version (though some events will be altered to flow better/be less \"*poof*, that just happened for no explained reason\" moments.\u00a0 A Sequel has also been planned for a while now to and I\u0027m itching to get that off the cutting room floor.\u00a0 The drawings aspect is in the middle ground; I am attempt to improve my own craft but there are some limitations that will always hold me back.\u00a0 Depending on how surprisingly successful this funding venue goes; I may seek out professional assistance to illustrating key scenes in my stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the Gaming side...hehe; I\u0027m not entirely concerned.\u00a0 That one is purely hobby as I have no aspiration to become a famous YouTuber or whatever.\u00a0 However; I do enjoy cutting together my past gamestreams I recorded over the years and tweak them a bit with some comical quotes and cutaway gags to relatable shows/movies/youtube videos.\u00a0 The quality of my older streams; though, isn\u0027t anything I can write home to mama about, and my current knowledge of video edit is expanding but not in a faster pace (mostly because I\u0027m stuck with Cyberlink).\u00a0 And because my focus is on my writings and drawings (and, not to mention, life with work and family and friends), the YouTube scene is my last go-to hobby.\u00a0 But; that doesn\u0027t mean a little \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ebling-bling\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e wouldn\u0027t help give me a extra drive if I discover my video\u0027s are doing well to entertain \u003cstrong\u003e*wink wink* *nudge nudge* *catch my drift* *Bob\u0027s your Uncle*\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really need to cut out the joking shtick.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut; yeah, those are my goals and any small offering of support (emotional, spiritual, financial) might get my lazy bones out of the muck of my lethargic habits and get sh-...STUFF done!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo all those that took all this time to read my little proposal, I thank you.\u00a0 To those that don\u0027t decide to stick around or aren\u0027t able to support me monetarily-wise, that\u0027s ok and I wish you well on your travels and hope what I do manage to finish and share will continue to entertain.\u00a0 And to those that are...\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOLY SHNIKIES \u003c/strong\u003ewhat are you doing, Person?\u00a0 I\u0027m not worth it; save that money and support someone with better material than me or spend it on something nice for yourself or- \u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*Smacks myself across the face*\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e -...\u003c/em\u003eThank you very much for your Patronage \u0026gt;^__^\u0026lt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any of my suggested material hasn\u0027t made you about face and forward march out the opposite direction in shock and disgust and instead peeked your interest and secret wild side, you can visit my current galleries for my past and current art and stories.\u00a0 Mind you; again, lots of them plus the sites they reside on are mostly NSFW, so follow at your own risk of sanity...and possibly bring a bar of soap to clean the filth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u0026gt;_________\u0026lt;\u00a0 Gosh Darnit!\u00a0 Not only did that joke stink but it sounded way too dirty........\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I still doing it?\u00a0 \u003cem\u003eSTOP THAT!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eFurAffinity gallery:\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/timidtabby/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/timidtabby/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeviantArt gallery:\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"http://timidtabby84.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://timidtabby84.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutube Channel:\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF5Edk2jOEoVdNlyJ47x63A\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF5Edk2jOEoVdNlyJ47x63A\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e"
