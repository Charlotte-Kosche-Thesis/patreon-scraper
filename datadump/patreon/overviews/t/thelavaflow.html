In his time as Chairman, he brought full ballot access to the LPAR for the first time in state history and which led to running 15 Libertarian candidates across the state. In 2012 and 2014, he also ran for Arkansas State Representative in the 51st district. He has worked with End the Fed rallies in Little Rock and been active in marijuana legalization. The LAVA Flow is the first podcast project of Pax Libertas Productions, an organization created to help spread the word of liberty and capitalism to the four corners of the world.",

This will be a very short 5 - 7 minute podcast at least once a week (likely more) on a single timely topic that is happening at the moment in the news from a LAVA perspective. This will require more of my time, so I need some coin to help offset that. Want to hear more of me and more often? Then exercise your free-market muscles and help support The LAVA Flow!",

However, with a full-time job and a family, it is tough to find time to write, record, edit, and produce this podcast on a weekly basis.
