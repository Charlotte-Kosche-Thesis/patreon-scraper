    "summary": "The Tenth Amendment Media Group (TAMG) launched in 2007 and we\u2019re very proud of our longevity in the media business. We appreciate the faith and trust our readers and listeners have placed in our ability to keep you informed, entertained, and empowered. It is an honor when you tell us that we were the only ones who stayed on the issues, asked the uncomfortable questions, and went to the front lines on your behalf. Our firm operated the now defunct Exceptional Radio Network (2007-2012), Home Rule News (2009-current), Dominique Magazine (2016-current) and a few other properties. The company is mostly a one man show-yours truly! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we are proud of the progress that we\u2019ve made, we cannot grow to the levels in which we desire using the current model. Our business and marketing plans point out to the vitality and urgent need of our outlets in the communities that we serve:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHome Rule News (Greater West Metro Atlanta Community News): Event coverage in Tri-Cities, West Atlanta, Smyrna-Cumberland and surrounding areas. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDominique Magazine (A lifestyle, news, views, and culture outlet for black men): We\u2019re targeting black men between the ages of 21-54 that reside in many metro areas across the country. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSounds from the Underground Music Series: This collection of shows features independent artists from all genres. The main show, Sounds from the Underground, features national/international artists. A-Town Rocks features Metro Atlanta/State of Georgia artists and Club 1007: Get It In features the best dance music and club jams. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past ten years, we earned revenue through ad sales and sponsorships along with rewards from strategic partnerships. Due to the focus of meeting operational expenses while generating consistent content, the existing revenue model must change. We have acknowledged the need to have a part time staff member or contractor to focus on ads and sponsorships as we begin to launch a marketing campaign that can be funded to grow."
