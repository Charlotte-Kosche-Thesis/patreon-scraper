    "summary": "Top Down Perspective has been a low key video game podcast since 2010. It consists of the rambling of Paul Fleck, Jon Wheeler, and Sean Booker. With over 400 episodes the three hosts have gathered every week to discuss what they\u0027ve been playing, the industry around them, and taken audience questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we grew we incorporated video podcasts into our workflow and even live streaming to an active audience. Now with Discord channels, community surveys, live stream commentary, etc. we have expanded how we interact with our fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the beginning this show has remained completely free for our listeners/viewers. The podcast contains no ads (except for the few that youtube runs) and we haven\u0027t received any monetary value from it. Hosting the show costs around $10 a month and we have always worked at a loss. We do this because we love it and it gives us each an opportunity to decompress and chat about what we love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe launch of this Patreon is set up to primarily be a kind of tip jar in the hopes that you may help us make this show self sufficient. We come to you hat in hand. If you like the show and want to support it and help us improve then please do so. At the moment we don\u0027t have many patron bonuses but we are brainstorming and taking requests every day. For now, we just want to cover that $10, then we can really start exploring!"
