    "summary": "I discovered the Rust programming language in 2013 and have been active in the Rust community since 2014 under the nickname \u003cem\u003etomaka\u003c/em\u003e. I am convinced that the combination of safety and zero-cost abstractions makes the Rust programming language a language of the future! But for the moment many people only consider this language as \"promising\". What is the point of using a programming language if you can\u0027t do anything interesting with it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I have spent a large amount of efforts contributing to several Rust libraries and building my own. I have been contributing to Rust in my own way by helping build an ecosystem of libraries instead of directly contributing to the language or the compiler.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut doing so takes a lot of time. There is still a lot of work to do: safety holes to fix, tutorials to write, issues left unresolved. By contributing to this patreon, you would allow me to continue spending time on this work. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eMy projects\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://vulkano.rs/\"\u003eVulkano\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003cem\u003e~45k lines of code\u003c/em\u003e) is a safe wrapper around the Vulkan API. It is a low-level brick that allows you to interact with your GPU and execute graphical or compute (GPGPU) operations. Vulkano aims to be very explicit and predictable especially if you are familiar with the Vulkan API, but at the same time provide some high-level functionnalities. Ideal for building a game, a game engine, or a GPGPU application when performances and explicitness matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/glium/glium\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGlium\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (\u003cem\u003e~33k lines of code, unmaintained\u003c/em\u003e) is a safe wrapper around OpenGL and OpenGL ES. It aims to provide an easy-to-use high-level API while still remaining predictable and not hiding what it does. Even though many people have liked glium, its main goal of being safe was determined to be too difficult because of the many problems with OpenGL itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tomaka/android-rs-glue\"\u003eAndroid-rs-glue\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e allows you to easily turn your Rust code into an Android package. After installing the Android SDK and NDK, run the \u003cem\u003e`cargo apk\u003c/em\u003e` command and you will get an .apk file which you can then install on your device. Works out of the box with \u003cstrong\u003evulkano\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eglium\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ewinit\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eglutin\u003c/strong\u003e.

It allows you to create a basic window on Windows, Linux, MacOS and Android, then lets you handle the events received by this window. In order to show something on the window, you are supposed to create an OpenGL, Vulkan, or DirectX context on top of it, but this is not covered by winit itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tomaka/glutin\"\u003eGlutin\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003cem\u003e~7k lines of code\u003c/em\u003e) does the same as \u003cstrong\u003ewinit\u003c/strong\u003e, but creates an OpenGL context in a cross-platform way on top of the window. The \u003ca href=\"https://servo.org/\"\u003eservo\u003c/a\u003e project from Mozilla uses a fork of glutin for its own windowing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tomaka/rodio\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRodio\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a cross-platform high-level audio playback library.

Hlua provides a high-level easy-to-use API and handles the Lua stack for you. The library is heavily templated and should have a negligible runtime overhead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tomaka/rouille\"\u003eRouille\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a web framework backed by \u003cstrong\u003etiny-http\u003c/strong\u003e. Contrary to other Rust web frameworks, rouille lets you write borrow-checker-friendly Rust-code. For example additional parameters to pass to a route handler do not go through the framework but are simply passed as regular function parameters. Rouille is not as shiny-looking as other frameworks, but it should work just as well and is likely more intuitive to use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tomaka/immi\"\u003eImmi\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a utility toolkit if you want to create an immediate mode user interface.
