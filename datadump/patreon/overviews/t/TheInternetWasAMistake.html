I will be releasing one a month, every month, until it\u0027s done. These are the first five:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnd-User License Agreement \u003c/strong\u003e(a weird sci-fi thing that sets the tone for what I\u0027m doing here, available now to all backers!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTiny Justice\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e(a gory comedy about Twitter.

If you want to know what kind of stuff to expect, think Black Mirror as co-written by Douglas Adams and Stephen King while Cormac McCarthy shouts at them to make it darker and gorier and more cynical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen does this start? Right now, the first patron-only story is already up. As soon as you join, you can download and read everything on any e-reader. Once the collection is complete and I\u0027ve sufficiently freaked you out about how the internet works, I\u0027ll send every backer a complete, revised, and lovingly-polished e-book version of the entire collection including any art or extra features that get added along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn closing: See that part where I offhandedly joke about dying? Won\u0027t that seem really macabre and tasteless if I actually \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0die? If that does happen, don\u0027t worry -- like I said,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eyou only get charged when I make paid posts\u003c/strong\u003e, and I\u0027m the only one who knows the password to this account, so if I do die in the middle of this project you won\u0027t be bilked out of any extra dollars. But you also won\u0027t get any more stories, so let\u0027s all of us root for me to not die.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much! I hope you decide to be a part of this.\u003cbr\u003e"
