I am not an expert, just someone who has devoted time and energy to thinking about the difficult things.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCreating work that gives people hope is my passion. \u003cbr\u003eThe work I share on patreon will be gutsier and meatier than the words I publish on my blog. This is the place for testing new ideas and delving deeper into subjects I am excited about. This is where I will be sharing my bravest work. It could get messy and is probably not for the faint hearted. Throughout October and November you will be able to access a video series I have created exclusively for Patreon about cultivating the essential art of rest.\u003cbr\u003e\nSupporting me means becoming a co-creator in the further development of my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u0027d like to support me, engage in conversation and contribute with your ideas and stories about how to live in this broken but beautiful planet then I hope you will consider jumping on board.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBig love x"
