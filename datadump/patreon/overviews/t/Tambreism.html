After 30 years in the music business and managing 100\u2019s of musicians decided to go back to school to become a Life Coach Psychologist. I hold a Bachelors degree in Psychology, certification as a practitioner of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), and a graduate of Robbin\u2019s Madanes (RMT), 100 Core Strategic Intervention Life Coach training. I am obsessed with how the brain works and my curiosity in all aspects of psychology, sociology, philosophies, science, and the infinite possibilities of quantum physics posses me on a daily basis.

What I have found is all my life experience is something that other people are actually interested in, go figure. I have actually had people tell me they wished they had my life and that is crazy to me. I am a walking reality talk show on steroids, and what I have been through could span a full season on the Dr. Phil and the Jerry Springer show. With that said what I am here to accomplish is to share my knowledge and experience in hopes that it serves others in their own self-discovery and to think beyond what they feel is all there is. I hope to offer interesting points of view for others to contemplate and come to their own conclusions, to show different perspectives on enlightenment, how we create our own reality, and how to manipulate energy to create a life never imagined before. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u201cNo one saves us but ourselves.
