    "summary": "Sex in the dominant paradigm is everywhere and nowhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s used to sell everything from the quick fix to the endlessly unobtainable, but few of us can say the words vagina and penis in conversation with people other than our intimate partners without some awkwardness. And some of us can\u2019t say those words even to those we are sexually intimate with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDefault sex, for many of us, is characterised by the chasing and reaching of orgasm\u2026 it\u2019s as if as soon as we get naked a program switches on and takes over, and then we\u2019re driving (generally pretty quickly) towards this unspoken goal, which is also the measure of whether the sex was good or not. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe tend to connect with our partners primarily in the physical dimension, and act from the ego driven scripts we\u2019ve been conditioned by: do I look hot, did I please him, did I make her come, did I go for long enough?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCulturally, the landscape of sex remains unexamined and unconscious. Hidden in plain view by the workings of taboo, and at the same time sullied by a dirty industry which mines it for the creation of wealth few of us benefit from. Formed over a millennia or two of violence, and now marked by a minefield of political correctness, and a  approaching this landscape can be terrifying and triggering.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there is hope. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHope is you. \u003cbr\u003eAnd me. \u003cbr\u003eAnd him.\u003cbr\u003eAnd they. \u003cbr\u003eAnd her. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHope is the individual unit of culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a culture that tells you you\u2019re unlovable and unsexy because you don\u2019t look a certain way, that your only worth is based on your sexual attractiveness, or that you can only be sexual in certain ways at certain times with certain people, then the simplest act of self-love becomes the most rebellious and radical fuck you to the prison of someone else\u2019s ideas. These are the prisons we live within.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we address the culture around sexuality within ourselves, we create healthy cultures in our immediate relationships, within our families, our friendships, and within our wider social network. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe culture within emanates and affects the culture without.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis singular landscape which is common to each of us, the human body, has been stolen, desecrated, diminished, altered, shamed, shoulded, twisted, hidden, broken and burnt. It is the territory upon which all the wars have been fought, be they wars with guns or ideas, and it is also the landscape of sex. It\u2019s where we come from, it\u2019s what powers all endeavour. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is one manifestation of the universe in ongoing intercourse with itself. It is sacred. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that when the individual experiences sovereignty in the body, their body will lead them to sovereignty in life. The powerlessness that many of us feel in the world is an illusion, we have all the power of the body to claim sovereignty in the landscape that matters most, the landscape of our own body. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSex, the single most powerful act any of us are capable of, when consciously approached, understood, and honoured can become the means by which we do our most potent and necessary healing, of ourselves, and of one another. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s where we can hold space for ourselves to disarm the trauma, dismantle the weapons of self-loathing and soften into the exquisite surrender of wholeness and homecoming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Slow Sex Movement advocates for the individual to go within. Slowly. Gently. Lovingly. Creatively. Thoughtfully. Therapeutically. Artfully. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe aim to equip individuals with a series of embodiment tools for self-exploration as a means of dismantling and disarming the conditioning around sexuality that we have been subject to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn doing the deep embodiment work (which looks much more like play), we come into direct relationship with our own sexuality and simultaneously into a more immediate and whole expression of our individuality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is activism, and actualisation through sex. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSelf-focused initially, with a view to communion with our intimate partners.\u003cbr\u003e"
