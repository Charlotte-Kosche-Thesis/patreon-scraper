So, after leaving our day jobs in the dust, we began our own Patreon to live off of what we love doing best: podcasting about The Simpsons and our other favorite animated works of art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve already proven we can give shows like \u003cstrong\u003eThe Critic\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eDuckman \u003c/strong\u003ethe Talking Simpsons treatment, and with your help, we\u0027d love to make this operation grow! We want to cover more forgotten Simpsons history, interview more Simpsons veterans, and deconstruct other classic animated shows! And with your support, Bob and Henry can do Talking Simpsons full-time and make all that (and more) happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please, throw a few bucks a month in our direction, and not only will you get even more stuff on top of our continuing weekly podcast, we\u0027ll also continue our lifelong promise of delivering podcasts that go beyond cromulent to become groin-grabbingly good.\u003cbr\u003e"
