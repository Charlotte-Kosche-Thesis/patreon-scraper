    "summary": "I created\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thethoughtfulgamer.com\"\u003eThe Thoughtful Gamer\u003c/a\u003e to provide a high-quality board game reviews, strategy guides, and discussion about board game culture. Soon after beginning I started a bi-weekly\u003ca href=\"http://thethoughtfulgamer.com/category/podcast/\"\u003e podcast\u003c/a\u003e. Then I expanded that to include off-week podcast features. Now I even\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitch.tv/the_thoughtful_gamer\"\u003estream\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSpahg20BYnWr6jZDdtJO2Q\"\u003egames\u003c/a\u003e occasionally, and I\u0027m in the process of dipping my toes into the world of video reviews and how to play videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut at the core, I remain committed to what it says on the tin: a thoughtful, critical perspective of board games and the community around them. I think there\u0027s a lack of truly quality board game discussion and analysis out there, and I want to help fill that void. I want to become a trusted source for honest, optimistic, and critical reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Is This Money Going?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m looking for your help to improve the quality of The Thoughtful Gamer. I want to film and interview at PAX Unplugged and I need, at a minimum, to get a digital recorder to do that. I also want to improve my video and streaming capabilities. Your money will go directly to improving my equipment and making sure I can keep doing this in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s In It For You\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve lined up some awesome rewards for you all that I think you\u0027ll find enticing. At the base \"supporter\" tier I\u0027m giving you a peek behind the curtain. Watch all of our podcasts on live-stream. Snoop in my game group\u0027s board game spreadsheet and see all of our ratings and rankings for every game we own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the patron tier you get a say in what The Thoughtful Gamer produces. Vote in polls for what games I\u0027ll review next or what topics I\u0027ll cover. You\u0027ll also get to see the entire \"master folder\" where I store ideas and write all of my posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you want to be a producer, you get the ultimate recognition. A verbal shout out on the podcast and your name in the credits of every video. Plus after 6 months of producer-level support you get to collaborate with us. Want to talk about your favorite game on the podcast with us? We\u0027ll make it happen. Want to just chill and stream some digital games? We can do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most exciting part for me is that everyone will get access to an exclusive Discord server to chat about games. I plan on being very active there and post about what I\u0027ve been playing, what looks interesting in games news, and whatever\u0027s on my mind. It\u0027ll be an awesome community of board game fans!"
