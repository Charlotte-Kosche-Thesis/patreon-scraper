Thank you so much for checking out my Patreon page!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a psychedelic superhero is a full time job. I volunteer to do entheogenic emergence(y), and integration work at various festivals and events more or less continuously for like 9 months out of the year. I work with the Zendo Project, RGX Medical, DanceSafe and a few other truly incredible harm reduction/benefit enhancement collectives. None of which can afford to pay me a dime.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write a widely read column called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://erowid.org/columns/teafaerie/\"\u003eTeatime, Psychedelic Musings from the Center of the Universe\u003c/a\u003e for the excellent psychoactive information site\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://erowid.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eErowid.org\u003c/a\u003e. But they don\u0027t exactly pay me as such, either.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also been working on some important (and totally legal) 5-MeO-DMT research in Mexico, but I\u0027m just another space monkey who is only in it to win it. \u00a0It actually *costs* me to help advance evolution.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been working on a couple of books, which is hopefully the longer-term answer to how I can keep on playing my character in the world and still stay alive. They still aren\u0027t quite ready yet, though, and I am running full speed ahead towards the edge of a cliff. I\u0027m going to have to develop some sort of an interim strategy but quick or I\u0027m going to have to hang up my cape and get a regular job. Which would mean that I would have to stop helping festival goers turn their psychedelic breakdowns into epically triumphant breakthroughs! But that\u0027s where my particular talents lie and it\u0027s what I most love to do... And when your gifts happen to line up with your passion then you\u0027re supposed to keep at it, right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf only I could somehow get sponsored or have a patron like artists sometimes had in the renaissance... Oh hey wait! What about that Patreon thing that everybody keeps telling me about? I used to make inspirational videos all the time! I made one every day for a year in like 2007. Some of them were pretty terrific, too! I almost have a million hits on my YouTube. Which isn\u0027t *a lot*, but I do have a whole bunch of followers. Or I used to. And I know that I could make even better videos now that I\u0027m a whole decade more awesome.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome play my new game with me! I\u0027ll make you laugh and think and I will occasionally fill you with wonder, and you can help me to keep on being a superhero. You also get to vicariously help out hundreds of lost trippers at festivals and support some fairly promising psychedelic research. It\u0027s like an orgy of win!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udcb0\u2615\ufe0f\ud83e\udd33\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udcef\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease pass this on if you can think of anybody else who might want to participate! Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e*bows, salutes, blows Teahorn*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
