Ive traveled through over 60 countries as I was on tour and Ive seen so many stray dogs and over the years I noticed that in many countries they have stared to kill the stray dogs instead of finding a place for them to be safe. I want to change that for at least as many dogs the home and the financial budget can handle and I hope that with your help we make this happen.\u003cbr\u003eI hope I didn\u0027t write too much here.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTony",
