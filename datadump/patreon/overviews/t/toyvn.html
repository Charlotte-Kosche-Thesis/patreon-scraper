    "summary": "Hey everyone! My name is John Valentin (aka MoonStar) and you\u2019re probably wondering why I\u2019m here on Patreon. Well like many of you, I\u2019m a huge fan of video games and visual novels, and over the last year I\u2019ve been working on developing one, it\u2019s called \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTears of Y\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eggdrasil\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things I wanted to do was make a game that really broke away from your traditional romance story set in a Japanese high school. So I asked myself, what if we went away from that, and mixed in Norse mythology? And that\u2019s where \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTears of \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYggdrasil\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e was born (at least mentally).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe World Tree is dying, and your character is pulled into this world to save it. You have to journey through all of the different branches, from our world in Midgard to the highest branch of Asgard, and down to the lowest branch of Muspelheim. Each world has a different problem facing it, and only by uniting all of them, can you save the world tree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy Patreon\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo why am I on Patreon? Well to be entirely honest, I\u2019ve reached the end\n of my limited funding. I\u2019m more of a writer than an artist, and if I \nwant to move forward with the game, I\u2019m going to need to get the art up \nto a good standard. The money from Patreon will go towards producing \nmore art for the game, and eventually bringing it to a level where it \ncould go on Steam!\u003cbr\u003eSo please support Tears of \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYggdrasil\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and let\u2019s make something great together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eDownload\u003c/h1\u003eYou can download the Windows/Mac/Linux of the current build from \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://moonstar.itch.io/-yggdrasil\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eItch.io\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Or \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://yggdrasil.vnovel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour site\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eVisualNovel Description\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://image.prntscr.com/image/35de03c2f9154d65aaa881c7c4b01093.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCharacters\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eYamakazi Kusanagi\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://orig01.deviantart.net/5f69/f/2016/065/3/e/yamakazi_kusanagi__updated__by_moonsttar-d9l6imy.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig01.deviantart.net/5f69/f/2016/065/3/e/yamakazi_kusanagi__updated__by_moonsttar-d9l6imy.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKusanagi is a lazy ass pervert with a kind heart even if he dreams to \u003cbr\u003ehave his own harem of girls at his feet.
