I wrote primarily on tabletop roleplaying games such as \u003cem\u003eDungeons \u0026amp; Dragons\u003c/em\u003e from my perspective as a licensed psychologist.\u00a0I\u0027ve been writing about \u003cem\u003eD\u0026amp;D\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand other gaming adventures for over five years now, and I invested a good deal of time and energy to interview prominent members of the RPG community such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://theiddm.wordpress.com/2012/06/15/ego-check-monte-cook-game-designer-author/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMonte Cook\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://theiddm.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/ego-check-mike-mearls-senior-manager-of-dungeons-dragons-research-and-design-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMike Mearls\u003c/a\u003e. I was fortunate enough to win Stuffer Shack\u2019s 2012 RPG Site of The Year award, and have grown a nice following to my blog and Twitter feed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDuring the past year, I expanded the scope of the content I offer through The Id DM, including a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://theiddm.wordpress.com/2015/09/04/life-death-love-and-star-wars/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epersonal history of my relation to the \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e franchise\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://theiddm.wordpress.com/category/hearthstone/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003evideos about the collectible card game, \u003cem\u003eHearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. I want to put more time into the creation of gaming articles and videos in addition to launching into some new areas, such as streaming and podcasting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese ideas will take time and resources, and I am honestly unsure if there is a sufficient audience for my content.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhich is why we\u0027re here! \n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 67, 16);\"\u003ePatreon\u003c/span\u003e is a platform that allows YOU to pledge a dollar amount of your choice each month in return for rewards. If you support my efforts with a pledge, then it is tangible feedback that someone is out there enjoying the content I create! And as more people pledge, I\u0027ll be able to hit my milestone goals to do more dynamic things like host an interview podcast series and stream games while fielding questions from viewers on all manner of subjects on gaming and psychology! This dates me, but I foresee a world where I\u0027m the Frasier Crane (or Dr. Drew perhaps for those of you that are younger than me) of gaming.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now I\u0027m aiming to post one article or video per week, and with my milestone goals I\u0027ll be able to increase that output. All of the money pledged will go directly into the creation of new content along with better equipment and improved Internet access so I can do things like podcast and steam games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited to see what we can turn this into! As a creator, I thrive on feedback, so please contact me with ideas or questions. Thank you for your time and consideration. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sincerely appreciate your time and support!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
