    "summary": "First things first, thank you for being here. The fact you\u0027re even looking at our Patreon at all \u2013 never mind actually funding us \u2013 is amazing and we\u0027re very pleased to see you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSo, what\u0027s this all about?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.thumbsticks.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThumbsticks\u003c/a\u003e is an independent UK website, with the goal of creating interesting articles about video games. Whether we\u0027re working hard to bring you the latest news or reviews, or putting together in-depth features or sizzling opinion, we try to keep it interesting and work tirelessly on quality control. In the age of disposable blogging and angry people shouting on YouTube, there isn\u0027t a great deal of top-notch, magazine-style coverage of video games to go around.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that\u0027s where Thumbsticks comes in. Here are just a few of our favourite pieces:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.thumbsticks.com/wonder-fear-radio-video-games/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.thumbsticks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Thumbsticks-radio-thumbnail.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.thumbsticks.com/imaginary-real-places-forza-horizon-and-the-american-open-road/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.thumbsticks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Thumbsticks-forza-horizon-thumbnail.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.thumbsticks.com/pessimistic-post-apocalypse/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.thumbsticks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Thumbsticks-post-apocalypse-thumbnail.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat \n\u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e makes Thumbsticks work is the team behind it, though. Our notional goal is interesting articles about video games, but the focus is on nurturing new talent and offering opportunities to aspiring writers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe like to think we do a good job of it, too. A number of our alum have gone on to do amazing things, including the Editor-in-Chief of a well-known games magazine and an Associate Editor of a global tech site, with others embarking on exciting and varied freelance writing careers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSo why Patreon, then, if it\u0027s all going so well?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGlobal ad revenues are dropping and Thumbsticks is no exception. With the prevalence of ad-blocking technology \u2013 particularly in a tech-savvy market segment like video games \u2013 and the overall downward trend in online advertising, it\u0027s really starting to bite. Ad revenue \n\u003cem\u003ejust about\u003c/em\u003e covers hosting the site and other ancillary costs, but we no longer earn enough to operate a proper freelance budget.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that\u0027s not just hurting Thumbsticks. More important than that, it\u0027s hurting aspiring freelance writers, and that\u0027s what we \n\u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e care about.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eAnd what\u0027s in it for supporters?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you pledge a little (or a lot) we\u0027ll obviously be eternally grateful, but crucially, you\u0027ll be investing in the future of quality games journalism and of freelance writers. All of the money we make from Patreon \u2013 every single penny \u2013 will be poured straight back into the site and that all-important freelance budget. Ultimately that will increase the output of Thumbsticks which is great for you guys, the readers, but it will help give new and aspiring freelance writers a start, which is the essential thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOh, and you\u0027ll get exclusive access to our Discord, and to behind-the-scenes, patron-only content here on Patreon. You\u0027ll also have our blessing for using an ad blocker, of course, if that\u0027s how you roll.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf the site earns enough we\u0027d love to start hiring some full-time staff, and producing books and magazines (which backers would receive), but let\u0027s take things one step at a time. Thanks again for reading, both the site and our Patreon, and thank you for your support."
