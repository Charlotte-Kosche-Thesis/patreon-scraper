As a teenager still in school, monetary support of my channel is a big factor that helps to determine how much time I can really dedicate to PetTube. Your monthly contribution allows me to have more time and funds to do things I wasn\u0027t able to before, such as getting a better filming camera, more efficient software, bigger enclosures for my animals, and even build a dedicated pet room if we get far enough ;) [Currently, Patreon funds have allowed me to upgrade editing software for more efficient workflow] You\u0027re assisting me in doing things as simple as caring for my pets each day and being able to dedicate more time towards creating content for you, to things as huge as going to animal-related events that are out of state and taking you with me through video! Most importantly and as always,\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eyou\u0027re allowing me to continue helping people who want to take better care of their animals.\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn return for your support, you get access to some awesome rewards - from exclusive content and a private community, to free merchandise and behind-the-scenes of my videos. If you change your mind or can no longer support me, you can change pledge amounts or cancel at any time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you do choose to support me, I encourage you to find 2 other pet youtubers and support them as well.
