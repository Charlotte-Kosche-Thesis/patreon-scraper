I\u0027ve spent the past few years building up a following, and I am incredibly grateful for everything I have been able to achieve. Rest assured, you don\u0027t have to pledge to continue seeing content from me! I will still be regularly updating my facebook and youtube with new content! This platform is specifically for those who feel like supporting me and if want some exclusive content as a reward!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI first started cosplaying all the way back in 2008 and ...whew. That was interesting. I have been incredibly lucky to continue to pursue this hobby and I have learned so much through the years! I never thought, when I first made Pai from Tokyo Mew Mew, that one day I would be able to work as a cosplay guest at cons and continue growing my craft, as well as become a sort of Body Positive cosplay ambassador in my little corner of the earth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, onto the other parts of this page! \u003cbr\u003eAfter years of longing after beautiful gaming PCs and shiny camera, I was finally able to procure everything I needed to start my own youtube channel! It\u0027s been a year of let\u0027s play, social commentary vlogs, cosplay tutorials and general buffoonery, and I\u0027m so excited for what the future will hold!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout this Patreon:\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who have been craving more content than my very tight schedule currently provides, this is a way to support me and ensure that you get all of the good stuff you\u0027re looking for! So, if you want early access and behind the scenes looks at the games I\u0027m working on, exclusive photoshoots, and videos, this is for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, my deepest, most sincere thanks to everyone who decided to take their time supporting me, either with comments, likes, subscriptions, views or even on here! Everything is hugely appreciated and I will never take it for granted!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Orders will not be shipped out until after the first week of the following month, after Patreon has processed all payments. \u00a0Any Fansigns for you lovely folk will be uploaded to Dropbox where you can search for your individual sign. The access link will be posted during the last week of the month, and you will have until the first week of the following month to download it. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, the part you\u0027ve been waiting for....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE GOODIES:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eFan Signs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003ePatrons will be able to vote on which costume they want me to make these handwritten notes in. Majority wins, of course. These are unique and personal notes that are fun and you will be able to download them for each month you are a member of my Potato Kingdom!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eCome Behind the Scenes with Me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eWhile I try to maintain some level of transparency across all my work, there\u0027s definitely a lot that\u0027s still under wraps or behind closed doors. With this, you\u0027ll get to see the fun -and sometime arduous- process of making the things I do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eExclusive Video for Patrons Only!\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003eNormally I release four videos a week.
