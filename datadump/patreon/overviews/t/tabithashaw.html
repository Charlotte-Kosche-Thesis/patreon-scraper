Patreon supporters will be given priority in: making suggestions for future art content, sending in \u0027asks\u0027 to a brand new \"Ask Tabby\" column on my blog (with an emphasis on asking increasingly ridiculous questions), you will also have free access to any tutorials, resources, or workshops that I create - which everyone else will have to pay for! Haha, sucks to be those plebs! Essentially - supporting me through patreon makes you a part of my team, and together we will create an empire and take over the world! haha! Just kidding ^-^ (..... maybe). \u003cstrong\u003eYou will also be my friend. \u003c/strong\u003eLegit, I need more supportive friends and if y\u0027all wanna support me with a big shiny dollar - we friends now. Let\u0027s snapchat each other pictures of our multiple chins.
