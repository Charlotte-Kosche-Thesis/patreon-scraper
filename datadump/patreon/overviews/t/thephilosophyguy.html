    "summary": "Hello everyone The Philosophy Guy here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Philosophy Guy is a philosophy podcast by a guy trying to understand the philosophical questions of our time. Attempting to make philosophy accessible and applicable to the real world. The podcast discusses ethics, morality, political philosophy, self-improvement, philosophy movies, philosophical dilemmas, culture, current events and anything else about understanding life through the lens of philosophy. Each episode guarantees one thing...it will be about philosophy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal for the podcast is to provide content about the many ideas in philosophy and where they occur. Including in your everyday life through politics, society, the movies you watch, TV shows. Philosophy is everywhere and my goal is working on understanding those\u00a0ideas all around us. In understanding those ideas, I don\u0027t mean merely understanding the ideas, instead applying them in your life. Even if you disagree with various ideas in philosophy there\u0027s always something to be learned from them and applied to your everyday life. My goal is to discover the nuggets of information from great thinkers and ideas that can help us understand life and live a better one in return.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere will the funds go? Well, the first round of support will help cover the expenses for maintaining the podcast and website. With more support, I will have the means to dedicate more time to the podcast, and with even more support I will be able to use the funds to help pay my everyday bills that come with young adulthood, fun fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are intrigued by the goal of the podcast or have enjoyed it so far I would greatly appreciate your support! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWubba lubba dub dub,\u003cbr\u003eThe Philosophy Guy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-philosophy-guy/id1223788267?mt=2\"\u003ehttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-philosoph...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebsite: \u003ca href=\"https://thephilosophyguy.fireside.fm/\"\u003ehttps://thephilosophyguy.fireside.fm/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
