    "summary": "Welcome everyone! I\u0027m Tamashii Hiroka, a Pokemon-loving-girl who makes YouTube videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have had a long and storied history of making videos on YouTube, and am most well known for my videos featuring commentary on the Pokemon series of games and franchise for the past 10 years. As I\u0027ve grown up I\u0027ve wanted to expand my content to include a wider variety of topics, and in the last year I finally took the plunge and took my channel in a different direction. These days I\u0027m making gaming reviews of titles from my childhood, with a fun cinematic format that takes you along on my personal journey with the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zaFDbmn6lfo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was a big risk to depart from what I\u0027ve built my career around for the past decade, and ultimately though this content is more fulfilling in creative ways and is forcing me to learn and perfect my craft like never before, it\u0027s less financially viable, and I can no longer support myself on ad revenue alone. So that\u0027s where you come in! If you are interested in helping me continue to make these videos, please consider supporting me here on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow is this gonna work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos are complicated and take a decent chunk of time to complete. Since my release schedule is somewhat slow, with a new video every 3 weeks, I\u0027ve decided to base pledges on a per-video basis, so that you don\u0027t end up getting charged if I don\u0027t manage to upload anything. Within the settings on your own Patreon account, you can cap your donations so that if for example I end up uploading multiple videos at once, you only get charged for $2 worth anyway. I\u0027ve created some very simple rewards to start out with, but I have lots of ideas for adding more and am open to your feedback. Please check out the reward tier on the side bar for more info!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you from the bottom of my heart.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI realize I am not owed a living making videos, and I am incredibly lucky to have been able to make it this far. I would absolutely not be here if it were not for what you have all already done for me, so I hope you know how sincerely I appreciate your support. YouTube has saved my life and given me a home, and it means a lot to me that you\u0027re willing to help me keep doing what I love for however much longer I can do this. I will put my all into everything I make and I will not let you down. I hope that you enjoy the show and that you enjoy being a part of this journey with me.\u003cbr\u003e"
