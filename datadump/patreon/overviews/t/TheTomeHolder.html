    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTears of a Forgotten Paladin is a tragic tale about two oath sworn paladins that fall from grace and into the enchantment of sin and shadow.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreetings. My name is Svafnir and I am the writer and illustrator behind this project. Tears is a culmination of all of my creative passions and discipline. I have poured the entirety of myself into this endeavor and will continue to challenge and improve my skill as this project grows.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been working on Tears for a year and a half and have kept a schedule while doing so. There are few things that make me happier in this world than spending my Saturday nights curled up in front of my desk with tea in one hand and a pen in the other. Working on Tears has been a truly great experience that has brought upon a lot of personal growth in the most positive way possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now we get to the part where you ask\u003cem\u003e \"Ayyo, Svuff! Why you make this page tho??\"\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll tell you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, I struggle when it comes to finishing things that mean a lot to me. I am a \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e harsh critic of my work and I am always looking for a more fine tuned way to execute an illustration or a story. While this leaves me with work I can be proud of when I am finished, I go through quite a few drafts and revisions and a lot of it ends up in the trash, never to see the light of day. There have been a lot of projects that I have entirely scrapped because they are not up to my (super-hyper-critical-unrealistic) personal standards.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Tears has been different.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe time I have spent working on Tears is the longest that I have pursued an idea to completion. There has been so much of this project that has been reworked, re-imagined, redrawn and redone but I haven\u0027t given up. I won\u0027t give up. I \u003cem\u003ecannot \u003c/em\u003egive up. This is the story that I must tell and I feel so strongly about it that I lack the ability to abandon it like I have things in the past. Though the road becomes perilous, I will remain steadfast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTL;DR: \u003c/strong\u003eI have created this page so that I may share with you one of the reasons that I get out of bed in the morning. I created this page so that you can be a part of this journey along side me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you would like,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you care to enter the Sanctum of the Jade Falcon by my side, oh valiant hero?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
