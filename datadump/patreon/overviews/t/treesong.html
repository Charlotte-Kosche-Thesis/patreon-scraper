When I went to college, I got involved in community activism and spent about a decade neglecting my writing career. For the past few years, though, I\u0027ve been creating a growing body of work that combines my interests in speculative fiction (sci-fi, fantasy, superheroes, etc.) with my concerns for environmental and social justice (especially global warming).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support as a patron will help me to create more content and better content. The more support I get, the more time I\u0027ll spend on my writing. This will improve both the quantity and quality of my writing. It will also encourage me to continue and expand my work as a \"Real Life Superhero\" -- serving my community and region through various volunteer efforts with an emphasis on climate justice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also looking forward to receiving more direct feedback from my patrons about what you appreciate in my writing and what you\u0027re looking for in future works! I already get some feedback like this from personal discussion and social networking, but sharing my work through Patreon will expand and deepen that conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support! If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. I always enjoy talking with my readers and am especially looking forward to talking with my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e"
