Patreon-support is obviously completely optional and I will keep pumping out content for free, regardless! This is a completely pledge pressure free environment!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, Patreon is super easy to set up! And even easier to shut down if you ever change your mind! Every pledge amount helps, as we all know.. it\u0027s not about the size of the pledge, it\u0027s how you use it that matters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut yes, that\u0027s basically all there is, if you feel this sounds good I would really appreciate you signing up and pledging whatever you feel like and I will do my best to keep creating content, every single week! That\u0027s my promise, and one day perhaps the channel is something that stands out from the crowd! See YA\u0027LL on Youtube!\u003cbr\u003e"
