Also, you won\u0027t be charged for April as I have temporarilpaused the campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreetings! Tiger here, the one-man \u003cdel\u003elazy\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0developer behind Cytoid. I\u0027ll skip Cytoid\u0027s background story here\u2014head to our \u003ca href=\"http://github.com/TigerHix/Cytoid\"\u003eGitHub page\u003c/a\u003e for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I wrote the game and its level sharing site\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cytoid.io\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCytoidIO\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0it\u0027s actually \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e who gave the birth to Cytoid. After all, without your enthusiasm (800+ levels in half a year!), Glow Dance would be the only Cytoid song out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\u00a0mission, then, is to support the community. I\u0027ve always wanted to make charting more accessible for creators: for starters, how about a built-in level editor that runs on the phone? As for players, there\u0027re plans for leaderboards and real-time PvP\u2014in fact, leaderboards should be soon available in late February.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u0027m looking forward to your contribution. If you\u0027re an Unity developer, join me on GitHub! If you\u0027re a charter, design hardcore charts to torture the players! (Okay. Please don\u0027t.) But since this page involves money, let\u0027s talk about financial stuff. Simply put, the game gets popular \u2192 server costs become higher \u2192 poor developer goes broke \u2192 Cytoid dies. Or not\u2014if some of the expenses could be covered by people who appreciate Cytoid so much that they\u0027re willing to throw money at me. \u003cem\u003eHint: you can do that by clicking that big orange button up there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, chances are you\u0027re\u00a0just that kind-hearted person who wants to buy me a coffee\u2014and that\u0027s nice! Actually, simply leaving a 5-star review on App Store already means a lot to me. Any tiny support would motivate me to work on Cytoid for another day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, regardless of you becoming a patreon or not, thank you for reading, and until next time!"
