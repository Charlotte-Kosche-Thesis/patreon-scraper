    "summary": "Hello and thank you for visiting my Patreon! My name is Exuro and I work tirelessly to make the Flow Arts and Juggling world as great as they can be. Read all about why you should consider supporting me and my projects below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I regularly produce flow arts and juggling content via instagram, facebook, and youtube, and have been producing content for 10 years. The videos I have produced have collectively garnered around 1 million views across the three platforms, for which I\u0027ve earned less than $1 in ad payments. I really enjoy producing content and have done projects such as 100 Days of Juggling, the #sticktrick series, collaboration videos, and more. You can see in my goals that I would love to purchase a new camera to create higher definition material for both those platforms and for here on Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I serve on the Board of Directors for the International Jugglers\u0027 Association. This is a volunteer position and is unpaid. In addition to regular meetings wherein we decide how to conduct the business of the IJA, I am working to assist in the creation and delivery of programs that make real world impacts for jugglers across the globe. More information on the specific programs I am helping with will become available in 2018 as those programs roll out. This position requires me to travel to the IJA festival each year that I am on the board, which is an out of pocket expense. Your contributions here will help me to make that happen, and allow me to better fulfill the IJA\u0027s mission \"to render assistance to fellow jugglers\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I host the Top 40 Flow Artists public voting program. 2017 is the first year I have hosted this. After watching the Top 40 Jugglers and Top 10 Poi Spinners compilations for a few years now, I decided to take initiative to create the Top 40 Flow Artists. The results video is being released in the first week of January 2018. This project is intended to promote those that do important work or make an impact in the Flow Arts community in hopes of elevating those that do good. All glory to those that do work for those around them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I conduct independent research on frameworks for object manipulation. Currently I am preparing material for Chapter 4 of the Vulcan Tech Gospel, in which the juggling notation of siteswap is integrated into the flow arts notation of timing and direction. I have previously researched and presented frameworks for poi, contact staff, partner contact staff, double staff, triple staff juggling, levitation wand, wallplane throws, meteor spinning, and fire manipulation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I present research, lead workshops, and perform at flow arts and juggling festivals around the USA and Europe. As of early 2018, I have led courses in 27 states and 8 countries. As these are still somewhat budding subcultures, many of the events that seek my expertise can offer little or no pay. For many years, I worked a day job and was able to spend that income on performing this work for the flow arts and juggling community. Now I am a \"full time\" flow artist and juggler, and my income is not as reliable as it was when working for the man. Contributions through Patreon will afford me the opportunity to attend some events in 2018 that would not be able to otherwise afford to have me present, so that I can bring my expertise to areas in need\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I have served key organizational positions for a number of flow festivals. These events often turn little or no profit, and so much of this work has been volunteer based. These events include Kinetic Fire, CampFire, MinneFLOWta, Florida Flow Fest, Midwest Flow Fest, Northwest Flow Fest, and Texas Flow Fest. I further volunteer my time on location at all other events I am present for. My work in these events has helped to elevate payment standards across the board for flow arts educators looking to be involved in the flow arts festival culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- I provide LED equipment repair. I provide official repair work on gear from Pyroterra Lighttoys, and unofficial repair work on gear from a number of other companies that manufacture LED products. Through this I have helped more than 250 performers who have had equipment failure of some kind. This has been my main source of income for 2017, but it is not enough to make all ends meet for me. Your contribution here will help ensure I can provide this type of help for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e"
