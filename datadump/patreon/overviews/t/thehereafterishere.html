Season One of Audiodes contains 14 Audiodes and concluded in March 2016 with \"21st Century Bicycle,\" a concept album about computers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeason Two launches in 2016 with an October Surprise! \"It Doesn\u0027t Matter: Volume 3\" is the 15th Audiode. This is the third installment of my quadrennial, nonpartisan, unaffiliated, American song cycle saga.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is an Audiode? \u003cbr\u003eAn Audiode is an Audio Ode. \u003cbr\u003ePart podcast, part travelogue, part AM talk radio show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat was the idea back in 2014, anyway, but it has become so much more! Audiode Six was an acoustic rendering of the entire \"Good Goodbyes\" album, for example. You can listen to that right away when you join Audiodes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can choose to pay whatever you want per Audiode. Any amount is appreciated. You can get Audiodes for as little as $1 per Audiode. That is a GOOD DEAL. If you can afford more, share more.\u00a0Audiodes come out almost monthly while a season is rolling, but sometimes I miss a month or two. It is a lot of work to make an Audiode. They are worth more than $1.\u00a0It\u2019s easy to cancel or change your subscription at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

Asked for influences, he creates a guest list to one amazing dinner party: Bruce Springsteen, Guns \u2018N Roses, Michael Jackson, Wilco, Radiohead, and fellow Minnesota native Bob Dylan all passing the hot dish.\u00a0John\u2019s songs have been heard in movies, on network and cable television, on iPods, in cars, on radios, and around campfires. He has performed on several continents and in 49 of the 50 United States. He has been\u00a0releasing albums on Garland Lane, his\u00a0own label, for over a decade to an\u00a0always growing number of listeners. He\u00a0remains an unsigned and unaffiliated artist and he is proud of that fact. He continues to make a living and build a dedicated following the old fashioned way: one new believer at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
