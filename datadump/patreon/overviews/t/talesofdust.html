    "summary": "If all life is a journey, then there are times when I fear taking the first step. It\u0027s almost as if I\u0027m afraid to lose my way back, to lose those experiences I\u0027ve already acquired. In perspective, this is like being afraid to stubbing your toe on your first\u00a0 trip to another continent and by being afraid cancelling the trip completely. In a way I suppose this is what, at times, keeps me from the adventures that surround new experiences. It is a fear that I think everyone shares, a base fear, a fear of the unknown. However I believe this struggle against ourselves that is the prime contribute to our personal growth. By surviving the fear we prove we can master it and overcome it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA friend once referred to life as climbing a mountain. We struggle towards the peak, worrying if each step we take will support our weight, aide us in the climb higher. Only once we get to the peak do we know that the mountain was not as tall as we thought it was from it\u0027s base. For once we summit these mountains we find much larger stone giants laying in their wake. Now I ask you to look at all the peaks you have summited in your life, count them for too few times do we remember what we have accomplished. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo as I wrestle with the base fear of the unknown and stare upwards towards the next peak, on which the goal of becoming a professional storyteller lies, I ask you to join me. As I embark on this journey I hope you will help with your constructive criticism, comments and new ideas. I ask that you help pick me up when I\u0027m down and help me to summit and, in the future, surpass this giant that is currently sitting before me. I hope as well you enjoy\u00a0 the stories I tell along the way because in the end no story is a good story without a listener.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI will update here weekly on Saturday evenings so please keep and eye out otherwise visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.talesofdust.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e to see Tales of Dust take shape. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"

In this fantasy setting I am trying to make a place which is as vibrant and diverse as our own. Using my love of the fantasy genre as well as including a variety of different mediums to tell a large amount of stories and give a feeling of a land much larger then is being told. With time, I hope the project will include everything from music and poetry, to videos and webcomics. However for the time being most of my time is spend woking on the flagship webcomic I refer to as Burden of Tears.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to support me in this venture please think about contributing at least a dollar and help me in making this world a reality for readers and other future fans alike. \u003cbr\u003e",
