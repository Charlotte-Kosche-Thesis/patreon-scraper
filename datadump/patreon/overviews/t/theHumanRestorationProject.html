Everything you do for us allows for progressive education to continually be pushed for, reimagined, and instituted.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month at the Human Restoration Project, we release four podcasts, one major project for students, and two reflective development booklets for educators (to develop best practice), as well as various blogs, infographics, videos, and other resources. If you haven\u0027t already, \u003ca href=\"http://humanrestorationproject.org/\"\u003echeck out our website\u003c/a\u003e to see what we\u0027re doing - we think you\u0027ll like it! Your patronage allows us to continue to make these resources - and, with enough support, will allow us to focus even more of our time towards enacting best practice in every classroom!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e_____\u003c/div\u003eHello, and welcome to the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.humanrestorationproject.org/\"\u003eHuman Restoration Project\u003c/a\u003e! I (Michael) am a co-founder along side my compatriot Chris. For the past 5 years, Chris and I have been teaching humanities (history and English, respectively), at the high school level. While we do teach at a fairly progressive school, \u003ca href=\"http://humanrestorationproject.org/images/pointerpatreon.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003ewe find ourselves often times feeling quite stifled by the traditional public model. Because of this, and with copious research, we try - each year - to push boundaries and reform education as much as we can without stepping on (too many) toes. While each year we have pushed further with constant success, attempting to remind students, fellow teachers, administration (and one another), that we are all human beings, this remains housed in our microcosm of the classroom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor months on end, Chris and I have been developing HRP in our very limited free time. By day, we remain radical educators attempting to reform public education (one classroom at a time), and by night, we are the creators and clients of HRP. Because we are fully aware that there are many complaints regarding the traditional public education model (as there should be), we wanted to be sure our project focused on possible solutions as well. It is one thing to find solace in others (i.e., misery loves company), but it is something else to find this companionship filled with a multitude of potential solutions. Our children have slowly (and surely) been dehumanized in this traditional system, and it is our goal to prepare students, teachers, parents, administrators, and the like for restoration. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHRP is designed to not simply be a place to find researched materials or thoughtful podcasts; it is designed to be a movement. Chris and I want HRP to spread like wildfire, and for that to happen we want to be sure we are keeping all those who subscribe and become involved prepped and ready. If you want topical and engaging dialogues for your car rides, we have podcasts - often times with guests in the realm of progressive education. If you want proof that what we are suggesting (at any given point in time) is best practice, we\u2019ve done the heavy lifting and filled the site with copious research links to up to date, peer reviewed work and literature. If you feel inadequately prepared to reform, we offer resources loaded with original content ranging from student/teacher/admin materials, guides, readings, and more to help you proceed on your journey with a sense of camaraderie. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat should basically sum things up. We are here to reform education and restore our students (and our own) humanity! Now, \u003cstrong\u003elet\u2019s go save the world\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e"
