So many of you have expressed interest in supporting the channel, and I\u0027m finally giving you that opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon campaign is simple - to reduce my dependence on ad revenue. To create a more direct relationship between myself, the creator of Trainer Tips content, and you, the viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I get paid by AdSense based on how many people watch ads on my videos. Essentially, someone tries to sell things to my audience before every video they watch. That doesn\u0027t sit right with me. I would much rather have my income come directly from the people who enjoy my content, rather than some company trying to take advantage of our time spent together each day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for every $1000 per month that you, the audience, pledge through this Patreon page, I\u0027m going to remove ads from one video per month. $1000 is certainly more than the average video earns in ad revenue, but I need to leave room for growth as the views on the channel increase and ad revenue increases with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the reward. Ad-free content. No one trying to get between you and I every day as I share what I\u0027ve created for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course I\u0027ll turn to you, the patrons, first when planning trips and content for the channel. As direct supporters of the content being created, you\u0027ll have a say in what comes next. Through the Patron-only feed, we\u0027ll discuss upcoming ideas and I\u0027ll take all your feedback into consideration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support thus far, and I look forward to taking this next leap into the brave new world of ad-free content with you all!"
