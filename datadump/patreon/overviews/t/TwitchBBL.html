We don`t need the money but its greatly appreciated and even the smallest donation goes a long way.\u00a0 We would not ask you for money to play in this league now, or at any point in the future.\u00a0 TBBL will always be here as a free to play environment.\u00a0 However, any support you can offer us is greatly appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince you`re still here, let me explain what we are doing and how you can help us with that through patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the release of BB2, the Twitch BB community has grown into a solid group, with regular streamers and many regular viewers who frequently watch multiple, if not all, of the different streams. Our aim is to create an environment that helps to bring the Twitch Blood Bowl streams together to create one big community in a competitive environment, where everyone can play Blood Bowl the way it is meant to be played, at least in our view, in a round-robin based league-system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Twitch Blood Bowl community is an awesome crowd. There is always someone streaming and people in the chat are great fun, polite and good looking.^^\u003cbr\u003eIn our efforts to make the league a good experience for everyone it sometimes keeps us up till very late in the night. There is a lot to be done and a lot to be discussed but having those discussions and working on our current or future projects can be fun and exciting as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny contributions will be put straight back into the league.\u00a0 So towards web hosting, prizes and any other league costs.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
