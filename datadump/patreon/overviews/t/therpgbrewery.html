    "summary": "The RPG Brewery is a show that focuses mostly on actual plays of tabletop roleplaying games. The main focus is to play as many systems as I can to give you, the viewer, a chance to see the games being played and hopefully give you a better bit of information about the systems before you buy them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there\u0027s more- I also bring on various guests from the industry to talk about their products and get more information about them so that we all get a better understanding of these games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you help support the show?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTabletop roleplaying is my favorite hobby by far and it\u0027s something I\u0027m quite glad to bring to everyone. I put a lot of time and effort into this show and am always looking for ways to improve. To keep the ability to keep trying new games takes money, and this is where you come in. Just slingning a couple of bucks this way helps a lot to be able to continue to purchase these products to be able to play them to get that information to all of you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for your support and help spread the word!"
