    "summary": "Hi! My name is Eric and I want to thank you for checking out my page :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout one year ago, a subscriber had asked me if I had any way for them to repay me to show their appreciation and gratitude for how hard I work on putting out videos and live streams. At the time, I had a full time construction job and I was living with my girlfriend. This left me with very little time to be able to interact and communicate with my subscribers and viewers. On top of that, my girlfriend was always home and I had very little time to record with peace and quiet :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell time had passed and my channel started taking off. It was growing so much that I started focusing on my channel more than my actual construction job. I realized that in order for me to be able to continue growing my channel, that I would have to work less at my job and put more work and time into my channel. Everything was amazing at 1st... Until all of a sudden my channel revenue started dropping almost in half..! This happened due to the reduction of ad prices after Christmas.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShortly after that my girlfriend broke up with me and moved out. Now I have to pay the entire rent and bills by myself and meanwhile my channel is still growing while my ad rates are still low. Now don\u0027t me wrong, before Christmas my channel\u0027s revenue was really good... However, every single amount of revenue that I received from my channel went right back into my channel. At the time I was still able to pay all my bills with my construction job so all of my youtube revenue went into upgrading my channel. I went from a gaming laptop to a desktop, then I got a monitor, keyboard, mouse, headset, microphone,and finally a webcam. This left me with very little extra income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my channel because I love being able to make videos that make people feel good and I wanted to be able to talk to people who have similar interests in the outdoors. With out you, there would have been very little motivation to keep going every day. You are the reason I get to wake up every morning and get to make amazing content! You are the reason that my channel has gone this far and continues to grow every single day! Thank You :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to spread cheer and positive energy to every single hunter, gamer or just someone who likes to watch my videos. Eventually I really want to be able to incorporate some real life hunting and fishing videos and make them the best that I can. However at this point, my bills are exceeding the amount it will take to be able to make that happen. I feel that I won\u0027t be able to keep doing this with out the help of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you read this far I truly want to thank you so much for considering supporting what I do :)\u003cbr\u003eAny money donated through patreon will 100% be used in upgrading the equipment in which I record with or plan to record for real life style videos with in the near future, as long as I can survive long enough to make that content happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI honestly believe that this community is the best out there and we have potential to keep growing. Let\u0027s all realize it together and help each other grow into own amazing community on YT.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Eric THEHUNTERDD33\u003cbr\u003e"

At the time, I lived with my girlfriend and had a full time construction job. Making it nearly impossible to be able to spend time with anyone. Well times have passed, I no longer have a girlfriend and now I have time to give back and be able to talk with you guys. However during this transition, I decided to dedicate more time into my channel and shortly after that my youtube revenue started declining shortly after... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe whole reason I decided to start putting more time on my channel is because I love to be able to talk to you guys and hear about all of our similar interests. You guys are the reason I can look forward to waking up every morning to make amazing videos!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to keep producing the best content on the best hunting games out there. However almost all of what I have received from my channel has gone directly right back to my channel, making it really difficult to be able to maintain the funds needed to be able to upgrade any more. Also, as soon as spring fishing and deer season come I want to be able to get some more equipment for recording some awesome real life style videos as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really want to thank you So Much for reading up until this point and for considering supporting what I do. I hope that I can repay you by giving you as much value as I can through the Rewards of supporting my channel here :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
