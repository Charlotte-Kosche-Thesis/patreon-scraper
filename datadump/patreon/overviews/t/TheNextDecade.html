    "summary": "My name is Dustin Beadle, for the last 8 years Ive been slowly building up my skills and talents to create some of the coolest, most confortable armored costumes around. With a focus on Japanese superhero costumes from the Tokusatsu genre, we strive to build some of the most interesting character and weapon designs out there. We just want to show everyone, if we can make it, so can you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, We can renovate my work area and upgrade it to feature a streaming station. This would allow you to join me in a private livestream, working on my own personal projects as well as working on customer orders. A fun way to hang out, connect and ask questions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also offer class lessons and private tutoring for anyone interested in making their own stuff, from foam fabrications, to fiberglass resin fabrications.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to make something for EVERY SINGLE CONTRIBUTOR THAT STAYS FOR 1 YEAR!! Something at least once a year that lines up with how much you helped me in that year will show up at your house as a thank you for long support. Could be anywhere from a small keychain like trinket, or Foam helmet/armor kits for characters of your choosing to base foam parts for you to build on yourself or FULL PROPS OR COSTUME PARTS! \u00a0It really depends on what you would like to do to, but I can promise even if you pledge for the lowest amount, you are guaranteed to get something Handmade and Tokusatsu related from yours truly. If you are supporting me with larger rewards expect me to be in contact well before a year is over to plan your rewards and schedule them for construction!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not want to use this as a means of making a massive profit, but as a means to help my buisness grow, as well as helping the people who helped me. I provide help by making items for people who may not have the immediate time, funds, or skills neccesary to create props and costume parts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOne of my goals\u00a0is to see this buisness expand, hire a few employees from our community, and move on to bigger and badder projects as a team.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eJoin our team and learn to better yourself and others through crafting and creation!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, Thank you for all your continuing support. \u00a0I wouldnt have even made it here if it wasnt for everybody that told me they liked my stuff. It means the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for taking the time to check this out- Dustin.\u00a0"
