    "summary": "Hello there! I\u0027m Justin, otherwise known as The Cynical Cypher. I am a content creator looking to expand his passion for content creation into a career. As of the time of writing this, I have been a content creator for over seven years, but have re-innovated myself over the recent years into a form which is much more suitable of my personality and abilities. My current content consists of film reviews, video essays/analyses, and other topics generally relating to that of entertainment. I like to provide not only the technical aspect of entertainment, but also dive into my interpretations towards the greater meanings behind these art mediums. I always seek to improve and change, never become stagnant and stale. My eventual goal is to make this into a full-time job and have enough support to be able to eventually create films of my own. All your support is welcome and is sincerely appreciated. Knowing the fact that anyone would be willing to financially support me so that I may continue to grow is something I cannot show my appreciation for in words, but only attempt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank all of you that have taken the time to read and those of you who choose to support!\u003cbr\u003eThank you once more, \u003cbr\u003e- Justin, The Cynical Cypher"
