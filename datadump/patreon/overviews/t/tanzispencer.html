    "summary": "I was home educated until I was\n13 when I asked to go to school so I could get my GCSE\u0027S and then go on to\ncollege, it was on my very first day that my teachers told me I was dyslexic,\nit was a relief, for me dyslexia proved it was not laziness or stupidity that\nhad caused my frustrating battle with reading and writing, in later years I\nfound out for my older sister it had been a huge relief that it had not been\nher fault she could not teach me to read and write properly.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy teachers were amazing and so understanding that my dyslexia did not hold me\nback from learning at school, it has at times held me back since, but I am\ndetermined it will not stop me from writing now.\u003cbr\u003e\nI have stories in my head, so many stories, but getting them on paper (so to\nspeak) is very hard, I need a focus and that is where YOU come in, I have set\nmy patron account to per couple of pages not per month, as I need to approach writing in\nmanageable, none scary, bite size chunks, 2 pages at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\nTo know that even just 1 person wants to read my next page will spur me on to\nwrite and with your help I will write a novel! Scary!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy novel begins:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(178,162,199);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(178,162,199);\"\u003e\n\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eLife was\ngood on earth these days, even for an orphan like Faith. History lessons tell\nof the time before, of a time when not a day went by without crime in every\ncorner of the world, pollution constantly on the rise and year after year\npeople getting sicker and sicker, a world bent on self-destruction, that was,\nuntil magic was discovered.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFaith had\nspent a year in a group home with three other girls, Selina, Jodie and Jane and\na custodian, Mrs Warren, a friendly but firm woman in her late forties.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nShe could\nbarely remember the other girls or their stories about how they ended up there.\nThe shock of losing her parents had not really worn off until she was moving\nout at 14 and was allotted her own private pod. That was when she started to\nwake back up again, started to dream and to build her life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFaith lay,\npropped up by pillows, on her bed gazing out of her window at the roses, tears\nstill drying on her cheek, her story in her hand, she had no idea why she did\nnot just get rid of it, it was something she wrote about 6 months after her\nfather had died, at the insistence of the councillor assigned to her group home,\nit was meant to be a tool to deal with her grief and say goodbye to her\nparents, but it had not helped and her councillor had never seemed happy with\nwhat she had written:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI was just 13 years old when my\nparents died, my mother first, of a brain haemorrhage, so suddenly there had\nbeen no time to even think about going to sky central to a healer, one minute\nbrushing her shoulder length raven black hair, hands reaching up to tie it into\nthe tight bun for work and then tumbling down, hair pins falling all around as\nthey were knocked of the table and her hair flowing free and wild as she crashed\nto the floor. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd then,\nwell then my father abandoned me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHe\nstopped going to work, stopped talking, stopped eating, he just sat in his\nchair in our pod and wasted away, the sunlight yellow walls, somehow feeling\nmore like a deathly jaundice now, like our whole home was sick and giving up. He\ndied less than a month after my mother, leaving me all alone and unsure if I\nwas more sad or angry.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA sad tale of loss and recovery was what the\ncouncil wanted, that was what everyone else always wrote for him but that was\nnot how Faith felt, she felt alone and betrayed....\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
