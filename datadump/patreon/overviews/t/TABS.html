If the Field Research teams are still working, they\u0027ve long since stopped actually reporting in and I am incapable of trawling through all of the pubs, taverns, speakeasies, drinking establishments, and opium dens they are known to frequent to badger them for their notes without funding. I want to keep this place running, but it has become painfully clear that I cannot do this on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027ve started a Patreon account.

Your contribution helps me collate data that has long been suppressed by Big Bird*, and allows me to release regular reports onto the internet without fear of censorship.
