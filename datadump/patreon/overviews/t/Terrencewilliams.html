It\u2019s better to be sponsored by the people because I I can keep it real and without worrying about \u00a0losing a sponsorship from a sensitive company because of some cry baby snowflakes . I am tired of being Censored on Social Media, \u00a0I refuse to stop speaking the truth and laughing at these crazy people . \u00a0I rather be Fan-Funded on Patreon than to change who I am.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use my voice to speak for those that can\u2019t speak or afraid to speak for themselves. I add a little humor in the midst of dark times. I learned to smile during cloudy days since my upbringing in Foster Care.  I have overcome a lot of life challenges and I have not complained.  I have thousands of people that follow me on Social Media so I will \u00a0continue to raise my voice and keep people smiling and laughing through all the chaos going on in today\u2019s world. Whether you\u2019re able pledge or not I Thank You for your support, because I learned in Foster Care that love is the best support anyone can give."
