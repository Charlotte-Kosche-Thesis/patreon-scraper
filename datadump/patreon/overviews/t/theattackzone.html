    "summary": "Thanks for checking out our Patreon. The Attack Zone is a Dice Masters podcast in The Reserve Pool Network dedicated to covering the strategy of the game. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d like to keep the podcast sounding great. One piece of content that our listeners seem to enjoy is \"The Six Pack,\" where we break down a hand of a booster draft and talk about the cards. We\u0027d like to continue doing it, but need to break even. For that, we need your help. We have a goal of $18 per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you back us for as little as $1 per month, we will do the six pack in every new episode once we hit our funding goal. We will also have a monthly drawing of backers and send the winner any foils, rares, and super rares that we opened that month in the six pack (dice not included except on specific cards). If you back for $3 or more, you will have five entries to win instead of just one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we exceed this goal, we will have other perks in the works for our backers, or perhaps will just do additional segments as bonus episodes, but we must stress that whatever happens with this, no content will ever be limited to backers-only. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote that this is just in support of our continuing this segment on The Attack Zone podcast; it is not fundraising for TRP as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e"
