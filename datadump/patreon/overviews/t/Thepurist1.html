    "summary": "A young boxing fan who had a thirst of reading and learning about the sweet science. I loved reading articles and think pieces about boxing but felt that the current boxing media and writers were doing a poor job of A, writing about whats neccesary in the sport in a positive light and B, didn\u0027t have great knowledge or understanding of the sport.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs social media has become an excellent way to build a fanbase and following as I knew there were true boxing fans with a pure appreciation for the art who would be drawn to not just my views and posts but to the discussions and talking points that boxing offers. Not just the basic ones that the media cover such as controversial decisions but the nuances and dynamic of boxing offers that only someone who truly has a pugilistic appreciation could ever see or discuss.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter building up that fanbase I knew that once i started to generate revenue I could start to put my best foot forward and possibly make my dream of being the chief editor and writer of my own boxing magazine a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut right now for this 19 year old writer it is still nothing more than a dream but i would love it if you could help me on my journey and even a donation of $1 a month will go a long way to helping me achieve that dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntill that dream is achieved I will continue on my path of pushing for the purist appreciation of the sweet science! -Purist"
