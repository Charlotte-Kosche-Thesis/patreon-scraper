Writing or playing songs and recording them is kind of the only thing I want to do\u2026 besides eating.  AND drinking coffee.  Those are important too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m mostly out on tour as a sideman with the insanely talented \u003ca href=\"http://www.misstessmusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMiss Tess\u003c/a\u003e, but the time I do spend at home, I like to sit in my little studio, writing and making sounds that seem to fit together.  For me, a song isn\u2019t finished until I have some kind of recording of it that feels right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here on Patreon because I think it\u0027s a fantastic platform for creative types and those who\u2019d like to support them.  It\u2019s an outlet for me to showcase my music and get it into the hands of people who care. All of this outside of the traditional music industry, which as we all know is changing rapidly and has never really favored the artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you be releasing on this site?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u2022   \u003cstrong\u003eRecordings\u003c/strong\u003e or demos of unreleased original songs.\u003cbr\u003e   \u2022   \u003cstrong\u003eCovers\u003c/strong\u003e of other people\u0027s songs. \u003cbr\u003e   \u2022   \u003cstrong\u003ePoems\u003c/strong\u003e that I write and think are pretty good.\u003cbr\u003e   \u2022   \u003cstrong\u003eMusic Videos\u003c/strong\u003e including \"official\" videos and homemade/live videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to release two songs a month, sprinkled with a poem or video here and there.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e****I\u2019ll never have more than four releases a month.****  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe modern day music industry is a nightmare. One that values product, image, page likes and streams more than creativity, talent and drive.  To even start playing that game, one needs to invest a TON of money into things like publicity and radio campaigns.  More often than not, these investments seem to lead nowhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe modern crowd sourcing phenomenon (Kickstarter, Pledge Music, etc.) has been wonderful for all sorts of creative types to get their work out into the world on their own terms, but they are still generally focused on an end goal, an album or a product. What makes Patreon so interesting and unique is that it allows the creator to focus on the process more than the product.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the wise words of \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/carsieblanton\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCarsie Blanton\u003c/a\u003e, \u201cI like the Patreon model because it values creative works (like songs and essays) over consumer products (like albums and books). This site is a good reminder that some of our best and most important work as humans can\u0027t be packaged and sold for a fixed price. To me, becoming a patron doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re paying for each song, it means you\u0027re showing support for my lifelong project of being creative.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Details\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to think of each pledge as a tip for every song I post.  Throw a dollar in the bucket!The more people get involved, the more time I\u2019ll be able to focus on each song, making everything better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cstrong\u003e\u2022   You decide what amount you\u0027d like to tip per song, AND per month.\u003c/strong\u003e Eg: you tip $5 per song, but can set a \"monthly cap\u201d at $10/month total.\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cstrong\u003e\u2022   If you tip $3 or more per song, you\u0027ll get cool rewards\u003c/strong\u003e, like a postcard, limited edition sticker, handwritten lyrics or a song just for you! \u003cbr\u003e   \u003cstrong\u003e\u2022   If you have questions or suggestions\u003c/strong\u003e, send me an email.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e****Remember, I\u2019m aiming to post two songs per month, NEVER more than four.

     "about": "Thomas Bryan Eaton has been honing his skills as a musician since he first remembers falling in love with sound at age 3. That fateful Christmas, he was given an old gray walkman with a record button on it that set his imagination running into a world of sonic explorations that continue to this day. Eventually Thomas saved enough money from his paper route and lawn mowing enterprises to buy his first guitar.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese days, Thomas can mostly be seen as a sideman coaxing sweet sounds out of a telecaster or pedal steel, working his melodious magic while chiming in on vocals when called for. Behind the scenes, he\u0027s also an avid songwriter with a strong love of the recording process, which keeps him quite active in his home studio. Whether it\u2019s demoing a new honky tonk tune, twisting knobs for an avant-garde synth noise experiment or mixing a freshly cut live band rock \u2019n\u2019 roll track, Thomas still loves tinkering with sound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the 2015 release of his second full length album, We All Want to Be Love, Thomas made the move to Nashville after living in Brooklyn for ten years. The move has allowed for more time at home in a space more conducive to writing \u0026amp; recording, giving him more freedom to create. Currently he is working on about twenty-five songs that are in various states of completion that he plans to corral into at least one new album.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, Thomas has started a Patreon page where he\u2019ll be releasing two exclusive tracks every month to his followers.",
