I\u0027ve been making Football Manager videos on YouTube for over a year now and have created a community of over 5,000 subscribers which is insane! It\u0027s already gone way beyond what I thought was possible and now I\u0027d like to take things to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBefore I go on, please only donate if you can afford it, there are plenty of things more important than donating to my channel. There will be no content hidden behind a paywall, I want my videos to be accessible to everyone, and there will be no hidden content you have to donate to Patreon to see, Patreon is just an extra option if you want to help out the channel.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating content has become a real passion of mine over the course of producing videos. Seeing other Football Manager creators turn their passion into a job has been a real inspiration to me that perhaps one day, playing Football Manager could become my job. This is still a long way off, but the long term aim of this Patreon page is to be able to help me make content full time. As I say though, this is a long way off, so for the time being, the money donated will be used to improve production of videos and the channel. I currently record videos on my outdated laptop which is under powered to the point where I can\u0027t play games in 3D, and I am limited as to what I can do in editing as my laptop is under powered. The webcam I use for face-cam is the built in webcam on the laptop, which quite frankly is atrocious. The money raised by Patreon will go directly to improving the channel, getting a better suited computer, a HD webcam, better lighting and a green screen for example.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a few different donation levels, but every single person will get a shout out in a video and my eternal gratitude. If you don\u0027t want to donate then no worries, I hope you still continue to watch my videos as you did before. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and if you do donate, thank you for helping me get a little bit closer to my dream.\u00a0"
