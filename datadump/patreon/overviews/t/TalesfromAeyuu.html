Back\nin 2011, I created the world of Aeyuu from a set of roleplay characters and\nplots that never saw the light of day. Since then this world has grown\nexponentially into a massive web of passion, madness, and stories told.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nMuch of Aeyuu is still left unexplored. This is what I invite\nyou to discover with me through the numerous stories offered each month for\nyour reading pleasure.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://talesfromaeyuu.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/tales-from-aeyuu.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAeyuu is a vast and dangerous place \u2013 a world of Dark Fantasy,\nwhere Vampires, Wyr (werewolves), Elves, Humans and stranger creatures still\nstruggle to survive. The Tales from Aeyuu follow several main characters as\nthey go about their lives, exploring their surroundings, dealing with danger\nand love. Each character reveals a unique aspect of this world that has existed\nfor well over 30,000 years, through their own eyes. Fauna, flora, culture and\nmyth \u2013 each story is as a puzzle piece that builds a greater whole.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://talesfromaeyuu.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/the-lands-destruction2.png\" style=\"width: 417px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEvery month, I bundle\nthe stories written during said month and offer them for all you Patrons to\nenjoy. \n\u003c/strong\u003eThese are first drafts that will not be\navailable anywhere else, but eventually edited and shared.

It is a story about love\nand regret that begins when Death, nudged by his wife, decides to reincarnate\nin the mortal world. It is unrelated to Aeyuu directly; all I\u0027ve learned with\nwriting this novel will serve my storytelling. All funds I might obtain through\npublishing will, of course, go towards writing the stories of Aeyuu and giving\nback to the community where I can (check the Goals for more info).\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://talesfromaeyuu.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/i-dont-want-to-kill-you.png\" style=\"width: 431px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUltimately, my goal is \u003cem\u003efinancial independence\u003c/em\u003e.
