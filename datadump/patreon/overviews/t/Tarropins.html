Taro hopes to join an art college in the fall. \u003cbr\u003eTaro finds inspiration in the challenges they have faced emotionally. thoughts and feeling that they used to treat like a weakness are now a source of motivation for their artwork. All though Taro is an interdisciplinary artist their illustrative work is their main focus and passion.\u003cbr\u003e they enjoy exploration in color theory and transforming dark subjects into bright and saturated pieces of work. taro takes intangible thoughts and emotion and brings them into the physical world through story, color and imagery.\u003cbr\u003e"
