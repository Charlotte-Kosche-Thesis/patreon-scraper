    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u0027re reading this, then chances are good you\u0027re probably\na little confused and have a few questions. So let\u0027s answer some of them, shall\nwe?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWho are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nI\u0027m Smokescale Aquatos, or just \u0027Smokey\u0027 if that\u0027s too much\nof a mouthful.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m a North American Water Dragon. Oh... wait... sorry,\ndidn\u0027t understand the question. I\u0027m a furry (some folks like to call reptilian\nspecies scalies). I have an appreciation for cartoonish animals. If you\u0027ve seen\nZootopia, that\u0027s a pretty good example of what I\u0027m talking about. I could throw\naround words like \"anthropomorphic\" but it\u0027s not terribly common to\nhear that word if you\u0027re not in the fandom and it might confuse some people, so\nI\u0027ll refrain.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat is it you\u0027re doing on patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m hoping to interest people in my writing abilities. I\u0027m\nan amateur author, and I\u0027ve been writing since about late 2002 (at least,\nthat\u0027s when I started writing material for the furry fandom, all my previous\nwork was lost in various catastrophic storage failures). Now, I am by no means\nclaiming to be a professional grade author, but I\u0027d like to think I\u0027m pretty\ndecent. I don\u0027t necessarily expect this to grow to the point where it can be a\nreal means of making a living, but you never know. Something I\u0027m hoping that\nmight come of this is the habit of writing, brought on by being held\naccountable by those who are contributing to my work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat sort of material do you create?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell, as I said, I\u0027m an author, so... I write stories.\nPrimarily, I write about fantasy and science fiction within the furry fandom.\nI\u0027ve created a couple of fan-fiction works but they aren\u0027t strictly furry, nor\ndo I really consider them to be part of my main body of work as I generally\navoid fan-fiction. Personal reasons only. If you like fan-fiction, read it,\nlook at it, create it, whatever, that\u0027s cool. I just generally try to avoid it.\nPrimarily, my work is, in point of fact, of an adult nature and should not be\nviewed by anyone under the legal age of consent for their area (I generally just\ndefault to 18 to be safe). Not only is it of an adult nature, but I tend to\nincorporate some rather unusual fetishes, so be ye fairly warned, all who enter\nhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo see stuff I\u0027ve already written and posted, check out the following links:\u003cbr\u003eMy FA Page: \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/smokescale/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/smokescale/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy SoFurry Page: \u003ca href=\"https://smokescale-aquatos.sofurry.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://smokescale-aquatos.sofurry.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll find much more of my work on SoFurry, but you\u0027ll also find some on FA. You WILL need to be logged in to each site to view my submissions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m also an amateur voice actor, creating a couple of\nsegments for a podcast called \"Fur What It\u0027s Worth\". I\u0027m responsible\nfor a segment known as \"space news\" wherein I discuss (briefly) what\nall is going on in the world of space travel, astronomy, and some of the\nrelated scientific disciplines.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nHow often do you create?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a writer, my mood, available time, and available ideas\nfor content are all a little unpredictable. That being said, I am trying to get\ninto the habit of writing one or two scenes a week. Now, a scene can consist of\njust a couple of pages, or it can range all the way up to 13-15 pages\ndepending. I often write little 5-page short stories since those seem to be\nsmall enough bites that are easily digested by the general furry public. Just\none of these 5-pagers can be counted as a single scene as they\u0027re usually only\njust long enough for one scene proper. If I can maintain that pace, that means\nI create somewhere between 52 and 104 scenes a year (not counting periods when\nI would need to go on hiatus). That could potentially be something I could\nparlay into a book. Maybe I could get published someday!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhy Patreon? Why not just sell commissions for stories?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSelling commissions or receiving money on a per-commission\nbasis is wildly inconsistent. If I were to only rely on that, I fear I would\nquickly burn out (as I have in the past and then returned months later to find\nI had not completed one or two commissions anywhere near how long I said it\nwould take). I\u0027d thought about a reward tier that you buy into for a chance to\nwin a raffle, the prize would be a story commission, but raffles constitute a\nform of gambling, and that bring in scrutiny under gambling commissions. That\nmakes things way too complicated and so Patreon discourages this.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat can I expect if I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell, so far, I don\u0027t have a lot to offer so I\u0027m going to\nkeep it pretty simple. I have two tiers, one of which gets you access to rough drafts. Another gets you a copy of one of my stories that I\u0027m publishing on Amazon (yeah, I publish on Amazon now!). Usually it will be only one story a month that I publish there, but more could go up there if I have more time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nAnything else you\u0027d like to tell us?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m currently unemployed. I had a day job until the company decided I wasn\u0027t worth keeping around so they used an excuse to fire me, not lay off, actually terminate. So, right now I\u0027m looking for another job. This means what money I make off of Patreon, Amazon, and Commissions is really the only income I have. I\u0027ve got a bit saved up at the moment so I\u0027m not hurting badly at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nYou\u0027re weird!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYup! I sure am! Kinda pride myself on that. I\u0027m gonna keep\ndoing me, so hope that doesn\u0027t put you off.\u003cbr\u003e"
