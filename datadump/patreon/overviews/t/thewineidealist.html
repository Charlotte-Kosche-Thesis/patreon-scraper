     "about": "Daniel Honan, aka The Wine Idealist, is a Hunter Valley based freelance \nwine and food writer, and advocate for natural, organic and biodynamic \nwine. A former journalist at the BBC, Daniel swapped the news desk for a\n wine bar and ever since returning to Australia has combined his words \nwith wine, while championing the new Australian and New Zealand \nsustainable and artisan wine vanguard. He has been published in \nDecanter, Gourmet Traveller Wine, James Halliday\u0027s Wine Companion, Wine \nNZ, ABC Organic Gardener, and many more magazine. Daniel is also a \nregular wine, beer, and food writer for the Newcastle Herald\u0027s Weekender \nmagazine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSustainability is not just another 21st Century buzzword \u2013 it\u2019s a consciousness raising amongst a generation of human being\u2019s that recognises the need to put back into the earth as much, if not more, as we take. From farmer\u2019s markets to heavy industry \u2013 people are changing the way they consume the things they want. Natural, organic and bio-dynamic ways of making wine is a part of this evolution of consciousness. Expressing wine as nature intended, with a minimum of interference so that they may reflect their sense of place in the most honest way possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs The Wine Idealist, it is my aim to be an advocate for authentic taste and environmental sustainability by supporting and promoting all those who live, love and work with natural organic and biodynamic wines in Australia and New Zealand. To write the emerging story of those winegrowers who are choosing to take a more sustainable, and conscientious approach to how they produce their wines. I want to promote and recognise those winegrowers that are producing their wines organically and bio-dynamically in as natural way as possible. I want to show people just how great a wine can be, when it\u2019s about provenance, passion and authenticity, rather than homogeneity, manipulation and commerce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

It was there the day decided to start writing properly about these kinds of wines from Australia and New Zealand, and it\u0027s been there, every single day, week in week out, and every Friday at 10:30am when it came time to post the /NEW/ Edition of The Wine Idealist!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/P7rwVS2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSaying goodbye hurts, but my old MBP is on its last legs, and it\u0027s time to upgrade.
