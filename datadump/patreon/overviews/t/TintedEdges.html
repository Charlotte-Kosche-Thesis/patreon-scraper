Tinted Edges is my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tintededges.com\"\u003ebook blog\u003c/a\u003e and the place I host all my book reviews and writing related projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page is going to be the way that book-lovers can support my biggest project: the \u003cstrong\u003eLost the Plot Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e. Lost the Plot is a monthly half hour podcast where I explore different book related issues and interview authors and big players in the industry. I absolutely love the challenge of finding new book news stories and book-related things to talk about, and meeting all the people I interview on the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve already completed Season 1 which you can check out for free \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lost_the_plot/sets/season-1\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027m really excited to launch Season 2 with a new way for listeners to support this project that I love so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLost the Plot is my most time consuming project and requires the most financial investment when it comes to technology, travel and tickets to events. Each episode takes hours and hours of planning, liaising, scripting, recording, editing and, finally, putting it up for everyone to listen to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would be fantastic if Lost the Plot could break even so I can keep producing, recording, improving and hosting this podcast for a long time to come. You can help keep it going by supporting each new episode via Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere supporters will get early access to episodes of Lost the Plot, sneak peeks into next month\u0027s episode, updates about what books I\u0027m reading and hot tips about upcoming book events. There might even be some giveaways!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLost the Plot will always be available to stream and download for free, so if you love the show but can\u0027t pledge right now, please follow Lost the Plot on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lost_the_plot\"\u003eSoundCloud\u003c/a\u003e, subscribe and leave a review on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/lost-the-plot-podcast/id1185190716?mt=2\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e, follow the Tinted Edges\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tintededges.com\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e, like the Tinted Edges\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tintededges/\"\u003efacebook page\u003c/a\u003e and share my podcast and reviews with your book-loving friends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for visiting!"
