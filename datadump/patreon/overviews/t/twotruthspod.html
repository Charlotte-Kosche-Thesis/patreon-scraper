    "summary": "You remember that time you went to that party? And your friend was in rare form, and maybe a little drunk? She was telling that group in the kitchen about that time you all went skinny dipping. But she doesn\u2019t remember it like you remember it. The lake wasn\u2019t frozen over, like she said. The cops never came and tried to put you in cuffs. And you certainly didn\u2019t lead them into Johnny Depp\u2019s backyard. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut she\u2019s on a roll, and while you could have cut her off, and tell her what a liar she is, you didn\u2019t. Instead, you let her go. Because whoever let a few facts get in the way of a good story? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwo Truths and a Lie \u003c/strong\u003eis all about storytelling. Each episode, we get three people to tell us a fabulous, unbelievable story. So unbelievable, in fact, it might not even be true. Because one of them is always lying. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey might be exaggerating. They might be stretching the truth mighty thin. Or they might not even be who they say they are. Thing is, you won\u2019t know until it\u2019s all over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://danieldavidshapiro.com/\"\u003eDaniel David Shapiro\u003c/a\u003e hosts the podcast and live show, which happens every third Sunday at \u003ca href=\"http://angelcitybrewery.com/\"\u003eAngel City Brewery\u003c/a\u003e in the Downtown LA Arts District, where the admission is free, and the beer is tasty. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2015, we\u0027ve been putting out new episodes every other week, and now - we\u0027re asking for your support.
