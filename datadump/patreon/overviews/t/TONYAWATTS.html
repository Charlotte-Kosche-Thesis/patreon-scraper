Sometimes, I feel such an urge to share my new songs, videos or thoughts on Social Media. However, I never feel safe in doing so. It feels way to vulnerable sharing your personal life and feelings so freely only to be met with resistance. I like the idea that if you are here then you must want to know what I have to say, sing, or offer in this\u00a0ballistic matrix we call Life on Earth! I can promise you as a\u00a0creator of songs, videos, blogs, and alternative opinions you will be entertained on this here \u003cem\u003ePATREON VORTEX\u003c/em\u003e that I would like to create for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

I Like the idea of financing it through this page.\u003cbr\u003e I will be in Nashville a lot this summer recording. I will set different rewards for different amounts. If by chance I end up with a few Angel Investors someone who donates more .. Like How much more?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e I can tell you right now I can record one track anywhere from 1,000 to 2,000 depending on the studio and such. That is on a budget pulling favors almost. It is not cheap which is why I have not released a full length album since \u003cem\u003e\" Handcuff My Soul\"\u003c/em\u003e. I have seen a lot of great artist raise money on Kickstarter but I never felt comfortable with that. This feels good! Especially if I am delivering content. I love it! I like releasing SINGLES! I am about to Release \u00a0\"LOVE LOVES LOVE\" \u00a0 on my label Dazey Rock Records. If I reach my goals it would pay for promotion of the single. This song will be promoted to radio..\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e I love creating! Writing songs! Performing Live! Meeting Y\u0027all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeaded South this Summer to Play Music and selling Hemp Products! \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Good things in the works... never give up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
