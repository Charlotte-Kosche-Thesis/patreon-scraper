Now, I\u0027m not sure whether or not there is some all powerful being, or beings, who have planned all our lives out... But making videos has quite literally saved my life. I\u0027m not saying I wanted to die, but instead had no reason to live. I was lost... Dreams bigger than the stars coupled with crippling social anxiety made it hard for me to believe in myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube has changed my life. Knowing that I can make just one person laugh... That\u0027s all I ever wanted. But it runs out I made over 8,000 people laugh! So naturally I want to continue what I do to the best of my abilities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR YOU TO PAY ALL OF MY BILLS!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll funds will go to large projects and overall channel equipment. I currently have at least 3 projects that I would absolutely love to get off the ground, and ideas flying in everyday. \u003cbr\u003eLook, I\u0027m not going to lie. Getting this new job and having such a change of life pace has really redirected my attention. I want to keep up with YouTube but I genuinely want to peruse making more videos worth making. I would really appreciate your support in this endeavor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecial note for all my poppets:\u003cbr\u003eSupport or no support, I love you all so much. I can\u0027t believe the outpouring of love I receive from everyone. Knowing that I can put a smile on your face, especially when you didn\u0027t think you could... That means everything to me. I have big dreams, and maybe some unobtainable goals... But I hope we get to all of them together, and I\u0027ll never forget those of you who were there for me along the way. You truly are beautiful in your soul, and that is all that matters. \u003cbr\u003eI owe it all to you.\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eArend :)\u003cbr\u003e"
