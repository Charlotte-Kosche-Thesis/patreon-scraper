Sometimes we pair up some of the better players at the store and it turns out they\u0027re both playing aggressive decks and finish their match in 15-20 minutes. Other times only one person gets to play magic in both games and more time is spent shuffling than playing. That totally sucks for everyone: the players and the viewers. You shouldn\u0027t have to spend more time watching recorded footage than live Magic. The addition of a back-up feature match can help alleviate this issue. With enough support, we\u0027ll be able to make sure you\u0027re watching as much live Magic as possible.",
