I started to diet for the first time in my life.\u00a0 Previous to the diagnosis, I hadn\u0027t really left my house in over 10 years, believing I was too unattractive to be seen in public.\u00a0 That was my mindset.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/grief%201%20of%201_zpszak5hrsp.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so I took the photos of myself, literally hundreds, just to find one I could live with. I started learning how to edit photos, learned about lighting and angles and really delved deeply into creating moods through the lens. I used costumes, make-up, wigs, hats. Just about anything to enhance myself and make it a more meaningful-for-me experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/bravery%201%20of%201_zps9zcpwwkz.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore than that....I started seeing myself with love.\u00a0 I had to look at all my flaws, and I started to actually like them.\u00a0 I started to see the parts I liked, and actually started to love them. Very soon, I began to just accept myself as I was.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/cover%201%20of%201_zpsceqfsqwx.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI learned.\u00a0 I wasn\u0027t so bad at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon I had friends wanting me to take their portraits.\u00a0 They were brave, I tell you, showing me everything.\u00a0 Letting their selves really shine through:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/jbbw%201%20of%201_zpsnkwarl9x.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/rainbow2%205%20of%2010_zpscui9akov.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/rob%201%20of%201_zpsbklzbzfz.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe project moved on, I took photos of all the people who came to our house, I shared them on social media and got an amazing response.\u00a0 I was asked to participate in some local art shows and soon I was hosting Soul Portrait events, where I would charge $20 - $25 per person to have their portrait taken.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI developed a system.\u00a0 I ask the subject to think of certain scenarios as I let the camera click away, most times, I don\u0027t even look at them, I turn my back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe style has changed, back and forth from close ups to waist up, to couples, children.\u00a0 I have, at this time taken the portraits of over 400 people in my immediate area.\u00a0 Sometimes for free, which is what I would prefer to do, but other times I have studio expenses, gas expenses, time expenses...and so I would charge that small fee to have a sitting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have three major goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOffer soul portraits sessions for free in my local area.\u003cbr\u003eOffer soul portraits sessions for free around the entire country.\u003cbr\u003eand\u003cbr\u003eGet a new camera and portrait lens.\u00a0 I am still using the NikonD80, with either the kit lens, when there is available light (as you see above) or sometimes with my 50mm 1.8 prime lens because I can get a little more light in using a smaller f-stop number. The ISO gets very grainy past the minimum 100 that the camera affords.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what I am asking for is patrons to make this possible.\u00a0 I want to travel the country, I want to help people find love in themselves...or to express pain, or to just be.\u00a0 I know that not everyone enjoys their soul portraits, but they aren\u0027t really meant to be enjoyed, more to be studied, learned from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClient Testimony:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElizabeth R.\u003cbr\u003e\"Kari\u0027s\n Soul Portrait Project did more for me than I ever thought any photo \ncould do. I came across her booth at a festival and was incredibly \nintrigued at the concept. I was told this photo was not a typical \n\"glamour shot\", that I would be asked questions to get a snapshot of my \nsoul. On that day I was struggling a lot with my lupus. It was hot, \nwhich never helps, and my face was dark red and swollen.\n I was worried this might be the last time this summer that I would be \nable to go outside. I went through the experience (which I really \nenjoyed), and just a couple days later when I got my photo back, I was \nblown away; it brought tears to my eyes. My Soul Portrait showed me that\n even in my toughest times, I can be beautiful, but more importantly, it\n showed me I am strong. I am a warrior. I am a fighter. It gave me a \nconfidence I hadn\u0027t had in a long time, and it encouraged me to not give\n up. Look at the peace the portrait brought out. Look at the strength \nwithin. I will recommend this experience to anyone who will listen to \nme, because beyond a beautiful, real photo, it will show you the \nbeautiful, real you, someone you might not have known was even in you.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/17973814_10154153127156887_5759902772267572015_o_zpsiotygxjr.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome more examples of the different styles:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/11-5223_zpsgxjyi9zc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/MathewandCarole%202%20of%202_zpsxvtokb5f.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/Ebony%202%20of%202_zpsandmsj0a.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/park%203%20of%201_zps3ljtru5u.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/park%202%20of%201_zpsr4wt5cob.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/park%201%20of%201_zpsya99c8sx.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/SoulPic%2012%20of%201_zpsfmarv5t5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h54/karipillow/vivion2%201%20of%201_zpsg1y5ehwy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
