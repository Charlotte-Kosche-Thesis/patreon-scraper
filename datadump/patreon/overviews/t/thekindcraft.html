For a decade, I worked with some of the world\u0027s largest apparel brands to create womenswear and kidswear collections. During those years, I found myself becoming less interested in mass-market fashion and more curious about the work of small-scale makers. I was living in Brooklyn where there was a \u2018Makers Movement\u2019 happening and, when I traveled internationally, I saw artisans in villages making truly\u00a0\u2018small batch, single origin\u2019 textiles and community-specific\u00a0crafts learned from their parents and grandparents.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn December of 2012, I packed my apartment into a storage unit and moved to Southeast Asia to learn about traditional arts and collaborate with artisans.
