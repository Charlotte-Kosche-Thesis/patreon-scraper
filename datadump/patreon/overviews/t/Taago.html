Thank you so much for taking the time to check out our page!\u003cbr\u003eTaago is a duo of cosplayers/artists in the Philadelphia, PA \u00a0area; Juli and Bianca.\u003cbr\u003eWe draw, sew, craft, and game-- and love to share these hobbies with everyone. Most of our events are on the East Coast, but our goal is to travel around the world one day~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e We thought a Patreon account would be a great idea so that supporters who enjoy our work have the option to contribute, and help us make/create more content! Most of the money we get from our day jobs goes to living expenses and other bills. (ugh, adulting) The little bit extra we save up is what we have to work with for costumes. We do sometimes vendor at conventions also; selling all kinds of cosplay accessories, hats, prints, jewelry, and more--but we wanted another way for people who enjoy our content to help support more and better works in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Anything anyone chooses to give goes solely to making new costumes \u0026amp; products for our shop (which also funds more costumes ) or travel and convention expenses. (Its about $300 or so each for a relativity near by convention--and that\u0027s just to attend!) Better photo shoots, materials, and equipment will help us give you the best quality content possible! \u00a0This is why we will only charge the Patreon accounts when a project is complete and a shoot is available to share with you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery form of support and encouragement is so appreciated, even just taking the time to read this bio. We really love our followers and friends we\u0027ve made along the way and hope to keep improving with better and more frequent projects to show how grateful we really are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003eCurrent project(s) being funded: \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLewd tier- Cammy\u003cbr\u003eAlexstrasza (HotS version)\u003cbr\u003eCatwoman (revamp of older costume)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e On a more personal level; here\u0027s a little info on us individually--\u003cbr\u003ePlease feel free to ask us questions if we didn\u0027t answer them already!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(146, 205, 220);\"\u003eTaago Juli:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i834.photobucket.com/albums/zz267/lollidollishop/Mobile%20Uploads/e0ced1bc-9dc5-4ddc-be6d-9c615840a455_zpscvxs5q4n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJulayy here! I am 24 years old and am fairly new to cosplay. I started cosplaying in 2015 ish and fell in love with our Taago group. My life consist of working, going to cons and playing my 3ds.

I can usually be found working on projects while binge-watching tv shows, Streaming PC games, or bothering my 6 kitties or my dogs Tibbers and Sophie! I really appreciate any support for my obsessions and its really amazing to me that people are interested in my work. Cosplay has been very helpful for my anxiety/mental health issues, and meeting new people at conventions always motivates me to be more open. \u003cbr\u003eY\u0027all are truly the best! \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(146, 205, 220);\"\u003eFeel free to ask us any questions here, on the facebook page, or by private message; we are pretty quick to reply.
