That does not mean that we will stop at 1,000 videos, but that number ensures  that we have enough content available to legitimately describe this project as a video \u2018library\u2019 of Japan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Does TokyoStreetView need Support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike many professionals that you may find on YouTube, we do not produce stock video footage of Japan for the purpose of selling it. Our first goal is to create videos for anyone that wants to experience Japan from afar.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables us to not only invest and upgrade our equipment, but also to cover basic costs for transportation and accommodation including hotels and food.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo give you a better idea of why we need funding, each video produced outside of Tokyo costs on average between \u003cstrong\u003e10,000\u003c/strong\u003e to \u003cstrong\u003e13,000\u003c/strong\u003e* Yen or around \u003cstrong\u003e$85\u003c/strong\u003e to \u003cstrong\u003e$110\u003c/strong\u003e USD. (* This does not include the time spent editing / shooting each videos or the initial cost of our equipment)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a list of more than 1,000 videos about Japan and its unique culture to film, your generosity and support is what this project needs to really achieve success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, if we want to achieve our goal, and be able to shoot Japan from top to bottom, we estimate the total cost of this project of about \u003cstrong\u003e100,000 USD\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is very different from other crowdsourcing systems that you can find, and the idea here is for you to support us with whatever amount you feel comfortable with and divide this amount by the videos published per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, you could sponsor us for $100 USD in total and only support us with a small amount each month...say only $1 until your $100 runs out, or for as long as you want. You are in full control of how often you chose to support us and by how much. Note that you can also sponsor us as low as $1 USD by choosing the \"No Rewards\" option offered by Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel more generous and want to help us further, we are proposing  different kinds of pledges each month to reward you with different kinds of advantages. We will also provide a  list of goals that we will strive to achieve each month and details of what these goals will allow us to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy don\u2019t you rely on advertisements instead?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of today we have no other options but to enable ads on our YouTube videos. But we do not like ads in general, and dislike the concept of pushing intrusive and non-related messages to our viewers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of now\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tokyostreetview.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTokyoStreetView.com\u003c/a\u003e is ad free and we hope that thanks to your support we will soon be able to completely remove ads altogether from our YouTube channel and instead offer content that we have control over and that you want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we get in return for supporting TokyoStreetView?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost you\u2019ll get a big THANK YOU from us and from the rest of our viewers! TokyoStreetView will continue to thrive thanks to your contributions, regardless of how much you would like to support. But the bottom line here is simple : More and more videos of Japan and this for your pure enjoyment!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is the team behind TokyoStreetView?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are bunch of passionate people living in Japan and want to share our love of this country and its culture to the world, whilst at the same time creating a high-quality visual archive of this unique country for future generations. Some of us have worked as journalists covering different sectors (Hi-Tech, Automobile) for over a decade, others are engineers, software developers and brand specialists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s behind the name:TokyoStreetView - Japan The Beautiful?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started several years ago as a photo blog named TokyoStreetView which was later used to upload videos about Tokyo. But since you cannot change your YouTube channel name, we kept TSV and added \u201cJapan The Beautiful\u201d with content available at both URLs:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tokyostreetview.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etokyostreetview.com\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://japanthebeautiful.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJapanTheBeautiful.com\u003c/a\u003e. It is possible however than in the future, and perhaps after reaching a critical mass, that we will officially use Japan The Beautiful as the definitive name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you publish videos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe usually publish two videos per weeks, which is the best way for you to enjoy Japan in all its glory!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs there anything else I should know about the team and TokyoStreetView?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur motto is \u201cshare\u201d and while making these videos available to all for free on YouTube, we are also working on screening these videos to members of the local community. For example we would love to visit hospitals and old people\u2019s homes in Japan and play videos to them in an effort to bring a bit of \u201cfraicheur\u201d to their daily routine, helping them to travel virtually and dream of more adventures with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the bottom of our heart we would like to thank you in advance for your generous support!\u003cbr\u003e"
