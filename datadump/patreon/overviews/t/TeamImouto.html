    "summary": "Hello, I am a rapper that goes by the name of Shiki. I make parodies and original songs that I upload on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TheTMNS\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/thetmns\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e. I am a big fan of anime and Eastern culture in general. Those influences are shown in my many songs. I have been making songs and recording music for about 4 years now. I love making music and interacting with fans and other artists. Creating music is a huge passion of mine\u0027s. It is my dream to reach a point financially where I can produce merchandise and albums independently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be using the funds I receive from this Patron account to fund my musical endeavors. As some of you may know, it can be very expensive to do things such as lease instrumentals. With the funding from this account I plan to lease instrumentals so I can create my first EP and if I can get enough money I would like to make my first full length album. I will also be creating other merchandise such as shirts and hats. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform in which you can support my content via \"crowd funding.\" It is very simple to use, and it is secure. I will not receive any money unless you authorize a payment.\u00a0To use Patreon, click on the tier you want, or enter an amount on the right. Once a month your pledge will be taken out of the account you have designated to pay with. That payment will be sent to Patreon and then be sent to me. At any time you can stop being a patron to my account. However, you will no longer have access to the benefits of that pledging tier. You can restart your payments at any time later if you wish to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be grateful for any contribution that is given. I really enjoy making music for you all and I know with support from everyone I can reach even greater heights. I plan to continue making superb music for you all. I know we can do this if we all work together. Thanks in advance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eShiki"
