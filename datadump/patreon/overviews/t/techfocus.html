    "summary": "TechFocus is a YouTube channel founded in November 2015. The aim of my channel is to educate people about the latest technology, whilst keeping the channel entertaining and informative. I have been doing videos almost weekly, with the occasional break, but here\u0027s a little bit more information:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA bit about me / the channel: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m a 16 year old content creator, Just trying to share my views and opinions, on new and old tech, to the rest of the world. It might seem a little cringe worthy, but it\u0027s true.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eI created my first video on the 21st of November in 2015. PLEASE DON\u0027T WATCH THAT \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/ZEVsi2fhvjU\"\u003eEYE-BLEACH\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eWith every new video,\u00a0I try to experiment with new ideas and techniques. Sometimes the results are not perfect, but they\u0027ve helped me get to where I am creatively. It\u0027s been a bumpy ride so far, but I\u0027m getting closer to finding my favourite style.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have a long history with video work\u003c/strong\u003e, none of which is tech-related, or even on YouTube. \u00a0I created my first ever short film when I was 6, with my brother. This was the basis for my \u0027career\u0027 in video work. If you want to see a little bit of my younger work, check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-yuHPEAgBA\"\u003eTHIS VIDEO\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\n\tSo on the 1st of November 2015, I created the YouTube Channel called \n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\"Alex\u0027s Tech\"\u003c/strong\u003e - a name which didn\u0027t stick (thankfully).\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003eI never thought when I started with that first, badly made video that I would come this far. There have been points when I felt like giving up, but I\u0027ve pushed through which is a good thing, otherwise I would not be here now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery penny and cent donated will go towards the Channel. It could be used to upgrade camera gear, purchase new products to review or giveaway, or something that can help me create the content that you (hopefully) love.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally, I\u0027d like to thank you, my audience. You inspire me and motivate me to keep creating, no matter what else is happening in my life. You keep me going, and I can\u0027t stop whilst you\u0027re here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u0027s keep this growing and expanding. Feel free to recommend my channel to others, share the video links to anyone who you thing will like it. Let\u0027s try and get to 20K by the end of 2018!\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e"
