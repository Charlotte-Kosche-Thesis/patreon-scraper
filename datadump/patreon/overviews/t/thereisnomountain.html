     "about": "There Is No Mountain is a husband-and-wife duo that combines percussion, guitar, and an affinity for vocal harmony to create a unique brand of pop with intricate, world-music-influenced arrangements and psychedelic swirls.  Reviewers have tried to peg our musical influences in genres ranging from jazz to folk, classical to psychedelic rock, and world music to doom metal (all are correct!).  We usually just call it \u201cpop with a short attention span\u201d. \u00a0We love playing music together, and the fact that other people seem to enjoy listening to it only sweetens the deal for us.",
