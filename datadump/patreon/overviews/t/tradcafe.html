    "summary": "Hello and welcome to the TradCafe Patron page! TradCafe is a podcast created and hosted by Celtic/Jazz pianist Neil Pearlman in order to give great traditional musicians a platform to share their stories with the wider public. Here on Patreon you can be a part of that mission by joining a community of fans who have pledged to support the show on a monthly basis and in return gain access to exclusive content, sneak peeks behind the scenes and the chance to be more directly involved with the show itself. We look forward to having you on board!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Show:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll around the world right now, amazing creative, thoughtful and driven musicians are carrying their musical traditions forward into the new millennium. The relationship between cultural traditions and original creativity is complicated one that lays bare the myriad ways that music plays a role in our lives and societies. From community building to individual artistic expression, social activism to deep personal relationships, music plays a fundamental role in our lives and the musicians who create these moments have a unique perspective. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of TradCafe is to present accomplished and unique musicians chatting informally with Neil, peer-to-peer in long form conversations. Paired with live unplanned musical collaborations, these conversations give the listener a window on the artist\u0027s journey and creativity in a way that doesn\u0027t happen in a more polished media interview. Hopefully through their struggles and successes we can glean inspiration and new ideas for our own endeavors, discovering new music along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs with most podcasts, TradCafe is free to subscribe and listen to (\u003ca href=\"http://www.tradcafe.org\"\u003ewww.tradcafe.org\u003c/a\u003e), and we\u0027re committed to keeping that model in place. But the show is not free to produce. There are overhead costs with media hosting, online presence and maintaining recording equipment, not to mention the hours of work it takes to record, edit, publish and promote each episode. Normally a podcast would cover these costs with advertising, but I don\u0027t like the idea of filling the show with ads, not to mention that the niche nature of the show is not well suited to building a huge mainstream audience. So that\u0027s where Patreon comes in! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon I can bypass the corporate model and connect directly to you, the fans. If you want to help us keep the show afloat you can pledge a monthly contribution that you know is going directly to the show. In return I\u0027ll keep you in the loop about what\u0027s ahead for the show, give you access to bonus content that didn\u0027t make it into the episodes, take your submitted questions in upcoming episodes and give you the chance to chat directly with me about the show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the rewards for pledges on the right side of the page and look to the left side for a series of milestone goals and what each would mean for the development of the show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re still reading, you\u0027ve already invested some time in this project so thanks for that! I hope to be able to welcome you to our TradCafe Patreon community soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Neil\u003cbr\u003e"
