    "summary": "Each week, I work tirelessly to bring you top-notch, passion-fueled, and practical content. I live for this stuff - it\u0027s not my full-time job though. In fact, it comes after my full-time job, my business, and the competing values we all face (e.g., family, health, friends, meaningful experiences). I\u0027d like to invest myself in The Daily BA as much as humanly possible. That\u0027s where you come in: if you chip in a couple bucks per month, I can expand the operation, or maybe get a little more sleep... ;)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started The Daily BA so that we, people that love and support Behavioral Science, can have a central place to enjoy resources, discuss the most controversial topics in our field and enjoy and share our beautiful science. Your subscription on Patreon gets you access to Patron-only content, sneak peeks, personal shout outs on social or in our videos, much more personal interaction with us on the Patreon stream/comments, and -- if you want -- some merch, advertisement, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the bigger story is how much it gives us. Know that everything I do is not only for you but *because* of you. Your support here on Patreon fuels the fire, the sleepless nights, the ups and the downs. Reward tiers are to the right, whichever you can support is perfect. If you choose not to, that\u0027s totally OK too.\u00a0 Rest assured that the show will always remain free, but if I receive enough financial support each month, then we\u0027ll have the means to bring more experts on, cover more topics, on-board more creators, producers, editors,create more merch, produce extra episodes, and create bonus content. It\u0027s my dream that I can work towards a model that allows me to connect with each and every one of you personally as I build this project into its full potential. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eDisclaimer: \u003c/em\u003eLet\u0027s be super honest with each other - I will not always say things you agree with. That may be opposing views on, or I love/hate a view that you hate/love, etc. We will likely philosophically clash at some point, and that\u0027s perfectly okay! Some people take disagreement more personally and angrily, but that\u0027s not how I roll (you\u0027ll notice that in my content). If you choose to fund my efforts, please be aware that my personal opinion is, well, my personal opinion, and that I will share it even if you aren\u0027t too fond of it. With that said, I\u0027m pretty damn approachable and I will always listen. So keep the dialogue open, and civil. It\u0027s a lot easier on everyone. =)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFist bump X3, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRYANO"
