If you\u0027re an RPG player and you\u0027re looking for game recommendations, we\u0027ve got you covered. If you just want to listen to some loveable goofs improvise a hilarious or maybe even heartbreaking story, we\u0027ve got you too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve loved\u00a0every second of producing the podcast thus far, but since we\u0027re all paying out of pocket for hosting fees, equipment, and game systems, there\u0027s only so much we can do at that level. With a higher budget we can release content more frequently, and with higher production values! Every little bit counts, so if you like what we do and can afford to help us do more of it, please consider becoming one of our Patrons! If you can\u0027t afford it, tell your friends! Thanks for sitting at our table.\u003cbr\u003e"
