If you know a business that would like to take a meaningful role in Arizona\u2019s race for inclusion, please tell them about our nonprofit organization.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur organization is dedicated to sharing the racing and team experience with anyone who wishes to join, including people with special needs and diverse abilities or disabilities. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy putting Arizona\u0027s athletes together in this way, we are fostering relationships and building community networks that can make a big difference for people with disabilities.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAssisted athletes\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nAt the core of our team, we have our assisted athletes.

They work with heart and passion together to get their assisted athlete across the finish line. They have given up the race for personal glory and want to put all their effort into helping their friend.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eUnless they are in an assisted athlete\u2019s immediate family, these volunteers have a minimum fundraising requirement in order to enter each event. We do not require any level of physical fitness for this job, and we\u2019ll try to team you up with a similar group of athletes to help with pace-setting.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe guideline for each team is to finish together, and finish strong! Our teams hold back when an assistant athlete is having trouble with the workout.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDonors \u0026amp; sponsors\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe rely on our donors and sponsors as core teammates. Thanks to the generosity of our community, we are beginning to cover some of our costs. We are a qualified public charity, and donors can deduct contributions they make to our organization under IRC Section 170.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur supporters choose whether they prefer to make a one-time donation when the time is right, or to sign up for an automatic monthly pledge. Either is a fantastic and quick way to make a big difference for our organization.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBusinesses provide us with sponsorships because we are aligned with their core values.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVolunteers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo make this racing experience happen, we need volunteers. It takes a lot of people contributing their time and skills to make our organization run. We need race day volunteers, non-race day volunteers, and long-term administrative volunteers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much does it cost?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur highest costs include:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInsurance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA nonprofit racing team like ours requires multiple types of insurance. Our current insurance costs are about $108 per month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRace entry fees\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe pay for our assisted athletes\u2019 race entry fees (unless they are donated by race organizers). We also pay for their immediate family members to race as assistant athletes. It is important for us to make the racing experience free for them. These costs are usually $300+ for each event.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRacing chairs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe help our assisted athletes employ a fundraising campaign to save up for their own racing chair. Meanwhile, we maintain several racing chairs for those who have not yet gotten one. The cost for these chairs is $3,000 to $5,000 each. They also require costly regular maintenance for safety.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWebsite hosting \u0026amp; systems\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur hosting is currently being donated to us but soon we\u2019ll require high quality website hosting for our site (about $300 per year). We also use a mailing list automation service to manage team emails (another $228 per year).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eNext we\u2019re fundraising for event registration software. These systems range in price and effectiveness ($49+ per month, or $1+ per event registrant).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePromotional materials\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe need to spread the message of inclusion all around Arizona and beyond, and to do this we need to purchase promotional materials ($500+ per year). This includes signs, printed materials, vehicle wraps, custom wheelchair wheel covers, and other promotional items.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTeam apparel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe will try to sell as much of our team apparel as possible at the team store, but we want to give away a lot of Team Hoyt Arizona t-shirts ($300+ per year).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTeam van\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur team needs a vehicle for transportation of our racing gear. We\u0027re currently seeking a sponsorship for this because it will cost thousands of dollars.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe have responsible leadership. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur Board of Directors work together to manage our scheduling, finances, and operations.\u003cstrong\u003e They are all unpaid volunteers and they weigh organizational decisions carefully.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e We\u0027re a qualified public charity.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTeam Hoyt Arizona is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit organization with tax exempt status. \u003c/strong\u003eThis means that donors can deduct contributions they make to Team Hoyt Arizona under IRC Section 170.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow did it start?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLucas King, the son of Steve and Denise King, was born in Tucson in 2007. Steve and Denise were very excited to bring Lucas into the world, and had made a lot of plans together for his future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLife is not simple for Lucas, and he was born ten weeks early with the umbilical cord around his neck, injuring him. None of us can possibly imagine how that changed Steve\u2019s and Denise\u2019s lives unless we have been through it ourselves as parents.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAt nine years old, Lucas is strong and his family is joyful. To hear them talk about it today inspires courage, happiness, and self-reflection. They have moved beyond Lucas\u2019 disabilities to live an amazing life together with him.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSteve and Denise understood very early that Lucas deserves many experiences that are not available to him because companies and organizations don\u2019t have accessible options for people with special needs. They usually needed to make extra effort to make sure people would include Lucas.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLucas\u2019 parents are both athletes, and Lucas loves participating in sports. Basketball, football, baseball, running, cycling \u2013 he loves it all! The rougher, the better! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnytime Steve went running, he\u2019d always take Lucas and push him in the stroller. Lucas loved it, and when they hit bumps he would crack up laughing hysterically. Having seen how much Lucas enjoyed running in his stroller, Denise and Steve became very involved in the wheelchair athletics community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSteve and Denise had an inspiring story with a powerful message. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Lucas take part in this activity?\u201d They became nonprofit activists and devoted enormous energy to public charity activism focused on inclusion.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBy rallying more and more volunteers behind the cause of inclusion, Steve and Denise were inspiring people to action. It was time to get organized!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe Kings were friends with their heroes, Rick and Dick Hoyt, and when they spoke about their organization with them Mr. Hoyt offered them the use of their name. This was a true honor for the organization because of what he and Rick had started.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSteve and Denise put together a Board of Directors and in March, 2016 founded Team Hoyt Arizona. In April the IRS determined our 501 (c) (3) nonprofit to be a qualified public charity and granted us tax exempt status.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve already participated in races in Arizona and Massachusetts, and our calendar has a full race season planned!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0027Yes You Can!\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTucson needs organizations that include people with disabilities in activities and create public awareness.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur organization has high costs of operation, but we\u2019ve succeeded to launch our program thanks to the generosity of our community.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution makes a real difference. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking your time to read our message.
