I decided to start a Patreon account because I love comics and with a little help from you I can bring more of it to the world.I grew up in the 80\u0027s which inspired me immensely to want to draw. I remember getting third place at an art show with a Bart Simpson poster. Drawing has been with me since. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI chose to start here because I saw it as a very cost effective way for people that enjoy my work and want to help. I understand you don\u0027t want to throw your hard earned money just anywhere and you do enjoy supporting creative people. With Patreon\u00a0you can do both which helps us artists directly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut how does Patreon work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is how the pledge system works...you can chose to pledge an amount that is set by me either as a one time per month or a per creation post.\u00a0 This can be as little as 1.00 or as much as you like and the best part is you can cancel anytime or set a limit of how much you wanna give.\u00a0 Below is a more detailed explanation of how it works....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the pledge configuration is \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eper month\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d - you (Patron) will automatically be charged on the 1st of the month regardless\n of how many creations I post. Tends to be a better deal because I do post alot of work.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf the pledge configuration is \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eper creation\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d - Every time I post a new creation then the amount you selected to contibute gets charged. This can be canceled at anytime however.\u003cbr\u003e"
