Now, with the launch of this patreon page and the ability to build on your support, we can continue to grow and share these stories with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon is very simple: you become a patron of the project, \u003cstrong\u003efor a monthly amount of your choosing\u003c/strong\u003e and with your help, I can work on more of the things that make this project so great! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a month donor at any level, your funds will help me continue grow and share this project with you.\u00a0 With your help, The Open Photo Project can continue to increase the depth of the stories that we share within our community and the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the project is long running and can be found on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theopenphotoproject.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTheOpenPhotoProject.com\u003c/a\u003e and all social media, the Patreon Page is brand new!\u00a0 I am still figuring out the rewards for different donation levels.\u00a0 If however, you would like to start the ball rolling and start supporting this project now, you are absolutely invited to do so. The rewards will kick in just as soon as they are ready.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMore detail about The Open Photo Project from Erika:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0I have been working on this project in between other jobs as a self funded part time job for several years and it is truly a labor of love.\u00a0By photographing non-monogamous people in a variety of their everyday activities, I seek to present them as the complex, multi-dimensional human beings that they are.  Whether cooking a meal, on the way to work, or naked with a partner, these images reveal the complex lives of these people and their choices.  A combination of portraits, daily life activities and text excerpts from conversations will show an in-depth look into their lives and relationship choices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to confront the broad misconceptions that exist in the mainstream social landscape where monogamy is the default relationship style (and the only one universally considered ethical).  In addressing people who believe that monogamy is the only acceptable relationship model to cultivate healthy romantic love, I wish to introduce them to the beautiful, complex and fulfilling lives that are possible among non-monogamous people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project offers a look at the uniqueness of human relationships and an invitation to re-examine preconceived notions of successful, sustainable, and healthy romantic love.  Together, let us de-stigmatize ethically non-monogamous relationships by building understanding and respect.  The aim is for more people to accept that while monogamy is a valid relationship choice, there is a wide spectrum of other equally valid choices that can be as varied as the human experience.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
