Or something else.\u003cbr\u003eI am a photographer and occasional writer at a crossroads of their life, figuring some stuff they know out, and some stuff they don\u0027t know. What I do know is that I like taking pictures, pleasing the masses, and earning money. Two out of three of these statements are guaranteed upon starting a patreon page. What is guaranteed for you is a monthly publication of photos and occasional other drabbles to look over and nod inquisitively at.* Most of them involve the outside world, but some might not. All will more than likely involve the color purple, or perhaps green, as they are quality colors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an alumni of North Hennepin Community College, previously a member of student council and the writing club, as well as a digital photography class, among other things. At the time of writing this, I have practically finished (we have two sessions left) a year and a half long running Dungeons and Dragons campaign, with plans and hopes to run another in the future. Photography is a hobby, but I hope to perhaps turn it into a career someday. At the very least, it is a possibility, but an entertaining one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please contact me at thetinwordsmith@gmail.com and I\u0027ll get to you as soon as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*while not required, inquisitive nodding would be appreciated."
