    "summary": "Welcome to the Zen Garden! For friends, fans, and fellow free-thinkers, I answer to Zen... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m based out of Chicago, IL., USA, and I got bored one day (yesterday, July 25, 2017, to be precise) and decided to start this as a creative outlet. I\u0027m not big on social media\u2014no FB, IG, Twitter, or even LinkedIn\u2014although, that may change at some point. I do like this site\u0027s interface and premise though, so... why not?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy stats: 5\u00273, 110-127, depending on weight fluctuations, black hair, brown eyes, Asian, rather intelligent, though not completely jaded (maybe only 85%?), and sometimes pretty funny\u2014others have said it, not just me! My most oft-played fantasy/daydream is winning the Powerball lottery, so I can travel and grow into my best self\u2014which I know is in there, but has been repressed by life stresses and worries. Boo! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI heard about Patreon via a Yahoo! news article, and was intrigued by the idea of a space that seems to be (to me) an amalgamation of a blog \u0026amp; portfolio display and work space with the potential for financial patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt heart, I\u0027ve always been a Creative, and my strengths lie in my abilities to perceive, conceive, communicate, interpret, and occasionally, problem solve and innovate\u2014whether through verbal or visual mediums, and this online space lends itself to flexibly express myself through either. While my degree is in design\u2014my \"adopted\" love (I\u0027ve always thought of it as)\u2014my \"native\" passion lies in the written word. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up, I\u0027ve always \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eLOVED\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e to read, voraciously and obsessively at times. I remember being 9-10 yrs old, and reading through 4-5 200-300 page books per day. While I still love reading, I\u0027ve had to give up doing that from actual books, due to cataracts as well as being nearsighted. Sadness!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a passion for beauty in the visual realm as well, but in that I tend to prefer appreciation over participation at times. I\u0027m a big fan of vintage fashion from bygone eras, enjoy museums, architecture, colors, textures, and just \u003cem\u003eLOOKING\u003c/em\u003e at beautiful, interesting things/people/imagery.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSooo... this page will be a compilation of my thoughts, moods, photos, and life, expressed through cyber ciphers or virtual visuals. Perhaps you could view this as a journal meets performance piece via the medium of pixels? I also want to get back into doing more writing, and hope this will help me better expand, express, and return to my core creative self (I hope).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love words. They have texture, taste, feeling, form and \u003cem\u003elife\u003c/em\u003e to me, so you\u0027ll see a lot of those. Hopefully, you\u0027ll read things from me that will make you think, laugh, or maybe see the world (or bits of it) in a way you never would\u0027ve conceived of on your own. I can sometimes wax excessively expressive, but I admire economy of verbiage, which is something else I\u0027ll also try to work on here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve learned to enjoy self-portraiture via photography, so you\u0027ll see those too. However, for many of those as well as some of my written posts, you\u0027ll have to become a patron. In part, it\u0027s due to the adult nature of some of my pictures, and because I think if there are those out there with genuine interest in me, I\u0027d like them to pledge to that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also sing, so occasionally, I may throw in a random audiofile of myself doing that, just because I can. I\u0027m not awesome, but I can at least carry a tune, and first and foremost before anything, this page is for me\u2014with or without \"patronage\" or interest by anyone else. :p\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I ever get brave enough, I may even try out videos, though I\u0027m not really sure what that content would be. Nothing blatantly sexual, for all you pervos out there. ;p\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I\u0027m not averse to engaging with anyone who\u0027s interesting, intelligent, curious, and genuine, so if you have a question, or manage to snag me into some kind of dialogue, I give as good as I get. But be forewarned, I \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eadore\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e braingasms\u00a9 , and sadly, there aren\u0027t many out there who\u0027ve been able to give them to me. If you can, I\u0027ll be addicted. If you can\u0027t, no hard feelings, as I generally don\u0027t expect much from most people anyway. *insert wry sardonic smile*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, that\u0027s about it for now...\u003cbr\u003e"
