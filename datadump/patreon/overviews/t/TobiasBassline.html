PLEASE READ! ***\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDear fans and friends,\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m in a really bad situation and I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat happened?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you will remember that I was six months in a prison, back in the first half of 2016. On 17. December 2015 police raided my home and found around 450g cannabis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here is the whole story behind:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNine years ago I had a pretty good life: I had a good job as supervisor at the BMW customer support, I had a nice wife and I got my first brandnew car (a BMW 120d). But in the end of 2008 I became chronic headache. It came and stayed until today: I have headache from the morning until the evening. Every minute of every day - about 3000 days nonstop now! :(\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy life changed dramatically due to this.\u003cbr\u003eFirst I lost my job, then in 2011 I lost my car and in 2012 my wife, after being together for 9 years - she left me because she fell in love with a 20 year older colleague of her. All this crap caused strong depressions, in addition to my chronic headache. From that moment I focused totally on my music. \u003cbr\u003eWithout my music I would have committed suicide without doubt. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid you visit some specialists about your headache?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course I went to countless doctors and health practioners. They found all the same - nothing! Also nothing which helps to lower my headache. Nothing but cannabis - around 2013 I noticed that it helps to reduce my headache at least a bit, which nothing else was able to do, and so cannabis became my medicine! \u003cbr\u003eBut it costs quite a lot (11-15\u20ac/g) and it is illegal here, even for most medical purposes. \u003cbr\u003eWithout job and without the financial help from my wife, it was totally impossible to get my medicine, which costs me about 300\u20ac/month. \u003cbr\u003eSo I started to sell cannabis to my friends. It went good for quite a long time but my weed was too good and so the smell was to strong. One of my neighbours informed the police and they raided my home.\u003cbr\u003eI had my court case on 30.06.2016. I was sentenced to 2 years but I came out with 3 years on probation. \u003cbr\u003eThe worst thing is that I\u0027m not allowed to smoke cannabis now, but in March 2017 there will be a new law about the medical use of cannabis here in Germany, and I hope to get it on prescription then!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s your problem now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy far my biggest problem is that I\u0027m TOTALLY broke now!\u003cbr\u003eI have around 150\u20ac from the welfare per month, which is far not enough for anything. :(\u003cbr\u003eI still have to pay 3000\u20ac legal costs to the court and 5000\u20ac to my lawyer.\u003cbr\u003eWith my zero income it will take ages to pay all that.\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course it is absolutely impossible to buy any new music at the moment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut you\u0027re an awesome artist! Don\u0027t you earn a lot of money with your gigs?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately no! :( The Psytrance scene is still pretty much underground (for example you don\u0027t hear any Psytrance on TV \u0026amp; Radio, beside in Israel maybe). I\u0027m happy when I get 250\u20ac for one gig of 2 hours. Often it\u0027s even lower, because most parties are pretty small. For example, in entire 2015 I had less than 1000\u20ac income overall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShouldn\u0027t you earn quite some money with your YouTube channel? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, unfortunately no! :( Though I have one of the biggest Psytrance channels on YouTube (\u0026gt;53000 subscribers) with over 20 million plays - which makes me probably the most listened Psytrance DJ on the planet - I don\u0027t earn any money with it. That\u0027s because you have to own the rights of everything you upload, to monetize your videos. As DJ I don\u0027t have any rights on the music - only the labels and producers have. In fact it is illegal to upload mixes on YouTube! It\u0027s currently a greyzone - only due to YouTube\u0027s content ID system the labels are quite ok with that nowadays, because they are able to monetize any videos which contains their property! But every rights owner could make a takedown request on my videos. After 3 of them my channel would be gone forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can we help you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI HAVE  A DREAM: I would like to make a living from my art! \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make a living and being able to pay my flat, food, taxes, health insurance, retirement pension and my music I would need quite some income. With playing live I would need to earn A LOT more per gig than I do now and I would need to play every weekend. That is absolutely impossible because of a few reasons: Noone would pay me a lot more per gig and I\u0027m really far away from having a gig every weekend. And of course it would be far too exhausting with my health problems, to play four times a month anywhere in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBUT THERE IS YOU, THE PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET - MY WORLDWIDE FANBASE!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf everyone of my 53000 YouTube subscribers would send me only 1\u20ac per year, I would have a bigger income than I had in my last job! Of course not everyone will send me money, so please think about yourself. How many hours did you enjoy my art to the most? How many hours you listen to it over and over again? Compare that with any other things you love \u0026amp; enjoy to do, and how much you need pay for these activities (e.g. going to the cinema or parties, buying DVDs or Blurays, etc.). Also please keep in mind that only my chronic headache made me able to create most of my mixes, which you enjoy so much! I wouldn\u0027t have had the time to create them, if I would work in a fulltime job, since I need about 150-200 hours to complete a new mix!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDonating me some money would help me A LOT these days!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEverone who donates at least 3$ will get an exclusive early access to my newest mixes on YouTube \u0026amp; SoundCloud, two weeks before everyone else (doesn\u0027t count for my \"Live at xyz\" mixes)! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you already donated before, please get in contact with me, to get on the early access mailing list!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next mix project in the pipeline will be called \"Gamma-Ray Burst\" (aka Supernova 2!). I decided to create a space trilogy, instead of simply naming it Supernova Vol. 2. Beginning with Supernova, followed by Gamma-Ray Burst and Black Hole!\u003cbr\u003eGamma-Ray Bursts are by far the most energetic events in the universe, and Black Holes are by far the most massive objects.\u003cbr\u003eI think that fits perfectly! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help me, to make this dream come true!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyours sincerely\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTobias \u0027TB\u0027 Bassline\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: If you can\u0027t afford to donate me any money, please share my videos to all your friends at least! Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
