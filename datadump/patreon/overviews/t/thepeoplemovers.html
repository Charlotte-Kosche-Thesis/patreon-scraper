    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eMeet the People\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe People Movers is a dance and production collaborative led by me: choreographer \u0026amp; producer Kate Ladenheim. We tell stories about urgent social, political, and cultural happenings. Our work is savvy, slightly obsessive and awkward \u2014 and asks careful questions about our culture and how we, as individuals, fit inside of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur performances are not just for stages. We put dance inside of warehouses, offices, apartments, phones, social media, daily interactions, and more. Inspired by the implicit urgency of these environments, our work zooms in on the ways people perform their everyday lives and survive in culture. Our work shows why this way of living is so isolating, so white hipster millennial, so problematic and so rich to unpack.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to our own artistic projects, The People Movers construct tightly curated, impossibly cool, and expertly produced events in unexpected environments. Our productions raise up the work of artists whose work is provocative, critical, conscientious, and wholly original.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe answer is simple: we\u2019re here because \u003cstrong\u003eit takes a lot of resources to make well-crafted art.\u003c/strong\u003e We\u2019ve always been scrappy and resourceful, but we can\u2019t make our work without four important things: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eTIME: We spend creative time researching and brainstorming ideas, creating and perfecting movement in rehearsal, training and taking care of our bodies, traveling, applying for funding and opportunities, marketing, communicating with community members and collaborators, and more. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSPACE: We need safe, accessible spaces for rehearsals and production\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEQUIPMENT: We need the props, costuming, and equipment - both for artistic reasons and to make our productions look professional and complete\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd above all else, PEOPLE: We believe firmly that everyone deserves to be paid for their time, and that people do their best and most committed work when they are fairly compensated for their time and contributions - so we work to ensure that all of our staff and collaborators are paid for their time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWe are leveling up.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn just the past year, we created and filmed our newest work Glass, supported by fellowships at LEIMAY and a residency at University of Georgia, Athens. We\u2019ve shown work at National Sawdust, SOAK, Gowanus Loft, and DanceNOW at Joe\u2019s Pub. We choreographed for a music video for our favorite upstart band, Overcoats. And we weren\u2019t quiet on the production side, either: we produced and curated performances inside of a Camera Obscura exhibit, and hosted two CRAWLs: our signature nomadic performance series. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext year, we\u2019re showing no signs of stopping. Coming up we have teaching engagements in Oaxaca, Mexico with the Juntos Collective, a tour to the Performance Arcade all the way in New Zealand, and the film release and live performance premiere of Glass. And if that weren\u2019t enough - we\u2019ve started work on a brand new piece called \u201cOh, Celine\u201d that explores Diva behavior in a performance made especially for Youtube, Instagram, and a carefully curated lifestyle blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re SO EXCITED to bring all of this to you - but we also know that \u003cstrong\u003eleveling up means having the finances in place to take these opportunities and squeeze every last drop of impact out of them. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy giving us a monthly donation, you\u0027re making sure that we can approach all of our lofty goals for 2018 with less fear and greater ambition. Plus you get our super sweet perks - including early access to our video releases, hilarious review videos, process notes and more. Every little bit that you contribute makes a **huge** difference for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour ongoing support means we can spend more time making great things. We can offer our collaborators more work, and value them higher for the amazing things they are already doing.  Most of all, though, it means that we can continue creating beautiful, moving performances and share them with you, our friends and supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecause really, you\u0027re the ones who keep the people moving.\u003c/strong\u003e"
