    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eA little about me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tjbanski.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTJ Banski\u003c/a\u003e! Born in the Pacific Northwest with a beautiful view of Mount Rainier. I enjoy writing, music and art. I first began writing at a young age and well haven\u0027t stopped. During a summer\nnight in 2013, I had a dream of a secret world that was right under our noses. All from third\nperson perspective I watched as a confused blond haired young man came faced to\nface with a creature one could only imagine in fairy tales or legends. The creature\nemerged from a brown hair young man only after being exposed through a sphere\nlike chamber created from a device that tainted the known reality. Yet no one\nelse could see what was happening.  There\nin the middle of the sphere like chamber was a young woman with glowing eyes\nand wielding a force sword confronting the creature. I woke excitedly and\nimmediately wrote down all the details I could about this dream. After\nencouragement from friends and family and a time crunch event during the month\nof November, known as National Write a Novel Month that I made this scene\nbecome it\u0027s own creature of a book. I soon made it into the series of books\nsoon to be.  Outlining in progress.\u003cbr\u003eThe wielders book series in retrospect is what I call a mix of Avatar the last airbender meets the immortal instrument series. A light vs dark, a discovery of one\u0027s true potential and a love that trancends time are the radiating themes through out the series. The first novel takes place in pacific northwest in and around my home town Olympia. Many different places I have visited are places my characters have either met or encounter creatures from beyond. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e? This website is dedicated to having artists show case their work and get the support they need to continue the work patreons like you enjoy! With each pledge, supporters can gain access to different tiers rewards, such as the first chapter to book 1!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon you ask\u003c/strong\u003e? In the recent years I have dedicated only a few moments to my novel series, long nights, weekends but it still wasn\u0027t enough. It became difficult to find a balance and I had to tuck my novel away for a time. With Patreon I can do the necessary research to travel to the places i have written about, write more content with connections I make with fans, the experiences I have and hire a graphics designer, filmographer to help market my book. \u003cbr\u003eI\nwanted to write this series to bring a little more fantasy to everyday life.\nFantasy books such as Harry Potter Series, Immortal Instrument Series, and the\nDresden Files have really helped me escape from reality even if for a little\nwhile and sometimes come back with a different perspective. The authors of\nthese series have really inspired me to continue writing. My hope is to inspire\nyoung writers to keep writing and follow their dreams. \u003cbr\u003e"
