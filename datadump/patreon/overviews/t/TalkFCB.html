    "summary": "Hi there! It was just over a three years ago now that I made the decision to start TalkFCB. I created my YouTube channel because I felt as though it was something Bar\u00e7a fans desperately needed - particularly during the hard times, and equally, the very successful times of the club.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I want to make this point absolutely clear - I have always maintained that I don\u0027t do TalkFCB for the money. I, like you guys, have a strong passion for Barcelona and football in general, and that is my driving motivation behind the channel and always will be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuite simply, in TalkFCB, I wanted to create a place where cul\u00e9s could gather to exchange opinions, connect with other fans and generally get involved in the day-to-day activities surrounding FC Barcelona.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to make it as easy a possible for Bar\u00e7a fans to engage with each other - no matter where you live in the world - and I\u0027ve been amazed at how many fans from so many different countries get regularly involved on the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s now April, 2018 and thanks to you guys, the most successful period of TalkFCB. I\u0027ve hit over 75,000 subscribers - which really is incredible to me - I could have never dreamt of this. The hard work and dedication over the past few years has been more than worth it so see all of you guys connecting on the channel, it\u0027s awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd it\u0027s been a really incredible journey so far! You guys are the best audience anyone could wish for. I try to reply to as many comments as is possible on the channel, and I\u0027m always interested to hear what you have to say in response to my videos. I really do try to take all of your feedback on board and constantly work on improving your experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always looking to improve on the channel and a number of people have asked if they could support the channel further, so I thought I would set up this page just to give you the opportunity todo so if you wished - so no pressure whatsoever! You are under absolutely no obligation to contribute in any way, your support alone helps me enough. But this is just here for you, if you want to go the extra step or feel that my work deserves this extra measure. It\u0027s completely up to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I will say though is that I greatly appreciate every last one of you who support the channel, get involved and enjoying listening to my opinions. Like I said before, I honestly couldn\u0027t wish for a better audience - and I hope there\u0027s lots more to come from TalkFCB in the near future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main goals are:\u003cbr\u003e- Consistent uploads on the channel, aiming to upload at least once each day where possible\u003cbr\u003e- Continuing match preview \u0026amp; reviews, as well as adding more in-depth analysis such as tactical previews \u0026amp; reviews\u003cbr\u003e- Historic Bar\u00e7a moments videos\u003cbr\u003e- Always looking to provide new and refreshing content for your enjoyment\u003cbr\u003e- Continuing to provide Bar\u00e7a updates on social media, such as Twitter, Facebook \u0026amp; Instagram.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ll join me for the journey!\u003cbr\u003e"
