     "description": "Early access to alpha features. One of the biggest things you\u0027ll have access to that others won\u0027t is epilogues, since most are still under construction. Other early alpha features often include the newest NPCs and newest actions. You also get access to some debug functions that let you vary body size / vary stats / ignore dignity limitations and lots of other cool stuff willy-nilly. If you upgraded from a lower pledge amount then you won\u0027t see the thank you screen, so go here to get the unlock file: \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/19103067\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/posts/19103067\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo find out what exactly is in the alpha version right now, go to the \"restricted features\" page on my blog. \u003ca href=\"http://www.trapquest.com/restricted-features/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eh\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPLEASE NOTE that when you stop pledging, you will find that the unlock file changes some time in the future (usually every couple of months) and you\u0027ll no longer get access to any new debug features that appear after the date you stop pledging. However the current system is that your unlock file will retain access to everything that was added before the date you stopped pledging.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e",
