I, as head researcher, am dedicated to looking at the mechanics of writing in multiple genres to learn what makes good writing... well... good. After an analysis, I create exercises for aspiring writers to hone their craft using the possible techniques they have learned from my findings. At the end of the month, the lab will host a poll to see which exercise the patrons wish to see turned into a piece of short fiction for the following month. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYour support means an incredible amount to me at the lab, as it gives me the money I need to conduct further research and explore the wonders of writing. If you choose to become a lab assistant by donating funds, I am humbled by your contribution and valuable time. \u003cbr\u003eNow, with my thanks and explanations out of the way, it\u0027s time for me to research and learn. Do you care to join?"
