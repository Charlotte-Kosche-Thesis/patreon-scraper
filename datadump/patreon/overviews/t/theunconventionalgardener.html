I\u0027m a keen gardener, a published author and an ethnobotanist, but you may well know me better as the voice of The Alternative Kitchen Garden Show. My gardening podcast, focusing on growing useful and edible plants in an environmentally-friendly way, was on air from 2007 to 2014, covering topics as widespread as home composting to growing plants in space. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Alternative Kitchen Garden Show was a free and ad-free podcast, a real labour of love. I had to call it a day due to domestic upheaval. I got divorced, sold my house and garden, went back to school to do a Masters in Ethnobotany, then embarked on a new life with a new house and a new garden that started out as a weedy lawn and a lot of mud....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love reading and learning about plants (particularly edible ones), but I find that traditional gardening magazines don\u0027t tend to cater for an audience that has developed beyond articles on when to sow your carrots and how to build a raised bed out of pallets. There are also wonderful gardening blogs out there, but filtering through them to find nuggets of exciting plant information takes a while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to fill the gap and create exciting reading materials for edible plant nerds everywhere, to write the kind of wordy, nerdy botanical articles I\u0027d really love to be reading.\u00a0If this mission is to succeed, and to reach as wide an audience as possible, then I need your help! Much as I would like to, I can\u0027t currently afford to do a lot of background research as a labour of love. But if you can contribute just a little - $1 would be fine - to support me each month, and if we can get enough people to do the same, then we can create an army of edible plant nerds around the world :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you! I really do appreciate your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
