There is a new video every day Monday through Thursday at 4pm Eastern.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy The Johno Show is on Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Johno Show is currently in its third year. It\u2019s been an amazing journey. Having started the channel as a daily vlog then changing it to focus on the 2016 Presidential Election and finally being true to myself and the message I wanted to focus on; together with your help we have built a great resource for the Cannabis community. You have helped transform The Johno Show into a well watched and liked channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon it\u0027s like an ongoing Kickstarter campaign where the people who enjoy The Johno Show content can help support the show financially and in return we can provide some cool rewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBehind-the-Scenes Access - Full unedited footage\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive Giveaways - Automatic entry into exclusive giveaways for Patreon members only\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStump The Guest Additional Questions - Two questions exclusive for our Patreon members.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrivate Party Invites - Get on the list to private parties\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSponsor Listing - Your name/company listed at the end of each show\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly Notification - \u00a0Get notified of the strain being reviewed each week.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFan Favorite Video: \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/58M0Jw8GDdE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Does The Johno Show Need Your Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I switched The Johno Show from politics to cannabis I knew I would get some push back. I just didn\u0027t realize that push back would come from YouTube itself. YouTube has demonetize all of my cannabis related videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I need your help to keep this channel going and I\u0027ve made it fun for you as well. If you\u0027ve watched my recent videos and particularly those where I\u0027m interviewing members of the community you may have realized they are heavily edited for time. At just $4.20 a month you\u0027ll gain access to the behind-the-scenes hilarity that often has to be taken out due to time restrictions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, going forward, all giveaways on The Johno Show will only be open to Patreon members. I found that many people entering The Johno Show contests were actually just contest whores. You know, those people that sign up for every single contest under the sun. Some of them have social media accounts specifically for entering contests and nothing else.\u00a0The point of the contests on The Johno Show is to reward my audience. Not some person whose just looking to fill up their garage with free stuff. So starting now members of The Johno Show Patreon Family are automatically entered into the contests and they are the only ones eligible to win.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I\u0027ve made the decision not to take on any more work outside of The Johno Show. I realized it is a big risk but I believe the reward is being able to dedicate 100% of my time to building this channel. If you have ever had a dream that required your full attention then you understand why your support is so critical to my success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider becoming a member of The Johno Show family and helping to make my dreams come true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you,\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJohno"
