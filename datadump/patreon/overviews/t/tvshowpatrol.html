    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello TV lovers! (Lovers of TV?)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks so much for clicking over to my Patreon page. Two years ago I launched\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tvshowpatrol.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etvshowpatrol.com\u003c/a\u003e to share my love of TV through interviews, features, videos and recommendations. You can support this venture here, by becoming a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo why should you throw me some cash? I\u2019m working hard over here to give you an entertaining and informative look at TV, hopefully with some humor and style. I\u2019ve been writing professionally about TV for 10 years now while working other jobs in journalism. But entertainment writing jobs seem to be disappearing as fast as \u201cGames of Thrones\u201d kills off characters.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWith so many new TV shows popping up, viewers need more than a few perspectives to help them choose what\u2019s worth watching. I think I approach every show on its own merits, giving all a fair shake. I don\u2019t always like everything, but I believe any creative endeavor has some redeeming value. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn other words, I\u2019m not a jaded beotch. Really!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI take deep dives into historical dramas such as \u201cVikings,\u201d \u201cVersailles\u201d and \u201cOutlander.\u201d  I also dig science fiction and fantasy shows such as \u201cSense8\u201d and \u201cInto the Badlands.\u201d Those two also scratch my itch for action, as do \u201cAnimal Kingdom\u201d and \u201cStrike Back.\u201d (Yes, it is coming back and I will write all about it!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs a Chicagoan, I couldn\u2019t be more excited the One Chicago shows exist\u2014and have helped draw other productions to town. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBeing just a bit irreverent tends to bring out the best in my interview subjects, allowing me to give readers a little more than they get elsewhere. Milo Ventimiglia shared his thoughts on exposing his butt, for example. And I totally made Philip Winchester cry on camera! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to hear about less well-known shows, I can help. I devour international series offered on streaming services both common and obscure. I would love to share that passion with all of you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eTo everyone who reads my site, thank you. New readers, please check it out. My TV coverage isn\u2019t subscription-based or behind a pay wall and I would love, eventually, to ditch advertising on the site. I find ads just as annoying as any other reader. And you can help me do this!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page allows anyone who enjoys the site to make ongoing contributions (like a Kickstarter, but monthly) in order to keep that coverage going.\u00a0As you can see in the goals section on this page, I have a lot of plans. I just need the time and cash to execute them. That\u2019s where you come in, most beloved readers. The more pledges I get, the more I will be able to concentrate on TV Show Patrol. And the more content you get to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u2019t pitch in, no worries. I still appreciate you visiting the site and reading. But if you dig my coverage on a regular basis and have the means to show some love, then by all means\u2014become a patron! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you for listening. Now back to your regularly scheduled programming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
