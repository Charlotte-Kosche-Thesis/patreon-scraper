I want to use this platform to try a different kind of storytelling, the\nkind where the reader is involved and helps choose the direction of the story. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis could be awesome fun or a horrible\ndisaster, but there\u2019s only one way to find out and that is to start. So this is\nme starting.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecause I like HEA or HFN endings I know where\nwe\u2019re going to end. I also know the start and the characters, what happens in the\nmiddle is up to you as each month you\u2019ll get to vote on three options. I\u2019ll\nthen write the next bit post it and give you three options (until we are done). I\u0027m estimating\u00a010-12 episodes per story (one complete\nstory a year). \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt the end of each story I\u2019ll get it professionally\nedited and turn it into an ebook and print book. You\u2019ll get it first (and a\nmention in the acknowledgements if you subscribe at that level). If you want to\nswitch up your support over the year no problems. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ll be posting up the chapters at the start of each month and there\u2019ll be a poll for how teh story should continue. The most\npopular option will be the direction for the story\u2026what could possibly go\nwrong? \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJoin me and find out!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n(Note: if it all goes horribly wrong I\u2019ll put the\nwhole thing on pause so you don\u2019t get charged).\u003cbr\u003e"
