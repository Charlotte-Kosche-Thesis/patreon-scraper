     "about": "Hi, I\u2019m Justin, and I love using SketchUp! I started using SketchUp a few years ago while working at a general contracting company. I had used other 3d modeling programs in the past, and SketchUp immediately made on impact on my with its ease of use and its \u201cfun factor.\u201d While using other programs was a bit of a drag, everything I made in SketchUp was a lot more fun.\u003cbr\u003eI started modeling things just for fun in my free time. I\u2019d see a building that I liked and try to draw it in 3d, or I\u2019d create a model of my living room so my wife could see what it would look like in different colors. Whenever I\u2019m modeling in SketchUp, the possibilities just feel endless! This is the feeling I\u2019m hoping to convey to other users with this website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePersonal Life\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born and raised in Colorado, and now live just north of Colorado Springs with my wife, 3 dogs, and ever increasing herd of horses.\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u2019m not creating SketchUp tutorials, I spend my time trail running with my border collie best buddy Bonnie, fishing, exercising, and trying to do whatever I can to enjoy the beautiful outdoors in Colorado.\u003cbr\u003e",
