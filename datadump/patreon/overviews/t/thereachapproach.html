This allowed the results to be contrasted and compared\nwithin different environments and over time.\u00a0 We\u0027ve come to see that the results are not unique to the UK and are relevant across the world, which is why our \u003ca href=\"http://www.thereachapproach.co.uk/approach/the-story-of-health-the-missing-link/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ework/model\u003c/a\u003e has had such extensive appeal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  \nThe primary premise of\nall the research was to establish what happens both in the short and\nlonger term to individuals who received therapeutic support to\naddress their emotional and psychological issues.  The results were\nvery illuminating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.unitedrant.co.uk/Paul/Patreon5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat the research\nuncovered was that in all cases, regardless of the organization\u2019s\nfocus and specialism, and the culture, gender and race of those who participated, at least 75% of the service users, clients and\npatients found that the initial help they received was not sufficient\nto sustain their recovery.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat the clients reported was that\nsomewhere between 3 and 12 months after the therapeutic intervention/community based support\nthey found themselves in need of further assistance.  In\nsome instances this involved going back to the same organization\noften with the same problems but in the vast majority of cases,\nclients opted to access alternative services due to their\nembarrassment or sense of failure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have come to\ndescribe this pattern as the \u2018revolving door of therapy\u0027 because\nwhat became clear was that clients were only getting enough to help\nthem deal with their presenting symptoms whilst the underlying causes\ncontinued to wreak havoc in some other way in their lives.   This is\nwhy they found themselves going round the same loop, trying to find a\nway to break out of that cycle.\u00a0  It was clear something else was\nneeded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 1990 Easton Hamilton\nfounded Reach as a direct response to this \u2018revolving door\u2019\nproblem.  Having worked in numerous social-care organizations,\nspecializing in mental health and having been instrumental in the\naforementioned research, he learned that a new approach was needed\nand wanted to establish an organization that looked at the \u2018whole\nperson\u2019 rather than focusing only on an individual\u0027s symptoms - and so Reach was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  \nLittle did he know then\nthat Reach would become not only a national psychotherapy and\npersonal development practice, specializing in a mind-body approach\nto health but that its influence in the following 3 decades would\nextend across the world.\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"http://www.thereachapproach.co.uk/contributions/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSee what our clients say about us.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope we have said\nenough to encourage you to join us in this positive revolution; a\nrevolution that is about changing hearts and minds, a revolution that\nis encouraging us to take responsibility for our lives in such a way\nthat we make, however small, some contribution to making this a\nbetter world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease join us and\nbecome part of the solution!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.unitedrant.co.uk/Paul/Patreon3.jpg\" title=\"\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
