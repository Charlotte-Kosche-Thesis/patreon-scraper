    "summary": "If you\u0027re finding this page, I\u0027m guessing you stumbled across my blog, or maybe you\u0027ve been reading my work for a long time now (I\u0027ve been at it since the turn of the last century). \u00a0From the time I was a little kid and we first moved to Sap Bush Hollow, I knew three things:\u003cbr\u003e1. \u00a0I never wanted to leave.\u003cbr\u003e2. \u00a0I wanted to tell stories.\u003cbr\u003e3. \u00a0I wanted my love for the land and stories to help make the world a better place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s what I do.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m a third generation farmer, and I\u2019ve been a professional writer all my adult life. I also run a farm-to-table cafe in our little hamlet of West Fulton. \u00a0As you might have noticed from the list of cookbooks on my website, I\u0027m pretty handy in the kitchen. So we use our farm products to feed our neighbors and keep a community space available. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile Sap Bush Hollow Farm manages to sell enough chickens, pork chops and fresh eggs to cover the bills, it doesn\u0027t pay me to do what I do best:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTelling stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd honestly, a lot of my time goes to that. \u00a0And a lot of folks seem to like it. \u00a0My work goes all over the world. \u00a0My essays are read throughout North America, as well as in South America, the Middle East, Europe, Australia and Asia. The essays are bundled into collected anthologies and published, they are distributed in college classrooms. They are printed off and handed around, forwarded through email, reposted on Facebook. They are read by lawmakers, by the media, and by people like you, who dream of a sustainable future, where family, community, spirit, justice and the health of the planet are at the soul of every life choice. They are read, quoted and distributed by the radical left, by ardent libertarians, by the conservative right, by militant centrists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut without donations and my patrons, all of this goes uncompensated. \u00a0And while it feeds my heart to create this work, it doesn\u0027t feed my family. \u00a0The continuation of my work is dependent solely upon donations and patrons.\u00a0I don\u0027t accept advertising, I don\u0027t accept money to endorse products, I don\u0027t allow guest posts from companies who pay to \"rent my blog\" and have my audience\u0027s attention. \u00a0I simply write for people like you, who come to my work to\u00a0explore the human side of sustainability:  how to hold families and communities together, and how to live happily while weathering the great political and ecological storms facing our world.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMaybe some of you have been occasional donors in the past, and the idea of Patronage through Patreon is a new one for you. Patreon is a website dedicated to helping artists generate steady monthly income.  It isn\u2019t like Kickstarter, where your one-time donation helps to fund a big project.  Patreon is about smaller donations, given on a recurring basis.  By using this website to become my patron, you will help me to even out my income and support my family. \u00a0Your contribution helps to offset the costs of managing the blog, on which I publish twice per week during our farm\u0027s growing season, from mid-May until mid-December. \u00a0During the winter months, the blog goes quiet while I retreat and work on my full-length projects. \u00a0Your ongoing patronage during that time helps to keep the bills paid while I do work that requires my full attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFarming is how I give back to my family, my community, and the earth beneath my feet.  Writing is how I give back to the world. \u00a0And your monthly gift to me will help me give back even more. \u00a0As you can see from the different goals I\u0027ve set, your contribution plays a key role in helping me push my work further into the world. \u00a0And I\u0027m grateful for it. \u00a0Thanks for considering.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I GREW UP ON SAP BUSH HOLLOW FARM, and in 1999, after getting engaged, Bob and I bought a sunny little cabin 7 miles up the road. It was the biggest move of my life. The cabin blossomed into a solar home where Bob and I produce handcrafts and school our two daughters while working on the farm with my mom and dad. I also write.\u003cbr\u003eI hold a bachelors degree in creative writing from Binghamton University, and a masters and Ph.D. in sustainable agriculture and community development from Cornell. My essays and articles have appeared in myriad regional and national publications, including \u003cem\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Boston Review\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eNortheast Public Radio\u003c/em\u003e. My quirky lifestyle, my (admittedly imperfect) attempts to live a life of personal accountability and sustainability, and my research and writings about homemaking as an ecological movement have landed me and my family on the pages of the \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eBrain Child Magazine\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eU.S. News and World Report, \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eLancaster Farming\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSmall Farm Quarterly\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eHobby Farm Home Magazine\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe New York Times Magazine\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Atlantic\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eNational Public Radio\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eGrit\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eYes!

After having myriad unpleasant experiences in the conventional publishing arena, I moved to self-publishing my books, and publishing my blog posts/essays for free.\u003cbr\u003eFrom May through Mid-December, I write weekly essays that appear on my blog,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theradicalhomemaker.net\"\u003eThe Radical Homemaker.net\u003c/a\u003e. The blog is followed by thousands of individuals and families around the United States and the world who are believe a peaceful, socially just world begins on the home front. During the winter I hibernate and work on my book manuscripts. I have a long list of writing projects to fill those months. At the top right now is my first novel, \u003cem\u003eAngels and Stones\u003c/em\u003e (almost done\u2026I think!); as well as a non-fiction project \u2013 \u003cem\u003eLess Stress, More Profit: A Radical Homemaker\u0027s Vision for Sustainable Entrepreneurship\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e",
