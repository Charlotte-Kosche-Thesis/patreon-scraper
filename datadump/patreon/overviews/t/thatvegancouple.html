We were hoping to fund the creation of this content with regular and consistent advertising from ethical businesses. Despite the show being a wonderful success with over 175 international 5-star ratings on iTunes, and over 90,000 downloads in less than 6 months, unfortunately we were unable to attract enough advertising to cover the cost of equipment, production time (including scripting, recording, editing, uploading, and promoting), and the cost of hosting the show. Yes it actually costs us to host the Podcast on a media hosting site! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe positive and supportive feedback we receive about our Podcast is overwhelming, and we desperately want to keep the show going! So, the only way we can make producing Podcast content sustainable longterm, is by offering Podcast episodes as a \u2018reward\u2019 here on Patreon. ALL Patrons giving $1 a month or more, will have access to ALL our Podcast episodes which will be uploaded here on Patreon. That\u2019s only $12 a year for access to quality, educational, entertaining, and often life changing content! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eJust to be clear, whether you pledge $1 or $100, ALL our Patrons will have access to ALL our Podcast episodes via Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe aim to upload 1 new episode every week - so 4 episodes a month. However we don\u2019t like making promises we can\u2019t keep, and realistically sometimes \u201clife happens\u201d. Which means some months we may only be able to upload 3 or 2 episodes (or 1 episode if the wheels really fall off!) \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBut for only $1 a month, you\u2019ve got nothing to lose, and only amazing content to gain. As a Patron, you will receive an email notifying you every time we upload a new episode. You can also cancel your pledge at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe will be keeping our first 25 Free Podcast episodes up on our website for new listeners to come and experience our show before deciding to join us for paid content here on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eDisclaimer:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn the rare occasion, there may be a special Podcast episode that we feel is important to be made free to the public.
