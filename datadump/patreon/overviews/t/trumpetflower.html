I\u0027m a painter, cartoonist, and childcare worker living in Portland, OR. I love my part-time job wrangling schoolchildren, but art is my life. I\u0027ve been painting pictures and drawing comics since before I learned to read or write. My Patreon campaign is about making art a self-sustaining part of my awesome existence on this planet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main subject matter is cartoon animals. I\u0027ve been fascinated with animal characters for as long as I can remember. Cute, charismatic and a bit mysterious, they appear in everything from ancient folklore to junk food advertisements. I\u0027m interested in how animal characters can be used to portray the human experience, in ways both lighthearted and profound. In fact, my work tends to run the gamut from light to dark, and my target audience ranges from young children to adults.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy usual choice of media are pen \u0026amp; ink and gouache, watercolor or acrylic paints. Everything I do is completely hand-drawn and hand-painted, with minimal photoshop intervention. Nothing against computers, I just love the look \u0026amp; feel of paint on paper.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some of the many things I look forward to sharing with my patrons:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePaintings \u0026amp; illustrations\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eComics (fiction, autobiographical, surreal, strange or silly)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIllustrated stories\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eColoring pages\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnimations\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHand-painted treasures (ornaments, pendants, etc.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArt activities and lessons for kids\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGreeting cards, postcards and the like\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting my Patreon campaign means empowering me to approach art as a part-time career as well as a full-time passion. Every little drop in the bucket makes a difference to me :)"
