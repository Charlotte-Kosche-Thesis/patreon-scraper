Potatoes, tomatoes. We love videogames.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love MMA. We\u2019re mildly fond of each other. We like to talk about things we love and laugh whilst\u00a0doing it. We hope you laugh as well. What do we hope to gain from your kindness? Well, we hope that\u00a0as you have heard our podcast you have noticed that, though we are beginners, we have a pretty good\u00a0sound for being nubs. What that means is that we plan to take money given to us and putting it right\u00a0back into the podcast. Mics are good now. Can they be better? Yep! That\u2019s a goal. Want video of the\u00a0podcast, too? We want that for you! Only we aim to deliver up to 4K content as a standard. Do you need\u00a0to see our 1 \u00bd beards in UHD? It\u2019s probably not a great idea, but, hey, some people are strange and like\u00a0to see strange things in extremely high resolutions because they\u2019re, well, strange. Basically, we want to\u00a0produce top-notch content always. We aim to keep donations low per user because we know money\u00a0doesn\u2019t come easy. We hope you\u2019ll see that we want to put money back into any and all content we\u00a0ever create. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs the goal to stop working our regular jobs eventually? Honestly, yes, it is. Why? Because\u00a0we want to spend the time wasted on our jobs to make even MORE content. With all of this being said,\u00a0please give us a chance and watch us grow into something you\u2019re proud to tell your friends and family\u00a0about. Thank you to anyone that supports us in any form or fashion.\u003cbr\u003e"
