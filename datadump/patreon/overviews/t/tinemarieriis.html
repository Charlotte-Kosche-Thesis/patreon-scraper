I live in Norway and have always been a huge fan of video games since I was 3 years old. ^3^ \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgh.us/grgrs.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://oi67.tinypic.com/2edmmxi.jpg\" style=\"width: 414px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing able to cosplay my favorite heroes/characters from games and series is truly a dream come true to me. Last year I quit my job so I would be able to cosplay full time. However, cosplay is crazy expensive, and it would be nice to be able to work on some bigger projects again as most goes into paying the bills and feeding my cat~\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t get me wrong, I truly am thankful for being able to work on this full-time, but because of the rising cost of materials, it now takes longer to be able to make bigger projects that reach over longer periods of time. \u0026lt;3 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMade in 2017. This would not have happened without you guys! \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://oi65.tinypic.com/fn713s.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePersian Gijinka (Pokemon), Serinuma Kae (Kiss him, not me!), Wonder Woman, Sailor Pluto, Paya (Breath of the Wild), Marie Rose (Dead or Alive), Rachel Amber (Life is Strange), Kitty Cat Katarina (League of Legends)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSide by side comparisons is always fun for me to make!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://oi64.tinypic.com/ipysed.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a detail freak, I really love to create highly detailed costumes. With this I will be able to craft more costumes and fix a higher quality Stream/YouTube which will contain not only gaming, but also Cosplay workshops/progress. *o*\u003cbr\u003eThere will also be limited WIP videos and video messages for my Patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgh.us/patreon1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://oi68.tinypic.com/2vdmgle.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my earlier projects. \u0026lt;3\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProject\u0027s I would love to do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://oi68.tinypic.com/2z52537.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the projects I would love to do right now is: Marie Rose (DoA, COMPLETED), Ranger General\n Sylvanas + Alexstrasza (Heroes of the Storm), Asuna (Sword Art Online),\u00a0 Daoko GIRL \n(In Making), and Zelda (Ocarina of Time), Star Guardian Janna \u0026amp; Miss Fortune, Valeera Sanguinar from WoW, \u00a0and many more!

It is always fun to teach people new skills, so I often travel to schools here in Norway to teach them how to craft and work with materials. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imgh.us/mmm_5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://oi63.tinypic.com/2qa4krm.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStickers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have a friend drawing chibis of my cosplays!

Before I discovered cosplay back in 2009 I was a rather shy girl who almost didn\u0027t dare to speak to anyone, but today I am a more outgoing and a happy person. Cosplay helped me realized that I should just be myself and do stuff that makes me happy.
