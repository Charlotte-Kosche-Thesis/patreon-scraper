    "summary": "Short Version:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHelp keep music education alive in our schools! I am a songwriter and educator, and feel compelled to do something to fight against declining arts support in public schools. I would like you to join me on the front lines, bringing vibrant music education experiences directly to young people, and I\u0027m throwing my time and talent behind this effort by offering my recorded and live music as an incentive. For as little as $1 per month you get access to all of my music and for every $250 milestone we make on Patreon, I will pick one school or community center that is experiencing declining arts funding and offer a workshop every month absolutely free of charge to them. I will also throw a free house concert at one of the patron\u0027s homes! \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLearn more about the workshops I\u0027ve developed at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.discovermusicnow.org/?page_id=1527\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDiscover Music\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong Version: \u003cbr\u003eThank you for coming to my Patreon page. I\u0027m a singer/songwriter, educator and advocate. I love making music, and teaching young people how to write their own songs! It is my sincere hope that I can use my music to help people.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://cheesebrowmusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://cheesebrowmusic.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my non-profit,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://http//www.discovermusicnow.org\"\u003eDiscover Music\u003c/a\u003e , 6 years ago because I saw a need for the school system to expand its definition of music education beyond the performing arts and focus on teaching students how to CREATE music. After a few years in the field I noticed that it\u0027s hard to get this kind of programming into schools that could use it most. I designed a killer curriculum, but many schools simply do not have the resources to offer it. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my dream to teach children the value of living a creative life, and help them use music to express themselves in a positive way. Funding for the arts in public schools has been in decline for some time and I don\u0027t want to see kids miss out on amazing learning opportunities because of it. Here\u0027s where we can help each other out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor every $250 milestone we reach on this patreon page, I will work to schedule a songwriting workshop each month with a school in need absolutely free of charge to them! This means everyone gets equal opportunity, and budgets are not a barrier.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get downloads of any album I\u0027ve made or will make in the future. You will get access to a video library of lessons, new songs, and other resources as I create them. Becoming a patron means that you are directly supporting my creative work in a sustainable way so I can spend less time trying to sell music and more time writing and recording new music. You also get to help fund music in schools on an ongoing basis, and suggest where we hold the workshops. Each month there will be kids directly benefiting from your patronage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBONUS: For every $250 benchmark we make I will also put on a free house concert for a randomly selected patron...could be you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease become my patron today for any dollar amount to get all of my music, to help me make more music, and to support music education for kids. We can do so much good together! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTim"
