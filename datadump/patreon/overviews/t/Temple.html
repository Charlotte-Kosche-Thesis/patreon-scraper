I\u0027m Andy\nEvans, also known as \u003cstrong\u003eThe Priest of Gaming\u003c/strong\u003e, and I welcome you to my Patreon in\nsupport of my website: \u003cstrong\u003eTemple of Games\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve always loved video games, since I was old enough to play I\u0027ve been taken\nin by the wonder rendered in pixels and polygons. They allow us to explore lives,\nscenarios and worlds otherwise impossible, they can make us feel strong when\nwe\u0027re at our weakest, and they can give us a place to escape to, when the world\ngets too difficult. \u003cstrong\u003eNo matter what has happened in my life, video games\nprovided an invaluable solace, and is a huge reason why I\u0027m here today.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, there\u0027s a lot of resistance to video games today. So many people want\nto demonize games, and ostracize gamers, making us and our hobby the convenient\nscapegoat for all the worlds ills, and \u003cstrong\u003ethis is unacceptable\u003c/strong\u003e. I believe video\ngames open us up to new experiences, and that gamers are on the whole, good\npeople. For this reason, I\u0027m passionate about games and the good they can do. I\nwant to share this passion with others, and hopefully contribute to bringing\npeople into a worldwide community of gamers.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTemple of Games just one step along a greater path\u003c/strong\u003e, but I\u0027m starting out with\nmy website where I\u0027ll be creating content commentating on gaming news and\nproducing entertainment articles. Who knows, in the future, I may even make my\nown games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor now, I just hope you can throw a few coins my way, to help this start to\nbecome a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPeace and High scores!\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/b\u003e"
