    "summary": "I\u0027ve been fighting on the front line of this war for a very long time. \u00a0Music is so much more powerful than most of us think, especially Hip Hop. \u00a0Every day someone claims, \"I don\u0027t listen to the words I just like the beat\", not realizing they\u0027ve just repeated an entire song word for word.\u00a0I\u0027ll never forget the day I witnessed a group of classy, educated women run to the dance floor when they heard, \"there\u0027s some H*es in this house\". \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is where I come in, an artist that believes there is so much more to life.\u00a0Why God chose me to be one of his musical warriors, I don\u0027t know, but I do know it\u0027s how he created me. I can\u0027t help rhyming words and creating tunes nonstop, it\u0027s in my wiring. God gave me this gift to uplift, inspire, teach, and rebuke through lyrics. \u00a0Sometimes, this path is very lonely, but he has blessed me with a few friends to back me up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of those friends goes by the name, DJ Riverside. \u00a0His suggestion was to build a spot for supporters to donate to the cause. \u00a0I didn\u0027t think it was a good idea at the time, but then Jesus dropped Patreon in my lap. \u00a0Sometimes I should just shut up and listen! That said, welcome to 5th Eye Music...I\u0027m TonyWHOA!! Holy Ghost let\u0027s go!!!"

Christian Rap recording artist TonyWHOA! started wearing glasses at the age of three, and thus became the butt of many glasses jokes through out his years. As a rapper, Tony has been warned numerous times to get rid of his glasses and switch to contacts in order to make it big. \"\u003cem\u003eThe differences between us, flaws and all, make us who we are, and I thank God we are not a planet full of clones\u003c/em\u003e\", says Tony. The hike in bullying related suicides moved Tony to create two special songs his new Cd, \u003cem\u003eYou Can Talk About Me\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eLook Like Me\u003c/em\u003e. The new Cd is titled, \u003cem\u003eCold War\u003c/em\u003e, and is slated for release in May of 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMISSION STATEMENT:\u003c/strong\u003e It is our firm belief that every day should be like Sunday, including the lives and actions of believers. Embedding the scriptures in your heart and taking the message with you into the streets, workforce, and household is what will make the difference in a Christian\u0027s personal and public relationships. We sing to the situation and to bring you through it victorious with an added challenge to help someone else along the way. We make the soundtracks that back up the Christ life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTonyWHOA!\u003c/strong\u003e is a Christian Rapper from Indianapolis, Indiana, who is about to release his tenth CD, Cold War. \u003cem\u003e\"Trying to paint Tony as an average cat would be doing him disservice. As a matter of fact TonyWHOA! is a dude cut from a different cloth. He is a throwback MC in every sense of the word. Not only that, based on his socially conscience and at times humorous rhymes, Tony might be considered a symbol of those who would like to take things back to The Roots\"\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e(Paul Collins, Dasouth.com)",
