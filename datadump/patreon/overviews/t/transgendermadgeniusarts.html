    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to the official Transgender Mad Genius Arts Patreon Fan Club! I thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to view the work that I do with my paintings/drawings, my poetry/short stories and the novels/books that I will be sharing with you over the next decade or so, and for supporting my work!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, many of you may have seen me before from my Queer/Trans BDSM porn days (which I still do), and of course, from my music career as a multi-instrumentalist singer-songwriter/lyricist/MC/founder of band, Wanderlust Grrrl and my self-titled solo project, October Rain Evans. In fact, I also run a photography studio known as Wanderlust Grrrl Photography Studios as well. Regardless of how you found me here, or where you\u0027ve seen me from before, you could very well say that I\u0027m a multi-industry creative entrepreneur on the road 24/7/365, creating and doing what I love, because this to me isn\u0027t just an labor of love to me - it\u0027s my way of saying that I\u0027m a modern day Transgender Renaissance woman. In the span of a year, I would go from fronting my solo project or band to doing a photo shoot for a band or a wedding, from acting or directing/producing/writing a independent horror film to doing some really fucking naughty things on camera in the Queer/Trans BDSM adult entertainment industry for many studios, including my own independent studio, Delirium Sade Productions, or even from writing poetry/short stories to publishing a full-length novel/book and doing so much more. But this is about my writing/poetry/journalist/art career, not about all that other shit that I do in my professional and personal life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere, you will get to have exclusive content and very rare opportunities to view my art, read my poetry/short stories or get a free digital download of my future books/novels before anyone else - exactly 1 WEEK before it even gets to hit the bookshelves at your local bloody Barnes \u0026amp; Noble or your library. That\u0027s pretty cool, right? Well, not only that, but you get some really great digital/physical fan club merchandise goodies, such as t-shirts, stickers, patches, hats, mugs, custom-made notebooks, free tickets/VIP passes to see me at a solo acoustic/book reading show, like what one Mr.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thecoreytaylor.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCorey Taylor\u003c/a\u003e does with his solo tours when he goes on a book/solo acoustic tour, and there\u0027s also that whole digital part of said goodies I just mentioned, such as partaking in Patreon fan club-exclusive only polls, watching livestreaming podcast updates from yours truly, seeing behind-the-scenes footage of what I do with my work and how it\u0027s created, from start to finish, and let\u0027s not forget - I also do custom orders of paintings, poetry/short stories and drawings from you, the fans! That\u0027s right - from time to time, if you want a custom order of me doing a special painting or a poem or a rather kickass short story with a theme of your choosing, all you have to do is request one from me \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(NICELY!)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, and we\u0027ll get to work on it ASAP and I will personally ship it to you for free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do what I love because it\u0027s my life\u0027s work and it\u0027s a queer labor of love to be able to enjoy creating art, writing poems/short stories and penning a kickass novel/book, and I also get to go on the road to share my rather rant-y moments but fun moments indeed when reading aloud to a library room full of adoring, badass fans such as yourselves. And there\u0027s also that occasional trip to any art gallery show in the world, even here in USA, whereas I get to display my artistic visions to the entire art community and with you as well - just don\u0027t hog all the blood cheese, savvy? I like cheese. LOL.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut how do I continue doing what I love to do with all this creative energy in me? Well, simply put, in today\u0027s independent/self-publishing literary arts industry and today\u0027s art community, especially in Corporate Amerika, it\u0027s getting more and more expensive to continue writing or publishing physical hardcover/paperback copies of any of my poetry/short story collections or my novels/books, and it\u0027s even harder to be able to afford the painting/art/drawing, etc supplies, including blank canvas, especially since I go out of my way to buy them at my local art supply stores, or at Michael\u0027s or from a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dickblick.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlick store\u003c/a\u003e and get to work on painting my next Transgender Mad Genius masterpiece! The prices alone for any of the supplies needed are just ridiculously expensive! Anyways, enough ranting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you, the fans, come in. Your support, especially your monthly pledges, help me cover the monthly expenses of getting art supplies, new notebooks to write my poetry and short stories in, keeping up with changes/updates to my laptop, which I use to write my novels/books on, promote my website/Patreon fan club to you all, and be able to afford the costs of touring and paying booking fees for performing a visual art show at a venue, or hosting a book reading show with a simple, elegant acoustic solo performance with me and my trustworthy acoustic guitar, etc., and it also pays for fan club merchandise manufacturing costs through VistaPrint and Sticker/T-Shirt Junkie, etc. (parts of it - the rest I have to fundraise through Kickstarter).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, Patreon allows me to work less at my boring old day/odd jobs and more on creating and working hard on my brilliant creations of poetry, short stories and many paintings/drawings yet to come. It\u0027s a simple yet effective solution, and could very well be the beginning of what we all have come to known as Universal Basic Income. Patreon solves the problem of the struggling/starving artists in today\u0027s society, and helps begin to heal the wounds inflicted by corporations and oligarchic sadists who rule our countries, so that small businesses and creative entrepreneurs such as myself and many others can truly thrive and no longer suffer in forced/enslaved poverty, working for less than $7/hour with no benefits, and surviving from paycheck to paycheck just to make ends meet so that we can try to create more of our hauntingly beautiful art for the fans who appreciate the hard work we do to make our dreams an reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with your support on a monthly basis, I continue to enjoy the labors of love that I\u0027ve come to become accustomed with, and rediscover my radiant wanderlust youthful artistic spirit again. Thank you for all the support you have shown me in my other creative entrepreneurship ventures, from my solo project to Kink Revolution Arts, from Wanderlust Grrrl Photography Studios to independent filmmaking, and so much more. And now, I hope you\u0027ll join me on my amazing journey as a writer/poet/blogger/journalist and as a painter/drawing/visual performance artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eNamaste and Blessed Be,\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eOctober Rain Evans\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eOwner/CEO/Founder of Transgender Mad Genius Arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
