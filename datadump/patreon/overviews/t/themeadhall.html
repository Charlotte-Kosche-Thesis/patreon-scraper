    "summary": "I am a retired English teacher- retired, not because I was ready, but because I\u0027m disabled, and, before I was even 50, my health deteriorated to the point that I had to take disability retirement. For the first time in many years, I found myself with time on my hands, and began researching my family history, something I had wanted to do for awhile. Not only did I discover that I had a knack for this type of research, which I could do from home, on a computer and not have my physical problems interfere, but I learned that my specific degree, which I worried would now be wasted, is one that could qualify me to work as a professional genealogist! (For various reasons, which I\u0027ll explain later, I actually consider myself a SEMI-professional genealogist.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am lucky enough to be a member of a very extended, very diverse, and very fascinating family. I am also lucky enough to be part of a family with many members who are just as interested in our combined history as I am, and who have put in many long hours of research, and who continue to do so. After my forced retirement, my own interest in our extended genealogy pretty much took over my life, in a very good way. I found that quite a few people had already laid a solid foundation on which to build, and, even more important than that, I found a vast community of friends, who are also my family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last two and a half years, it has been my goal to collect and centrally archive as much of our shared genealogical information and history as I can, and to make it as available as possible, to as many people as possible, in as many forms as I have the energy, and the funds, to create and maintain. At present, that includes several trees on the free site, Tribal Pages (every tree I create eventually ends up there, because it is free for basic membership, so anyone can access them), several trees on Ancestry.com, a page for The Mead Hall on Facebook (at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/MeodeHealle),\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/MeodeHealle\u003c/a\u003e )\u00a0and a central web site of my own, (at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dlr7114.wixsite.com/themeadhall.\"\u003ehttp://dlr7114.wixsite.com/themeadhall\u003c/a\u003e ).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been left in awe at how quickly this project grew, well beyond my wildest dreams- and that is both a blessing and a problem. The blessings are too numerous to list, and begin with the bonds I have forged with relatives I never even knew I had. The problem- and the only one, so far- is that, as the project has grown (well beyond 50,000 individuals in the combined trees, at last count), so have the costs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have recently discovered the vast benefits of using DNA for genealogical research and, while I have only been able to afford a couple, so far, the avalanche of info has been extremely rewarding, and enlightening. However, no matter how good the info is, it is useless without a place to display it and other trees to compare it to, so it is necessary to maintain trees at various pay sites, as well as the free ones. The combined tree is also so large that it has crossed international borders on many occasions, which means those pay sites must be maintained at a higher level, to access international records. Also, since so many in the family know that I am doing this, I have begun to amass a large collection of photos and documents, from every branch of our ever-growing tree, requiring some archival storage materials (at least temporarily). Many of these items will eventually go back to the people that they came from, once I have a chance to get them all on-line for all of us to access. In addition, it is my goal to make sure that any materials that have been given to me outright, for my disposal, eventually end up (again, after being posted on-line) with the people who have the most vested interest in them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though I decided to pursue a retirement career in genealogy, it was never my intention to try to make a bunch of money off of it. A teacher\u0027s pension means that I don\u0027t live like the royalty I am descended from, but I do have my basic needs cared for, which is all I really care about, at this point in my life. From the time I was very young, I struggled to understand and find my place in my family, so the connections I have made with the many truly extraordinary individuals (who also happen to be my relations), mean far more to me than anything as crass as money. This is why I jokingly call myself a semi-professional genealogist. When I set up my business policy, I made one hard and fast rule- I work for family (both by blood and marriage) for free. The second rule is that, if I find that a client is related to me- by blood or marriage- after I begin my research, there are no further charges for my newfound cousin, from that point forward. Now, since every human being on this planet is 40th cousin or closer (with a shared ancestor since 800 AD), and research into human DNA has proven that we are all descended from a single pair, far in the reaches of the past, that is really a sucker\u0027s bet, if money is the ultimate goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, a teacher\u0027s pension really does only cover basic necessities (especially since, in California, a \u0027disability\u0027 retirement for a teacher does not come with health benefits- go figure). I recently had a discussion with a young relative, who explained this site to me, and who explained to me the difference between charging a relative and \u0027sponsorship.\u0027 Again, though, I am not trying to amass a fortune and am only looking to cover some of the expenses. All sponsors from this site will be honored on a newly created Sponsor Page on my main website (above), and all proceeds will be used for storage materials, web site fees, and the cost of DNA kits. If there are enough sponsors, I will be able to upgrade Ancestry (to access military records and publications) and upgrade the free pages to premium or deluxe services, and so will be able to add more pictures and info that will be available for everyone to access for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be special perks for each level (although, as I write this, I have no idea yet what they all will be and I am more than open to suggestions).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*note-\u00a0 I chose the name, The Mead Hall, because of my studies in Medieval Literature and Linguistics. In Medieval times, the Mead Hall was the seat of government, community rec hall, banquet and party space, schoolhouse and church, and general community gathering space. It was where guests were welcomed, and stories were told. One of the favorite themes of the storyteller was the exploits of ancestors, so it seemed an appropriate name for a space in which this type of information was gathered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eTrees available on Tribal Pages (free to sign up and access)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eThe Big Working Tree-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tribalpages.com/tribe/browse?userid=dianarostonworkingtree\u0026amp;view=9\u0026amp;ver=44\"\u003ewww.tribalpages.com/tribe/browse?userid=dianarosto...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Larvie Family Tree- \u003ca href=\"https://www.tribalpages.com/tribe/browse?userid=larviefamilytree\u0026amp;view=9\u0026amp;randi=836275041\"\u003ehttps://www.tribalpages.com/tribe/browse?userid=la...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Earnhart Family Tree- \u003ca href=\"https://earnhartfamilytree.tribalpages.com/tribe/browse?userid=earnhartfamilytree\u0026amp;view=9\u0026amp;ver=32\"\u003ehttps://earnhartfamilytree.tribalpages.com/tribe/b...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*The Maugh-Mayfield Family Tree-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://maughmayfieldtree.tribalpages.com/tribe/browse?userid=maughmayfieldtree\u0026amp;view=9\u0026amp;ver=16\"\u003ehttps://maughmayfieldtree.tribalpages.com/tribe/br...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*The Rodriguez-Wilkins Family Tree-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://rodriguezwilkinsfamilytree.tribalpages.com/tribe/browse?userid=rodriguezwilkinsfamilytree\u0026amp;view=9\u0026amp;ver=16\"\u003ehttps://rodriguezwilkinsfamilytree.tribalpages.com...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eTrees available on Ancestry (pay site- but has more info, like photos and documents)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eThe Big Working Tree (my largest cache of info)-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/67050435/family\"\u003ehttps://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/67050435...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Larvie Family Tree-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/88476617/family\"\u003ehttps://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/88476617...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Earnhart Family Tree-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/88476617/family\"\u003ehttps://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/88476617...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*The Maugh-Mayfield Family Tree-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/88476617/family\"\u003ehttps://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/88476617...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*The Rodriguez-Wilkins Family Tree-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/106457456/family\"\u003ehttps://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/10645745...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e*These trees are for clients, only meaning I haven\u0027t yet found where they intersect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRemember- a stranger is just a cousin you haven\u0027t yet met!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
