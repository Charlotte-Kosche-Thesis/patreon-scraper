I love working on both my fanfiction and my original work that will hopefully someday have fanfiction of its own. As long as my work brings people joy though, then I believe I have succeeded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current attendance at university prevents me from updating as often as I\u0027d like, but I have been able to maintain a weekly schedule for one story with chapters for the others being produced as quickly as possible. By gaining Patreons, I can lessen the burden college tuition places on me and my family. And those Patreons in turn will gain access to exclusive content including original work and future story ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to all who read and support my work! I hope you enjoy what comes next!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGo Forth and Conquer!"
