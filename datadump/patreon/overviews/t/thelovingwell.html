Marcella Lyles, M.Ed, CCPF, CSEF\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027m glad that you\u0027ve found us here at The Loving Well, LLC (Patreon). The Loving Well opened it\u0027s virtual doors during the summer of 2013 and was created out of a conversation about being loved and about loving other people. For most of my life I had come to know people who were struggling with having relationships that work, that leave them excited about life and about being connected with the people they loved.\u00a0 It didn\u0027t matter if the relationship was romantic or aromantic, sexual or non sexual, friends or family, business or personal...the problem was almost always the same and just kept showing up in a different forms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDuring a conversation with someone I have a deep and powerful love for...I wondered what made the connection so wonderful such that even when we had arguments or \"something wasn\u0027t working\" we could still manage to have a sense of love and connection. We both sat and thought for a while and talked about all the things that help a relationship THRIVE.\u00a0 When we traced all the things that \"work\" in a relationship, we realized that they all had the same source...that they all came from the same place, Love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe continued talking and discovered that people give to their relationships from whatever \"well\" or \"source\" that they have deep inside of them. If they have a \"well\" of fear, then fearful things (insecurity, control, worry, distrust, etc,) will be the result. If they have a \"well\" of anger, then angry things (violence, betrayal, neglect, etc.) will be the result. However, if people could learn to have a \"well\" of love to draw from...to give to themselves, the people they care about and the things that happen in their lives...then loving things (compassion, connection, growth, freedom, peace of mind, etc.) would be the result.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Loving Well, LLC \u003c/strong\u003ewas born. We are a place where people can come and get connected to the ideas and concepts that leave them loving well and being well loved by drawing from a \"well\" source of...LOVE! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur commitment to your participation is that everything we create, we create with love. We are dedicated to the idea that you will walk away with a skill, idea, insight, conversation, lesson or even a challenge that leaves you more in tune with your deepest, best and most loving self.
