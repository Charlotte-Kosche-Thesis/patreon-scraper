So this is in place for my up coming series MIKO! and supporters for it and my art in general.\u003cbr\u003eIve chatted with a bunch of artists who have a decent rep of Patreon support that i know/able to chat to and a lot (and i mean a lot) are making essentially a minimum part time job wage via patreon (some are making 1000$ each month of people i know and live on their own because the supporters) and in all honesty... i havent been on the wagon of \"providing a bunch of content\".\u003cbr\u003eSo in light of the new year, i want to pump out as much as possible, and with your guys support, i might be able to live on my own for once and get my mind situated in a sense of \"doing a bunch of art\" rather than bitching to myself bout pointless shit and just work on something, whether or not its MIKO! or some concept designs or even just plain ol perno.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/3b71c04a4c77102e1c14a5a15168d1f0/tumblr_inline_p0z3tt8XT31s9prct_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eso i hope yall help and contribute to my learning and my art in general. so thankyou bunches to those who support and hopefully ill get my shit sorted out.\u003cbr\u003e"
