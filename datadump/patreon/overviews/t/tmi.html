From that point, \u003cem\u003eTMI\u003c/em\u003e spread from a simple streaming show from my apartment to being broadcast weekly on a great non-commercial radio station here in Madison, WSUM 91.7FM. While expanding \u003cem\u003eTMI\u0027\u003c/em\u003es podcasting capacity, upgrading its website, and experimenting with video streaming the live broadcasts, I\u0027m very proud to have had the honor of interviewing mayors, state assemblypeople, congressional representatives, secretaries of state, investigative journalists, television personalities and more!

TMI has never once taken advertising, meaning that it is beholden to no corporate sponsors, and exists for no purpose other than to get the truth to you. That means tmitmitmi.com has never had ads, and the audio podcast recordings and live audio streams have \u003cem\u003ealways \u003c/em\u003ebeen available to everyone for free. Yet, I know it can be more, and yearn to do more with it more often. The thing I need to make that happen? Your support. If you can\u0027t send anything towards making real media happen, trust me, I get it - to support me, simply spread the word about \u003cem\u003eTMI\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and this Patreon page. I\u0027ll still make \u003cem\u003eTMI\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to the best of my ability, just like I\u0027ve done now since the beginning, either way. But, if you can spare a dollar a month, five dollars a month, or more, and you\u0027re impressed by what I\u0027ve been able to do so far, and you want to be a part of reclaiming the media from the for-profit commercial model that squelches anything that exposes you to stories that run counter to the sponsors\u0027 interests, here\u0027s what we will build, together:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $100 a month, I\u0027ll expand the podcasts to video, so that the fleeting LiveStream recordings that vanish after 30 days instead remain in perpetuity.\u003cbr\u003eAt $500 a month, I\u0027ll be able to afford the equipment and time to expand \u003cem\u003eTMI\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0beyond the radio studio, producing more frequent episodes to keep you up to date on what\u0027s going on.\u003cbr\u003eBy the time we hit $1000 a month, \u003cem\u003eTMI \u003c/em\u003ewill be able to go to no less than five days a week, and the equipment and software available to make it happen will have been overhauled to create a truly unparalleled experience in independent media, including hiring support staff (accounting, etc) as needed to ensure the best possible future for the program.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTMI\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0has always been focused on serving you the best way it can. with no government funding to lose (unlike PBS) and no corporate sponsors to offend (unlike many other fine media outlets). Supporting \u003cem\u003eTMI\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is your way of saying you deserve better than you get from the corporately-owned 24-hour cable news cycle or from the constantly-compromising middle-of-the-road work that public broadcasting is famous for. Let \u003cem\u003eTMI\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0be YOUR Cure for the Common Media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut, what is\u00a0TMI with Aldous Tyler?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cThe speed of communications is wondrous to behold. It is also true that speed can multiply the distribution of information that we know to be untrue.\u201d \u2013 Edward R. Murrow\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor decades now, the media has become more and more compromised. While you have always needed to question what is given you, it once was that the networks ran their news bureaus at an operating loss, buoying them with revenue from the rest of the network in order to meet their public service obligation. That meant that they didn\u0027t need their news to entertain, to bring in ratings, to sell advertisements. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo longer. Now the \u201cnews\u201d is run for the same reason as any commercial program: to sell advertisers air time so they can reach audiences they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have easy access to. This means that commercial news sources generally dare not report too strenuously on things that might go against the interests of the sponsors, lest the offending news program find itself pulled off the air. Worse, misinformation that the sponsors prefer to be aired can be let loose via the purchased ads or even more insidiously, within the news content itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecognizing this, many media consumers set their sights on PBS, only to see the once-reliable source compromised by their need to censor themselves in the interest of not offending their major underwriters, a recent example being the pulling of the expos\u00e9 \u201cCitizen Koch\u201d off of PBS\u2019 schedule, noting that the Koch brothers themselves have given over $20 million to public broadcasting. I assure you, that money was spent precisely to give the Kochs the very leverage they exercised there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem style=\"\"\u003eTMI\u003c/em\u003eis designed to have no sponsors to be beholden to, so that the news, views and interviews that are going unreported, under-reported or just plainly distorted have an unfettered point of release. I happen to be a champion of those causes that focus on helping people and protecting their rights. I proudly wear the label \u201cprogressive\u201d which translates to \u201canti-authoritarian left\u201d, politically. I believe in the rights of the individual and in the support of your fellow human being, and if there is any bias to\u003cem style=\"\"\u003eTMI\u003c/em\u003e, it stems from that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, don\u2019t get me wrong, there are some good people who work within the commercial and public broadcasting models who regularly do good work, and I look up to them as inspiration for how one can hold fast to one\u2019s values in the face of intense pressures to deviate from them. I simply knew it was necessary to make manifest the ideal of the media: information being given with honest analysis, the only filter being the conscience of the person bringing you the information. That is what I mean by saying that\u003cem style=\"\"\u003eTMI with Aldous Tyler \u003c/em\u003eis \u201cThe Cure for the Common Media\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill you support a real alternative to the corporately-owned-and-run media sources that are difficult to avoid? That\u2019s an answer only you can give. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eAldous Tyler,\u003cbr\u003eHost,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem style=\"\"\u003eTMI\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
