We want this to be something that completely absorbs you in all things Twisted Showcase. With your help, by becoming a member of the Fan Club and a patron to Twisted Showcase, we will be able to dedicate our time to the messed up short stories that you know and love, as well as something new, some longer form Twisted Showcase stories which will be told over a certain amount of parts, keeping you hooked for weeks and months on end.\u003cbr\u003eAlongside this we will be making a series of one minute horrors for you to enjoy. How much of this we can make all depends on how big we make this thing, and how much help we can get so we can dedicate our time to it.\u003cbr\u003eThere are other perks to the Fan Club as well, there will be video Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s which can be about anything in the Twisted Showcase world. We\u0027re hoping for lots of buzz about Series 4 (We\u0027ve not forgotten about that) and also a reading service, where we will read and provide notes on your fiction, whether it be a screenplay or prose.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe also hope to open a Fan\u0027s corner on the website where members writing and work can feature and be read by other Twisted Showcase fans.\u003cbr\u003eAs a good friend of Twisted Showcase once said \"Have you got the balls for it?\"\u003cbr\u003e"
