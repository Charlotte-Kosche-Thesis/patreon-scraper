Thank you for visiting this page and considering supporting me, you have no idea how much it means to me that someone enjoys my work enough to even look at this page ^_^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations go towards getting the things I need to do more things and going to more places to do more things! I love supporting the geek community and showcasing indie comics and games. I also love reviewing movies and retro games and showing you guys all the wonderful stuff at comiccon as well! It\u0027s a lot of work but I love it. And you guys are the ones that make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the future there are more things I would love to do including showcasing more indie and retro games and also VR! It will take some saving up but it would be amazing to do mixed reality showcasing indie VR too! Right now I have to sell kit to help buy kit and borrow a lot of things to get stuff done; which limits what I can do a lot. If you would like to help me to grow my channel and be able to keep producing more and better content that would be amazing. I plan to talk to my patreons regularly - if you want me to sort a patreon only video chat I think the site supports that now! I would love feedback and suggestions - these are your videos as much as mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee my videos so far on Youtube:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/tristabytes\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/c/tristabytes\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eOr you can send a one off mini donation here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.ko-fi.com/tristabytes\"\u003ehttp://www.ko-fi.com/tristabytes\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eYou can also join me on social media here:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=EcqDYaOnCh8\u0026amp;event=video_description\u0026amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftristabytes%2F\u0026amp;redir_token=elWsN3yaYYB8lAPBA3umq3n-9f98MTUyNjU1MDU1OEAxNTI2NDY0MTU4\"\u003ehttp://www.facebook.com/tristabytes\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=EcqDYaOnCh8\u0026amp;event=video_description\u0026amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitter.com%2Ftristabytes%2F\u0026amp;redir_token=elWsN3yaYYB8lAPBA3umq3n-9f98MTUyNjU1MDU1OEAxNTI2NDY0MTU4\"\u003ehttp://www.twitter.com/tristabytes\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=EcqDYaOnCh8\u0026amp;event=video_description\u0026amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Ftristabytes%2F\u0026amp;redir_token=elWsN3yaYYB8lAPBA3umq3n-9f98MTUyNjU1MDU1OEAxNTI2NDY0MTU4\"\u003ehttp://www.instagram.com/tristabytes\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again :)"
