That\u0027s capitalism, right?\u201d (I had already read 500 books)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe said that was a good description of capitalism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThen I\u0027m done here! I\u0027ve come to tell them where the well is!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI pushed my school books off the desk; the books they were going to spend a whole year with that I had read in a weekend; and I ran over and climbed out the window!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI walked miles to get home and was never going back.

They spent all their time searching for cheese to eat. \u003cbr\u003eOne day they came upon a ginormous, hundred-foot tall, mile-long mountain of cheese filling up a huge cavern. It was more than they could climb over in a month, and more than they could eat in lifetimes; so they stayed there happily for years, growing fat and lazy.\u003cbr\u003eOne morning they awakened to discover the entire mountain of cheese was gone! Not even a crumb remained; somebody had taken it all during the night.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImmediately, one mouse went to go find more cheese.\u003cbr\u003eThe second mouse started trying to figure out who took it.\u003cbr\u003eThe third mouse sat down to wait for them to bring it back.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m that first type of mouse, who took off 45 years ago on a Quest for Cheese during the 3rd grade when I realized what was missing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u2019m not coming back with it triumphant and cheering. I am but a step or two short of the entrance to the big cave; disappearing as I toss this little ball of cheese through the door and hoping someone will pick it up and start feeding everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt may not look like that big, glittering mountain\u2026 but it\u2019s enough to feed us all if you\u2019ll help me spread it around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Quest tired me greatly, but left Wisdom in its place; I am still being taught by life and just this moment realized another Pearl of Wisdom denied to the young\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Journey of a Thousand Miles ends with a single step.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sure hope you really like cheese. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love Cheese\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imIhkJPka0M\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imIhkJPka0M\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e",
