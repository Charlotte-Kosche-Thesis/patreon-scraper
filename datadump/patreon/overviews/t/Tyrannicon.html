    "summary": "Running a Youtube channel is like a full time job, taking hours of work each day. As it\u0027s very time consuming it\u0027s my only source of income, and if the Ad Revenue from the videos is low each month, I have to spend more time working elsewhere and less time on the \nchannel, which causes the content to suffer (that is why videos such as Skyrim Battles and other \nMachinimas stopped being made.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Youtube and my partnered Network taking around 50% of all Ad Revenue to begin with (along with no money being made on any mobile/cell phone views too) I\u0027ve had to create this page and turn to you, the Cohesive Unit for help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love to make more videos on the games and shows that you guys wanna see such as TJ Laser Space Scumbag.. finally finishing the trilogy in Mass Effect 2, The Great Battles of Skyrim/Fallout and Kickboxing Banana/Throthgar Machinimas. Aswell as try new series like Throthgar and TJ Laser finally questing together! Hopefully with a little help from you, it can all happen. So check out the goals and if we can reach them \nI can start making the content! \u003cbr\u003e"

I always wanted to make more but they are very time consuming so by reaching \nthis goal I can promise to make a new battle video at least every 2 months. You guys can \nalso have a say in what battle videos get made, Lord of The Rings? \nGame of Thrones? Star Wars? I will create a poll and see what you want!",
