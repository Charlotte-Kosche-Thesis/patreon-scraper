    "summary": "I love video games and making people laugh, and for the last few years, I have combined these two passions into my own brand of insanity by making online videos. My series like Commercial Failure, Video Game Bunker, and Gamers without Borders have received overwhelmingly positive reviews from many of my viewers, including complete strangers just randomly discovering them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, positive appreciation alone doesn\u0027t pay the bills. As such, I have been forced to put my hobby on the back burner as I focus on my full time day job. I have to choose between working on videos for my job, or working on videos for my channel. With your support, I can begin making the shift from my freelance job to making more original content. I\u0027ve been a gamer for almost 30 years, and my love of the industry shows no sign of slowing down. Hopefully with your help, I can share my wisdom, knowledge, humor, and insight with the rest of the world through my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rewards below are subject to change, and if you have another suggestion/idea for a reward to accompany your donation, feel free to leave me a message on any of my social media accounts. I\u0027m open to suggestions!"
