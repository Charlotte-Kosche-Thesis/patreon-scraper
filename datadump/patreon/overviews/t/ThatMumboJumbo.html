    "summary": "Hey guys! Welcome to my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a service I have considered using for quite some time now and with a recent poll suggesting that over 3700 of you liked the idea, I decided to take the plunge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you guys know I have been looking into ways of which I can increase my available recording time. There are a number of different options available to me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- Home studio: This would allow me to continue living with my parents, but have a dedicated place to make videos outside of the noise of the household. High upfront cost, but cheaper in the long run. That being said, the council don\u0027t seem to like the idea very much and are resisting my plans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- House Studio: This would allow me to continue living at home, but heavily improve the equipment that I already have. Has a high upfront cost, but works out fairly cheap in the long run (despite needing to constantly upgrade the equipment). Items that are currently on the list are: Furniture, PC, Monitors, proper sound proofing, base traps, external drive storage, Mini Fridge, Secondary Microphone, powerful portable laptop, new camera equipment, webcam, greenscreen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Office: Continue living at home, but have an office that I travel to each day to record videos. Would be a good focused environment, but my specific needs making finding a suitable location difficult.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Move out! This is by far the most expensive option, with property nearby being eye wateringly pricey (seriously, it is ridiculous around the suburbs of London). But, it would once again provide a good focused environment for creating videos. Heck, I could even get a dedicated recording room which be nice!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSO! I have some pretty big decisions to make over the next few months. As you can probably tell, I am leaning towards the \u0027Move Out\u0027 option, which is why I am looking into ways in which I can top up my income to ensure that I can move out sustainably and without putting myself into any sticky financial situations.\u003cbr\u003eBut honestly, I don\u0027t want to talk about money anymore, it\u0027s boring. This is an outlet that allows those of you who wish to support me in the creation of future content to do so without too much hassle. I hope you like it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
