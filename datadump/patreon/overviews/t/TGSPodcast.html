Thank you for considering joining\nin on the fun of the podcast you have come to enjoy. Become a monthly supporter of The Glen Show and help it grow and reach more people just like you. Whether you listen\nat work, while making dinner, exercising, or just passing the time, I am\nhonored. In 2013, my ambition for\nlaunching a podcast came from a voice that told me to stop making excuses and\nstart sharing some laughter. It was a literal voice in the form of a comedy podcast\nthat made my work days a little more bearable. Not once have I been disappointed in the\nresponse and support of my podcast through the years. If listening to the show\nis even a fraction of the fun as it is to make it, then you kind of owe me,\nright? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGoing on the show\u0027s 5th year, I have set a goal of releasing 25 episodes in 2018. Ultimately, this is less about the money and more about accountability. Even with zero backers, the show will continue, but I\u0027m looking for a driving force of dedicated supporters to keep me moving forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduction\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eShow prep and episode planning are ongoing processes that have evolved, much like the show itself.\u00a0 With my two co-hosts, Jason and Steve, along with random drop-ins, we record the show every other weekend.\u00a0 When we are done yucking it up, the real work begins. The shows average an hour in length, but editing takes about 2.5x that amount. This includes adding an intro, outro, music bumpers, additional segments, and commercials. Once I complete edits, rendering, and publishing, it\u0027s now time to promote. The Glen Show can be found on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and at \u003ca href=\"http://www.TGSPodcast.com.\"\u003ewww.TGSPodcast.com.\u003c/a\u003e When promoting, I focus on cultivating content for the Facebook page as well as Instagram posts for the newest episode. With all things considered, each episode has about 6+ hours of work\u00a0 wrapped up into a listener hitting the play button.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo listen, laugh, and most importantly share!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you to my co-hosts Jason and Steve for allowing me to captain this paddle boat, and to all the listeners for being our fellow seaman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
