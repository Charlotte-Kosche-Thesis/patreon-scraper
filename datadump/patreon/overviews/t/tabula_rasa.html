But it\u2019s even more likely that you don\u2019t do that enough. I believe food is everything. Well, that\u2019s an overstatement. But it\u2019s crazy important\u2014more than we realize. The best food is the stuff we cook for ourselves at home. Maybe it\u2019s not the best tasting we\u2019ve ever had, but I can help you change that. I\u2019m here to help instill some courage to improve your cooking game, no matter where you currently find yourself. I wholeheartedly believe that anyone can make really delicious food, and it\u2019s not some big, crazy mystery of mastery. Understanding some fundamental principles and taking some time and care can make everybody a great home cook. And when we\u2019re making what we eat, it is less expensive, more healing, more transparent, more grounding, and exactly how you like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for even coming here. If you\u2019re considering getting involved, take that dollar that would have bought \u00bc of your coffee and put it toward becoming a better cook. If you\u2019re already a patron, I genuinely thank you. Without you, I wouldn\u2019t have any reason to do this. Keep being awesome, and cook more food!\u003cbr\u003e"
