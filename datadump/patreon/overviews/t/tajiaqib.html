I\u2019ve been at this for a very long time, have taught myself everything I know. My passion for what I do comes entirely from the art, as it should for all true artists. I have never been in it for financial gain, but rather, to impact the world in a positive way through my music, messages, stories, and\u003cbr\u003e philosophy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhy do I need patrons?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly live for my art. Unfortunately, there comes a time where you have to actually eat in order to live. So, here I am...and here you are. By coming along on this journey with me, you will be part of the revolutionary movement that I have been trying to manifest brick by brick since my early teens, choosing the road less traveled in an industry increasingly dominated by commercial agendas and superficiality. While hip hop - which I believe has potential to be the most influential form of communication in the world - is my weapon of choice, I am building my brand and movement upon the understanding that art, in its essence, is the human experience, and we must try to preserve its authenticity restore balance back to its landscape. That is why I call it a movement; I do what I do not only for myself, but for all true artists and the culture. And I don\u0027t know if it is even possible for me to win this fight, but I know for a fact I won\u0027t be able to do it alone, as I have attempted to do since I set out on this journey. I recognize now that I need a pack.

I find it hard to believe, myself, especially considering the very limited budget I\u0027ve had to work with. Quite honestly, it will be impossible to keep up and live at the same time. Handling one facet of any one project I\u0027m working on (for example, video editing), is enough for one person\u0027s full-time responsibility, let alone wearing every hat of multiple projects, and being my own manager as well. So when you become a patron, it will allow me to upgrade my equipment, eventually outsource, and be more efficient in production. Most importantly, you will be helping continue to push forward and bring the world enlightening and quality art, to continue to inspire, and to bring you the things you enjoy! However, in addition, I do offer some extra incentives, probably the most important of them being that you\u0027ll have access to regular updates and chances to give input on the things I am working on. You will essentially be a part of my much-needed team and I will be very glad to have you. Welcome to the Wulf Pack!\u003cbr\u003e"
