    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe return of twogag?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey everybody. First off, I\u0027m humbled that so many people have gotten in touch with me over the last year and told me how much you miss Twogag.\u003cbr\u003eUntil now I haven\u0027t shared with anyone why I suddenly stopped updating it. This is partly due to shame, but also that I always planned on picking it back up again, eventually. But i wasn\u0027t really sure how, as something had to change. The way I used to do it caused me so much stress that it drove me into a depression that I had to spend months dealing with. I even stopped drinking, whaaat?!\u003cbr\u003eThe thing was, I felt like I owed you guys updates, and I felt really guilty every time I missed one. That isn\u0027t healthy, especially since the comic is free and the money I made from ads and such was meager to say the least. It just wasn\u0027t worth missing out on so much of life because of a comic I got so little from, well, besides creative fulfillment.\u003cbr\u003eWhich is a shame, because for all intents and purposes, twogag seems to be a popular comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I feel better now, and that\u0027s why I\u0027m proposing this restructure. If the goal of \u003cstrong\u003e\u0027$500 per creation\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e is met, and kept at that sum. Then I will start updating twogag again. And I will keep updating it on the site as usual, \u003cstrong\u003efree for everyone to read.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat this means is that once/if that sum is reached I will post a comic, here on Patreon, and on the twogag site. And Patreon will only charge you after a comic has been posted, never if it hasn\u0027t. And a maximum of 2 times per week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you might think this is like keeping the comic hostage, but I nearly killed myself doing the comic and it is hard to justify that amount of work, time, and mental stress year after year without a way to sustain my efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt feels fantastic to have created something so many of you like, and this is your chance to show me how much you want the comic to return. After all, It\u2019ll only take 100 of you to pledge $5 to get the comic rolling again. That\u2019s like what, half a cup of Starbucks?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis proposal might fail and embarrass me, but it\u2019s the best solution I\u2019ve come up with that\u2019ll make us all happy. I actually already have a handful of comics ready to go if we meet the goal.\u003cbr\u003eSo, the comic is now in your hands, people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a an instant part of your support you will be able to view the sketch of the next comic that will go up. ( with no charge unless the goal is actually reached).\u003cbr\u003eYou will also get instant access to a discord server I\u2019ve set up, with roles based on your pledge amount.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay. Let\u2019s see what happens!"
