    "summary": "Thanks for swinging by my Patreon page! If you\u0027re here it means you\u0027re most likely a part of my core audience from YouTube. With your help I see big things ahead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have four\u00a0goals for my Youtube channel and Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e1. Continue to inspire people to go backpacking and to share my experiences as I grow.\u003cbr\u003e2. Create \u003cstrong\u003ecompletely independent\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0quality gear reviews. What do I mean? Backpacking gear not provided by any company to review. Instead we purchase and review gear acquired by you and me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3. Connect with YOU. Youtube is great but I find the connection can be one-sided at times. Patreon is a way to make my channel even more interactive.\u003cbr\u003e4. One of my dreams is to complete a long distance thru hike and bring you with me through video! Your support will enable me to do that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago I was stuck in a really bad work situation and found a need to get an escape. Backpacking and hiking was a major outlet for me and still is! On my channel I focus on making gear videos about gear that has worked well\u00a0for me, take you along on my backpacking trips as I bring beautiful awe inspiring places to you, and have waaay too much fun testing gear to the absolute limits. I love being part of a community that LOVES the outdoors. Backpacking and being in the outdoors is one of the things in my life that I find freeing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe inspired to get outside and live what I call \"real life.\" If you feel suffocated by being inside and just can\u0027t wait to get out then you\u0027re in the right place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTake a look at the awesome rewards at each support level on the right side of this page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBig\u00a0Question:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t have much money to spare, can I still be a Patron? Yes! \u003c/strong\u003eJust $1 per month makes a difference. Every dollar is another permit, money for gas to the trailhead and help in camera and editing equipment. To put this into perspective a dollar a month is the equivalent of about\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e500\u003c/strong\u003e views on Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
