    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHow are sex trafficking and prostitution laws used?  Despite the raging international debate on\nsex work policy, we have very little data here in the United States to answer\nthat question.  This is a journalistic\nproject to uncover the public records that exist and turn them into usable\ndata.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt the end of 2013 as part of my master\u2019s thesis (People in\nAlaska\u2019s Sex Trades: Their Lived Experiences and Policy Recommendations,\navailable on ProQuest) I made a public records request for every case that had\nbeen charged under Alaska\u2019s sex trafficking law, passed in 2012.  Even I was surprised by the results: every\nsingle person who had been charged with sex trafficking was a sex worker who\nwas charged with prostitution of themselves in the same case they were charged\nwith sex trafficking either themselves or their coworkers.  No children had been found, no victims had\nbeen rescued \u2013 in fact, the two people who could have been considered victims\n(their coworker was charged with trafficking them) were charged with and\nconvicted of prostitution. \u00a0Later, I found that the 2013 Uniform Crime Report had over reported prostitution arrests in Alaska by over 600.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSex trafficking under federal law is the use of force,\nfraud, or coercion against people in the sex trade, or any involvement of\nminors.  States, however, have their own sex\ntrafficking laws, which vary greatly in their definitions of sex\ntrafficking.  How are these different laws being used?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m going state by state (or in some cases, metro area by\nmetro area) and making public records requests for charging documents and court\norders in every case of prostitution, promoting prostitution, and sex trafficking\nfiled in 2013 and 2014.  Then I read each\ncase and enter it into a database where I track factors such as race, immigrant\nstatus, street involvement, minors, allegations of abuse, whether workers were\ncharged as the result of trying to report that they were the victim of a crime,\nwhether police describe having sexual contact with them before arresting them,\netc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis all takes many, many hours \u2013 hours that can be hard to\nfind among all the other things to do and the necessity of making a\nliving.  That\u2019s where you come in: you\ncan pledge to support the project in whatever amount you want - $1, $5, $20,\n$100 \u2013 every time I spend a day on the research and post about it.  You\u2019ll also get up to the moment updates on\nall the research I\u2019m doing.  Sometimes it\nwill be boring updates about my appeals of records requests denials and\nsuch.  Other times I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m\nfinding, jurisdiction by jurisdiction, and quote from charging documents as\nexamples.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou get to come along on the whole journey. \u00a0Really, you\nmake the whole thing possible.\u003cbr\u003e"
