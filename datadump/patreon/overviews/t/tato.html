I\u0027ve had the privilege of serving the furry community for over 9 years, and now it is my full-time job. Drawing has always been my passion, and when I\u0027m not doing commissions, I am creating stories or doodling for fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI graduated SCAD in 2010 with a BFA in Sequential Arts, specializing in web comics and self promotion. I have published comics and children\u0027s books, so story-telling, facial expression, and body language are key elements in my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut my biggest passion is making an impact in the furry community by \nencouraging others to pursue their art on a professional level, and \nmaking my commissioners\u0027 ideas come to life. I am most satisfied when I \ncan make someone\u0027s day a little brighter with my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of art do you do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\n am a fetish-friendly artist who\u0027s willing to draw anything short of \nnudity and actual sexual situations. I\u0027m mostly known in the \nbabyfur/ABDL community, as well as fatfurs, inflation and tickling. I \nhave a no-kink-shaming policy, so you never have to be afraid to come to\n me with your commissions! You can find me on Furaffinity at the below \nmentioned addresses:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBabyfur/ABDL account: \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTato\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything else: \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/fattato/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFatTato\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo read my TOS and find all my commission forms see: \u003ca href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/tatocomms/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eRunning a business solely on commissions is more difficult than it sounds. Sure, there are great perks like working from home, and drawing what I love for money, but there\u0027s an incredible sacrifice that few people understand. Health insurance, taxes, retirement fund, a fixed schedule, and a social environment are all perks of a typical job that many take for granted, but when you own your own business you are your own boss, advertising team, PR, and accountant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile many folks get refund money at tax season, commission artists OWE money, anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars. All of this is because we have no boss to take taxes out of each of our \u0027pay checks\u0027 from individual clients. We calculate it ourselves and file them just like everyone else, to find out how much income tax we owe. In addition to income tax, there\u0027s also a Self-Employment tax of 15.3% to cover for Social Security and Medicare. And let\u0027s not even mention Paypal\u0027s $.30 + 2.9% cut of every transaction, resulting in hundreds to a thousand dollar in fees.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo even though it seems like I have my life made, it\u0027s quite the opposite: I have to make a life for myself, and I can\u0027t do that without your support and business. Whenever you leave a tip, or support me on sites like Patreon, you\u0027re contributing to my entire well-being as an artist and entrepreneur, and I am eternally blessed and grateful \u2665\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhen do I sign up and when do I get my rewards?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have to be signed up before the 1st of the month you wish to receive the awards for. Your account will be charged on the first of the month. Only fully paid members will receive their rewards.\u003cbr\u003eExample: If you signed up in September (any day after the 1st) you will be able to use your rewards in October, after the October payment period, which is on the 1st.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCan I cancel any time?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can cancel any time and your rewards end upon cancellation.
