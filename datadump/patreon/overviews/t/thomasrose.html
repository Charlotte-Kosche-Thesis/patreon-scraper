I often write horror, but it blurs with fantasy\nand science fiction too often to count. Then there is my dystopic fiction,\nwhich aims to comment on aspects of modern society through some cruel twist of\nreality. If you love the sound of any of those things, you\u2019re going to LOVE being a patron on\nthis page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to make this a full time gig, so I need all the help I can get!

It\u0027s an ongoing form of crowdfunding. Think of it kind of like a subscription to a specific creator\u0027s content. It helps creators start to earn a living from their creativity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my case, I\u0027m setting myself on a path of making writing a full time career, and I\u0027d love to bring some loyal fans along for the ride if you\u0027re keen to help out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me to get something, you need to get something.

Well, all will be revealed in time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE STORY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been writing most of my life. The picture below is one of the earliest records of this. Back when I could barely type and sitting at a desk chair meant sizing up the sturdiness of surrounding furniture before climbing up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.thomas-rose.com/wp-content/uploads/Thomas.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAcross my\nuniversity studies, I wrote a number of short stories while working on my first\nbook. In attempts to kickstart my writing career, I shopped these stories\naround to a variety of magazines. Everyone gave me positive feedback, but\nnobody wanted to publish me, so after years of trying the \u2018traditional\u2019 way I decided to do it myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI embarked\non the adventure of self-publishing in 2016, culminating in the successful\npublication of my first book \u2013 The Isaac\nSpiders \u2013 in April 2017\nthanks to the help of Ingram Spark, Kindle Direct Publishing and Kickstarter. I\nam now chipping away at my second book \u2013 Blood Gate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.thomas-rose.com/wp-content/uploads/17155592_1461270690571707_7383127385010110814_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSelf-publishing\nhas a great many pros but one mighty con. By\nvirtue of the name, it involves a lot of \u2018self\u2019, in both time and money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt the time\nof writing, I am working three jobs amounting to full time work. I tutor\nEnglish, help out at a bookshop and run communications for a small non-profit.\nAmongst all of this, I squeeze in writing. And publishing. Yes, I\u2019m nuts. But I love it. The whole process of creating stories and then being the person to directly share them with the world - whether online or in print - is incredibly rewarding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on how far we take this Patreon, I\u0027ll begin dropping the number of jobs on my plate, which means more time to write, which means more for you to read and interact with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.thomas-rose.com/wp-content/uploads/thomas_book_launch_isaac_spiders.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m keen to maintain the momentum I\u2019ve built publishing \u2018The Isaac Spiders\u2019 which is where I turn to all of\nyou, my patrons. With your help, I can build an ever continuing speed. My commitment is to produce two big projects (novella to novel length) a year, as well as 2-3 short stories. All of this will hit Patreon before it hits anywhere else, including my own website. My commitment to you is to make you the FIRST people to see anything. It\u0027s the least I can do for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT DO I WRITE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI primarily\nwrite horror and dystopia, with a healthy of dose of fantasy and science\nfiction when the need arises. So, to be all encompassing, I write speculative\nfiction. Very specific. Very descriptive. I know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost of\nwhat I have written (or am going to write) is interconnected in some way. \u2018The Portal Novellas\u2019 is the start of this, as are the majority of short stories I have posted on my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY DO I WRITE\nIT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eA lot of my\nhorror preys on my own fears. For instance, my short story \u2018Woken\u2019 tells the story of Chloe, a sweet\nlittle girl who wanders the house at night saying creepy things that come true\nthe next day. Sounds totally fantastical right? Well, it\u2019s based off witnessing my little\nsister having waking nightmares where she\u2019d run around the house screaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother example is the story concept behind \u0027The Smile Men\u0027, which features perpetually grinning dopplegangers stalking suburbia at night, ready to rob people of their lives if they are ungrateful for what they have. That one came from a nightmare which was making me whimper in my sleep.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you want\nto read \u2018Woken\u2019 you can do so for free\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.thomas-rose.com/shop/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eover on my website\u003c/a\u003e.\nBe sure to tell me what you think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.thomas-rose.com/wp-content/uploads/TheSmileMen2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you want\nto read \u2018The Smile Men\u2019 then you\u2019re going to have to become a patron,\nbecause I haven\u2019t written it\nyet but you can help make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDystopia is\nan extension of horror in a lot of ways, but instead of analyzing horrific\nevents and their impact on the individual, it looks at horrific events and\ntheir impact on society. Needless to say, it usually isn\u2019t pretty. \u20181984\u2019 and \u2018Brave New World\u2019 are perhaps my biggest influences\nhere although I also have a fondness for the \u2018Chrysalids\u2019.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a taste of my dystopic fiction, check out \u0027Expiry\u0027 for free\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.thomas-rose.com/shop/\"\u003eon my website\u003c/a\u003e and discover how a man\u0027s entire existence can hinge on a single interview.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE DREAM?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDo this\nfull time. If that was the case, I would be churning out at least two full\nlength novels a year and a plethora of short stories. The current backlog is\nimmense \u2013 ask me about\nit sometime during one of the Q\u0026amp;As!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.thomas-rose.com/wp-content/uploads/17492920_1475768632455246_1507762209396266597_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
