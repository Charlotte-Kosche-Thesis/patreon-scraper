I\u2019ve got a day job,\nbills to pay and all manner of normal boring stuff that regular people have to\ndeal with, but you know what I\u2019d rather be doing?  Making more YouTube content.  Unfortunately, on both the money and time\nside of things I have a difficult time dedicating more of both to the channel\nbecause I do not have infinite resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eWhat is this Patreon for?\u003c/h1\u003eThis is a way for people who enjoy the content that I make on\nYouTube to both support the continuing development of that content and also\nencourage and support new lines of content as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat is it that you\u2019re supporting? \u003c/h1\u003e\n\nMy channel on YouTube currently runs three video\nseries. \nFeature Creep which is a game industry editorial, Game Industry News Wrap Up\nwhich is obviously a game news show but done in a late night comedy talk-show\nmonologue style and Reviews which, well, they\u2019re game reviews without a lot of flash.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve also been preparing for game developer interviews, picking up new recording equipment so that I can start up a new series. \u00a0The goal is to conduct interviews to get more information on the day to day parts of game industry jobs. \u00a0Patrons have already helped me get to the point of picking up some gear. \u00a0The more people Patronize me here, the sooner I can do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/h1\u003eAll of the normal content available on my YouTube channel will continue to remain open to all. \u00a0However, as a result of the generosity of Patrons here, my signature series Feature Creep is not monetized on YouTube. \u00a0In addition to that, there are some rewards for Patrons including livestream vods, multiplayer invites, script access and probably more in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, the all important Discord server where we can debate the finer elements of the game industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eAt the end of it all\u003c/h1\u003e\n\nI\u2019d love to do YouTube for a living, but that\u2019s always a\ndifficult and potentially very long goal. \nIn the interim, there is more than I would like to do with the channel\nand you can help me do that. Any assistance that you can provide would be\nbeyond appreciated.  I will continue to\nput out the content that I have over the last few years, improving where I can\nand I have no intention of gating content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThanks very much for your viewership, your likes, sharing these videos on Twitter, Reddit and plenty of other places. \u00a0It means the world to me. \u00a0That\u2019s all I have to say. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- T\u003cbr\u003e"
