    "summary": "Hi, My name is Alex Malpass. I run a podcast, called Thoughtology, in which I interview professional philosophers about the things that they are working on and the ideas that they are excited about. I want to bring their knowledge and expertise to a wider audience, because I believe that philosophy shouldn\u0027t just be for those who are privileged enough to be able to go to university to study it. I was fortunate in this regard, and have a BA, MA and PhD in philosophy, and I want to be able to share the joys of philosophy to as many people as possible. It also means that I know a bit about the field and know who to talk to about different topics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am mainly interested in logic, metaphysics, philosophy of science, philosophy of religion, philosophy of language and epistemology, although I will also be engaging with philosophers who do moral philosophy, feminist philosophy, continental philosophy and much more besides.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA big thank you to anyone who has supported the project. If I can just get enough to buy a decent microphone and the occasional train ticket to a philosophy department out of town, I will have achieved my monetary goals.\u00a0"
