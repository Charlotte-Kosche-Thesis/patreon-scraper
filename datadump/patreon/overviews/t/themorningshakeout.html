    "summary": "Putting your work out into the world is scary business. And doing it on a consistent basis is no easy task. I launched \u003cem\u003ethe morning shakeout\u003c/em\u003e in November 2015 as a weekly email newsletter about running and other worthwhile topics, and haven\u0027t missed an issue since. It\u0027s evolved and grown tremendously over the past 2+ years, and the interest, engagement, and feedback has been humbling to say the least.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach week, I give my unapologetically subjective take on things that interest, inform, entertain, or inspire me in some way. \u003ca href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/2142581/5-people-saving-runnings-reputation\"\u003eMy experiences as an athlete, coach and journalist\u003c/a\u003e have provided me a unique perspective on the sport of running and the industry as a whole, and I regularly share my insights and opinions on issues I\u2019m knowledgeable and passionate about to create awareness, generate meaningful dialogue, and spur healthy debate. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBut that\u2019s not all! I also interview many of the sport\u0027s top athletes, coaches, and personalities on a regular basis, like award-winning writer \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-morning-shakeout/going-long-an-interview-with-ed-caesar-baf99a4dccc9\"\u003eEd Caesar\u003c/a\u003e, New York City-based runner, writer and coach \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-morning-shakeout/going-long-an-interview-with-knox-robinson-bd55c7fbbc20\"\u003eKnox Robinson\u003c/a\u003e, four-time Olympian \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-morning-shakeout/going-long-an-interview-with-shalane-flanagan-e5f9e596f624\"\u003eShalane Flanagan\u003c/a\u003e, former world-class runner, turned overweight non-runner, turned runner again \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-morning-shakeout/going-long-an-interview-with-colin-mccourt-f4980cc89ad5\"\u003eColin McCourt\u003c/a\u003e, professional musician and sub-3 hour marathoner \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-morning-shakeout/going-long-an-interview-with-liz-anjos-ab029bfe9164\"\u003eLiz Anjos\u003c/a\u003e, Olympic middle-distance runner \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-morning-shakeout/going-long-an-interview-with-kate-grace-d644adf012cc\"\u003eKate Grace\u003c/a\u003e, Brooks Beasts coach \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-morning-shakeout/going-long-an-interview-with-danny-mackey-b9efb5d0ebde\"\u003eDanny Mackey\u003c/a\u003e, the exception to almost every racing rule, \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/the-morning-shakeout/going-long-an-interview-with-mike-wardian-8c4112745ac\"\u003eMichael Wardian\u003c/a\u003e, and many others. The newest extension of \u003cem\u003ethe morning shakeout\u2019\u003c/em\u003es interview series is a podcast, which I\u0027m hoping to make a weekly installment. Early guests have included 2:12 marathoner \u003ca href=\"http://themorningshakeout.com/podcast-episode-1-scott-fauble/\"\u003eScott Fauble\u003c/a\u003e, U.S. marathon champion \u003ca href=\"http://themorningshakeout.com/podcast-episode-2-tim-ritchie/\"\u003eTim Ritchie\u003c/a\u003e, and two-time Olympian \u003ca href=\"http://themorningshakeout.com/podcast-episode-3-des-linden/\"\u003eDes Linden\u003c/a\u003e, to name a few. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn short, \u003cem\u003ethe morning shakeout\u003c/em\u003e is carefully crafted blend of informed commentary, engaging interviews, and smart curation, intentionally conversational in its tone. And I plan to keep it that way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon? And why now? I want to keep working on \u003cem\u003ethe morning shakeout\u003c/em\u003e, plain and simple. \u003cstrong\u003ePutting my own spin on things, sharing what I\u2019ve learned through my experiences, and connecting with people on a personal level through my work has always brought me the most enjoyment.\u003c/strong\u003e This is why \u003cem\u003ethe morning shakeout \u003c/em\u003eexists and the reason it\u2019s in the form of an email newsletter that gets delivered straight to your inbox. I don\u2019t charge anything to read or listen to any of my content and have absolutely no plans to deviate from that approach. But, just because it\u2019s free doesn\u2019t mean it comes without expense. The newsletter and podcast are a labor of love that cost me a lot of time\u2014and an increasing amount of money\u2014to put out each week. And dammit, I love producing \u003cem\u003ethe morning shakeout\u003c/em\u003e in its various incarnations and want to spend more of my time working on it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBut in order to continue doing that, I\u2019m asking for a little help from my friends. The newsletter and podcast need to generate enough income to not only cover equipment and production costs, but also help me earn part of my living. No use in trying to sugarcoat it. I\u0027ve had some luck selling\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://themorningshakeout.com/sponsorship/\"\u003emonthly sponsorships\u003c/a\u003e of the newsletter over the past year (still available, FYI), which has helped keep the operation afloat to this point, but isn\u2019t proving to be a reliable solution.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where you come in. If you find value in \u003cem\u003ethe morning shakeout\u003c/em\u003e or it regularly brings some joy into your life, please consider supporting my work through Patreon. It\u2019s my hope that recurring pledges from you\u2014my loyal readers\u2014can make this a self-sustaining endeavor for many years to come. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
