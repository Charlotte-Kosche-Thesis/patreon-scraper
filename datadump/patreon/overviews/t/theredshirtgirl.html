A year ago, I cold-turkey quit my job to do\nwhat I love doing best: Making costumes for me, custom pieces for fellow\ncosplayers, modeling and walking convention halls while eating overly-priced pizza with the\nrest of you ;) After stopping cosplay for a\ncouple years to \u201cbecome an adult\u201d and \u201chave a real career,\u201d I began to feel\nlike I was distancing myself from my happiness. Then it happened. I had a\nseizure in the summer of 2016 and I found out I had a benign brain tumor. \u003cbr\u003eI\ncouldn\u2019t work for a couple months, so I threw myself back into the arms of my true love, cosplay. I was\nso out of the loop on new materials and techniques, I had to re-learning\neverything. A week before FanExpo Toronto, I had a successful tumor removal\noperation and me being me, only let myself rest for two days before diving back\ninto finishing my outfit. Still on heavy pain meds and a head full of stitches,\nI went out to FanExpo in full costume and it felt amazing to be back! It was a little scary at first, but little by little doors\nare opening, and the extra time has allowed me to create some EPIC outfits and meet\nso many of you in person. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI LOVE what I do and I assure each and every\none of you, every PENNY of your support goes to funding my fantastical habit.\nThe needles and thread, the wigs and the Worbla \u2026even tipping the \u00dcber driver who picks me up at the airport and takes me to the Con. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u2019s all down to\u00a0\u003cu\u003eYOU\u003c/u\u003e and I\u2019m truly moved AND MOTIVATED by it!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlso (drum roll please): In case you were wondering,\n\u003cstrong\u003eYOU DO NOT HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR PATREON!\u003c/strong\u003e I\u2019ll still think\nyou\u0027re awesome just for giving me the positive vibes and moral support across the\nmiles until we meet at the next Con.
