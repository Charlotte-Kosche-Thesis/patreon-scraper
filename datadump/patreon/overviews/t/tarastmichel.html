My name is Tara St. Michel, and I run a Musician channel on YouTube, home to cover songs, remixes, and more.\u00a0On my channel, you\u0027ll find a variety of musical styles and genres which I have performed and recorded using my home studio setup. These include Anime songs, Vocaloid Songs, Video Game Songs, and songs by some of my favorite North American music artists. Music means a lot to me, and I want to share it with any and all who are willing to listen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://tarastmichel.com/patreon-images/What%20Is%20Patreon_zpsdzyvdjsu.jpg\" style=\"width: 624px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of Patreon as a way of \"tipping\" someone whose content you support online the same way you\u0027d tip the pizza guy when he brings your hot, gooey, delicious pizza to the door 5 minutes earlier than you expected! Instead of pizza, however, you\u0027re showing your support for creative content! In a way, Patreon is also kind of like kickstarter or indiegogo, but instead of funding a project to reach a single proprietary goal, you provide an ongoing contribution of your choice that goes towards future ongoing content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can choose how much you want to put in in any amount, and you can always reduce how much you put in or stop completely if you aren\u0027t satisfied with the results being put out or if you\u0027re in a situation that leaves you without the funds for this kind of thing. If the \"per song\" idea worries you, don\u0027t freak out yet!\u00a0Patreon has you covered with their \"cap\" limit, which lets you limit how much you spend per month, no matter how many songs are released during that time frame.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e Contribution is \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ecompletely optional\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e! I still love and thank you if you are an active follower of my work, whether or not you show your support financially or by being one of my amazing subscribers/followers who come together so I am able to share my passion with so many people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://tarastmichel.com/patreon-images/Why%20Did%20You%20Start%20a%20Patreon_zpsmmdmowem.jpg\" style=\"width: 636px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been making videos since the end of 2009 featuring myself performing at the piano, covers with still images to a readily available backtrack, and other kinds of similar work. Unfortunately, through this process, I have had to figure out most things on my own, produce everything from start to finish by myself, and find space to film video when possible with the help of my family with camera work and setup. This process takes a lot of time, effort, and energy, leaving me with inconsistent uploaded content with long gaps of time in between uploads, especially with university classes and part time work on top of everything. I would like to put out higher quality, engaging content that reflects what\u003cstrong\u003e YOU\u003c/strong\u003e, the listener and viewer, would like to see/hear and the quality that is expected of someone like myself who is passionate about their creative content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main goal is be able to produce more frequent content, put out higher quality videos via purchasing better equipment and revising my home video setup, \u00a0hire professionals to help put together my work, and more! I hope to be able to produce some\u00a0original music (which I already write in my free time but would like to be able to release as more polished work), more frequent content, more Loudr song releases, etc!\u00a0With your support, the possibilities are limitless!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://tarastmichel.com/patreon-images/Patreon%20Images/Whats%20in%20it%20for%20me_zpsg9phinjc.jpg\" style=\"width: 637px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOther than faster, higher quality content that reflects what you want to hear, you ask?\u003cbr\u003eWell, If you look to the sidebar, you\u0027ll notice there are rewards that are available for donating within a certain range of amounts. You have the option of claiming these rewards when you contribute. Depending on how much you donate, you will receive the corresponding reward as a thank you for your support!
