    "summary": "\u2763\u25d5 \u203f \u25d5\u2763 As a child I was raised with a mother who collected perfumes and a father who was addicted to video games. My nose is so good at telling scents I could figure out what perfume someone is wearing in a crowd. After working for Lush Cosmetics in 2011 I had discovered how much I love to take baths and work with beauty products. It was only after a friend suggested I should make my own did I experiment and play around with scents in bath bombs. With the proper funding I was able to invest in some video game molds, a plethora of fragrance and essential oils and enough supplies. Then Twootie Tarte was born. \"Twootie\" stemming from a childhood nickname that I also use for my cosplay page and my obsession with the word \"Tarte\" go hand in hand.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI began \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/TwootieTarte\"\u003eTwootie Tarte \u003c/a\u003ewhile I was in college at the very end of 2013. Started to sell at the con circuit in 2014 and I have been building it ever since.\u00a0For \u00a02017 I was able to sell at 13 conventions and one day events. This year I am looking to sell at possibly 20 events in total. It\u0027s thanks to the help of my fans and family that I was able to quit my job last year to pursue Twootie Tarte full time. I am\u00a0also proud to say that\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KawaiiNOLA/\"\u003e Kawaii NOLA \u003c/a\u003enow carries Twootie Tarte products.\u00a0Slowly but surely I am expanding my business and my fan base across the south but my dream is to be able to sell at events over in Los Angeles and up in the north. Maybe even one day sell at Design Festa in Japan! I want to change how the world bathes and leave everyone smelling good and feeling happy. Together I believe we can defeat the con funk for good with the more conventions I sell at! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThrough my Patreon I hope to use this as a front for donations from generous fans but to also reward the big fans. Patreon is also where I am hosting my monthly subscription box so please be sure to look into that! Thank you so much for reading this and taking the time to check me out!"

I have a bachelors in Theatre with a minor in Psychology. During my time in college I was blessed with the chance to study abroad at Doshisha University in Kyoto, Japan. And yes I do speak a little Japanese.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTraveling, bathing, video games and sleeping are my favorite things to pass the time. I have 2 adorable little hedgehogs and recently made room for a cute french bulldog named Fluer. In my free time I like to dress up in Japanese fashion or cosplay with my friends at anime conventions. I am happily taken by the sweetest guy in the galaxy Sean the Sheep. My favorite band is Gorillaz. In the past I have worked for Lush Cosmetics, Michaels and Whole Foods. I am now the proud owner of Twootie Tarte which I started part way through college.\u00a0",
