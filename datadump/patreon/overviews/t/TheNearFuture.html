    "summary": "It\u2019s time to think about the future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAbout me: a decade ago, Scribner published my book \u003cem\u003eMaxed Out\u003c/em\u003e. Millions of people either\nread the book or saw the film on which it was based (or both, I guess) in no\nsmall part because on my birthday that year, Lehman Brothers unexpectedly\ndeclared bankruptcy, turbo-boosting the financial crisis I\u2019d described as\ninevitable. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nElizabeth Warren, a major voice in \u003cem\u003eMaxed Out\u003c/em\u003e, has shown how after decades of calm, financial \u201cpanics\u201d\nhave become both cyclical and more severe. Like hurricanes. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo last year I wrote a book that very few people read called\n\u003cem\u003eUpside Down\u003c/em\u003e. It lays out the\nsocio-economic conditions that led to Trump and that are leading to a looming\ncrisis, worse than \u201808.  Think of it this\nway: during Hurricane Katrina, the wealthy were largely able to protect\nthemselves while the poor were left battered, but the next superstorm will affect\neveryone. Massive clouds, aka bubbles, are \nforming: student and auto loan defaults alone are dwarfing the mortgage\nmess of \u201808. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nHaving already lived in Asia, last year I moved to Mexico,\nstill a cash economy and in many ways the inverse of the U.S.. For decades,\nMexico has provided the fuel of our economic boom with cheap, reliable labor\nbut like everything, that has come with a price: violent trafficking in drugs\nand human beings. \u003cem\u003eErgo\u003c/em\u003e calls for \u201cthe\nwall.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are deeply in debt and deeply divided. The issue of our\ntime is the end of the American Empire. I\u2019ve gathered ideas and data for a book\nbut that\u2019s not the right tool. Books are static tomes that must have a certain\nstructure to keep the reader\u2019s attention. A punchy voice helps, but at the\nexpense of intellect and diversity. Same with conclusions and prescriptives. Telling\npeople what to do or think is a mistake.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut what if the bookend to \u003cem\u003eMaxed Out\u003c/em\u003e could be dynamic and open-ended instead? The\npossibilities become more exciting, something that Patreon makes possible. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nToday I\u2019m launching a think tank of sorts (but not an echo\nchamber!) called \u003cem\u003eFuture Thought Tank\u003c/em\u003e.\nUltimately, the project will have three major components: \u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst is a fictional, serialized book based on five distinct\nstories of Americans living in the eye of the \u201cbig big one.\u201d Because only in\nfiction can we imagine the unimaginable, predict the unintended and choose our\nown adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSecond will be a series of videos, featuring\ndocumentary-style interviews and travelogues from around Asia and North\nAmerica. I hope to offer a moving picture of where people, resources and ideas\nare moving\u2014\u003cem\u003eMaxed Out\u003c/em\u003e but in real time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThird is a \u201cphantom\u201d investment portfolio where our knowledge\nis synthesized into financial opportunity, wherever and whenever prudent.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe future is not just about money, however. The\nconsequences of diminishing American hegemony are omnipresent: the failure of\nyoung people to \u201claunch,\u201d the worship of escapism (cosplay, binge TV), addiction\nand suicide, the substitution of stigma for human connection, the loss of\nmobility due to lifelong debt, the dislocation of workers/emergence of\n\u201chelicopter money\u201d and the tilt to China. But to be opportunistic we must also\nrealize that it is often darkest before the dawn. The world will continue to\nspin, billions are entering a global middle class, creating awesome opportunity where parents sacrifice for their children and grandchildren.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo each \u003cem\u003eFTT \u003c/em\u003ecomponent\nwill be guided by these principles: one, information is now the most valuable\ncommodity; two, we should always look forward, not backward; three, context is as\nimportant as substance; four, we must avoid arbitrary biases and deadlines;\nfive, discretion is more valuable than publicity; six, if it\u2019s not worth doing,\nit\u2019s not worth doing well. But most important: \u003cem\u003ethe pursuit of happiness is universal.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEach of us is already changing the world and investing our\nresources, every day. My professional life is dedicated to doing both more\nthoughtfully. \u003cbr\u003e"
