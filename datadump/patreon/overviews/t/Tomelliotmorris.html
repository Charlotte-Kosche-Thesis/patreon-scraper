    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eHi there\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting my Patreon page. I\u0027ve always been pretty restless with music. I use it as a kind of therapy, which for me, means writing every day. This can be lyrics, photography, songs and more. To date, I have released over a dozen solo eps/albums, not including the records that I have released with bands or the writing that I have done for others. Just under two years ago, I withdrew from releasing solo music for some time in order to take stock of what it was I was doing, and what it was that I actually wanted to carry on doing and achieve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I have regularly released solo records, the time has come to adapt that output to something more considered and, in a way, condensed. So, rather than collecting my output onto several publicly released records per year, I want to make the majority of them available to the people who are really interested, and want to see the background workings of those songs and projects develop. I will still aim to put out an album or ep here and there, but at a reduced and more considered rate. The items available here as part of this Patreon will be exclusive in terms of their numbers and content. Included on each item will be early recordings, songs that don\u0027t make it to a commercially released album, alternate versions and so forth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, it is important to me to make this ongoing project as open as possible to people. There is an entry level available that will provide access to a monthly update, with a live performance of a song that I am working on, with a downloadable version of that song.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to sharing the first video, and song, here with you soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTom Elliot Morris\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.tomelliotmorris.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.tomelliotmorris.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://limitedrun.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/1259156/38.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
