This very same group of people have worked with me, albeit a struggle in the beginning, to bring my artwork to the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to present the progress of my journey of becoming a professional artist and sharing, from what many have told me ,my God given gift with the world. If my artwork is able to touch and inspire at least one person to create their own piece of work, then my job here is complete. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not have much training outside of a high school art classroom. Most every piece of art I produce is through practice and personal experimentation with the medium. My parents always told me that I was drawing with anything I could get my hands on from the time I could hold a pen or pencil. How much of that is true shall be left to the historians to possibly one day figure out. For now, I am practicing my craft and honing my skill to show the world that art is in everything and everyone.",
