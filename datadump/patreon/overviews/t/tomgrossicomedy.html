Any person who attempts to entertain for a living is nothing without their fans, and I will never ever forget that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 5th grade, I\u0027ve been drawn to making people laugh. Just about every teacher since that point has pointed out similarities to Jim Carrey. While I was honored to get such a comparison, I never thought I\u0027d do comedy professionally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout 8 years ago, I ventured into improv comedy in college and fell in love with it. About 4 years ago, I jumped head first into stand up comedy. Finally, 3 years ago, I started Packast, a weekly Packers podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to 2018, and I could not be happier with how my comedic career has turned out. With almost 500,000 views on Youtube, creating my first comedy album, and the amazing support of the #grossiposse, I am truly lucky.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be completely honest, I never had any plans to create a Patreon. I just didn\u0027t have the resources to produce what I wanted, and didn\u0027t have a comprehensive plan on what I would do if I began getting funding from fans.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year, Packast, a podcast I began in my basement 3 years ago, with no radio experience, and $0 towards marketing, broke over 100,000 views just for this season. While this is a drop in the bucket for larger creators, this is an incredible achievement for me. In addition, on March 24th 2018, I will be creating my first comedy album.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year has really put what I want to achieve into focus, and so now, is why I am ready to create a Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who are here from Packast, I want to tell you that it has and will always be free of charge. I will never put it behind a paywall, and will continue to produce content for as long as I physically can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is not for easy money, this is not so I can scale back, this is instead to create something even bigger \u0026amp; better. Here is what your funding can help me do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- New visual equipment for Packast, including live streams, and even more content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- New podcasts/shows, that will again, always remain free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- Future comedy albums, as well as tours.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re still here, I want to thank you for checking this out. Whether you support with $1 or $250, I will keep on doing what I\u0027ve been doing since 5th grade, entertaining you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTom\u003cbr\u003e"
