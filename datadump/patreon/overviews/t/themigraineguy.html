The number of YouTube videos that I publish that month determines how much you contribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, if you pledge $1 per YouTube video, and that month I publish 4 videos, then you\u0027ll contribute $4 for that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, you can easily set a monthly contribution limit when you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there\u0027s no surprises at the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, you can pledge $1 per YouTube video, get access to the rewards at that tier, but cap your monthly contribution limit to $5.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u0027t worry about missing out on any content either. You will still continue to get my YouTube videos even if I publish additional YouTube videos that go beyond your maximum contribution limit for the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhere Your Money Goes.\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/give-money.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables me to invest more time into producing free product reviews, medication overviews, and all the other kinds of videos for the headache and migraine community that you\u0027ve enjoyed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, it takes time and resources to create content, both which require money. Your support lets me focus on making the most valuable content for you that I possibly can instead of spending as much time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you. \u00a0Also, I am more able to purchase products to review so that you can know if those products are worth you time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt also helps me replace broken equipment, produce higher-quality videos, and free up some of my time to do more important things, like investing time into my family!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eDo I Have To Become A Patron?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/no-money1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo! \u00a0Please don\u0027t become a patron if you\u0027re low on money or are struggling financially. I know EXACTLY what that feels like and want you to take care of more important priorities first. I will continue to make educational videos and will continue to operate theheadachereview.com so that you can hear from other headache and migraine sufferers just like YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWho is The Migraine Guy?\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://theheadachereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Patreon_Banner_3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, first things first. \u00a0My real name is Kevin Patton. \u00a0I am a graduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. \u00a0I am married to another graduate student at UNL whose name is Patricia. \u00a0Our cat Roo rounds us out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began suffering from migraines many years ago, but it is only in the last 3 years that they become chronic (more than 14/month). \u00a0After having a doctor who, while well intentioned, merely throw a variety of medications at me, I began to do my own research.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany doctors and medications later, I attempted to find a YouTube channel that would help demystify the migraine experience. \u00a0While there were a few channels that had an occasional migraine video there didn\u0027t seem to be any channel devoted to migraine education. \u00a0It was at that moment that I realized I needed to take my rather painful circumstance and attempt to transform it into something that could help others. \u00a0The videos expanded into a Facebook support group which is thriving and genuinely supportive. \u00a0From there I realized the need to create a headache and migraine community review website that would allow OUR voices to influence others like use before we see a particular doctor, try a particular medication, or buy a particular product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is an enormous amount of pain and sadness if you are a migraine sufferer who does not have a support system. \u00a0None of us needs to be alone. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support. \u00a0I truly appreciate and thank you for it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"
