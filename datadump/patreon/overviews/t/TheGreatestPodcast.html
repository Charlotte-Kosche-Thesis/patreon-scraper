    "summary": "World Championship Wrestling was a hell of a thing. This is something we\u2019ve been coming to grips with over the past 30-odd episodes we\u2019ve been doing of our show. We, in this case, are Graeme, Jetta and Adrienne of the Greatest Podcast in the History of Our Sport, an irreverent retrospective of the promotion that rose to redefine success in pro wrestling, only to fall farther and harder than anyone before or since. It\u2019s been more than 15 years since the last episode of WCW aired on television. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce a giant of the industry, one that held what would become the monolithic WWE under its weight, WCW still echoes through modern wrestling. The promotion is gone, but the legend remains. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019re here to remember that legend. Also, to remember the parts that were less than legendary. Because remember, for every pair of Outsiders they had, there was a Shockmaster.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom the height of the New World Order at their most popular, to the dregs that remained of WCW in the year 2000, we\u2019re going through all of it, in no particular order. But we don\u2019t just go for the big stuff\u2014we shoot to explore all the facets of WCW, every interesting midcard worker, every weird backstage battle, every offhand comment about \u201cvanilla midgets.\u201d Did you know Jerry Lynn was in WCW and he was a different guy from Jerry Flynn? Did you know two grown adults fought over ownership of the letter T in WCW?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe love wrestling, and we love to talk about wrestling, to share all that we know and contribute to the oral history of an entertainment form that we all firmly believe can survive epochs of human history\u2014don\u2019t let the fact that we make jokes fool you, we\u2019re all about this stuff. But we\u2019re also folks with lives, and plates we need to keep spinning. With your support, we can adopt a more regular schedule, upgrade our gear and explore more of the world of wrestling. We may even be able to wrangle guests to speak firsthand about their experiences in WCW- a lot of folks not only have their own stories, some of them are still working in the industry. You\u2019ll be with us in the crowd, but you\u2019ll also be helping us to perform better. If that\u2019s not pro wrestling as all hell, I don\u2019t know what is.\u003cbr\u003e"
