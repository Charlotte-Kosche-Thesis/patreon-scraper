    "summary": "Hello current and future Patrons! Welcome to our Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHO ARE WE:\u003cbr\u003eWe are the Normies. Our channel provides you with weekly skits, group reaction videos, and commentary on just about anything in the entertainment landscape. We deliver content that we are passionate about and are very open to the suggestion of the community we have built that has allowed us to get this far!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn our YouTube adventure, we created a community of wonderful fans and subscribers that love to watch trending TV shows and movies with us. We pride ourselves in being interactive with our fans. We enjoy reading contributions from our fans below each video we release, be it insightful, funny or pure troll mastery, and we always take their suggestions, ideas and opinions into account to determine our next move. The sense of community we created distinguishes us from other reaction channels and we want to continue to build this wonderful relationship by delivering new, better and original content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY BECOME A PATRON:\u003cbr\u003eWe were surprised by the outpour of support we received in forms of care packages coming into our recently opened PO BOX. Even though it may seem weird for a reaction channel to start a Patreon (fookin sellouts), we want to have more time and freedom to keep building our community and deliver more, better quality and original content that our fans desire. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith our channel becoming more sustainable, we will have more time, less complications and better equipment to create. Your financial contributions will be used towards new equipment, allow us to have more editing time, and mainly, it will give YOU an opportunity to interact with us even more and influence which way our content goes next. We have a variety of different pledges to choose!  Have access to some of our content early, make up crazy lines for our new monthly Fan Made Skits, watch a movie with us, maybe see more of Rana\u2019s feet, have a chat with your favorite Normie/s and who knows you might even see a twerk off! I mean\u2026 God knows what\u2019s in that \u2018Normie Vault\u2019, right?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe really value each and every small or bigger contribution. If just half of our subs each donated only $1 a month..boy, oh, boy\u2026 With that money we could make Jon Snow the next president. So please contribute and help us make YouTube reactions legit again!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eThe Normies\u003cbr\u003eRana, Chris, Micky, Pat, Navi, Marketa, Suraj, Nahid\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.
