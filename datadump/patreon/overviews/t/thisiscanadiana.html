    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eCanadiana\u003c/strong\u003e is a web series that follows Adam Bunch as he geeks his way across the country in search of the most incredible tales in Canadian history. From Halifax Harbour to Vancouver Island, from major cities to secluded towns, Adam will dig up the mind-blowing true stories: the famous, the infamous, and the unfamiliar. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Canadians, we\u0027ve seen our cities and towns turned into foreign movie sets, our lives flooded with the history of other nations.\u00a0We want to do Canadian history the justice it deserves, and bury the phrase \"Canadian history is boring,\" because it\u0027s anything but.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur mission is to make episodes that entertain and engage you with the stuff you didn\u0027t hear about in history class. Stories you aren\u0027t going to find elsewhere. We are going to cover the highs and the lows, the heroes and the villains, and everything in between. All in a form we think is best suited to the content: high-quality YouTube videos. We aim to make episodes about once a month anywhere from 5 minutes to 15 minutes long.\u00a0We\u0027ve chosen to do this as a web series because we want to build an open tapestry of stories. Too often history is crammed into an arbitrary broadcast length. We want each story to take the time it needs, and no more. And rather than a linear series, we want to create an interconnected web of stories that can grow endlessly and collectively produce a remarkable new image of our country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do that, we need help. We aren\u0027t trying to profit from Patreon, we are trying to keep the series sustainable. So...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003eWhere does my contribution go?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLocation Shoots:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the driving factors behind the idea for Canadiana is our desire to feature the locations that the stories took place in. Instead of a couple of images, textbooks, and articles, you get to \u003cstrong\u003esee\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0the places that were defined by the history. Whether or not buildings have been torn down, landscapes have changed, or modernity has erased the past. The idea being: the next time you walk past that building, down that unremarkable street, or by the statue you see everyday, you might stop for a moment to feel the history running beneath everything. Nondescript buildings will suddenly become memory palaces. The suburb/city/town/village you grew up in may take on a new character. You might even see ghosts. We think this sense of discovery and wonder has been completely ignored in Canada and we\u0027d like to try and contribute to it. We are going to capture these places on camera like they never have been before. Some will be new views on locations you know, others will have never seen the inside of a camera lens. We aren\u0027t after stock footage B-roll, we are after the character and narratives behind it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do this, we need gas money, and ultimately...plane money. We need to cross the country to do this right. Hostels and travelling costs are our primary reason for signing up with Patreon. We want to show you Dawson City in the Yukon, Iqaluit in Nunavut, Fogo Island in Newfoundland. We want to offer virtual tours of ruins, of abandoned bunkers, of mountain ranges. We want to combat the never-ending wave of films and TV shows pasting other countries on top of the already storied places in Canada that deserve to show-off their own historical and cultural identities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGear/Studio:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we set out to make the series, we knew that filming with shoddy gear in our apartments was out of the question. No matter how great the story is, covering it with a veneer of mediocrity would only serve to further the trend of Canadian-history-done-wrong. No more underfunded and lazy re-enactments. We wanted to produce the best images that have ever been captured of these locations, with broadcast quality sound and video. We\u0027ve invested heavily in our gear so far, but cameras break and mics fail. We need to rent some of the tools required to do this as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also shoot in a studio space for various segments, which we rent by the hour. In that studio, we need to be able to fill it with props and a set based on the episode\u0027s content. Set design and rental is a realm we have no way of funding ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePost-production:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this leads to post-production. You may have seen slideshow-style videos on YouTube channels before. Some are great, others are not. We don\u0027t want to just toss a photo on screen, and then another one, and then another one...ad infinitum. We want the archival and animations we use to stand-out as visually entertaining pieces that help tell history in a new way. We are determined to never release a simple slideshow on YouTube. The archival sections are not filler, we strive to make them work in tandem with the location shooting to boost the experience and give a fresh new take on the history. But they take an enormous amount of effort to create. Animations that are so crucial to tell these stories require an insane amount of time for what could be a few seconds in the video. At the moment we are scrambling to cram it around our day-jobs, but the hope is that if Canadiana can get self-sufficient, we can work on it full-time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis series is dead-on-arrival without your support. We think Canadians would love to learn more about the events, people, and places that make this country so often weird and wonderful, whether or not they\u0027re already fans of history. We\u0027re confident our team will be able to contribute to that in a new and entertaining way\u2014we plan on proving it to you over the course of the episodes we\u0027ve already shot. And we\u0027re desperately excited to share even more stories with you (it\u0027s a never-ending list). And so, we want to thank you for watching, and if you consider dropping us $1 a video or more, we owe you, big-time. We are going to do this thing until we can\u0027t anymore, and we hope we never hit that mark because this country is packed from coast to coast to coast with some of the best (and worst) stories you\u0027ll ever hear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWARNING: Patreon only works in US dollars (it took us a while to realize that), so keep that in mind if you do choose to support us!
