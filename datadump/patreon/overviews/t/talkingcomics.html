What the site has blossomed into is amazing even to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTC has been around for nearly 7 years as a podcast and web site. We\u2019ve grown from being a site that featured\none weekly podcast and a few notable reviews to a full-fledged geek\nentertainment hub. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was my dream for this Patreon to exist to reward the hard work that goes into the site and to be able to upgrade our podcast network\u2019s equipment to continue to bring you all the best possible geek entertainment that\u0027s possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThats still my hope, but I\u0027ve realized that I need to hit a certain level on Patreon to achieve this lofty goal. The first goal is keeping the lights on. The podcasts cost about $100 a month to keep hosting, then there is the fees for the various services I use to ensure our team stays connected and that our videos look great. Then there is the hosting and fees for the websites which runs between $10-15 a month. The long and short of it is by the time we clear taxes it costs nearly $200 to just keep this enterprise going and with a new baby I need your help to make sure that keeps happening!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past I\u0027ve promised content that included lots of people from our site. I can\u0027t do that anymore. Its not fair to them, but what I can promise is I will do my best to bring you extra stuff every month. However, I won\u0027t do some at the expense of growing the thing you are all here for in the first place. So I ask you to be patient with me as we grow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is this grows into something that can sustain me doing it full time and then moves to something where I can begin to pay the awesome contributors like Joey, Steve, Bob, and Huw who have worked so tirelessly to make this site great. Honestly it\u0027s not that far away of a goal!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can help us make that happen with a\nsmall donation. If every single person who listened to the Talking Comics podcast network donated $1, we would be able to give our contributors a decent rate for their\nwords. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe team we have is amazing and our community is amazing. In all of this time, we\u0027ve kept the site and the podcast ad-free because I believe in our passion project and we want to share it with the world without compromise.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you enjoy what we do, please support\nus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom our readers and listeners:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Talking Comics has an honest, respectful appreciation for the medium with diverse, entertaining opinions and reviews.\"\u003c/em\u003e -Carol Cross\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"The CNN of comic books and its culture.
