I wanted to \nsee if I could connect with cool witches around the world, while sharing\n my own personal experiences with witchcraft. I wanted to talk about \nwitchcraft\u0027s role in body positivity, in my own personal brand of \nfeminism, and in my life. I wanted to share books, and share tips and \nspells, and share jokes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope I\u0027ve done that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\n response from those of you who take the time out of your day to listen \nto me rant and rave on the airwaves is honestly life changing. I never \nexpected it, but I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re all here with me on this trip.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoing into the podcast\u0027s third year\u003c/strong\u003e, I have no plans of slowing down or stopping! I\u0027ve had a difficult year, health-wise (another reason your patronage means the absolute world to me! Some of that money definitely went towards medication, transportation to the doctor, and feeding Jimmy Hoppa when I was broke. He\u0027s grateful too ;)) which forced me to take more time off than I\u0027d like, but I\u0027m excited to go forward this year!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thefatfeministwitch.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/28208338_10160011108155273_688978918_o.jpg\" style=\"width: 290px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRather than donating to this Patreon campaign and just waiting around for gifts to show up in the mail that you could probably go out and buy yourself or getting a shout out on my website, the \"rewards\" levels gain you access to a private group where we can all reap the reward of just having other witches to connect, practice (and bitch!) with, as well as a look behind the curtain, so to speak, of the topics I cover on the podcast and blog. In the group we have a monthly book club, featured sketchy herb and magic rock, and celebrate sabbats and moon phases together. As the group grows, so will what we can do with it. At the heart of it all, though, is that it serves as a place for like-minded witches to share tips and spells, experiences, friendship with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that this will foster friendship and spiritual growth for all of us, while allowing me to do what I do best - loudly and ridiculously rambling about magic on the internet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thefatfeministwitch.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/blogsignature.png\" style=\"width: 250px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
