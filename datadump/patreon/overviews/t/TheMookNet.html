    "summary": "I love writing and sharing about tabletop RPGs and, hopefully, you love reading about them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last 17 years I\u0027ve had a website staked out at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.themook.net/gamegeekery/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTheMook.Net\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and from day one it has been predominantly about RPGs, especially\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGURPS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (though in those days, it was mostly recaps of games I\u0027ve run and house rules. Oh, and a visitor counter. We all had a visitor counter).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a long time the most popular section was\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.themook.net/rpg/examples/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCombat Examples\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, detailing small sample encounters of how the GURPS combat system works. But a few months back I started focusing more on the blog, \"Game Geekery,\" and found that I really, really like releasing gaming material on a more frequent schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee, I\u0027ve always loved writing about games, but we all know it\u0027s never easy to find time for the things we love. Working full-time, scavenging for overtime when it\u0027s available, and being stuck on the never-ending treadmill of chasing down odd jobs and freelance gigs doesn\u0027t leave much time for pursuing passions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat Is Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon is a crowd-sourcing service for creative types, similar to Kickstarter but focused on tiny, ongoing support instead of much larger one-time pledges. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn ye olden days, patrons would provide funds to the artists whose work they enjoyed so those artists could continue being creative and still have luxuries like \"food on their plate\" and \"shoes on their feet.\" Patreon is a modern implementation of that concept -- the artists create, the supporters support, and everybody wins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho Are You?\u003c/h3\u003eI am Mook, a looong time gamer and GM, and author of \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/howtobeagurpsgm/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to Be a GURPS GM\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\" I run tabletop games at home and at conventions, try to expand the hobby whenever and wherever I can, and write about games and other geekery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want that to be more often!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat Is Game Geekery?\u003c/h3\u003e\"Game Geekery\" is a blog I\u0027ve had up for a couple of years, and have lately been making more the focus of my online endeavors. I talk about gaming conventions, creating your own adventures, tips for GMs, recaps of one-shots and campaigns I\u0027ve run, and examples of combat and other rules in action. I also create a number of downloadable PDFs useful for GURPS GMs and players -- fillable character sheets, forms, that sort of thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI post at \u003cem\u003eleast\u003c/em\u003e once a week, sometimes more, usually on Thursdays. Much of it is about GURPS Fourth Edition, but there\u0027s also a fair bit of Fate Core and just general celebration of all things gaming and geeky.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy Would I Want To Support That?\u003c/h3\u003eThe only real reason is\u2026 because you enjoy it and you want to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheMook.Net has always been, will always be, an open and free site. The reality is, though, it\u0027s not zero cost, either in funds (hosting, domain registration) or time (site maintenance, finding time to write around paying work).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf it can start paying for itself, that\u0027s one less bill to deal with. Getting support from Patrons makes it easier to be enthusiastic and creative, and to find quality writing time instead of stressing over lining up more and more freelance gigs to make ends meet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContinuing the blog as-is, that\u0027s just the beginning. I have projects I\u0027d love to finally be able to spend time on and share -- more extensive rules tweaks, more reviews, more combat examples, even a full game setting I\u0027ve had percolating for a good, long while. The more support I can find, the more likely it is these things can see the light of day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the bottom line is: apart from any perks you get from the level of Patron at which you support, you can just keep on reading like you always have without changing a thing. What becoming a Patron \u003cem\u003edoes \u003c/em\u003edo is help keep the blog and site chugging along into the future, and increase the chances I can expand it even more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow Does This Work?\u003c/h3\u003eIt\u0027s honestly not complicated, I swear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, go to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/home\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ethe main Patreon page\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and click \"Sign Up\" or \"Join Today\" to create an account. Patreon will ask for the usual items: a name, a valid e-mail address, and a password.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext, go to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/themooknet\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTheMook.Net Patreon page\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (that\u0027s this page) and click \"Become a Patron.\" Choose the level you would like to support at, how you would like to fund it, and that\u0027s it -- you\u0027re a Patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil you choose to stop supporting, Patreon will automatically collect the amount you pledge around the 1st of the month -- \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e more than you pledge, and \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e more frequently than once a month. There will be no surprises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, and thank you for supporting if you can. I\u0027m looking forward to growing the website, hearing what you all think, and writing even more!\u003cbr\u003e"
