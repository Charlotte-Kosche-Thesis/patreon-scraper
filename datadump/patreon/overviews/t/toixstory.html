    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHello and welcome to ToixStory\u0027s Patreon! I am ToixStory, and I create alternate history cartography, original fiction, and blogs across the web, primarily on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://toixstory.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edeviantart\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=327851\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ealternatehistory.com\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/blog/toixstory\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.toixstory.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy own website\u003c/a\u003e. I believe that my work should always be free to view\u2014that is, never behind a paywall\u2014and so all of my cartographical and written works are put on here for everyone to see. To give people incentive to donate to my Patreon, then, I give exclusive bonuses with each post I make; think of it like a behind the scenes feature on a movie. Everyone can see the movie, but the people who pay get to see extras. That way, you\u0027ll never have to worry about being forced to buy the main body of my work. This will, from time to time, include source files, notes, bonus content, and other little tidbits I can add in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll also notice that I have my donations set up on a month-by-month basis, rather than by project. This is because the maps, books, short stories, and blogs I produce take a lot of time and energy, and may, occasionally, last longer than a month. With monthly donations, I don\u0027t have to worry about having enough food on my table, and thus I never rush any of my projects. The finished product will always be the very best I can make it. Plus, it means if I\u0027m more productive one month it won\u0027t hurt your wallet, and instead allow you to sit back and enjoy the extra content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFunding\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne thing immediately different about my Patreon from many others is that there are no reward tiers beyond the most basic. This is because, as I\u0027ve grown to be a part of the Patreon community I increasingly believe that it is not right to withhold content from those who simply don\u0027t have the money to pay it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead, my funding will be set up similar to other projects like the Humble Bundle. Starting with a base of $1, you, the patron, can donate as much as you feel is right per month and get all the content I give to Patreons no matter if you give $1 or $100 or $1000. You pay what you think the content is worth, and I\u0027ll be more than happy to provide said content for you. Ultimately it\u0027s up to you what you think my content is worth and how much of it you want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe goals setting out with this Patreon are simple: to, eventually, make enough money to host a large amount of content on my own website, absolutely free to everyone. That includes original fiction, blogs, cartography, random art, and more all paid for by patrons here. I will endeavor to keep my work free and open and, perhaps most importantly, free of paywalls or advertisements. Patrons thus serve a crucial role of allowing totally free and open creativity rather than having to seek out the corporate world for my talents to be honored.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProjects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, my projects range from small-scale to large. On a month by month basis, you\u0027ll be seeing the maps I create either on my own or by commission, and the occasional short story as well. Many of the coming maps will be more detailed and feature a greater amount of content than ones in the past as I grow and learn as a cartographer. Sometimes one map may take anywhere from weeks to just a few days as I get my technique down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, with writing, I\u0027ll be working on my two major projects: one series of short stories and novellas set in the a cyberpunk future, and the other an alternate history series that promises to be one of my most extensive projects yet. While both will require months of writing, tons of research, and a great amount of editing, they will promise to be some of the best content I\u0027ll ever produce. I\u0027ll give updates as often as I can on them, and will post up work in progresses for feedback or just enjoyment to everyone on here before I put them up on my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting these projects may not seem like much, but by doing so you\u0027ll be helping entire worlds come to life. I believe the world can be a better place when everyone\u0027s creative vision is free and open rather than stuck behind corporate walls, and I fully believe that Patreon is a major tool in allowing that to happen.\u003cbr\u003e"

I am an avid writer and cartographer, but for the purposes of this Patreon I\u0027ll focus on the latter. I make alternate history maps using Inkscape and, occassionally, Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator for everyone to view, and create detailed universes for them to exist in. My maps ask questions like, \"What would North America look like if Cromwell\u0027s Commonwealth had survived?\" and \"What if China was ruled by an Islamic emperor?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do the maps mostly on my own, though occasionally by request or commission as I enjoy watching other peoples\u0027 ideas come to life. However, I also believe that everyone should be able to view my work. So, I figured that Patreon would be the way to go to fund my efforts and make it easier to get out new content as often as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, that\u0027s enough about me, I hope I\u0027ll see some support for my craft, if for nothing else than to be able to give out lots of bonus goodies to patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also check out my blog at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://toixstory.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etoixstory.com\u003c/a\u003e and my gallery of art at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://toixstory.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etoixstory.deviantart.com\u003c/a\u003e!",
