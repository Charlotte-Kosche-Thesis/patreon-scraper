    "summary": "Hello! The Library of Ohara is a site dedicated to analyzing the contents of the beautiful manga of One Piece, from in-depth analysis of every chapter every week to other informative projects about the lore and characters of the world. Explore it to find more about all the fascinating things in the world of One Piece! https://thelibraryofohara.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been suggested to create an option for support such as this one for quite a long time. I\u2019ve received a lot of requests and suggestions to open up something like this and it\u2019s definitely something that it\u2019s been on my mind for quite some time. I was unsure about if I should ever go with this, since the main aim of my content is for it to be free, this is for me first and foremost something I do out of passion and fun. I also don\u2019t like feeling like a liability of someone else, so I wasn\u2019t completely sure if I wanted to open this avenue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter talking about it with some people, I decided to go with it, but under one condition. This platform will exist only as a way for those that wish to support to be given the option. I\u2019ve decided not to include any tiers or rewards with Patreon so that you can be your own judge on how much you wish to support me. It would be easy to lock away stuff like Chapter Secrets 24 hours early behind a reward and other things like that, but that\u2019s just not what I want to do. I\u2019m going to be as transparent as possible and offer no rewards of sorts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing able to gain from what I create is fine, but I want my decisions with the Library to be led mostly by what I want to do, not turn it into a product. But since I\u2019ve received quite a lot of requests, I\u2019ve also decided to open up the option. As someone who is still a student and has to rely on a small amount of budget, any amount really helps out, especially considering the time I put in Chapter Secrets and other projects for the Library every single week. Even a small amount every month could make a big difference for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut with that said, for those that do not have the means to support me, don\u2019t worry about it, seriously. As I\u2019ve said, the last thing I want to feel is like I\u2019m a liability to others. If you check my content every week, that is reward enough for me, so don\u2019t push yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd most importantly, this is not going to really change anything. I\u2019ll continue working hard to deliver my content for everyone to enjoy. Thank you to everyone who has supported me so far, be it through Patreon, support messages or simply being there for me. Thank you for believing in me."
