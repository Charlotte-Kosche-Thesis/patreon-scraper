Just like how you walk, I make my character go through life, sometimes fearing for their lives as they don\u0027t know if going to a bus stop will be the end of them, and other times playing the part of a DnD (Dungeons and Dragons) type character, on an adventure. I\u0027m the kind of person who prays the Dungeon Master doesn\u0027t decide to spawn Beholders at level two. It\u0027s happened, trust me, instant deaths. Nothing is worse than a bad DM.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to rationalize the unknown, make it seem as if this could be you. Instead of having a character dramatized as his mother dies, I would rather show a new side, a new, frightening point of view, instead of a Drama Queen\u0027s \"Nooo, my mom! Why!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write Horror, Adventure, Romance, Mystery, Thriller, and anything else I damn well please to, when I please to. Of course, the fans all assist in this as I love the support given to me by you. I wouldn\u0027t be here without you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is who I am. Now let\u0027s go on an adventure, together."
