    "summary": "Hey there, welcome to my Patreon page! You can call me Tero, which is obviously not my real name, but this is the internet - where everything\u0027s made up and the names don\u0027t matter! It is worth following me on \u003ca href=\"http://teromain.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e or at least checking in on it once in a while if you are a Patron, since I tend to talk about upcoming things most often there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere may occasionally be \u003cstrong\u003eNSFW CONTENT\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0here (only in text though, never images!). So I un-designated my entire account from being marked as NSFW because Paypal does not allow pledging to accounts like that. So instead I will try to mark any chapters that have \u0027explicit\u0027 content in them from now on (and go back and mark old chapter as well). If you ever had a problem pledging through PayPal, that may have been the issue.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are a new Patron, the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://teromain.tumblr.com/patreoncontents\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etable of contents for bonus material and Patreon-only stories is here\u003c/a\u003e! This is so you can more easily find older content since Patreon\u0027s organization system is...lacking.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(195, 214, 155);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(198, 217, 240);\"\u003eWho am I and what I do\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been writing stories since being birthed. Or maybe sometime after that, once I learned fine motor skills and the English language and the possibility of becoming a storyteller. Now I\u0027m a twenty-something Californian who\u0027s been sharing science fiction and fantasy stories featuring lgbt+ characters free online for ten years, and I plan on continuing to do that for many years to come. You can check out a few of my stories on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/ADTraux\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoodreads\u003c/a\u003e, or read them yourself on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fictionpress.com/u/393499/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFictionpress\u003c/a\u003e. I try to write the kind of stories that I love to read; ones with vibrant worlds and interesting plots, with strong characters that fall somewhere in the lgbt+ spectrum. My most well known story is the Light and Shadow series, a four-book fantasy/political/military series about an alien warrior-prince and his human lover.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a platform that allows independent creators of all kinds of art and media to continue creating their art and media, just with a little help from their friends and supporters! Unlike Kickstarter, it isn\u0027t a big one-time donation to support the production of a really large project \u00a0- instead, becoming a Patron allows you to continually fund a creator\u0027s ongoing smaller projects at whatever amount of money you choose. And you can also get some cool stuff in return for your donations! It\u0027s a great way to give back to artists and content creators that you care about and would like to support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229, 185, 183);\"\u003eWhy am I using Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI would love to share stories for free forever, because I\u0027d love to write things for people to read and enjoy for free, but unfortunately, this is not how life works! Especially as recent health issues in real life have left me pretty much unable to hold regular employment for the present time, and while I don\u0027t expect to make a living off of donations, I made this Patreon account so that if people like what I do and want to help me a out a little, they are able to do so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is a complete experiment for me, and I reserve the right to change around the donation rewards or anything else until I\u0027ve really figured out how this system works, and how I can best utilize it so that everybody gets the most out of it! I may later add things like video chats or hang outs once I\u0027m more familiar with the site\u0027s features! I will probably add higher donation levels later on too, but for now I\u0027ve kept it very basic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(198, 217, 240);\"\u003eThe Future\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI do intend to self-publish (or publish) some of my stories in the not-too-distant future. But until that time, \u003cem\u003ealmost\u003c/em\u003e all of my stories are \u003ca href=\"https://www.fictionpress.com/u/393499/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecompletely free and available to read online at any time\u003c/a\u003e. They will continue to be completely free and completely available until (if or when) they are published. The exceptions are a dystopian sci-fi novel from NaNoWriMo 2011, \u003cem\u003ePolaris Breach\u003c/em\u003e, which I published semi-privately only to my Livejournal (the first chapter is available to read \u003ca href=\"http://teromain.livejournal.com/103972.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e), \u00a0its unfinished sequel also on LJ, and my supernatural novel from NanoWriMo 2014, \u003cem\u003eThe Cold Lamp, \u003c/em\u003ealso unfinished and only available on Patreon. Also, the continuing rewrites of the \u003cem\u003eLight and Shadow \u003c/em\u003eseries are only going to be available here as I prepare them for some form of publishing (likely self) in the future, though the first book (\u003cem\u003eTenebrism)\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand the first two chapters of the second book (\u003cem\u003eChiaroscuro\u003c/em\u003e) are public. Additionally,\u00a0the companion series \u00a0\u003cem\u003eKing and Lionheart,\u003c/em\u003e which is from Keyd\u0027s POV will also only be posted here except for the first chapter which is public.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(198, 217, 240);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003eContact Me?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eSure! The activity section of my page here is meant for that if you are a Patron; leaving comments and such. I am also fairly active on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://teromain.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e, and I also have both a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://teromain.livejournal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLivejournal\u003c/a\u003e and a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://teromain.dreamwidth.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDreamwidth\u003c/a\u003e with identical content. \u00a0I can always be contacted through those or, if all else fails,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/teromain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(229, 185, 183);\"\u003eHow my Patreon works\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThis is set up as a monthly campaign, meaning that you can decide what set amount you would like to pledge each month, regardless of how much I update or how much content I create. You can change or cancel this pledge at any time! I\u0027d suggest reading the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq?ftyp=patrons\"\u003ePatreon FAQ\u003c/a\u003e to get a better idea of how this works!

I\u0027m not really aiming for any certain amount of donations, I just need a little help out. But if those amounts are reached, I feel like I should definitely do something to show my appreciation!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did I choose a set monthly donation over a \u0027per work\u0027 donation?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI tend to update only once a month anyway, because I am a perfectionist and don\u0027t like to release work until it\u0027s the best it can possibly be at the moment. But mostly because I have several on-going stories, not just one, and I didn\u0027t want to have a set up where a patron might end up donating for a updated chapter of a story that they do not read or are not interested in. By making donations at a set monthly amount, it lessens the focus on individual projects and becomes more of general support for me and my work, even if there\u0027s a time where something a patron doesn\u0027t read updates.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAny story I post online will be free and available to everyone.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou do not need to donate in order to read regular updates!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eHowever, extra content and opportunities will become available depending on the amount you want to donate. You can read about all of them below! I may add higher donation rewards later, but for now I\u0027m starting with these."
