Now that we have established ourselves as stable and sustainable, we realize that there are a lot of production value assets to content creation that would greatly improve the quality of our streams, as well as allow us to budget more into our community as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause our community, stream and brand has grown and changed, so too have our goals and pledge rewards to better reflect our experience in the content creation field. Please mind our mess while we revamp this profile.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt present, we perform on a rigorous streaming schedule - 7 days a week! It is a lot of work but I get a lot of fulfillment out of delivering consistent content. As you can imagine, especially with our chat token bots, having that much uptime on our PC\u0027s and machines that host our data and stream our games is very taxing on the hardware. In fact, many of our devices wear out from use in half the time it would if operated for normal consumer needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1174.photobucket.com/albums/r611/JohnTangent/Patron%20Graphic_zpsmi2uvzlh.png\" style=\"width: 581px;\"\u003eYour support would allow us to have the capability to expeditiously replace broken hardware so that we have less downtime on the stream. With the additional funding that we receive through Patron support, we will invest in a multi stream setup, audio and visual on screen effects, props, and cameras that will enable us to take our production and quality to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease be aware that through content creation our bills and living expenses ARE paid for and we are not asking that kind of support. Because of our community, we already can do what we love and have a measure of comfort. This Patreon is for those who enjoy our content and would like a way to support the continued growth and advancement of our content creation. Thank you for considering our content to be worthy of your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1174.photobucket.com/albums/r611/JohnTangent/schedule_zpsxsnrbizv.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGeneral Streaming Schedule - (Times subject to change)\u003cbr\u003e\nMonday - 6:00 AM EST - \u00a02:00 PM EST\u003cbr\u003e\nTuesday - 6:00 AM EST -  2:00 PM EST\u003cbr\u003e\nWednesday - 6:00 AM EST -  2:00 PM EST\u003cbr\u003e\nThursday - 6:00 AM EST -  2:00 PM EST\u003cbr\u003e\nFriday - 6:00 AM EST -  2:00 PM EST\u003cbr\u003e\nSaturday - 6:00 AM EST -  2:00 PM EST\u003cbr\u003e\nSunday- 6:00 AM EST -  2:00 PM EST\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
