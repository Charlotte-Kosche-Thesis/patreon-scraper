So hear me out:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity of befriending two Palestinians in my youth that changed my life and world perspective -- one when I was just 14, who had moved to Jordan due to his family home being taken via force by illegal Israeli settlements. The other while I was in high school -- her family one of the \"Arab 48\", those of Palestinian or Arab heritage who chose/were allowed to stay on their land once it was named as the state of Israel. Because of her Palestinian/Arab identity, she is not allowed to cross checkpoints nor to visit Palestine -- the place of her origin and ancestry just across the border.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story of Ahed Tamimi, a 16 year old Palestinian activist charged and indicted on counts of assaulting an Israeli soldier and interfering with soldier duties, drew from my soul a familiar and deep call towards the plight of the Palestinian people and their fight towards liberation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is with abiding and renewed fire that I seek for myself and The Storyteller Media to be a part of documenting, uplifting, and giving platform to and with the stories, oppression, and incredible resilience of Palestine and her people via documentation, collaboration, and accompaniment. Funds designated for this purpose will be utilized to cover travel, compensation for collaborators, equipment, and other monetary costs of this pursuit.",
