    "summary": "Hello Everyone,\u003cbr\u003emy name is Mary\u0027iam griffin, but you can call me Marri (Mah-ree). I am a youtube creator who dreams to see a world that I somehow inspired into being. I live a zero waste vegan lifestyle and my goal is to help whom ever is taking this journey with me, to have a helping hand. Please message me if you have a struggle in your lifestyle you are trying to surpass and I will put my best advice forward. \u0026lt;3 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur beautiful home, this planet (Earth), is dying. When I say \"Earth is dying\", I truly mean a providing earth is dying, a habitable earth is dying, a diverse life on earth is dying. I do not believe that this is inevitable, I believe a solution is more than possible. In the United states 230 million tons (multiply 230 million by 2000) of trash is produced. If this figure worries you, you can inspire others and you can move mountains through your lifestyle. Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Cherish your belongings and only bring value into your world. Have you ever heard the words fair trade? When you support fair trade you deny child labor, slavery, and impoverishment the ability to thrive. Have you ever heard of something organic? When you support organic foods, not only do you put your money into a healthier body and soil, you support a life of another being (farmers free from chemicals causing cancer in other countries). Have you ever though about the impact of buying a banana? What about coffee or chocolate, or even a smart phone?! The more you ask yourself these questions, the more your life will invite unity and enlightenment towards your impact on the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery day is a chance for a new and improved way of viewing the world. \"The only person that you should aspire to be better than, is the person that you were yesterday.\" When we think locally we can change things globally, and vice versa. The experience of going to a local farmers market is liberating and intimate. Where we receive the items we consume make a big impact on our communities. Supply is demand. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen people think of a world where some people are dying without the experience of a plentiful life, Im sure it saddens most. Im also sure it can be upsetting when you see these subjects being distanced from our minds, and replaced by consumerism and convenience. When we think of hunger in a world of 7.5 billion people, where one country feeds 52 billion animals to then eat, do you not scratch your head? To produce one pound of beef that a standard american would eat in one day requires up to 13 pounds of grain to produce (Not to mention the equivalent of water you would use showering for a whole month). Here in america they feed 70% of there grain to the animals they then eat. A plant-based diet requires one third of the land needed to support an american diet (Trees are cleared for cattle grazing; currently over 40% of the earths land mass is dedicated to animal agriculture).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you thought those figures were shocking, did you know 90% of the worlds large fish are gone due to over fishing, climate change, and pollutants? 70% of the oxygen in our atmosphere is supplied by our ocean. Not only does our ocean supply us with oxygen, but it is the worlds largest net sink of carbon dioxide (Thanks to phytoplankton and marine life). \"By 2050 there will be more plastic in our ocean than fish.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I have giving a quick summary of some of the reasons why I am zero waste and vegan, would you like to take this journey with me? All of money you put forward will go towards product reviews, my university student group activism (protection of the earth and animals society), a local sanctuary (piedmont farm) contributions, and of course, this girl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Marri\u003cbr\u003eHere is my website for more:\u003cbr\u003ewww.thekindjourneyforyou.weebly.com\u003cbr\u003e"
