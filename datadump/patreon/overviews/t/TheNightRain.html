    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eNew Patreon who this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello and welcome. So a little about my background in this endeavor. Building this RTS (Real Time Strategy) game is something I have been thinking about and working at off and on for years. From starting development in Unity then moving to Unreal to writing back story and coming up with universe concepts. I have seen a lot of RTS games that just can\u0027t capture the simple yet exciting feel of say Warcraft, Age Of Empires, StarCraft, and Command \u0026amp; Conquer. So my goal is to work on this project myself and bring others on as needed via contract work to make this world and story I love a reality I can share with you in the form of a RTS game. I am a gamer like I\u0027m guessing many of you are and as such I understand the importance of quality and content needed to make a good game. This is about building the game I want to play and I\u0027m hoping many of you will want to paly it as well. (Why the name? Well it\u0027s been my Xbox Live gamer tag for over 12 years.) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell as it\u0027s just me at this time and Patreon allows me to start with small support and ramp up as I move this forward. This can let me expand the skill base as support allows instead of trying to say grab a large funding amount up front. It also allows me to interact with my Patrons in ways that some other funding solutions just don\u0027t have. I will work to get feedback and communicate progress in a manner that I hope you all will enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does my Money go to?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to be up front I currently have a fulltime job and that pays my bills but it doesn\u0027t leave a lot left for things such as game development and that is where Patreon comes in. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eAt this time (and stage) becoming a patron does not buy you a copy of the game or get you exclusive in game content.\u003c/span\u003e That\u0027s not to say that things along those lines won\u0027t be explored in the future and depending on distribution avenues I may have my hands tied as to what I can give outside of their distribution payment model.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo here is where your money has and is going with the current amount spent on it.*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eRegistering Game Name \u0026amp; Legal Fees\u003c/span\u003e - $0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eConcept Art\u003c/span\u003e -\u003c/span\u003e $90.25\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eGraphic\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e Design\u003c/span\u003e - $210\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eRigging \u0026amp; \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eAnimation\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e - $43.62\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eMusic and Sound\u003c/span\u003e - $0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eLevel Design\u003c/span\u003e - $0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eCoding Work \u003c/span\u003e- $873.50\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eCinematography\u003c/span\u003e - $0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWebsite/Webservers \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e- $156.83\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eGame Servers \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e- $0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eDevelopment Hardware\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e - $0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*These figures will be updated as development continues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat setting is the game in and what are the planed features?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo the setting is medieval fantasy with it\u0027s own world and universe. So yes archers, villagers, swordsman, knights... I think you get the picture. There will be \"magic\" or fantasy units as well but more about those as the time comes. As to what feature are currently planed for this game see the list below*\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSingle Player Campaign / Story\u003cbr\u003e2 Factions to play as\u003cbr\u003eSandbox and Scenario modes\u003cbr\u003eMultiplayer vs AI or Player\u003cbr\u003eDedicated Servers for \"completive play\"\u003cbr\u003eCharacter builder with some RPG elements\u003cbr\u003eLoot system to build and customize your hero unit.\u003cbr\u003eCosmetic (think skins or audio commentary changes) shop for continued server upkeep funding.\u003cbr\u003eFree seasonal content (think maps or custom Scenarios)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAfter release and things are running smoothly expansion content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e*All planed features are subject to change and may change for many different reasons. I will always try to communicate what is going on and direction things are taking in a concise manner but planed features are not and should never be considered as promised features.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo are there any promises?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhile I don\u0027t like to use the \"P word\" I feel that supporting something or someone should include at last a statement of ideology and process as to what to expect. Being a gamer for most of my life I have seen and played many a good and bad game. I have also seen money grabs and poor user experiences fuelled by corporate greed and/or poor planning. These are things I will try my best to avoid as being on the receiving end of them is no fun. I don\u0027t feel all games should be open and free but I also don\u0027t feel that the practices that are now becoming common place pushing the price up games even higher is not right either. In the end I am working on making the game I want to play and something that I would consider my life\u0027s work not just a source of income or passing fancy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor all those that chose to support this long endeavor I thank you and it really does mean the world to me. For those that don\u0027t I wish you the best of luck in other things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFAQ.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs there a release date?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt this current time no. The reason for this is there is a lot of work to do and at this time I am unsure of how long it will take to do it. Also I will not be giving a release date until I am sure the game is done and ready as rushing to finish content I feel is a mistake and leads to poor results. I will though release updates on progress and game direction as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much will the game cost?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt this time I don\u0027t have a solid price point as many factors can play a part in how much a game costs and what is needed to keep it running and updated after launch as well as developing new content. That being said if permitting I would like to sell it for less than many other major companies do if I can keep overhead down and the fact I don\u0027t need a gold plated hummer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will the game be rated?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell that is kind of up to the rating companies and if they will even rate the game. That being said I don\u0027t plan on targeting any specific rating but my guess is it would be on the M (Mature) or higher level due to combat violence and other subjects that will be in and addressed in this game. Long story short this is probably not going to be a game for little kids (but I\u0027m not going to tell you how to parent your children).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat platforms are you planning releasing on?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is kind of a two fold question a some people refer to platforms as distributors (Steam/Microsoft Store) and others are talking about the devices you can play the game on. To address the first one at this time I haven\u0027t made a decision as to what distributors I will be using as this will effect price and probably some multiplayer aspects of the final game but I will let you guys know as soon as a decision is made.\u003cbr\u003eAs for what devices I will be targeting with this game I currently only plan on Windows PCs at this time with no plans for Linux, MAC or any consoles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat game engine and tools are you using?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I would not look at this as a comprehensive list these are some of the tools being used.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnreal Engine 4 (game engine)\u003cbr\u003eBlender (3D modeling)\u003cbr\u003eManuel Bastioni Laboratory (human modeling Blender add on)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
