    "summary": "WHY WE ARE DOING THIS\u003cbr\u003eHi everybody!  Damo here, one-half of The Guitombres.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you and help you to understand the effects of your patronage on the world. \u00a0Let me share one experience I had that fuels me to create music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI played a gig at a small winery in North Texas.  Two folks were leaving Dallas on their way home to Oklahoma and just happened to exit the freeway and heard music.  They recognized one of their favorites and came inside to listen for a few minutes.  They ended up staying three hours.  After the show, this gentleman comes up and says that he and his wife used to go to concerts and enjoy live music out, but hadn\u2019t for the last few years because of health issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, they looked uplifted and this complete stranger told me with tears of joy he felt this night had been musical healing, for his soul.  I am so honored to have been a part of that evening in their life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOUR MISSION\u003cbr\u003eWe want people to hear and share our music freely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe wish all music could be free--so we will start with our own. \u00a0Your patronage makes it possible for us to bring that music to the world to enjoy anytime for free. \u00a0Maybe a complete stranger will have their soul healed by the music that you helped become a reality. \u00a0Thank you so much for making it possible for us to create for everybody.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOW WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH THIS\u003cbr\u003eThe music we produce on Patreon is either original or in the public domain, so you\u0027ll hear interesting takes on familiar classical, baroque, romantic, and folk pieces.  That\u0027s also why every recording we release on Patreon is Creative Commons licensed for non-commercial use. \u00a0We want people to take recordings of our music and incorporate it into meaningful times in their lives, so go ahead and play it at your wedding; play our music at memorial services for loved ones; play our music at dinners celebrating graduations. \u00a0Put our music in your video about your grandkids; put our music in your family reunion slideshow you post online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will make available audio and some simple video versions of our songs, with a new song on the first and middle of every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we gain patrons we will bring on more skilled production teams and eventually start licensing newer, copyrighted material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA LITTLE ABOUT US\u003cbr\u003eDamo and Ryan played their first gig together in El Paso, Texas in 1997 (under the name Border Lights. \u00a0We ditched it because it sounded too much like a cigarette brand to us.) \u00a0Since then, both bounced around other projects in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, practicing various arts until reuniting with music as The Guitombres in March of 2017. \u00a0Since then, we have performed twenty shows and composed several pieces for two upcoming documentary film soundtracks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe like taking familiar favorites and giving them an acoustic guitar twist, a process we call Guitombrifying. \u00a0Then we share it with the world. \u00a0We love it when people come up to us after hearing the music and letting us know how much they enjoy listening!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo find out more about The Guitombres, click our Facebook link or visit our website:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.damonallengaymusic.com/the-guitombres\"\u003ehttps://theguitombres.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
