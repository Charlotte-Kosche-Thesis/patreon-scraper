My aim here at patreon is to raise funds that will allow me to be increasingly independent \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e to complete various of the major projects I have planned or in-prep, not least of which is a major textbook provisionally titled \u003cstrong\u003eTHE VERTEBRATE FOSSIL RECORD\u003c/strong\u003e. More information on this book and other projects is included below. Patreon funds also help me put more time into preparing material for Tet Zoo, into the annual TetZooCon meeting, and into in-prep projects like \u003cem\u003eCryptozoologicon II,\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ethe planned expanded version of \u003cem\u003eAll Yesterdays\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and the big book on dinosaur life appearance I want to do. Those familiar with my work or writings will know that I work hard, and generally produce a lot of content -- that\u0027s great, but \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ewith your support from patreon I could do so much more\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e Please consider supporting me - even tiny amounts add up - and you\u0027ll be helping with the following...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTetrapod Zoology the blog.\u003c/strong\u003e There is essentially an infinite amount of stuff I\u0027d like to cover at Tet Zoo, but making time for it is not easy given other commitments (read: stuff I have to do to keep money coming in). If you appreciate or want to help the blog and keep it going, please consider chipping in. The independence of the blog from existing hosters is one conceivable aim of increased patreon support. I have some way to go before that\u0027s possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOpen Access technical research.\u003c/strong\u003e I am increasingly committed to publishing technical research in OA venues - this meaning that the research concerned is available, 100% free, to anyone with an internet connection. My commitment to OA is demonstrated by my publication record: in 2017 alone I\u0027ve published OA papers in \u003cem\u003ePeerJ\u003c/em\u003e (on azhdarchid pterosaurs) and \u003cem\u003eNature Scientific Reports \u003c/em\u003e(on theropod dinosaur facial anatomy, hence the \u003cem\u003eNeovenator\u003c/em\u003e image used below). I currently have a monograph on a theropod dinosaur (co-authored with Andrea Cau) submitted to an OA venue. \u003cstrong\u003eBut publishing in OA journals takes money.\u003c/strong\u003e You have to pay a subscription to the journal, or pony up page charges.... or both. The aforementioned monograph, for example, involves page charges of $600. \u003cem\u003eMoney received through patreon goes directly towards the assistance of my publications.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/blogs/assets/File/Neovenator-reconstruction-with-bones-2-D-Naish-600-px-tiny-June-2017-Darren-Naish-Tetrapod-Zoology.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCryptozoologicon II\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eAll Yesterdays\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e Readers of my stuff will be familiar with these two much-acclaimed book projects, produced in co-operation with colleagues John Conway and C. M. Kosemen. Follow-up volumes are planned and much material has been produced for them. However, progress has been substantially delayed due to existing commitments. Support me and I will be able to complete these projects and similar volumes much quicker. John, Memo and I would actually like to keep producing volumes of this sort, but it can only happen with support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTetZooCon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The Tetrapod Zoology Convention has now been going for three years, and each year\u0027s event is bigger and better than the last. Again, we struggle to make time for preparations and any and all help is appreciated. Support here at patreon allows me to put more time into the work associated with the event.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/blogs/assets/tetrapod-zoology/File/TetZooCon-2016-banner-600-px-tiny-Sept-2016-Darren-Naish-Tetrapod-Zoology.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Vertebrate Fossil Record.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0At the time of writing, this book - which includes enormous, extensively illustrated chapters on all vertebrate groups (yes, even ALL THE FISHES) - is well over 700 pages long. It will feature a ridiculous number of montages, cladograms and timelines of all vertebrates known from the fossil record. Below are the sorts of illustrations I\u0027ve been preparing... Support me here and you can see stuff as it comes together AND you can help me get it done all the quicker.\u003cimg src=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/files/2014/11/Triassic-marine-reptile-montage-600-px-tiny-Nov-2014-Darren-Naish-Tetrapod-Zoology.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/blogs/assets/tetrapod-zoology/Image/all-the-fish-Mar-2016-SMALLER-600-px-May-2016-Darren-Naish-Tetrapod-Zoology.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/files/2014/12/fish-montage-Sept-2014-600-px-tiny-Dec-2014-Darren-Naish-Tetrapod-Zoology.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDinosaurs In Life.\u003c/strong\u003e Once several of the projects mentioned above are out of the way, John Conway and I aim to produce a major volume on the science and art of dinosaur life appearance. This is some way down the line, but it will happen eventually \u003cem\u003ewith your support.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Tetrapod Zoology Books.\u003c/strong\u003e It is my aim to migrate all of the published online material featured at the blog to printed book form. Books are not dead and the internet is not everything, and having the Tet Zoo material published in hardcopy helps ensure a more permanent format (every now and again, someone presses a button and huge swathes of material at Tet Zoo ver 2 and ver 3 just disappears or becomes hopelessly mangled). So far, just ONE such book has been published (it\u0027s called Tetrapod Zoology Book One). The subsequent volumes will include a huge number of new illustrations and images, plus exciting covers that have yet to be produced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA little bit about Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou probably already know what Patreon is. It\u0027s basically an open-ended, Kickstarter-like project in which you make regular cash pledges of a chosen amount to your favoured content-creator. There\u0027s no obligation and you can quit at any time. Even small amounts can make a difference, so don\u0027t be shy about pledging tiny amounts. As a Tet Zoo patron, you\u0027ll get to see exclusive content before it appears anywhere else, so this is definitely something to be involved in if you\u0027re a fan. If this works out, I can \u003cem\u003eachieve\u003c/em\u003e more, produce \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e content, \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e share it with you. \u003cstrong\u003ePlease consider becoming a Tet Zoo patron by pledging to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/TetZoo!\"\u003ehttp://www.patreon.com/TetZoo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
