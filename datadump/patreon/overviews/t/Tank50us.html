However, I\u0027m also a bit of an amateur writer. You wouldn\u0027t believe the stories in this mind. :) Those coming here from my Deviant Art, or Fur Affinity page know what I\u0027m all about, and know what I\u0027m capable of. But if you\u0027re new here, of if you\u0027ve never seen my work, I fully intend to please you and guarantee that you will not be dissatisfied with my capabilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if you\u0027re wondering what my eventual goals are: I eventually want to go into game design, and produce some titles that fulfill Some of the many voids that I currently feel are in the market, but those will come in due time. I\u0027d like to tell you more about my plans for my games, but that will also have to wait, as I have yet to fully finalize my ideas that I hope we can all work on together as a team. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those that wish to assist, I appreciate your support greatly, so, sit back, and enjoy the upcoming work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
