Originally named as a goof when creating an iMovie trailer for a fun audio-dramedy made by Bridger and several voice-over buddies, NSIP is now an incorporated company with big plans, professional services and hands in everything they can reach! Alongside producing their flagship workplace audio-dramedy, \u0027Zoolaplex\u0027, its side-series of \u0027Zoolaverse Shorts\u0027 and a new semi-animated parallel series on their verified \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/NoStudioInParticular\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e, NSIP have provided voice-casting and production support for several indie video games, and is the secondary production studio to NOWWA\u0027s open-development shooter game, \u0027\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/NOWWACORP\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBulletVille\u003c/a\u003e\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn early 2017, NSIP halted all production of the second season of \u0027Zoolaplex\u0027 to fund, create and produce \u0027Hostile Work Environment\u0027, a full-length, semi-animated pilot based on the series, to be released on the 10th of February 2018. Soon before the release, they announced to bring the second season of the \u0027Zoolaplex\u0027 audio-dramedy (nominated for a total of 31 awards at the annual Audio Verse Awards since 2014), on the 1st of March, alongside new \u0027Zoolaverse Shorts\u0027 and regularly-released semi-animated adventures of shorter size and scale. They were also incorporated in 2017, leading to a newfound drive as a full-fledged production studio. This is their Patreon campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow operating on a monthly pledge campaign to accommodate the upsurge in new content being produced, NSIP promises to provide well-deserved rewards, goals and content to satisfy our patrons - both old and new - in order to create a better working studio. Our goal is to entertain and make entertaining work for us, and that\u0027s what this newly-redesigned Patreon campaign is going to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor as little as a dollar, your pledges can help us make \u0027Zoolaplex\u0027\u00a0 far better than it already is, with better writing, longer episodes, special guest stars, and more semi-animated adventures to accompany the audio. We can\u0027t promise the moon, but we can promise better than what we\u0027ve got already, and that\u0027s pretty damn good! Thanks for reading, and thanks for helping us make our show even more awesome!\u003cbr\u003e"
