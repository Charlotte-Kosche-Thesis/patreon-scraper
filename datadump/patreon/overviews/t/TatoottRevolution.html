I have faced detractors of\n all sorts, most of whom choose not to attack my arguments, but my \ncharacter (as if they know my character beyond what I have let them \nsee). \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/orl0YayaCFY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, haters are not and never have been my biggest \nenemies. Their obsession with me has only helped me to grow. Their every\n attempt to tear me down has only propelled me forward at greater \nmomentum.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy biggest adversary is YouTube itself, which has done \nas much as it can over the years to tame me, to tame my perspectives, to\n water me down, to make me as bland and uninteresting as most of the \nrest of their website.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTheir newest method of neutering my \nchannel (and the channels of anyone else who dares to have a real \nopinion) is to pull advertising from videos that they have deemed \ncontroversial. This is an obvious attempt to bully creators into towing \nthe YouTube line by denying them a living if they don\u0027t.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n once \nagain ask my fans to help support this content. I do not want to make \ncontent that pleases YouTube and its advertisers. I want to create \ncontent that truly reflects my thoughts and truly respects the \nintelligence of my audience.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope you will consider supporting my content so that we can begin a new decade of The Amazing \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/tatoott1009\"\u003eTat\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://tatoott1009.com/\"\u003eRevolution\u003c/a\u003e.\n I vow to you all that as long as I am a free and breathing man, I will \nfight the fights that I think need fighting. And you may not always \nagree with me, but you will always know that I speak only the truth as I\n see it. What more can any man really offer? What more does any man \nreally have?\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo... what it this \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/tatoott1009\"\u003eTat\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://tatoott1009.com/\"\u003eRevolution\u003c/a\u003e\nPatreon account for, you ask?  It\u0027s an emergency back up plan. As many \nof you now know, Google has changed its algos to filter out REAL NEWS \nsites like \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/tatoott1009\"\u003eTat\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://tatoott1009.com/\"\u003eRevolution\u003c/a\u003e\nfrom coming up in searches. As a result, our daily average traffic is \ndown nearly 35% since Google\u0027s announcement in November 2016.  And You \nTube ad revenues are down more than 90% since March 31st.  It\u0027s getting \ntougher and tougher in the current environment to do that, and I fear \nGoogle will only makes things more difficult. SO, if you value what we \nare doing and would like to give us a little \"boost\" just in case times \nget really tough, we\u0027d welcome a couple bucks per month from you, \npledging $10-50/year would be helpful if you value the information we \nprovide at \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/tatoott1009\"\u003eTat\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://tatoott1009.com/\"\u003eRevolution\u003c/a\u003e.com\n - That\u0027s it. We just want to keep doing what we\u0027re doing regardless of \nGoogle\u0027s strategy to strangle us. So, if you\u0027re still with me and you\u0027ve\n read this far, thank you. We wouldn\u0027t be here without YOU. God Bless. I\n thank you for watching. And I hope I can also thank you for becoming a \npatron. \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/tatoott1009\"\u003etat\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e"

The goal is to save lives by informing the public .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlready at this time, many thanks are due.  :)   For the past 9+ years, the whole operation has been financed and supported by viewer generosity.
