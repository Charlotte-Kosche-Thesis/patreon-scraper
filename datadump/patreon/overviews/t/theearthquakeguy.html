I\u0027ve been doing this for the last three years on Reddit with the goal of making Earthquakes and News as easy to understand as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this account after I went through the Canterbury Earthquake Sequence and had little to no information on what to expect next. Feeling that out of control was not a good feeling, so after a few years of learning what I could I created TEG.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I\u0027ve covered Earthquake events, Other Disasters, Military Events, Civil Unrest, Building Explosions and other World News Events. Recently I\u0027ve started to expand my scope and provide easy to read news summaries that aim to be as unbiased and honest as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always felt that no one should have to pay for what I do. Charging for this kind of information in my opinion isn\u0027t fair, which is why I\u0027ve turned to Patreon to allow those who would like to support what I do, to be able to do so freely. The more support you give, the more reporting I can do, the quality of which will increase.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the not so distance future I\u0027d love to get a news site up and running, as well as dive into Youtube to make easily digestible news roundups.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate all the support you guys have given and continue to give me on Reddit, Facebook and hopefully soon, Youtube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay Safe!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
