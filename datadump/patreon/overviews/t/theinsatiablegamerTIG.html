    "summary": "If you have been paying attention to the gaming industry recently, you might be aware that there is a real lack of quality when it comes to news and reviews. \u003ca href=\"http://theinsatiablegamer.com/\"\u003eThe Insatiable Gamer\u003c/a\u003e wants to change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is \u003ca href=\"http://theinsatiablegamer.com/\"\u003eThe Insatiable Gamer\u003c/a\u003e? We\u0027re a New Zealand based website currently owned by Michael Cox, Daven Parsons, and Clarke Scrimshaw who have enlisted a team of writers in order to create something special. In a sentence, TIG is a website dedicated to reviewing new videogames. We understand that being in the media, integrity is everything. We strive to create content that we find genuinely interesting and entertaining, and hopefully you will too. All of our writers have distinct personalities and styles, which they reflect upon and take into consideration whenever they write. Not only do we review games, we also have content dedicated to news events, opinion pieces, podcasts, Youtube, satire pieces, and with your help hopefully a whole lot more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why subscribe to us on Patreon? What separates us from other review sites is that our team has been doing this for free for a number of years. Our website is updated as much as possible with all the content we can pump out. That being said, with your donation, we could be doing a whole lot better. All of our content will remain free for anyone to view, but Patreon donators will see their money going towards things like website maintenance, recording equipment, gaming equipment, and feeding our starving writers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s in it for you if you donate? Apart from our sincere and unwavering gratitude, there are a number of different rewards. You\u0027ll be able to join our Discord and partake in community gaming events. We are also considering creating our own TIG store and who would be better to send free stuff to than our donators! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe understand that money is tight, and Patreon can be a risky business. If you do wish to support us but don\u0027t want to donate that\u0027s A-OK! Even just browsing our website, giving us some feedback and comments, and sharing it with your friends is greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a final send off, we as a team at TIG are incredibly passionate and driven about games. Many of us have sacrificed work, school, and family to keep it running, and we wouldn\u0027t have it any other way. If anything, we hope to make something that all of us, and hopefully all of you, can be really proud of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttp://theinsatiablegamer.com/ \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
