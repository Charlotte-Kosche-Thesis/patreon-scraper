    "summary": "The workshop is more than a blog. I personally wish for it to be a community where you discover your value, the beauty surrounding you, and the marrow of life we should all be sucking on every day of our lives with the people life brings our way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI call the things I write \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eparts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e because I believe no one person can say everything there is to say about something. We all carry a unique facet of opinion. If you would engage with me, you will think of things you may have never thought about, discover things about yourself you didn\u0027t think were possible and find life in something that you probably normally wouldn\u0027t have given time to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon and why the Subscription?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is the best format for creative to interact with their fans and it\u0027s also the easiest way for fans to pay for what they value. I believe that my writing is valuable. For each post I spend at least a few hours planning, outlining, writing, editing, editing the photo, rechecking again then finally posting, then I update all the social media so that hopefully you will spend 5 minutes reading it making your day a little better.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere is it all going?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will be going towards writing becoming my main source of income. It\u0027s one of my dreams to write books and influence the world through inspiring them to think and engage. I also am called to full time ministry as a youth pastor and this is not a high paying job. The average salary is around $20,000 and that\u0027s really only if there is a salary. Most youth pastors are volunteers and still spend 40+ hours a week on the kids. This honestly excites me and I know God will provide. While I am still working a full time job and building this, your money will mostly go towards saving, investing, and back into building The Workshop and making it the best it can be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it all work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you create your account you will become a patron choosing the reward tier you wish to. I have a full range of rewards from $1 per part to $10 per part. I promise to never charge for more than 3 posts a month so if you choose the $5 tier you will be charged $15 \u003cem\u003eat the end of the month\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you guys so much for believing and investing in me and my dreams. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA few things you should also know:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Every post will come to your email so you don\u0027t have to worry about going onto the website or losing track of the posts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 I get exuberant at the potential for interacting and processing with you, so if you have questions, thoughts, comments, or wanna share the part you have on a subject please comment or message me. I will reply. Some tiers even reward time with me. \u003cbr\u003e"
