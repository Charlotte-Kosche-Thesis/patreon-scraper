    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, I\u0027m Tobias, and I have stories to tell.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for coming to my Patreon page. I want to dedicate this space to the craft of stories. There are stories all around us, there is an infinite amount of stories that are happening at any time, and too many of those remain untold.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am just about to finish my very first novel, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBeyond the Mekong\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, which has been inspired to me by the people of the rural Cambodian village where I have been volunteering at for the past 10 months.\u003cbr\u003eThe people here are confronted to a different reality than what I have been used to before. They face different problems, have different dreams and aspirations, but remain mostly unheard.\u003cbr\u003eIn this novel I tell the story of a young teenager, Srey Li, who is eager to leave the village and go on an adventure. Not everything will go as planned and she will find herself facing problems that have shaped and are shaping Southeast Asia today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is only one of many stories. I have already several novel ideas in mind that I am looking forward to write in the near future. First, I want to publish the novel that is now nearly finished. The goal would be to donate some of the money to the NGO where I have been volunteering at in order to organise a school trip for the children (\u003ca href=\"http://www.obtchiro.com\"\u003ehttp://www.obtchiro.com\u003c/a\u003e). That is also the idea behind my next novels, which will deal with, and confront social issues in different societies. I hope to regularly donate to build and develop projects that help people in need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I believe that people are fundamentally good. Our societies however, are complex, big, and difficult to understand. They are pressing us down, making us feel like life is a daily fight. When you turn on the radio or TV, most of what you see are reports of bad news, another war, another conflict, another injustice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt doesn\u0027t have to be like this. There are plenty of great things happening around us. People helping their neighbours, the elderly, the homeless, immigrants, animals, the world. \u003cbr\u003eThese people are just like you and me. They get up in the morning, and dedicate their time and energy to others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think that stories have the power to inspire, they have the power to inspire more people to act this way. They have the power to make people reconsider prejudice, to develop respect, and to make people question themselves more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what I want to provoke through my stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am looking forward to use this space to share inspirational stories with you, to discuss what inspires me, what makes me think, what I think, and to talk, to exchange. I want this space to become a space where you and I can talk about people, about life, about issues and how there is always a silver lining somewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need your help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePut simply, I need to afford a living to have more time dedicated to the writing of stories. I realised this past year while writing my first novel, that it is very difficult to find the time and energy to write while working full time as a volunteer Guest House Manager for a Non-Governmental Organization.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI already have 2 set ideas of books that I would like to take the time to write, however to do so I need to afford to pay my bills and cover my living expenses.\u003cbr\u003eMy goal of $1000/month would allow me to do so. It would cover housing, food, transportation and a small security margin. With that goal achieved, I would be able to support myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining and talk to you soon,\u003cbr\u003eTobias"

     "about": "Hi, I\u0027m Tobi, and I have stories to tell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter graduating from university I went to Cambodia to volunteer in a rural community where the people have inspired me to write my first novel.\u003cbr\u003eThat novel is about to be finished and I am looking to publish it as soon as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt made me realise the necessity to write the stories of the people around ourselves. In the past few years I have been going through several countries, meeting countless of unheard stories and discovering new perspectives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to take the time to write stories that can make a difference, that can get people to think and get people to engage themselves into making our societies better.\u003cbr\u003eWhy?\u003cbr\u003eI believe that people are fundamentally good, and everyone has the potential to do good, but our societies have grown so big, diverse and complex that you and I are getting heavily influenced by that. This is not always necessarily in the right direction; the media are constantly portraying bad things that are happening around us, making us distrustful of each other, and not often showing us the good things people do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my stories, I want you to meet characters that are going through our difficult societies and facing adversity. I want you to read these stories and feel inspired to take action, to be more open to diversity, to develop respect for one another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI joined Patreon as a way for me to afford a living while having more time to give to the stories. In the near future, I am looking to move to Japan and learn the local language to bridge a cultural gap and get to understand their society better and tell the stories that are left untold..\u003cbr\u003eMy objective would be to make 1000$ monthly, which would allow me to cover housing and living expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContent wise, I am looking forward to share with you bits of the nearly finished novels, share my thought process on the characters and the social issues that transcend through my book. I would like to share with you what inspires me, what drives me and makes me write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little bit more about me. I have first studied Business Management at Toulouse Business School in southern France, which gave me the opportunity to study abroad in China in 2012 and get confronted to diversity. It also spurred my desire to learn more, to understand and to put myself in other people\u0027s shoes. I got the chance to go back to Asia, this time in Hong Kong in 2014 to work in a hotel and encounter another facet of Chinese culture. I finally studied some more Chinese in Xiamen before moving to Sweden for my MSc. in Asian Studies. During that master I specialised on Japan \u0026amp; Korea, as a way to diversify my understanding of East Asia from my previous experiences in China. During the master I also got to work in Greece for a few months and conduct some research in Tokyo before finally moving to Cambodia after graduation for a volunteering project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to learn more about this world, to learn languages as to get to better understand the people that speak it . And I hope to share this with you.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting my work and I look forward to meet you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eTobi",
