While I do have other sources of income, they are all just as unstable as the last, and it\u0027s just not enough at this point to continue. I love what I do here and there is just so much I\u0027m still yet to accomplish, and to have that taken away from a situation I have no control over feels too sad to honestly let go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nn_J14D5Pg8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in. Hopefully you\u0027ve seen at least some of the stuff I do to convince you to back me up. I always aim to get the most high quality content out for my viewers, and with your support I\u0027ll be able to go above and beyond that. This Patreon is NOT an obligation if you are a regular viewer of mine; if you don\u0027t have any money to spare then it is completely fine. But if you do have any spare change in your pocket, I have set up some rewards which I know at least some of you might enjoy and get the most out of. And this list will only increase with the more funding we get here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of how much money you decide to pay, every bit of support is incredibly appreciated and I promise to NOT let your generosity go to waste."
