To encourage communication around mental health and well-being for men, I am using my trading medium of barbering to speak about these issues with the intention of instigating further conversation in the community. By removing the fiscal aspect of trade and operating solely on the system of barter we are reinforcing our commitment to socio-economic equality in New Zealand.
