Contributing $4, $3, $2, or even $1 a month could help us reach our goals. If enough of our community pitches in, we would be able to add new shows, video, live shows and pay our deserving co-hosts for their time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2006 we have taken time each week to produce, high quality, entertaining and consistent content. We are five guys working together and sharing our passions with the world. Over the years we have received plenty of kind comments and encouraging words from our audience. Some of our listeners have even been kind enough to donate to our network. This is why we have put together an organized crowd funded campaign so we can continue to build our network. We will use the funds to: buy equipment, rent a standalone production facility, outsource audio/video editing and kick a few bucks to our hosts. If you are a fan of TPE Network, we hope you will join this movement."
