    "summary": "My name is Tom Taggart. I make things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack when I was a kid, Kellogg\u0027s had this contest every year where you send in drawings of your favorite Kellogg\u0027s character eating breakfast and selected entries would win prizes. I drew Toucan Sam and Tony the Tiger eating in a row boat surrounded by sharks and I won a 10 speed bike. I guess you can say that was the official beginning of my glorious art career. Since then, I have worked as an illustrator, doing 3-D covers for Marvel, DC Comics, Dark Horse, Topps and even LucasFilm Arts. My work has graced the covers of such titles as Batman, Swamp Thing, Doom Patrol and Animal Man just to name a few. I\u0027ve worked in the toy industry, fabricating prototypes for such companies as McFarlane Toys. I\u0027ve built mini-golf courses, worked on movie sets, painted murals, and now ... well, now I try as much as I can to just do my own thing, whatever that thing is at the moment. I live off my own work, much of which you can find in my ETSY shop.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/tomtaggart\"\u003ehttps://www.etsy.com/shop/tomtaggart\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eI guess I am hoping that with this PATREON page that I can have more time to work on pieces of art that matter to me, that come from my heart rather than just always chasing that buck, trying to pay bills. I\u0027d like to get back into illustration, but for my own books. I have a couple in the works, and as patrons, you will be the first to know all about them. I am still very new to all this and figuring things out, but as I go along, I hope to start adding videos and other special things that I feel you may all enjoy. I will post as much about my process, both physical and mental as I can. You will see projects from start to finish as well as pieces from my past to show you how I evolved into this thing I now am.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, hopefully, if you are still reading this, you are intrigued enough to at least pitch in a buck a month. I mean, everyone can afford a buck, right? Hopefully this venture will open doors to new and exciting opportunities and be a lot of fun for all of us. Thank you in advance for all your support, both financially and spiritually. I honestly could not do any of this without my fans. You are the ones who make all this crazy stuff possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANKS !!!!\u003c/strong\u003e"
