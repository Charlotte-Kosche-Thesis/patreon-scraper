    "summary": "I am TehSnakerer, film bloke screenwriter decidedly unprofessional in basically any field game person who makes analysis videos on Youtube, this series is called Playing, and I\u0027d say it\u0027s good but you could call me biased.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePLAYING\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePlaying is a part essay, part game analysis, part review, and part playthrough. I aim to be enjoyable, informative and a bit relaxing each video, taking my time and going through a game in good detail, story events, plot breakdown, introducing new gameplay mechanics and explaning if I think everything works or not. I try to take each game on its own merits and treat it as its own property. I ask myself what the game is going for and try to meet it halfway, whether or not that\u0027s for the best can be a bit point for or against it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eWatch_Dogs \u003c/em\u003efor example, I weighed up the awkward mix of stealth mechanics with weapons, hacking, and the story of a surveillance state, and questioned whether this blend of elements actually worked together, how the game wanted me to play with the story presented, and whether the intended gameplay itself worked?\u003cbr\u003eLater in \u003cem\u003eWatch_Dogs 2 \u003c/em\u003ewith its more comedic plot, and pushing player expression through equal viability of stealth, trickster, and lethal playstyles, I tested if these playstyles were equally viable, and (spoiler) found that stealth had been made overpowered, whereas combat had essentially no benefits. Gameplay wise, it wasn\u0027t exactly as promised, but with the context behind it it made a lot of sense, and made the theme the story was going for a lot more interesting. However the plot itself was a massively wanky, self congratulatory and at times hypocritical mess.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/902iD9TyjLg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eARE YOU JUST PLAYING BLOODY WATCH_DOGS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot at all, I play whatever game takes my fancy, a part of my video series is to give these analytical style videos not just to big games everyone has done to death, everyone and their mother has talked about Dark Souls, where\u0027s the love for smaller or oft forgotten games like \u003cem\u003eSeum, Gotcha Force, Boiling Point?\u003c/em\u003e I\u0027ll only do a video on a game everyone has done if I feel I have something new, or can at the least make it worth everyones while that I say something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSeum\u003c/em\u003e was a precise, fast paced first person platformer with kickass music about speedrunning, so I focused on how well it captures those elements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eGotcha Force \u003c/em\u003eis a sentai 3D brawler about building an army of little robots powered by belief in them and fighting off alien invaders, so the video is about different unit viability, building a team, and combat mechanics\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBoiling Point \u003c/em\u003eis a strange cheap FPS RPG with a weird dad main character and faction politics in a fictional south American country, so it\u0027s about how well the game captured being a mercenary, and is a sort of bizarre travellogue (and one of my favourite episodes)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KoEuQQlGZSQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSUPPORTING PLAYING (THANKS AND AFTERTHOUGHTS)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027d be nice, I have a long list of goals and rewards to go with them, I\u0027m a sound recordist/boom operator on indie films so I have a fair bit of downtime, It\u0027s impractical to think I could go full time on this (still wanna work on my own film projects that I pen) but it\u0027d give me some stability and let me focus more energy on them, peace of mind helps with those things and I like to provide for those who help me out. Alongside thanks you get access to my scripts and notes, and for $5 and up you get access to Afterthought videos where I run off incomplete thoughts about the game that didn\u0027t fit in the proper script, answer viewer questions and test gameplay mechanics or generally things requested by people in this bracket, here is a freebie along with the episode it was made for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_rFTtalMhM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LtSz2wGXdM\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAND THANK YOU TO ANYONE READING, AND TO ANYONE WHO PLEDGES\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am to make my videos enjoyable, I make the content I enjoy watching, I\u0027ve always like talking about games every since I was a wee one, and Youtube gave me the perfect outlet, the fact I can share that with others is a great thing to me, every dollar helps in this endeavour, and even just watching and spreading the videos is greatly appreciated by me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
