Their mythology is based on the Sun, whom they revere as their Father. The Sun\u0027s brilliant rays are said to be the reason for the male\u0027s manes. Prides are typically headed by one or a small number of males, who father all of the pride\u0027s cubs. Young males are ousted from their pride upon adulthood, and if they survive to grow strong enough, will go on to challenge for leadership of established prides. Upon successful takeover of a pride, all cubs sired by the previous patriarch are killed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe main characters from the lion\u0027s side are \u003cem\u003eIphiko\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eIlanga\u003c/em\u003e, a pair of lionesses who grew up under this Spartan-like culture. Ilanga was endowed with great strength by birth \u2013 both in physicality and temperament \u2013 while the gentle and meek Iphiko was shunned by her peers.

Their mythology is based on the Moon, whom they revere as their Mother. They are neither patriarchal nor matriarchal \u2013 for although the males are larger and stronger than the female, the strongest social bond between two leopards is between that of a mother and her cub. For this reason, the mother figure is held in reverence by the leopards.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHawa, arguably the \"protagonist\" of the story, is a leopard who was raised as such. His mother never taught him hatred, but unfortunately, he was born into a world that would not allow him to retain his innocence. Through tragedies that befell him, he would be driven to the brink of madness, and formulate an elaborate plot to exact revenge on those who wronged him. Ruya, mother of Hawa\u0027s cubs, chose to confront her grief differently, which would lead her down a diverging path...\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHYENAS:\u003c/strong\u003e Hyenas are a strongly communal species with a matriarchal hierarchy.

As a\nchild, I was fortunate to be raised with a strong scientific education, and\nheld a burning curiosity to understand the natural world. I was particularly\nfascinated with animals, and stories of animals (both fiction and non-fiction);\nyet a part of me \u2013 the part that had read all the books and watched all the\ndocumentaries I could get my hands on \u2013 regarded animals with an almost cold\nobjectivity. Their behaviors, as presented in such materials, were often\ngeneralized, and my young self \u2013 in my naivet\u00e9 \u2013 was simply was not wise enough to realize the depth of individuality\nthat could exist within other species.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is why those two aforementioned\ndocumentaries had such a profound impact on me. For the first time, I witnessed\nhow stunningly \"human\" animals can be \u2013 the same joy and innocence of\na child, the same love of a mother, the same sorrow for loss, and even the same\nstruggles with morality. Thus the first iterations of \n\u003cem\u003eThe Leopard Sun\u003c/em\u003e\nfocused primarily on ethology. Like a child eager to share his newfound\ndiscovery with the world, I wanted to show people that animals are not how we\ncommonly perceive them to be; that, like us, they think, feel, and make\nchoices, and that in itself is beautiful. It was my humble hope then, that\nthrough this beauty, I could get people to care for the natural world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, as I grew\nolder and became wiser to the world, the message of the story \u2013 though dear to\nme still \u2013 became insufficient. Could the human attitude toward animals and the\nnatural world change on a global scale, simply because they were shown to its\nbeauty and individuality? Or is it always the select few who were already\npredispositioned to care, who gets touched by the story? History has shown,\ntime and again, that the majority are only driven to action when confronted\nwith something that is relevant and applicable to them. But how could a fictional tale about African\nanimals be relevant to most?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe missing piece\nof the puzzle came in the form of a person. Her name\u00a0is Anastasia Korochanskaya (AKA\u00a0\n\u003cem\u003eElbereth\u003c/em\u003e). I came upon her\nart by pure chance in 2005, and immediately fell in love with the surreal\nbeauty and spirituality of her work. I approached her about the prospect of\nhaving her assist me in illustrating \n\u003cem\u003eThe Leopard Sun\u003c/em\u003e, to which she\nreplied that the story had touched her deeply. That was how our friendship\nbegan, and eventually we grew to be partners in all things.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the many\nyears, we constantly influenced one another, shaped one another, and grew with\none another. It was through \n\u003cem\u003eElbereth\u003c/em\u003e that I discovered the works of the\ngreat astronomer Carl Sagan, whose poetic view of the universe\u0027s grandeur and\nunwavering belief in the principles of science became a main source of\ninspiration \u2013 both for our daily lives and for the story we worked together\ntoward.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe Leopard Sun\u003c/em\u003e of today is very different from the story\nit once was, both in message and scope. Through its many deaths and rebirths,\nit has become a story not about animals and the natural world, but about\nourselves. It asks some big questions relevant to a time in which increasing\nglobalization is being met with strong resistance by people clinging to ethnic,\nreligious, and cultural identities. It also asks some big questions relevant to\nus since the beginning of our time: the meaning of love, of life, and of\nexistence.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYet, in spite of\nthe many changes brought about by the iterations, \n\u003cem\u003eThe Leopard Sun\u003c/em\u003e\nremained the same in spirit. At its core, it is that story that grew up with\nme, became a part of me, brought the love of my life to me, and in turn, became\na part of her.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd I hope, by the\ntime you finish reading this page, you will be moved to let \n\u003cem\u003eThe Leopard Sun\u003c/em\u003e\nimpart its mark upon your life as well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tA Message from Elbereth\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI met \n\u003cem\u003eL\u00f3rien \u003c/em\u003eon DeviantArt in 2005 by way of a humble\nnote he had written me after coming across my art.

I reached\nback out to him without hesitation and in time we found in each other a lasting friendship that\nwould eventually lead us to share all things in life. I am humbled now to say that this story is something I consider as much\nmine as it was once his alone. The many elements of it grew with our years of\ncompanionship, just as it once grew with him during his youthful days before I\ncame into his life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThus\u00a0\n\u003cem\u003eThe Leopard Sun\u003c/em\u003e truly is a living story. It matured and expanded\norganically as we did. It absorbed new knowledge and wisdom as we gained them.\nAnd now, we feel the time is ripe for it to finally be told to the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are those who might rightfully inquire about the story\nI once promised to tell on my own, \n\u003cem\u003eSavuti\u003c/em\u003e. What has become of her? The short\nof the long of it,\n\u003cem\u003eThe Leopard Sun\u003c/em\u003e was always a priority, although it\nwent unannounced. It was the search for\u00a0\n\u003cem\u003eThe Leopard Sun\u003c/em\u003e, by which I found\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSavuti\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eAnd\nin those early uncoverings, \n\u003cem\u003eSavuti\u003c/em\u003e too came to share a special part of my heart\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\nBut without\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Leopard Sun\u003c/em\u003e, it is a story I do not believe I would have even found. I\nfeel because of this, I owe it to\u00a0\n\u003cem\u003eThe Leopard Sun\u003c/em\u003e to first help lead its way to\ncompletion. I believe\u00a0\n\u003cem\u003eSavuti\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eis a story that awaits to embrace me, that will\nonly be enriched by the work we put into completing\u00a0\n\u003cem\u003eThe Leopard Sun\u003c/em\u003e. And so, for the moment \u003cem\u003eThe Leopard Sun\u003c/em\u003e has my undivided\ndevotion.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s20.postimg.cc/9d7zqj0nx/leopardsun_patreon_home5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tOUR THANKS\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nStories are meant to be read, otherwise they have no need to be told.
