We are Kelsey Kay Love and Peter Rimkus, and we started a travel blog -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://travelinfools.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTravelin\u0027 Fools\u003c/a\u003e -\u00a0back in 2013 after our first combined move from Texas to Costa Rica.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur motto is \u003cstrong\u003etravel randomly, move frequently\u003c/strong\u003e, and we\u00a0believe you can live anywhere you want with little planning and even less money. After more than 5 years of living the slow travel lifestyle - meaning we \u003cem\u003emove\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0places, not just travel there - we have plenty of valuable tips, advice and funky anecdotes to make sure you land on your feet for your very first (or next) move.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter living in places like Costa Rica, Maui, Bali, Australia, New Zealand, Sumatra and Thailand for time periods spanning anywhere from 4 months to 2 years, we break down the costs, visa challenges and more to show you it\u0027s not impossible, or perhaps even as difficult as you may have thought, to do the same on a limited budget. We are, of course, assuming you have a decent sense of humor, somewhat flexible standards and the fortitude to carry on when you inevitably end up vomiting in a dark alleyway in Indonesia. Goddamn chicken pizza...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnyway, here\u0027s where you come in.\u003c/strong\u003e Since we do not see an end in sight to this lifestyle and our goal is to retire as soon as humanly possible (we kid... kind of), we\u0027d love for you to support our efforts to create even more detailed, amusing, helpful, inspiring, and totally ad-free travel content. We\u0027re currently working towards...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#1 Producing More of our Own Unique Content.\u003c/strong\u003e This includes travel videos, our own set of Travelin\u0027 Fools postcards, a photo book, and more fun nonsense we haven\u0027t even thought of yet. However, since we\u0027re both still working for other humans to fund our slow traveling way of life, finding the time and funds to create our own stellar content is continually a challenge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#2 Creating A Travel Writing \u0026amp; Photography Course.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWe get several messages a month from people asking how we\u0027re able to do what we do. And while there are plenty of travel bloggers out there telling you to quit your job and buy a one way ticket, we realize that isn\u0027t possible for the majority of humans, including us. We\u0027re currently working to put together a travel writing and photography course, located in one of our previous living destinations, where we teach you how to create a website, write about travel, photograph and edit content, and market yourselves (and skills) along the journey, all while traveling in a kickass location.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#3 Making Travelin\u0027 Fools a Full Time Job. \u003c/strong\u003eIn an effort to avoid writing crappy \"fluff\" content for companies and putting those annoying clickbait ads in between each paragraph, we have purposefully chosen not to take on any advertisers for the site. Unfortunately this also means we make zero dollars, and even worse, actually lose money by paying for hosting, site maintenance, and all the rest that\u0027s involved in having a fully-functioning website. I would friggin\u0027 love to make Travelin\u0027 Fools my full time gig, but until money starts growing on frozen pizzas, we\u0027re kindly asking for a little assistance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are so thankful for each and every reader, and hope to continue putting smiles on your faces and inspiring you to hit the road to find the weirdness in the world. Life\u0027s too short to live somewhere that sucks. High fives to all of you, and we look forward to running into you on our adventures!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003eKelsey \u0026amp; Peter\u003cbr\u003e"

Snail mail is back, y\u0027all. We\u0027ll also be starting a travel video series (what what!), because I guess that\u0027s a thing people who don\u0027t have the patience to write a real book do now.\u003c/div\u003e",

Hopefully not better, but we\u0027ll take what we can give. ;) Anyway, we need funding for marketing this idea, as soon-to-be traveling writing and photogs do not often hang out on the same beaches in Thailand as we do, sadly enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
