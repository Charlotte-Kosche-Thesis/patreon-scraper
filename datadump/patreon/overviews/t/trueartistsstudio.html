    "summary": "I am a film school grad with a background in television production, world news and small production house experience. I have run my own production company since 2011 out of Cincinnati and my niche is documentary filmmaking with a minimalisitc style and a touch of cinematic flare. I have released four documentary films that have been official selections and won some awards in the film festival circuit. They are currently distributed through VOD platforms such as Amazon, Vimeo and Comcast. I also do commissioned films for non profits, small businesses and weddings. I am married to a hot momma with three awesome kiddos and live in West Chester, OH. I am blessed enough to have produced all of my documentaries solely out-of-pocket but as a progressive filmmaker I am now using this platform to help fund my documentary projects. \u00a0"

     "description": "Finishing my hardest documentary to date, \u003cem\u003eYear 33\u003c/em\u003e. It\u0027s a bio pic of sorts. In my line of work as a filmmaker, I meet so many different types of people. Small business owners, non profits, start ups, people getting married, I service all these types of people with storytelling through video. Each and every one of them are important. In fact, my mantra is \"You are important and your story is important\" but having a friend tell me that I needed to point that mantra at myself and tell my story... well, that freaked me out a bit. Let\u0027s face it, it\u0027s hard to look inward and say, \"I am interesting enough of a person to make a movie about myself\", no, no I am not that interesting. However, I have been given a story and it\u0027s actually a really, really good one. The film follows my life during my 33rd year on this earth which was between 2014 and 2015. Post production is our next phase but due to so many other obligations and zero dollars coming in to fund this project, I have put it on hold. Well, the time is now to attempted to raise enough to have post production completed as well as get the film sent off to film festivals and potentially, screenings for non profits as well.",
