    "summary": "Hello and thank you for stopping by. \u00a0My name is Donnie Boyd and I am a local missionary who helps operate a ministry called The Prayer Collective. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Prayer Collective is a network of believers who are united in Jesus Christ and are committed to praying for and providing help to those in need in our community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe use street photography and social media to connect people from all backgrounds to a live worldwide network of praying believers as well as the local church. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy posting portraits, stories, and prayer requests of people we meet to the collective\u0027s Facebook and Instagram page, everyone can see the person they are praying for, hear their story, and pray specifically for the requests that are made. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis connection let\u0027s the people, especially those outside the church, witness the love and grace of the christian body as they see the prayers and words of encouragement in the comments section below the portrait.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour participation in this area is crucial!! Please pray, like, and leave a comment of encouragement. Even a simple \"Amen\" will work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce this online connection is established people from the collective can reach out to the person individually to offer continued encouragement and support through further one on one interaction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine if we receive a request for a loved one with cancer and you have been through that same battle, your words will resonate and your ability to relate on a personal level will have a profound effect. Or if we come across a homeless person in our area and can help with a gift certificate for a hot meal or even pay a place to stay on a cold night, these acts of kindness and care are why we are here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal with this is simple. \u00a0Plant seeds of faith, share the gospel with the lost, \u00a0pray for everyone, and provide for the needy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunding raised by the collective goes toward supporting the ministry and meeting the needs of people we meet. Please prayerfully consider supporting our ministry by hitting the sign up button and becoming a part of The Prayer Collective. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod bless you!\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eDonnie Boyd\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us \u00a0 \u00a0through the prayers of many. 2 Corinthians 2:11\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us,written not with ink but with the spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tables of human hearts. 2 Corinthians 3: 3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* For God, who said, \"Let light shine our of the darkness,\" has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 2 Corinthians 4:6\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
