I\u0027m a teacher, author, blogger, and now officially also an educator on YouTube. I have a lot of goals for my channel. I want to eventually have teachings that go through every book of the Bible, systematic theology courses, biblical theology courses, teachings through the end times and eschatology, studies on various subjects in apologetics, and eventually a biweekly or daily show that focuses around some of the more controversial subjects, difficult questions, or just questions that many are asking without receiving answers (like why the Old Testament is important).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to formally (or officially) charge anyone for this material, because if it be the word of God then it should be free. I want this to be accessible and easy for anyone and everyone. So, for those of you who desire to support me, it is entirely voluntary, which is why I thank you so kindly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your consideration and support.

My wife and I have a thing we call \"Ravens Creek\", which involves a music and art studio as well as theological studies. This is a part of the theological studies, but feel free to peruse the music by searching for Ravens Creek Studio. The name comes from 1 Kings 17, that Elijah was told to hide at a brook and was fed by ravens. It is true for us as well, that we seem to be in the middle of obscurity, barely known by anyone, and yet our needs being met by the most unlikely circumstances. Please take the time to look through my content, and see if there is anything that you find worthy of supporting.",
