I\u0027m a mad nonbinary witch and writer who is using tarot, astrology, and reflection magic to heal the individual and the collective. The spells I cast are the stories I weave through introspection, connection to ancestors and intuition.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, the bulk of my energy goes into my person-to-person services. I love this work indeed. But my dream for The Firebrand Witch is to offer services that are both intimately crafted and accessible to the collective.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do this, I am asking for your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream for The Firebrand Witch is to offer paid astrological offerings every season of the year, freely accessible monthly horoscopes, and community-based courses in healing, reclaiming narrative and remembering our personal magic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd to do the magical work of reclaiming and sharing my stories, my struggles, and my triumphs so that I may inspire others to speak their own truths and weave their own narratives. In 2018, I hope to begin writing a memoir about my experience with depersonalization disorder. This will include reflections on spirituality, magic, and an unspelling of past traumas. This is deeply vulnerable and tender work, but I\u0027m \u003cem\u003efinally \u003c/em\u003efeeling ready to do it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any of these projects are ones that you would like to support, or if you would like to support my free weekly tarot forecasts, I invite you to become a Patron. This will allow us to work one-on-one while also supporting me in my goal of extending my services to be available on a community-level.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will support (in order of dispersal):\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOnline maintenance of The Firebrand Witch: \u003c/strong\u003eThis includes web hosting, email service, podcast hosting service, and other services as needed.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTime spent creating new offerings: \u003c/strong\u003eI am currently making a podcast (see above) and creating a collective offering that I hope to launch by July.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiving + moving costs: \u003c/strong\u003eFor now this includes my rent, groceries, and food for my wee cat Frankincense.
