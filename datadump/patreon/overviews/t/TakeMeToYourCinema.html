Yet when it comes to film, it seems that the topics always come from a very limited catalogue.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo as inspiring as the work of Kubrick is, and as popular as \u003cem\u003ePulp Fiction\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is, wouldn\u0027t it be great if the goalposts were widened a bit, so that it\u0027s not always the same 8 or 10 films under discussion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo What Is \u003cem\u003eMy\u003c/em\u003e Cinema Specifically?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAlready in its second century, the art form of film has already built up a rich heritage. And as we move forward, I want to make sure that great works don\u0027t fall into obscurity as audiences eat up and spit out every new release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, my primary interest is in exploring the ways in information is conveyed. Taking a primarily filmmaking based approach, I explore how the medium of film is used to tell stories, and discuss how approaches to visual storytelling has changed throughout the years. This video discussing the influence of German director Max Oph\u00fcls (\u003cem\u003eLetter From An Unknown Woman\u003c/em\u003e; \u003cem\u003eThe Earrings of Madame de\u2026\u003c/em\u003e)\u00a0on the long-takes of \u003cem\u003eBirdman\u003c/em\u003e is my approach in a nutshell:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z6SQgmC9CMo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWho\u003c/em\u003e Am I?\u00a0Who \u003cem\u003eAm\u003c/em\u003e I?

I\u0027m currently doing a post-graduate research thesis. I see these videos as way for me to take my mind off my academic work, whilst allowing me to continually hone the skills needed to excel in that area. Basically, I\u0027m writing essays for fun. \u003cbr\u003eAnd I get to watch, research and discuss my first true love: cinema.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
