    "summary": "More than 2 years ago, I started learning about quadcopters, and I shared what I was learning on a YouTube channel. Today, I\u0027ve made over 1100 videos and over 58,000 people subscribe to my channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst-Person-View (FPV) flight is an experience like nothing else. All the excitement and fun of flying. None of the risk of personal injury. And a lot cheaper too. But it\u0027s got a huge learning curve. There are so many skills you have to know in order to even get your foot in the door.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where I come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI teach people how to build, tune, troubleshoot, and fly FPV multirotors. Racing drones. Mini quads. Whatever you want to call it. Everything from how to solder, to how to tune, to how to do tricks and get faster lap times. I also do product reviews that help you spend your money on the gear that is going to work best for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January, 2018, I made the decision to quit my day job and work on the YouTube channel full time. It\u0027s easy to imagine that all YouTubers are just making videos in their spare time, for fun, but that hasn\u0027t been true for me for a long time. I\u0027ve been putting in easily 20-30 hours a week on my channel for the last year, in addition to my full time job. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I don\u0027t have that job, I look forward to putting in 60-70 hours a week! I LOVE WORKING ON THIS CHANNEL. But in order for me to do that, I need your support. And by \"support\", I mean money. Because YouTube views don\u0027t pay the rent. And I would rather get paid by my viewers directly than have to add more commercials and other stuff like that to my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are a regular viewer of my channel, please consider subscribing at any level that you feel matches up with the value you get out of the channel. If I saved you a few hours of hassle trying to look up an answer on the internet... if I helped you buy a cheaper product that is just as good as a more expensive one... maybe I answered some questions for you one-on-one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease subscribe at the level that matches the value you feel that you get from my content."
