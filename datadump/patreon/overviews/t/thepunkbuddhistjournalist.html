    "summary": "Day to day, moment to moment, I am continually inspired by those around me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Stewart Campbell. I am the Punk Buddhist Journalist and I wish to have an open conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I am creating is a unique short audio documentary for each and any individual who would like to have one made. An art audio podcast of sorts that tells the story of, and gives a voice to, the people we pass by everyday. A project that anyone can be a part of that will hopefully further encourage and inspire others to have these conversations in their everyday life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that by sharing our stories and allowing  people to hear others in a way they may not have heard before, we begin to realise how much we have in common. Be it man, or woman, of any age or religion, we all share the experience of being alive, of being human. By sharing our stories, by sharing what we\u0027ve learned, and by hearing each other, I believe we begin to make a better world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe real celebrities of the world are all around us. The people we meet and see every day that we may just be lacking the courage to speak to. I\u0027ve created over 60 pieces for over 60  wonderfully unique individuals who\u0027s stories and views of life are a continual inspiration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not a Buddhist, I\u0027m not a punk, I\u0027m not a journalist, but I try to take a piece of each with me in my day to day life. To believe in a bit of  Rock and Roll, Love and Peace and taking the time to ask people who and how they are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u2019t make anything doing this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made a Kickstarter and used the video above for it. Initially the idea was to raise \u00a312,000 in order to create 365 pieces, one for every day of the year. I saw it as \u00a31000 a month for a year, \u00a3700 to pay my way and then \u00a3300 to spend on traveling to meet people and buying them a coffee, lunch in whatever environment they feel most comfortable in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, this is not something I\u0027m set on and honestly I\u0027d like to do more than 365. Ideally I\u0027d like to do this for the rest of my life but at the very least I\u0027d like to do it for a year to speak to 365 people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt started off as just  interviews, then they became art interviews with a mix of music and sound, then they became more like art conversations. The project continues to  grow and expand with no two pieces the same  (much like people themselves) with each individual offering and contributing something that allows the project to naturally evolve. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the interviews we meet in a place of the person\u0027s choosing. If at any point the person would like to stop that\u0027s fine. If I ask any question the person would prefer not to answer, it\u0027s no problem, and the question is edited out. If afterward the person did not enjoy it, we delete the piece immediately. If they are happy I take home, listen to, and edit the piece in one go; hearing the journey of the conversation out and allowing the personality of the individual to shine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI then create music to finish it and upload the file on Soundcloud privately, this just means only they are able to hear it. If they dislike it we delete it immediately, if they would like a few changes we change them, and if we\u0027re both happy we make it live and share the piece. Even after a piece is live the person can change their mind and the piece can be taken down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny contribution helps so much. I believe in people. I believe in this project. Already so many talented and caring people have helped me make this possible, artists, musicians, family and friends. So I thank you all for helping and taking the time to read this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMay we long continue to inspire one another\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eall pieces available to listen at the links bellow\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n      \n    \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-182094551\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/user-182094551\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/thepunkbuddhistjournalist/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
