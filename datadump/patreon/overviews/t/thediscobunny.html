    "summary": "It was always my dream to harness the positive energies of my mind, body and soul, my skills, qualifications, and passion in a humanitarian form to help others in the form of giving, and in doing so help myself for giving is receiving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January 2016, out of inspiration and desperation, I made a conscious decision that I needed to learn to live more in the present, develop a greater sense of gratitude for the numerous and almost uncountable fortunes in my life, in essence to let go of blame, to live a little more, to open my eyes to the wonders of life itself and unique beauties of others from which I could learn and ultimately begin to fulfil my potential, to direct my own destiny, to take control of my life and to make \u0027manana\u0027 today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was never my idea to just dance on the streets, to become a street dancer, no, not at all. Though I had skills and qualifications, I just wanted to do star jumps; to do something simple with a broad smile upon my face, and with passion, to awaken the hearts, souls, and minds of all others to their own existence, conscious behaviour and choices. To ignite the fire of passion within me... within them... within you; the positive ripple effect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s when I called myself The Disco Bunny.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to today, some eighteen and more months later, having amassed a billion plus views on the internet, with many having the same reaction as those I meet on the streets \"you just made my day\" and I find myself in exactly the same financial state; living day to day, struggling to pay for food, put credit on my phone and pay for a humble roof over my head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Why?\" I ask myself.\u003cbr\u003eI am not sure. I think I am afraid to ask for help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt confusing for people to first grasp what it is I do as The Disco Bunny yet beyond confusion, dumbfounded I am asked:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"How do you make a living out of this?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy my understanding of this question, it relates to how it is that I am alive, that I survive. Well I tell you, I don\u0027t dwell on my own problems, I smile. I have never given a false smile because I am The Disco Bunny.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut when I am not The Disco Bunny, my struggle is real, my worries, my concern, my fears, my self-doubt, my inability to reflect on what it is that I am doing or achieving with any sense of pride is real because, to put it simply, I am struggling financially sometimes even more than day to day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe lack of cash flow is my only struggle, my greatest struggle, the biggest hindering factor that\u0027s preventing me from progressing, from evolving, from sharing and realising The Disco Bunny Project, from fulfilling my potential; from making this simple, beautiful dream a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I have set up a Patreon account.\u00a0That\u0027s why I ask for your help, for your involvement, for your participation in this way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to take The Disco Bunny to remote places.\u003cbr\u003eI want to use my skills and qualifications, to harness my time and energy to greater effect.\u003cbr\u003eI want to make positive social change, to educate and entertain.\u003cbr\u003eI want to take The Disco Bunny around the world, to all the continents, to many countries.\u003cbr\u003eI want to go on adventures and take you with me.\u003cbr\u003eI want to introduce you to the many people I meet along the way.\u003cbr\u003eI want you to join me, to feel free to come and spend some days wherever I am on The Disco Bunny World Tour in person, and be with me every step of the way as we evolve and grow and make this dream a reality:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Disco Bunny Project."
