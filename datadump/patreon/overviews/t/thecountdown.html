Thanks for giving two massive film buffs and best friends a shot. Thanks for becoming a fan! (Because why else would you even consider visiting here?) And thanks for coming as far as checking out our Patreon page. It means the world to us that you would even think about donating some of your hard earned cash to not only keep the show going, but also growing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause that\u0027s exactly what we\u0027re aiming for here. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe\u0027re going to keep creating the same weekly show for everyone to enjoy.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e But we want to improve the sound quality with better equipment, and as our back catalogue grows, we want to be able to keep all our episodes available to new listeners that come to the show. That means more server space. We also want to record more content and reach more and more sets of ears. And in this day and age all of that comes with a financial cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO\u003c/strong\u003e .. we\u0027re offering a number of incentives to say thank you for your contribution. The tiers are a work in progress, so please bear with us while we sort through the intricacies of Patreon. That said, we\u0027re very open to hearing \u003cstrong\u003eYOUR\u003c/strong\u003e ideas about what you\u0027d like see here which you think others might also like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill the show end if you opt not to become a patron? Ahh, no. We love doing it too much for that to be something we\u0027d ever threaten. So this is not about guilting or begging you as you click through the page. We\u0027re not those kind of guys. (Well, Wayne might be; Paul is a stand up bloke ... who may or may not be responsible for writing what you\u0027re reading now.) Instead, this is about seeing what kind of an \"empire\" (with a very small \u0027e\u0027) we can build and how much better the show might become.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you do choose to become a patron, know you have the undying gratitude of two Aussie mates who no-one thought would make it to Episode 10 with their movie podcast, let alone be able to invest back into the show with the help of some seriously cool folks. Help us show those naysayers. *shakes fist at said nasysayers* :P\u003cbr\u003e"
