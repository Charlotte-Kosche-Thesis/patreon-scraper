I create images that express the essence of people, places, and ideas. At the heart of this expression is connection. I strive to\u00a0develop honest and deep connections with my subjects, whether human or nonhuman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to explore. And think. And create. And engage.

The mission of ETL is \"to create a strong network of individuals who use photography as a means to engage one another and the world with compassion and creativity.\" The series began in 2014 as in-person workshops with military veterans in the Lubbock, Texas area. For my patreon supporters at this level, I have created an exclusive online-only version of this contemplative photography series that will guide you in my approach to photography as a daily mindfulness practice. Though we will discuss some technical aspects of photography, this is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e primarily a technical class. This class is primarily about learning how to see. You\u0027ll receive a link to a private online group where you will be able to share 10 images each month based on assignments I provide.
