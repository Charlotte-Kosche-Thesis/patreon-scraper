I love to create art and this Patreon is my path to hopefully creating full-time. Here you will find everything I create from sketches, Works In Progress, comics, speed paints, art experiments, wallpaper, and more. I mostly work in fan art, but I also post my own original content as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy usual Fandoms include MLP, Pokemon, Steven Universe, Harry Potter, and Undertale. However, I\u0027m not limited to just these fandoms and will tackle other fandoms at the request for patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e By becoming a patron you get an inside look and exclusive access to my art and process. I draw daily so Patrons can expect to receive up to 20 new images month, not including wallpapers, speed paints, and all other creations. Support even at the lowest tier will help me to keep drawing and eventually reach my goal of drawing full-time and meeting my living needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e As my supporters don\u0027t hesitate to message me with content request and images you\u0027d like to see finished or continued.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Who Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 As you know I go by Taylor Made, you can simply call me Taylor. I\u0027m a 24-year-old\u00a0female artist hoping to spread my art to all and establish myself as an artist for a living. My sole source of income comes from my artwork through commissions and Patreon. So if you enjoy my art and it brings you some joy, please support through my Patreon to help me keep doing what I love and providing you with art you enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Where Does Your Support Go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll proceeds generated go towards helping to take care of my living expenses and assisting my family. As my goals are reached I will be able to invest in getting better equipment and software to create more and better content for my fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
