    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to The Kwerks\u0027 Patreon page! We\u0027re a married duo from Vancouver, BC, Canada, who decided to scrap life in the \u0027burbs for a life where we live out our dreams. Our dreams include a whole lot of music and fun, so that\u0027s what we make, and we are so excited to have you join us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a simple message to get out there. Live life NOW. Say YES. Take RISKS. Scrap the unimportant things in life and follow your PASSIONS. This is what life is all about, and it\u0027s what we Kwerks are shouting from the rooftops!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we\u0027ve been having loads of fun with live shows and such, there is a reality to the challenge of the artist\u0027s lifestyle. In short, it doesn\u0027t bring in a lot of money. So when we found Patreon and explored how it works, it seemed like a perfect solution to having a small but steady income to work with as we keep on creating and spreading the love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe couldn\u0027t do what we\u0027re doing without our amazing army of supporters!! You have propelled us through so many amazing experiences already, and we couldn\u0027t be more thankful. With Patreon, supporters who sign up as Kwerk Patrons will receive a variety of perks - everything from merch to experiences, to insider and behind-the-scenes information and videos. We want you to know how much it means to have your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen you sign up to be a \u003cstrong\u003eKwerks Patron\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eyou\u0027ll get to choose the level of support you\u2019d like to give per video we release (even $1). Patrons can set monthly limits on their contributions, and can change or cancel their support at any time. Depending on what category/level a patron chooses to give at, we will offer different perks and there are many to choose from. (Take a look on the right side of the screen!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s kind of like crowd-funding. Unlike a typical crowd-funding initiative, however, this is not project-based, but is an ongoing support system where we will be able to gain a little income in order to continue to sustain the art we\u2019re creating and the message we\u2019re trying to get out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much content will you be putting out?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(36, 64, 97);\"\u003eWe release about 2 or 3 videos per month. One live music video, plus one or two behind-the-scenes videos, video blogs, interviews, etc. As a patron, you can set a monthly limit, even if you\u0027ve pledged a certain amount per video. (Eg: if you pledge $3 per video, you can set a limit of $5 per month, and that\u0027s all you\u0027ll be charged.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we doing this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell, we have been trying to figure out how to offer a way for you to engage with us in a really practical way, and have also been brainstorming ways to continue to fund our work. We see this as a win-win opportunity. More engagement, more fun, and some sustainable income for us as artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s DO IT!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, will you join us? Will you be a part of this Kwerky message that endeavours to make life a little brighter? Will you engage with us and laugh with us and hey, even dance along with us? \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you will, we\u2019ll be so excited to have you on our team.\u003cbr\u003eClick on the \"BECOME A PATRON\" button on the top right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo The Kwerks"

Through the incredible support and love of our followers, fans and supporters, we\u0027ve been propelled so much further than we ever imagined!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been doing everything DIY indie-style. From songwriting and forming a band of solid musicians, to marketing and promotion, to booking and managing, to producing our own videos, to submitting to every festival and contest we come across, to keeping engaged with our amazing army of fans, KwerkNation, it\u0027s more than a full time job!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe realities of sustaining The Kwerks financially are challenging, and while live performances and music sales bring in a certain amount, allowing our fans and supporters to become patrons will allow us to really delve into this work with much more freedom. It will also allow us to fund larger projects like a full album, an \u003cem\u003eactual tour\u003c/em\u003e, and better quality music and video.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur patrons don\u0027t only get a lot of Kwerky perks as they sign up to support us, they also get the opportunity for engagement, which is really a win-win, since we love to connect with our people, hear what they love, and ask for input on what we put out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, will you join us?

Many patrons simply want to support the work of an artist they like. Some patrons may really like the perks (free stuff, early access to music, engagement with the artist), while others want to brag to their friends that they\u0027re the fuel behind The Kwerks\u0027 music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not a new concept, actually. Mozart, Shakespeare, and many other notable artists were sustained by patrons \"back in the day\". Patreon is simply engaging an old world tradition in a new-world way, making it easy for artists to find the support they need to relax into their art and create better, and more, and higher quality art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many videos will you be putting out?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we\u0027re early in our Patreon journey, we\u0027ve set a goal of one video per month, with plans to increase that over the first year to two or three per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I sign up?
