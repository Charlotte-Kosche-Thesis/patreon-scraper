Hosted by John Rubio, along with Anastacia Kelly, Grant Davis, Mike Lambert, and a rotating cast of beer-lovin\u0027 riff-raff. The humor can get a bit crude, so earmuff the kids. Also, if kids are listening to a craft beer show, you might not be doing the parenting thing correctly. Recorded in Austin, TX with beers from all over the world.",
