We discuss Star Wars \u0026amp; Star Trek, DC \u0026amp; Marvel, Harry Potter \u0026amp; Middle Earth, and so much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe take our podcasting very seriously and we hope to improve in every aspect, from our production quality, to our podcasting performance, to our content we present. We plan on using this platform to help improve our podcast and our skills and abilities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will help out The Nerds improve our show. As it stands we spend money on a monthly basis for podcast hosting services, as well as fees for our website hosting services. We would like to be able to first use the donations to be able to cover these minimal costs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen once the show is self sustaining, we want to vastly improve our show to be more professional sounding! The first thing would be to get Marc a microphone. Then we would next buy some podcast software to record and edit our show to improve our show quality. Next we will look at buying video editing software to make it easier to provide quality video content to you, our Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs our production value is improving and we have the equipment and software to make these improvements, we will be increasing the amount of our show content and improving our quality at the same time. We also want to provide Credulous Nerds swag and product giveaways to all of you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal at Random Angst Productions and The Credulous Nerds is to produce the best show to our abilities and to provide premium and interesting content every time. We want to be forum where people can join because of interesting content, have their voice heard, and be a part of a positive environment. Let us know how we are doing and what we can improve on!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being a part of this endeavor!\u003cbr\u003e"
