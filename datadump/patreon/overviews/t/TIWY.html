Advice from local leaders, authors, experts, and business owners, plus performances from regional guest artists round out every show captured in front of a live audience at The Underground Theatre in Duluth, Minnesota. The live performance is then produced into a podcast. Two seasons and 16 podcast episodes later, we are entering our 3rd season...With the will to do more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY ARE WE ASKING?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecause in a community like ours, we know that a little from a lot of greats will go a long way to bring our podcast to you on a regular basis!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"text-align: center; background-color: initial;\"\u003eWHAT IS OUR STORY?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u2019s pretty simple really. At the heart of it, \u003cem\u003eTake It With You \u003c/em\u003estarted with great\u00a0people wanting to make great s#!%, with great artists...And pay them what they\u2019re worth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the summer of 2013, Blake Thomas, Mary Fox and Andy Frye were living in Minneapolis enjoying burgeoning arts careers when they had AN IDEA! They would drop everything, move up to Duluth, and create a live radio show and podcast from scratch with no funding, limited connections, and next to no resources\u2026 No one said it was a \u201cGOOD\u201d IDEA mind you! But as \u003cem\u003eTake It With You\u003c/em\u003e enters in to its 3rd season it\u2019s safe to say that the gamble is paying off. \u003cem\u003eTIWY \u003c/em\u003eboasts a string of sold out performances, nearly 10,000 podcast downloads, and a slot on Duluth\u2019s KUMD radio\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRadio is called \u201cthe theatre of the mind\u201d for a reason: we\u2019re relying on our audience to use their imaginations. We\u2019re counting on \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e to create the world right along with us. \u003cem\u003eTIWY\u003c/em\u003e is one part theatre, one part music concert, one part improv, and one part instructive. The format allows us to highlight a wide range of talents and ideas in a single performance. Plus, as a podcast, our once finite live-audience becomes virtually limitless, which is how we ultimately intend to \u003cem\u003eTAKE OVER THE WORLD\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, world domination may not be in the cards for awhile, but that\u2019s alright with us. We believe that the idea comes first, and that the best stuff is often made when our creativity has to pick up the slack for what we lack in resources. We started from zero and we\u2019re building brick by brick.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eOne\u003c/em\u003e of our long term goals is to be able to pay everyone on our team an hourly wage for their work. It sounds like a no-brainer (right?), but it\u2019s a concept almost unheard of in the arts today. It\u2019s an uphill battle for sure, but we\u2019ve got a lot of people rooting for us. The collective heart of Duluth is enormous. The support, love, creativity and selflessness of this community is no small thing and \u003cem\u003eTake It With You\u003c/em\u003e owes much of its success to the city itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you come to see \u003cem\u003eTake It With You\u003c/em\u003e (or you\u2019re listening to the podcast) you\u2019re doing more than merely experiencing a show.
