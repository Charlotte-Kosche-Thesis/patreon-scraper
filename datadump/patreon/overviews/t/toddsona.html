I\u0027m currently a senior at The Cleveland Institute of Art, and I\u0027m majoring in Animation. I\u0027m also an avid gamer, writer, and self-proclaimed nerdiest nerd to ever nerd.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, you maybe wondering \"Morgan, just why are you here on Patreon?\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell I\u0027ll be honest: My current job isn\u0027t exactly paying what I\u0027d like it to, and it leaves me less time to be devoted to what I love. I don\u0027t have as much time to expand my knowledge and experiment and improve as much as I would like. And I\u0027d love to have something that can sustain me while I begin to work my way into the industry (i.e. Disney, Blizzard, RoosterTeeth, you get the idea)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to help me, I know I can make it worth your while!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the bottom of my heart, thank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested, check out my art here! ===\u0026gt;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://hinataelyontoph.deviantart.com/\"\u003ehttps://hinataelyontoph.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWanna come by while I stream?
