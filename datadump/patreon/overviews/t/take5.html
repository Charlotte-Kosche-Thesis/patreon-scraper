    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eDo you have 5 minutes a day to receive a session with me and see how your life changes? As a teacher, author, Certified BodyTalk practitioner, mother of 2, Autism Recovery Facilitator, world traveler, intuitive empath and mentor, I am doing something, no one has ever done: I am sharing the healing work that I do in a 5 minute daily format with a small membership cost.\u00a0 After offering one-one-one sessions for high prices for years, I\u0027m convinced that if I offer the sessions to a large group for a small price, we can create a much larger shift in ourselves and society!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor people interested in deeper healing and growth, there are longer weekly and monthly BodyTalk sessions and individual consultations that support you on the path to health in the 5 main areas of body, mind, emotions, energy, and spirit.\u00a0 I\u0027ll be offering home intensive 5 day retreats and retreats in person in Hawaii for the most one-on-one support. Check out my site at \u003ca href=\"http://www.take5healing.com\"\u003ewww.take5healing.com\u003c/a\u003e for more information on retreats and on the BodyTalk System.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAutism has personally impacted my life through my daughter\u0027s diagnosis in 2010. I have experienced the healing power of energy medicine and BodyTalk for Autism.\u00a0 My specific interest in Autism recovery has lead me to write one book already, \u003cem\u003eBecoming Real: Our Journey Through Autism\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 These sessions will work great for children with special needs! They don\u0027t have to understand, you can just \"tap in\" the session lightly on their head and heart area. In addition to sessions, I\u0027d like to create more trainings and materials for families impacted by Autism and offer them \u003cimg src=\"https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=bodytalk+image\u0026amp;id=6ED3EAC8C7759C54385FEEFC47B9C573142633A8\u0026amp;FORM=IQFRBA\"\u003eat little to no cost. I have powerful solutions for some of our biggest problems today in healthcare, can you help me share this solution of group intuitive healing work with energy medicine?\u00a0 I intend that through this site, may you be more whole, healed, and happy!\u00a0 So tap in these sessions as I show you in the videos.\u00a0 Tap them in for your kids and family who want to receive the sessions. Share with your friends and invite them to join us in a healthcare revolution where powerful healing is available every day for everyone! Are you ready to Take 5 with me?\u003c/div\u003e"

     "description": "Once I reach $5000, I\u0027ll be able to complete and publish my 2 big writing projects.\u00a0 First is my Autism Recovery Facilitator\u0027s materials for workshops. This is an innovative and effective way for parents and caregivers to create a program for healing that works for their child. It gets powerful results because it is based on the child\u0027s own unique needs. I developed this while recovering my daughter from Autism symptoms!\u00a0 Second, I can finish and publish the book called \u003cem\u003eThe Sacred Sanctuary.\u003c/em\u003e It is a mind blowing method for self-healing that was revealed to me and is working powerfully for others I have shared with! I\u0027ll be sharing parts of these materials with my top $50 - $200 tier patrons.\u00a0 I\u0027d like to share these for little to no money for families affected by Autism.\u003cbr\u003e",
