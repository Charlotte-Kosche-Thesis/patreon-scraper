    "summary": "Hello everyone! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Tobie and I have been gaming for almost all of my life. \u00a0I am the Creator and Game Designer for \u003cstrong\u003eTAG Sessions\u003c/strong\u003e, where I create tabletop role-playing games such as A Single Moment, Sickening Queens, Bad Timing, Sunlight, and many others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been into tabletop rpgs for over twenty years, and have also worked on mobile and online games for over five years.\u00a0 I have set up this Patreon as a means to get monthly support funding for all the gaming related projects and releases I create each month. These range from creating small and big projects that get released, to holding talks and rpg-related seminars that help more people get into the hobby or learn new things about it. Collectively, these are what I call \u003cstrong\u003eTAG Thingies\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are \u003cstrong\u003eTAG Thingies\u003c/strong\u003e?\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, any game ideas I came up with simply became blogposts. But as of February 2, 2016, I found the courage and earned up enough funds to release my first TAG Sessions release:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/172570/Bad-Timing--A-Romantic-Comedy-Fiasco-Playset\"\u003eBad Timing\u003c/a\u003e. It was a Fiasco Romantic Comedy playset and while it didn\u0027t exactly gain a fandom, it found its gamers and made me realize I should go beyond just blogposts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, \u003cstrong\u003eTAG Sessions\u003c/strong\u003e was born. The name started as an inside joke, about how people would brag about having had a \"Tobie Abad gaming session!\" But in the end, my partner helped me realize I should embrace that as a brand. Creating games costs money. Artists, layout and distribution can cost and sadly I wasn\u0027t really earning at a point that I could self-publish everything without hurting my savings. My partner told me there are always people willing to help out, and this account is giving people a chance to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTAG Thingies\u003c/strong\u003e is my Pateron term for stuff I create to celebrate gaming in all its forms - which range from games I\u0027ve created and similar projects, to talks, slide-shows, and seminars on gaming that I can offer the community. I currently have been offering to give talks in various events, with the most recent one (as of this writing) being an upcoming school talk on game design this March 2018. I keep the slides available online as well, at what I call the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tobieabad.googlepages.com/home\"\u003eGarapata Repository\u003c/a\u003e, so others can make use of them if they want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince this Patreon began, the current list of slides for talks I\u0027ve given include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRPG101 - Introduction to Gumshoe\u003cbr\u003eThe Game of Love (On running romance and love stories in rpgs)\u003cbr\u003eHow to be a Better Player (Tips which have worked for me in the years I\u0027ve been gaming)\u003cbr\u003eGoing GMless (Introducing a few GMless systems, and sharing how gmless games can work)\u003cbr\u003eHow to Host Horror (Building mood and using horror techniques in films for your rpgs)\u003cbr\u003eSharing the Fun (Tips on introducing rpgs to non-gamer friends and loved ones)\u003cbr\u003eA Glimpse and a Taste (of Indie games that you may not have heard of)\u003cbr\u003eNot Pathetic Caricatures (Suggestions on approaching NPCs to be more interesting)\u003cbr\u003eNarrative Control (Breaking down the concept of it, and how it makes games better)\u003cbr\u003eA Beautiful Lie (Mood building using light, sound, time, and more)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso released thanks to the support of my Patrons are the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBad Timing (a Fiasco playset for running romantic comedy games)\u003cbr\u003eA Single Moment (a two-player dramatic samurai game, with loads of rpg tips)\u003cbr\u003eSunlight (a play via webcam game created for Game Chef 2016)\u003cbr\u003eThat Night Out (an official release of a survival horror GMless game I created for a contest)\u003cbr\u003eSickening Queens (a Fiasco playset for running Drag Queen inspired stories)\u003cbr\u003eTen More Playsets (a supplement to A Single Moment)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther Work I\u0027ve Done\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you\u0027re wondering about my ability to write, you can also look at the freelance writing work I\u0027ve done. I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to work on a few other projects, such as contribute to John Wick\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003ePirate Nations\u003c/strong\u003e book for the second edition of \u003cstrong\u003e7th Sea\u003c/strong\u003e, his upcoming \u003cstrong\u003eCurse of the Yellow Sign: Fragments of the King\u003c/strong\u003e, and other projects such as \u003cstrong\u003eSound of Water\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eAdvanced Doll\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eGirls Elsewhere\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eTrust Me\u003c/strong\u003e,\u003cstrong\u003e Indie Mixtape: Volume 3, New Hotness\u003c/strong\u003e.

Become my patron and I promise you that it will not be a wasted investment in someone\u0027s creative dreams. Your commitment towards helping me shall be matched by my commitment to contributing more back to the gaming community and helping introduce more people to gaming. I shall work on releasing the listed projects, as well as continue to introducing gaming to more and more people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sincerely thank you for taking the time to read this very long introduction and I do hope you choose to become my patron. Gaming has in many ways made my life wonderful and fulfilling. I only hope to somehow share that experience with others and give back to the community in any way I can. \u003cbr\u003e"
