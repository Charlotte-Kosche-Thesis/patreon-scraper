I love Anime, Games, Films and so much more. One day i decided to create a YouTube Channel: TGS Anime, with the intent of talking about all the things i find interesting. One of my biggest hobbies is the game of Yu-Gi-Oh! I have made many series around that show Like; Yu-Gi-Oh! Trivia where i disect an archetype in the card game and find out what inspired its creation and lore. Yu-Gi-Oh! Character Profiles where i break down the aspects of each character in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Series and find out why they are the way that they are. Most Popular are my Top 10\u0027s and Idiots Guides.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHowever i do so much more, I love to review the big new animes as they come out weekly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u00a0I reckon I upload \u003cstrong\u003eroughly 5-10 videos a week!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAnd that is not counting the\u003cstrong\u003e 4 \u003c/strong\u003eLivestreams\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI do minimum \u003cstrong\u003eevery week!!!\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tAs you can imagine creating all this content takes up\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eA LOT\u003c/strong\u003e of my time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t Writing scripts, recording audio \u0026amp; editing it all together - all of this is \u003cstrong\u003edone by me and me alone\u003c/strong\u003e.
