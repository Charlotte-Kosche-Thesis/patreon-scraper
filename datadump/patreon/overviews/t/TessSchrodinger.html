    "summary": "Welcome and allow me to say \"Thank You!\" to the following for joining my TEAM ADVENTURE!!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy very first patron, Paul Ewen! And thank you as well to Kage, James Troutman, Andrew, Andrea Gonzales, Yestin, and Nyx! It is an honour that you appreciate and support my work! And it\u0027s a pleasure to share it with you. And now....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my lair!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"The devil is in the details\" refers to \"a catch or mysterious element hidden in the details, meaning that something might seem simple at a first look but will take more time and effort to complete than expected.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuch is life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you have never met me and do not know me in person. Allow me to introduce myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a single mother who works hard to raise a beautiful strong intelligent daughter. I have never received a penny of child support. I have had several folks suggest that if I set up a Patreon account, I could essentially make the equivalent of child support through sharing my own work. There is, however, a part of me that cringes at the idea of charging for things that I have always and would like to continue to share freely in my efforts to give back to my community and to those who have helped me over the years through mentoring, friendship, and constructive advice and criticism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, here is my plan. I already create a variety of what you might call \u201cproducts\u201d that I already share with people and have never charged for:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecurity Education Products: I have designed a number of security awareness products over the years and even won a few awards. Because I am a champion of education and awareness, I feel that it\u2019s my gift to those who might struggle with creating their own products. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cCrypto\u201d Challenges \u0026amp; Games: Over the years I have designed and shared a number of fun games and challenges for everything from a child\u2019s birthday party to conferences with over a thousand attendees. I do not charge for these and I share them freely. This year, I have also created two \u201cEscape Rooms\u201d geared towards kids for a local conference. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFitness \u0026amp; Motivation: I have lost over a hundred pounds in the last ten years. I compete in triathlons. I swim, cycle, run, walk, and lift weights. I have gone from a woman terrified to run two steps on a treadmill in fear of hurting herself or looking like a ridiculous elephant to a woman who can glance across the room and see dozens of triathlon medals hanging on her wall and even TWO awards (a second and a third place). I know how difficult it can be to loose that weight, I know how overwhelming it can be to pivot and change your entire life (remember, I am a single mom), I have known sadness, frustration, and fear. Fear? Yes. I am also a breast cancer survivor, so I also share motivational quotes, stories, and experiences to help encourage others so that they feel less alone and to help them realize they have the same potential for greatness even if they can\u2019t see it themselves at the moment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHomeschool: In addition to all of the above, I homeschool my daughter with the help of my family. She is a teenager now and has had the benefit of a number of amazing experiences and opportunities for non-traditional education. While academics are always the first concern, I am also a huge proponent of \u201clike skills\u201d so I volunteer as a teacher with a few local homeschool cooperatives. I have taught classes in Cyber Security Awareness, Introduction to Information Technology and Security, and I also teach cooking classes and art classes. I am delighted now to have found Patreon as a platform where I can share my lesson plans and materials for both our own personal homeschool as well as the classes I teach. For those interested in homeschooling I am always happy to sit a moment and share how we do it and for those interested in trying to teach other kids about cyber security and awareness I am always happy to share my \u201clessons learned\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the day, I pride myself on being a strong woman who has done her best to not let life (or anyone or thing in it) to beat her down and keep her down. My intention is to continue to share my products and experiences with anyone who needs them. Therefore, when I create something for the community, it will always be free. No need to contribute even a single penny to me for that. If you do so desire to contribute, however, I promise that I would use that generous gift towards continuing to provide for my daughter and her education. As I create more for her and for my community, I will share that with others and you here. If you\u2019d like to contribute monetarily as a patron, you will be supporting me as well as my daughter continue to do amazing things to reach as many people as we can to educate, motivate, encourage, help heal, and help grow a better world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeriodically, I will post a list of the monthly big project I will share. In addition to those pre-planned projects, I will also share smaller things on a more ad hoc basis such as book and movie reviews for materials I use for work or homeschool; product reviews for things I use either in my personal life or for work or training; and occasional blog posts on current events or topics of interest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAreas of interest you can expect materials from me on depending on what projects I have on my plate or have recently completed: Science, Cyber Security, Triathlon, Swimming, Cycling, Running, Weight Lifting, Nutrition, Surviving Cancer, Organization, Planning, Art, Drawing, Painting, Event Planning, Gourmet Cooking, Parenting, Philosophy, Quantum Physics, Cryptography, Travel, Education, Mentoring, Coaching, Community, Writing, Design, Fashion, Beauty, Shopping, Humor, Motivation, and Self Improvement. \u003cbr\u003e"
