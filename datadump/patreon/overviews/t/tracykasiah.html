The jokes is that I can smell chocolate from 50 paces, but it\u0027s really only like 25, and beauty is something I can\u0027t help but find everywhere.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I on Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePainting takes time.\u003cbr\u003eRecently\u00a0I was able to take most of the month off from my day job to allow myself a few weeks to paint. In 25 days I finished over 35 new paintings; most 8 x 10 inches or smaller but there are a few well rendered 16 x 20 (see Vaticani Visti) and 18 x 24s (see Cry Circle, Manang, or Thorung Phedi).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m tired of trying to work two jobs just so that I can afford to paint. I\u0027m going to be painting either way, maybe this way we can actually get some of these series finished in a timely manor, share them, and hopefully develop my abilities further with your invaluable feedback!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I going to do with the money?\u003cbr\u003e*\u003c/strong\u003ePay rent for my studio; currently my front room/entryway - eventually an extra bedroom/office\u003cbr\u003e*Buy supplies, more paint, more brushes, and maybe eventually more canvases but for right now I have plenty of those (thanks, Black Friday!).\u003cbr\u003e*Print things. Prints for my patrons, prints to sell in coffee shops, and reproductions to sell at art shows.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e*Rent a venue for an art show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I hope to finish filling the 50+ canvases I already have with my story telling landscape paintings ranging from 3 x 5 inches to 3 x 5 feet. Trail adventures and scenic views through 12 countries, the end goal is an art show and hard cover book with paintings and stories side by side for your enjoyment. Prints will be available throughout for sale and as rewards. I hope the originals find happy homes too, as any good mother does. More stories at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tracykasiah.com\"\u003emy website.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading, and for all of your support!"
