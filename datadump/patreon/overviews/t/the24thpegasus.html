Well, if you\u0027re here, I\u0027m going to assume that you know what this is for, so I\u0027ll spare you the details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend so much time writing fanfiction and sharing it with fellow fans like me that I decided I might as well make a little something in case people want to share their gratitude with a little bit more than just a comment and a like. Might as well try to profit off of something that you do passionately and well, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fimfiction.net/user/The%2024th%20Pegasus\"\u003eFiMfiction\u003c/a\u003e, busy plucking away at my small gallery of stories, and updating things every once in a while (but hopefully more often than not). I\u0027m best known for my fantasy-style war stories, though I\u0027m prone to writing whatever strikes me as interesting at the moment. I currently have a selection of fantasy, sci-fi, and a few slice of life and comedy stories, though I tend to ground most of my series work in a brutal realism as opposed to high magic and wacky space hijinks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re willing to kick a few bits in my direction, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I in no way am asking anyone to donate money to me; my finances are secure for the foreseeable future, so it\u0027s not like I really need it. This patreon is more like a tip jar for those who feel like donating in support of my work. That being said, I appreciate whatever you feel like giving me; it gives me more spending money to put toward things, and I hope I can repay you with my skill behind a keyboard.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd with that being said, I figured I\u0027d use this as a way to give something back to you all. You\u0027ll get early previews of my chapters and stories at the $5 reward, and you\u0027ll be able to commission fics from me at the $10 reward. I\u0027m keeping a limit on the latter for now, just to see how things go, and I might adjust or remove it completely at a later date. But if you want me to write something, there\u0027s your best bet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yeah, that\u0027s it. Cheers mate, and even if you don\u0027t want to donate anything, I appreciate your support for my work regardless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnte Legionem nihil erat, et nihil erit post Legionem\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e24"
