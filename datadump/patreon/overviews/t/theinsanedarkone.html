XD\u003cbr\u003e(Also, with this new method, projects like the Femme Fatale can be also concluded)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, what I want to tell here is that, in front of me now, there is this opportunity and, it\u00b4s always strange to take a first step into a different plattaform, but, as some guys taught me back when I started doing my first commissions, some things in life just happen, and we got to have the courage to let that opportunity be part of our path, not because we need it, but because we truly belive in it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHope you guys understand and, also, hope many here can help me reach this next level! ^^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely, and thanking each one of you in advance\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDanilo Rosa   - TheInsaneDarkone"
