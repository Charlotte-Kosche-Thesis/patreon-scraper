    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIn all honesty\u003c/strong\u003e, I have no big expectations for this Patreon page, this is why I don\u0027t have many goals at the moment. But if anyone wants to support me and others that feature on the channel, and we will be actually expanding, I will definitely will layout proper plans for the future and keep everyone updated with the progress. Even though there are some projects in the work, but I rather do it step by step, than announcing everything at once and have the pressure of finishing everything as soon as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OzlI6eA.jpg\" style=\"width: 900px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you want to support the channel, I will be really grateful for your support. It\u0027s not really important, it\u0027s all optional, as it won\u0027t change the direction the channel is going. But every bit of support for upcoming projects is really awesome and I appreciate that you watch my videos in the first place. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0V2rtCjl.png\" style=\"width: 896px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main content for the upcoming year will be \u003cstrong\u003eBattlefield \u003c/strong\u003e(gameplay, commentaries and podcasts), as it always was, but of course, we got other series that you can enjoy. We played games like \u003cstrong\u003eLeague of Legends, Unturned, Runescape\u003c/strong\u003e, and I have plans to make videos about Witcher 3 and Lego Worlds. On other note, I would love to do FIFA videos, I won\u0027t lie. I just loved the Race to Division 1 series back in the days, and I would love to expand on that. But I do realize the nature of sports games, \u003cstrong\u003eso I won\u0027t make\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eFIFA videos unless\u003c/strong\u003e people will demand for it. Not to mention, I need to buy a console for that (PS3 and PC owner), as sports are not going strong on PC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/BX5ssBV.jpg\" style=\"width: 894px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegarding the actual theme for the content, expect to see everything. I\u0027m not a serious person, I\u0027m really not, but I do understand that sometimes I need to put my jokes aside and talk about some serious stuff. This is why I\u0027m a big of fan podcasts and informative videos. But of course, expect some crazy \u0027\u0027funny\u0027\u0027 videos from, as I already mentioned, I\u0027m not a serious person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bj5PW6Z.jpg\" style=\"width: 889px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery donated dollar will be invested into games me and others would love to play, equipment like microphones, lighting, webcams, and if there\u0027s a need, PC parts. Even if the sum is couple dollars, it always helps. So if you feel like my channel deserves the support, feel free to donate. Like always, your support is appreciated and I will do my best to justify your commitment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for watching my videos\u003cbr\u003e- Tom aka The Lanky Soldier\u003c/strong\u003e"

     "about": "Hello there guys and girls, my name is Tom and I\u0027m 23 years old. I\u0027m just a normal regular dude that loves to play video games and enjoy them with other people.\u00a0I may sound sometimes like an unhappy individual that complains there\u0027s no toilet paper in the bathroom (partly because of my accent and my humour), but I\u0027m not that type of guy that loves to complain like everyone else. I rather just shut up and just find the best solution for the problem.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027\u0027The problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the problem. Do you understand?\u0027\u0027 -\u00a0Captain Jack Sparrow\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a really neutral person when it comes to anything to be honest. I always see both sides of the stick and I always try to understand and analyse the situation. I always\u00a0remain objective to everything and always give fair share of praise and criticism where it\u0027s due, no matter what. And of course, I will not talk about subjects that I don\u0027t understand or give ideas, as I mentioned already, I would have no clue of what I would be talking about. I rather leave those discussion to people that actually understand what they are talking about and learn some new things from them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I already mentioned, I am a gamer, I won\u0027t deny it. I love video games and they do bring a lot of emotions in me. I don\u0027t play all the games, as I stick around with my favorite ones (Battlefield titles are my main ones), but if a new video game is really interesting to me and actually worth the money, I will play it. I never play RPGs, as my last RPG was Runescape back couple years ago, and I spent 3 years just playing that web-browser RPG, leveling up my character, doing quests with my friends, exploring the world and of course fighting against other players. I still have my account. So I knew that I don\u0027t want to spend so much time on a RPG anymore, as Runescape has a special place in my heart, but people told me about Witcher 3 and I kinda gave up to the hype. And you know what? Witcher 3 is a masterpiece.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to first-person shooters, I don\u0027t really enjoy them. Battlefield is the only first-person shooter that I actually enjoy, and it became my main game since when I tried Battlefield for the first time years ago. I never looked back since then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really passionate about my work that I produce and always aiming to do better next time, whether it be a Youtube video or short movie. I\u0027m really competitive in nature, but I don\u0027t allow to myself too seriously.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
