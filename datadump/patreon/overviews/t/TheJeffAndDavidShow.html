    "summary": "I\u0027m Jeff and I\u0027ve been doing the Jeff and David Show with David for over five years now and it has been a whole lot of fun. With the amount of time and effort I put into each video with editing, processing, rendering and so forth, I had the \u003cem\u003eweird\u003c/em\u003e notion that it might be possible to get paid to do this. Both David and I know what it is like to be professional musicians, and in that industry you get used to the idea of not being compensated for your work and time. Patreon, though, offers a great opportunity to see actual income come in from doing the projects I love on Youtube. This means exhaustive Let\u0027s Play videos of our favorite video games, guides for particular noteworthy endeavors like tackling the bosses in the Dark Souls games, and the occasional video game music cover (which I\u0027d love to do more of, but time and money do not currently permit).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, we can eventually turn this channel into a full time job which would be awesome and something we would be eternally grateful for. As it is now, the Youtube ad revenue system does not have a place for the channels out there like ours that have less than a million views per video. By appealing to the loyal few, we can bypass the ad system entirely and, with a steady and reliable source of income, provide more quality content on a faster schedule. This means that if we can reach a sustainable level of income, we\u0027ll produce videos for the channel full time! That means more LPs, more guides and more of David trying to pronounce simple English words!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe will continue to release videos on Youtube for free\u003c/strong\u003e, so don\u0027t worry about that! What the Patreon system can do for us is ensure a certain level of income each month so that we can do \u003cem\u003eresponsible adult things\u003c/em\u003e like make budgets, cook and make internet videos instead of running around desperately seeking new or better employment when a gig or contract expires. So kindly consider a monthly tip if you like what we do. Even something as simple as $1 a month will be $1 a month more than we would have got otherwise! We have a bunch of strange, yet appealing incentives for the intrepid backers who would dare take a chance on us, Abba style, below!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
