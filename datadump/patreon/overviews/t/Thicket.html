A sickness has spread, killing countless and reducing the number\nof births drastically. Our story begins as Pilgrim and his friend, \u003cstrong\u003eWillow\u003c/strong\u003e, venture out of their village in\na desperate search to save his sick mother. But upon entering an ancient cave,\nseeking to beg the help of ancient spirits, the two accidentally open a portal\ninto the spirit realm using the yolk of a fossil egg, and are plunged headlong\ninto a fantastic new world. They are surprised to discover that spirits; shaggy\nhorned creatures, are nothing like they had imagined...and this world is a treacherous\nplace to be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPilgrim crosses\npaths with a duo of Spirits, \u003cstrong\u003eUnki \u0026amp;\nRy\u003c/strong\u003e, who are searching for a \u003cstrong\u003eWraithwood\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e;\u003c/strong\u003e cocoon laden trees that act as cerebral wombs for spirits. Once\ninside them, a spirit dreams the life of a human that recently passed away and\nawakens with the soul\u2019s memories entwined with their own. It is an important\npart of a spirits existence; and is the final step of a soul\u2019s reincarnation.Through their\nnew friends, Pilgrim and Willow discover that an old spirit, \u003cstrong\u003eMadu\u003c/strong\u003e, has\nbeen storming through the Thicket, burning down the Wraithwoods. All of Madu\u2019s\ndreams have been experiences of pain and cruelty, leaving him broken and\nafraid. He despises humans and believes the destruction of the Wraithwoods will\nbring an end to his suffering. His actions are destroying the natural balance\nof both worlds, and the loss of Wraithwoods becomes directly linked to the mysterious\nplague afflicting Pilgrim\u2019s village. A darkness is falling over the Thicket;\nold powers of fear and anguish have slunk out from the shadows in a powerful\nmanifestation, and have begun to latch themselves to the tortured Madu.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nThicket\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eis a fantasy tale that paints the great beyond in a new light. It combines the playful\ntale of an unlikely boy-hero with mature undertones that illustrate the\ncapacity of darkness within the human heart. It is as much a tale of redemption\nrevolving around its central villain as it is an outlandish coming of age story\nfor the young protagonist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OekDotA.jpg\" style=\"width: 595px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Vl4WQPn.jpg\" style=\"width: 594px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Do You Receive Content?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEach new issue of Thicket \u003c/em\u003ewill be available for all viewers\u00a0on my website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.chrisoconnor3d.com/thicket/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.chrisoconnor3d.com/thicket/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn all levels, you will receive a high resolution digital download of each issue a whole week before it is released to the public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/aAMGAXY.png\" style=\"width: 683px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Chris!
