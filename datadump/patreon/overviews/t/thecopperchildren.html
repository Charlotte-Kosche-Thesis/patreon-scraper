Through joyful times and times of sorrow, music is that which gets us through; our good healing Old Time Medicine! It is the way we give back to our creator, to our people, and to ourselves. We hope and pray that you have found this page because of that very music and that it has served you as well as it has served us.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0We are truly blessed to have so many supporters, friends, and family on this journey with us and we are SO excited for you to join us on our journey!\u00a0It\u0027s not always easy to ask for help, but the truth is we all need it from time to time. In our case, we are rich in SO many ways (joy, friends, family, health, love, music) but could use your aid financially.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0We ask you: Please give what you can, for we are giving it all we\u0027ve got!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advanced for your help!

     "description": "Fix the bus, Gus! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur tour bus, \"UP\", unexpectedly took a poop in the engine compartment one week before our #springbeans tour, and repairs have been utterly expensive!! We have already payed $500 to get it diagnosed and repaired but it seems we may have to put another 500-2000 in it to get her going again. The diagnosis was not very hopeful but we need a mechanic to take the engine apart further to truly find out the problem. \u003cbr\u003e At $75-100/hour it will realistically take 2-5 hours just to diagnose it, let alone fix it.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0Please help us Give \"UP\" a chance for the Summer Tour in June as it is the ideal way for us to travel (she\u0027s a 12 passenger shuttle bus that hold all our gear, and sleeps us all comfortably)\u003cbr\u003e Thank you infinitely!! \u00a0And yes, you can \"Get on Up!\" with us when we come to your hood :)",
