We always strive to look at Norwich City\ndifferently to anything out there in the NCFC world. Dan left to join Norwich City to their programmes.\u003cbr\u003eSo, there\u0027s a new team of people\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are no blow-by-blow match\nreports, no transfer gossip, no repeating news you\u2019ve already read elsewhere,\nno deep analysis of formations, no publishing clickbait and absolutely no\nbudget to do it all in. So far we\u2019ve had a huge support for our output \u2013\nwith some terrific writing on the website. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Little Yellow Bird Project is for\nthe fans. Not advertisers. Not sponsors. We are all about quality writing and\ninteresting, funny views. So far we\u2019ve run the site purely off our own backs\nand paid for it out of our own pockets. Football websites are overrun with ads from gambling\nwebsites which take advantage of people for profit, and we don\u2019t want that on\nour site. \u003cbr\u003eWe have to be independent.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo this is what we are proposing\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon helps followers and fans to pay a monthly fee to \u003cstrong\u003eThe\nLittle Yellow Bird Project\u003c/strong\u003e in return for quality output. We\u2019re not asking for a huge\namount \u2013 just $2 a month is around \u00a316 a year. (Or you can give more if you\nwish!) In return we can keep the website, audio and video content going. Your support would\nbe very kind, and hugely appreciated, and even more helpful than retweeting us\nor linking to us or SHOUTING ABOUT US. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf everyone who watched, read and listened to our content, paid just one pound a month, the LYBP would be a full time NCFC content provider - all of our normal content and also produces NCFC documentaries, interviews with NCFC staff, famous fans, ex-players, comedy, more music videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will The Little Yellow Bird do for\nyou?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe will continue to do the following:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- \u003cstrong\u003eMatch Previews \u003c/strong\u003e\u2013 interviews\nwith interesting writers and journalists who support the opposition\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- \u003cstrong\u003eWHAT HAPPENED? - \u003c/strong\u003eJon\u0027s video reviews of the Norwich game\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cstrong\u003e Podcasts -\u003c/strong\u003e A bi-weekly dip in the world of NCFC in \u0027\u003cstrong\u003eThe Little Yellow Bird No Repeat Orginal Podcast\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e with Clare, Rich + Zoe\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eColourful Articles\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013 we\nthink we have some of the most interesting, funny and best people currently\nwriting about Norwich on our site.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- \u003cstrong\u003eThings We Sort of Learned\u003c/strong\u003e \u2013\nwe want to keep our amusing post-match reports\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat more will The Little Yellow Bird do\nfor you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine, the site and its content take minutes to read and watch. But hours to create. \u00a0Maybe one day, through your funding, this could be a full time job and the amount of content could even double.\u003cbr\u003eWe also have things we would like to do which we currently cannot\nafford. With your funding we want to grow to\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\n\n- \u003cbr\u003e\n\n- Pay writers and contributors\u003cbr\u003e- Develop artists to help with merchandise \u003cbr\u003e\n\n- Attract more writers \u003cbr\u003e\n\n- Create comedic videos for the site\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- Afford better equipment for podcast and videos \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does funding The Little Yellow Bird mean?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFunding The Little Yellow Bird Project means that we can stay\nindependent. No tacky ads. No banking or gambling sponsorship. So no-one asking\nus to push their products on the site, or PR teams censoring us. You \u2013 our\nreaders \u2013 are the only people we will be accountable to. Your money will help good\nwriters get paid for good work. More content will be produced for you to enjoy.\nIt\u2019ll all be done for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn advance, thanks so much. We put a lot of\nwork into making sure The Little Yellow Bird Project is as good as it possibly\ncan be, and we are genuinely amazed at the reaction it\u2019s received. We love that\nso many of you seem to love it, and with a bit of extra cash we\u2019ll hopefully\ngive you reasons to love it even more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe want to get bigger, better, funnier and\nmore interesting \u2013 and with you we can do it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJon"

You probably won\u0027t have heard of Dan, but he\u0027s an \nactual sportswriter who writes about actual sport. Jon is tall, Dan is \nshort. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have also been joined by the very talented Jack Holmes (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jackhoImes\"\u003e@jackholmes\u003c/a\u003e),\n who will be providing us with his awesome player illustrations \nthroughout the season. We haven\u0027t met him yet, so we don\u0027t know whether \nhe is tall or short. We also have some ace and fun guest writers.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWhat do we offer you? Well, we like \nNorwich, we like talking about Norwich, we like writing about Norwich. \nBut we also like not taking football seriously. So we try to be \nfunny and interesting and we always strive to look at Norwich City \ndifferently to anything out there in the NCFC world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo there are no blow-by-blow match reports, no repeating news you\u2019ve already read\n elsewhere, no deep analysis of formations (well, maybe a tiny bit. Dan \nquite likes that), and absolutely no budget to do it all in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe \nwant to do the best we can to celebrate this silly, pointless, brilliant\n game and the team with The Little Yellow Bird on their shirts.",
