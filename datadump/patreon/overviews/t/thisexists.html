    "summary": "Since I started making This Exists in December, 2013, it\u0027s gone through a lot of changes. Different backdrops, different facial hair lengths, different people working to make it all happen. It\u0027s been a wild, amazing ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, the show is produced entirely by me (with graphics from the dude Bobbie Tubbs) and posted with less frequency so I can focus on making more thoughtful, complete episodes with the amount of research and depth each subject deserves. It\u0027s not about solving the YouTube algorithm and chasing \u003cstrong\u003esweet clicks \u003c/strong\u003eand sacrificing quality in the name of strategy. It\u0027s about making things that are worthwhile and add something to the discourse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve stolen from some of my favourite podcasts and eliminated complicated rewards tiers, leaving one - \u003cstrong\u003e$4\u003c/strong\u003e for an extra video that goes behind the scenes and answers questions about the most recent episode for \u003cstrong\u003epatrons only\u003c/strong\u003e. For every new video, I\u0027ll be shooting an update that gets into the process of putting it all together, looking at the guts of the episode and answering some of the questions that have emerged here and in the comments. \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/hSe4tjeEjBU\"\u003eHere\u0027s an example\u003c/a\u003e for \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRoBSGzeEc0\"\u003ethe /r/place episode\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s like buying me a coffee (a good one, I\u0027m fancy) per episode, and me monologuing at you while I drink it. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this new focus, the model for this Patreon is now \u003cstrong\u003eper video\u003c/strong\u003e. Your support will help me with research, with equipment, with the production bells and whistles that elevate each episode. I\u0027ll be posting new videos at least once a month. If by some miracle I upload more often than twice in a month, those extra videos won\u0027t trigger any Patreon charges. Same with anything shorter, like updates or live streams.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you don\u0027t have the means to donate, thank you for supporting the show over the last three years. I\u0027m incredibly fortunate to have this platform to yell about the goofy things that interest me. You are the best.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eBe excellent to each other.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
