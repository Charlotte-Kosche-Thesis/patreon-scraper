    "summary": "Hi there! \u00a0Welcome to Tulsa YouTubers Patreon page! My name is Carissa Lee and I\u0027m excited to have you here. \u00a0First off, I just want to say THANK YOU to our Patrons. \u00a0Your contributions are helping us make a difference in the Oklahoma YouTuber community through meetups and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0Let me tell you a little bit about how Tulsa YouTubers came about. \u00a0A few years ago, I started putting random home videos on YouTube, one being a cat video (of course!) and it went viral. \u00a0Before then, I was just using my youtube account as a dumping ground for miscellaneous videos here and there with no clue of what could happen if I had just applied a little effort to what I was doing. After my video took off, I was inspired to pick apart the magical place of YouTube and figure out how to make money from it. \u00a0After a bit of research, I realized that I needed to find other people to collaborate on videos with to grow my channel and surprisingly found no one else in my area and definitely no local meetup groups for YouTubers. \u00a0That\u0027s when I started a Facebook group called Tulsa YouTubers.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 At first, this group was filled with random friends that I threw into the mix to draw people in. \u00a0It grew slowly for awhile but eventually started gaining traction and now here we are. \u00a0Over 200\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/groups/tulsayoutubers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e members, over 200\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://meetup.com/tulsa-youtubers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMeetup.com\u003c/a\u003e members, about 70\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN4n5sJ8N6blhwk00zsgAPg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e subscribers, and every meetup we have is filled with excited, local creators that may not have met had they not decided to take a chance and join us in person. \u00a0I\u0027m passionate about this community and want to see every member in it succeed. \u00a0The passion I have for our talented community has led to the creation of a new website called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://okyoutubers.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOklahoma YouTubers\u003c/a\u003e (okyoutubers.com), where I am currently working on a directory that will eventually hold as many creators names and links as possible by category. \u00a0One day, I hope to make this website more interactive with the ability to create profiles, etc. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 When you become a Tulsa YouTubers Patreon, you become an important part of the YouTube Movement in Oklahoma. \u00a0You are helping a budding community grow into a force to be reckoned with. \u00a0All money donated will go towards the cost of renting a room for our monthly meetups (last Saturday of every month), supplies and refreshments for the YouTube members at the meetups, community projects that facilitate collaboration among members, creating helpful content for the Tulsa YouTubers YouTube channel, maintaining / adding to the community website, hosting events to draw in more YouTube creators (example: booth rental at Tulsa State Fair or other local events), and helping us worry less about coming up with the funds for our community and more about delivering the most value to all of our local, talented creators."
