And since I have neither a steady job nor a degree in progress I might as well shamelessly set up a place where people can both donate to my personal charity and get more art in return!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI draw a bunch of stuff but my specialty here is the male body\u2014muscles, growth, height, masculinity, and all that transformationy stuff. I admit I\u0027m a bit of a novice in this area, but I sure as hell am committed to becoming the best artist I can be via drawings of attractive men, and learn more about anatomy and art techniques in the process!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis page is really sad and rough right now but I\u0027ll be working on it! And if any of you like my art enough to donate even a dollar, then I want you to know that I love you \u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003eyour family in a warm, platonic way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT YOU\u0027LL BE GETTING\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eConsider this Patreon page an upgraded version of my \u003ca href=\"https://theobromic.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr feed\u003c/a\u003e. Not only will every finished piece there be posted here first, $3 and up Patrons get more and full-quality WIPs and sketches! Higher-pledging Patrons also get more connected to me and my process, from getting full process files of finished pieces to being able to suggest ideas and vote on what I draw next! Expect more info on those soon while I get my stuff together!\u003cbr\u003e"
