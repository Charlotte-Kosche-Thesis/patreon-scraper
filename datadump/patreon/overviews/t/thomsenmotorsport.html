Now that the car is on the track, I\u0027m producing videos of how the car is developed and of its exploits on track. You can find an introduction to the project here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gzjcimjfTQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the next few months, I\u0027m going to be releasing the designs of the car piece by piece to the public. I\u0027ll aim to release them within a few weeks of the milestones being reached to my Patreons, which will allow those who contribute to have early access before they go public once the project is complete. Hopefully others can learn from these designs, come up with their own improvements or just use them to build their own car.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can probably tell, this project has been costly, both in terms of the money it took to build the car, and also in terms of the time it took me to do the research, learn to do what I needed to do, and to make the videos that you hopefully enjoy. By building this page I hope that people who have enjoyed what I\u0027ve done or who use the designs give back what they feel is a fair contribution for my efforts. I don\u0027t want to lock what I\u0027ve done behind a fee that would make it inaccessible to a large number of people, so I see this as a great way to give what they can and what they feel I deserve in return.\u003cbr\u003e"
