    "summary": "Hey everybody my name is Will, I\u0027m a gamer/vlogger/reviewer type of YouTuber. I started this YouTube channel Nov 2015, I had another YouTube channel since 2006 but I never made videos on it. Finally I had the guts to start making videos, I\u2019ve always been shy and self conscious of what people would think of my voice or the way I look due to my medical issues. I graduated high school in 2013 and I\u0027m 22 years old. Ever since I was 4 I got diagnosed with an extremely rare disease called Pompe Disease, it\u0027s a muscle dystrophy type of disease which means it\u0027s a muscle weakness disease so since then I\u0027ve been disabled and on a breathing machine all my life sadly. My life has been nothing but pain, here is some of the stuff I go thru, depression, anxiety, collapsed lung, kidney stones, gallbladder issues, I have a hard time swallowing food and liquids due to my esophagus being narrow. Also only my right arm functions which means I eat, play, edit, type only one handed and I\u0027ve had 26 surgeries. There\u2019s more stuff but it would take forever to type it all. \u00a0My dream is to inspire and motivate people thru YouTube, I want people to be like, \u201cOh look at this guy, he\u0027s disabled and on a breathing machine, has all these issues, can only use his right arm but yet he still doing what he loves, \u00a0if he can do it I can too\u201d. I feel embarrassed to make a patreon but I have to if I want to achieve my dream on YouTube, since all the equipment is so expensive and because I do giveaways, and I cant work due to my medical conditions. I\u2019m not forcing anyone to pay but if you can it would mean the world to me even a single dollar helps. Thank You"
