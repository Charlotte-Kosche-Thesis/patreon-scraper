I\u0027ve exhibited my work internationally, co-built the World\u0027s first Crowdfunded Fashion Label (in 2010) and co-built the World\u0027s first Virtual Museum on a physical location, just to name a few things. Furthermore I have been a Creativity teacher on artschools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a regular base I will show you a painting I made, a project I developed, a show I curated or a text I wrote in the past 25 years of being a creative professional.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will receive invites to all openings, and events I\u0027ll be involved in (provided that they are not private for some reason), and once a year I will give away a painting to one of my pledgers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom time to time I will also share the way I made these works, oftentimes techniques developed by myself, and once in a blue moon I will provide a step-by-step to make one of these works by yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrequent updates on work in progress (painting, AR projects, writing) and notes on the creative process, previously largely unavailable to anyone except my dog Lou.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to give you an insight on all things created now and in the past and hope you\u0027ll find it both stimulating and informative, maybe even inspirational for your own work or life (creativity can be useful in any part of life).\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou can make use of my techniques in any way you want to, be it literal or adjusted to your needs. In fact I hope you do! Being a teacher I like to think that knowledge and experience are on loan and should be passed on, and in my view this is the platform to do just that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m keeping my pledges relatively low because I believe in  inclusiveness and I think the content I\u0027m producing should be available to as many people possible, independent of their financial disposition.\u003cbr\u003e"
