    "summary": "Thank you for having an interest in my Patreon page. \u00a0To tell you a little about myself, from an early age I was very interested in comics (the usual suspects) like Superman, Batman, The X-Men, etc. \u00a0After attending art school and graduate art school it become ever apparent to me how much I love to draw and paint, but also the telling of stories that move your heart. \u00a0Thus the birth of a graphic novel called \"The Sixth Age\". \u00a0This project has branched off into a lot of different stories that I have written, as well as adapting an out of copyright poem by the name of \"The Man From Snowy River\" by \u00a0\u003cem\u003eA.B. Pater\u00adson.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThis is where I need your help. Over the past decade we have seen the digital media explode leaving the print media in an interesting and precarious spot. \u00a0Perhaps out of stubbornness, I still believe print to be a powerful media worth investing in, however, I do realize the quality and amazing uses of modern technology to be able to showcase and promote quality artwork. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://zepfhyr.com/thesixthage/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/collage_lb_image_page4_8_1.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThis is where you come in: Most of us have \"real\" jobs to be able to support our families. \u00a0The goal here would be to making comic development and publication a full-time gig with the spattering of side jobs to make ends met. \u00a0By becoming a patron and adding your support of $1, $3, $5, etc. a month, this will afford me the opportunity to give more of my time to the projects like the graphic novel, \"The Sixth Age\",\u00a0\"The Man From Snowy River\", and other TOP SECRET projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor adding your monetary support, of whatever amount,\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI will automatically enroll you in a monthly drawing for a limited edition print from the featured artwork from that month\u003c/strong\u003e (as a thank you because of how awesome your support is)\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u00a0As a community goal to kick off this monthly drawing we need at least \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e50 Patrons.\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0So start sharing your support on the web, to your fellow geeks, and who ever else you can think of! \u00a0Scroll down to view the other rewards as a \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e for helping me get these projects off the ground.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne more thing, to view the artwork in progress go to \u003ca href=\"http://www.thesixthage.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.thesixthage.com\u003c/a\u003e"

As an illustrator by night and a designer by day, I find it to be an exciting task to be a part of the whole production process. From a young age I have always wanted to be involved in all aspects of the creative process without being just a part of an assembly line.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e",
