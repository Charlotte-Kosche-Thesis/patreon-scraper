You may know me \nfrom such productions as ELR, The Instance, Filmsack, The Morning \nStream, This Week in Trek, or Grumpycast.\u00a0 Most\n of these, I am still involved with.  I do them for free, and I truly \nhope you enjoy them...  but there is a cost associated with each and \nevery one of them - some more than others.\u00a0 I\u0027m also busy making phasers, ray guns, and other props to sell, but there are startup costs involved with these projects as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI put time into looking up Trek \nConnections for Filmsack.  I often refer to a \"Trek Connection Machine\",\n but of course there really is no machine.  It\u0027s all just me going \nthrough a time consuming process.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e For the Morning Stream, I\n research end-of-segment questions to ask Scott \u0026amp; Brian, and \nlengthen my workday to make time for the Stump a Trek Nerd segment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eBy far, the\n most labor intensive Task I have, is writing every episode of This Week\n in Trek, and capturing and editing clips.  This all takes a minimum of 3\n hours per week.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eGrumpycast takes a minimum of time \nto prepare for, but there is still time involved in creating the notes, \nediting audio, and recording \u0026amp; publishing the podcast.  We would \nlove to expand this to a weekly show, but it needs to become worth our while \nto do so.\u00a0 I own the domain name grumpycast.com, but have had no time to do anything with it.\u00a0 Given the funds, we could do so much more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eCreating replica phasers and ray guns fills up \nthe rest of my time.  While I enjoy making \u0026amp; selling them, the\n cost of labor is high.  This can be brought down with your support.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003ePodcasting\n may seem like a low cost activity on the surface, but there are regular\n expenses such as hosting for both the podcasts and web sites.  In fact,\n I am cutting corners so severely that there are no web sites for \nGrumpycast, or my prop-building at all.  I can\u0027t even tell you our \nnumbers for Grumpycast because I can\u0027t invest in the infrastructure \nneeded to keep track of listenership.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e  \nEquipment always breaks down sooner or later, and I have no backups.  No\n mixer.  No mics.  No backup drives. No nothing.  If anything goes out, I\u0027m sunk.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo\n you see, I really do need support. And at higher levels of support, I \ncould bring you more podcasts, lower cost props, and if anything happens\n with my equipment, I could replace it if needed without interruption.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
