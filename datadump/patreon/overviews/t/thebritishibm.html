The band has been around since 2012, played lots of gigs, recorded 2 albums and had music used in various retro gaming related projects such as the \u0027From Bedrooms to Billions\u0027 documentaries, various YouTube channels and even some video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe band generally runs at a loss due to the amount of money it costs to record music, make music videos (the decent ones at least), distribute music, host a website, drive to gigs, stay in hotels, book rehearsal rooms and all the other fun stuff that\u0027s required to do what we do. Which is all well and good as, like I said, it is a labour of love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut! It would be cool to have a few coins coming in to help out and to make recording and playing live a bit easier and something that could happen more often.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eGood question! Well imagine not having to wait three or more years between albums, that would be pretty cool right? Of course it would! We could be creative in a slightly more iterative way, recording songs throughout the year for you to listen to as soon as they\u0027re ready. We can give you access to behind the scenes antics, lyrics, demos, stream live performances and anything else that we can think of if things progress and the interest is there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know there are a few dedicated British IBM fans out there that send us nice emails, buy merch and help out from time to time, so hopefully this will be something that a few of you will be interested in and if it is then we promise to make it worth your while!\u003cbr\u003e"
