    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eThe Short Story of the Blog\u003c/h2\u003eHi- I\u2019m Devon Bowker, ardent naturalist, sci-fi fanatic, science writer, and curator of geekery. I have a degree in Wildlife Biology and am currently working towards achieving licensure to teach Life Science for grades 9-12. I started The Wild Life in January of 2017 as a place to blog about natural history, earth science, biodiversity, extraordinary discoveries, and the amazing lives of this planets inhabitants. In time, the goal is for this project to become so much more with \u003ca href=\"https://thewildlife.blog/the-podcast/\"\u003epodcasts\u003c/a\u003e, original videos, \u003ca href=\"https://thewildlife.blog/wtff/\"\u003eID help\u003c/a\u003e, and the \u003ca href=\"https://thewildlife.blog/the-hiking-club/\"\u003eTWL Hiking Club\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI invite you to stick around with me to explore, learn about, and discover the wonders, curiosities, and badassery of life on Earth. We\u2019ve only got one life. Make it a wild one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re interested in hiring me for a naturalist program, guided hike, as a freelance writer, or if you\u2019re interested in having me as a guest blogger, contact me at devonlbowker@gmail.com.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Not So Short Story\u003c/h2\u003eThere are \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/science/30species.html\"\u003e8.7 million species in the world\u003c/a\u003e, give or take 1.3 million, most of which are yet to be discovered. Broken down in easy to interpret chunks, three-quarters of those species live on land with the other quarter living in the water. I find that especially odd considering the water-land ratio of earth is pretty much the exact opposite. If we were to break that down a little bit more, we\u2019d find that there are 7.8m species of animal, 298,000 species of plant, 611,000 species of mushrooms, mold and other fungi, around 36,400 species of protozoa and single-celled organisms, and 27,500 species of algae or chromists. Mammals, of which we are, only make up around 5,400 of that. At least that\u2019s around how many have been recorded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy point in all this is that if I were to try to write about 1 species a day, it would take me about 15 years just to get through the mammals alone. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e15 years! \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBut you know what? I\u2019m going to do as much as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo go camping, to go to museums, naturalist programs, state parks, college, all of these places, is a tremendous privilege. Certainly not one that everyone gets to enjoy. Money, time, geographic location, physical ability, you name it. Lots of things play a contributing role in what I call the ever-widening nature accessibility gap. My goal is to lessen that gap by bringing the natural world into the virtual world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMy Story\u003c/h2\u003eGrowing up, my idols weren\u2019t athletes and movie stars. They were scientists and naturalist like Steve Irwin, Jane Goodall, and David Attenborough. I had an obsession with taste testing plants around my bus stop and yard, with a surprisingly lucky streak; binders full of animal fact sheets; and an endless curiosity for the outdoors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat should have been an obvious career choice alluded me until 2015, when Heather Millar and Kathy Gardener of \u003ca href=\"http://www.abnc.org/\"\u003eArmand Bayou Nature Center\u003c/a\u003e took a chance on me, putting me in the role of an Outdoor Educator. I fell in love, found my passion, and suddenly realized that it had always been what I wanted to do with my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I have worked as a Park Ranger and Interpretive Naturalist, finished a bachelor\u2019s degree in wildlife biology, and have spent a lot of time honing my method and style as a naturalist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently live in central Minnesota with my wife and son who is almost 18 months at the time that I write this. We spend a lot of time outdoors and at state parks hiking, taking pictures, birding, and enjoying the nature around us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a member of The Wildlife Society, the American Society of Naturalists, and the Ecological Society of America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dream of a day when The Wild Life becomes more than something I do in whatever free time I can scrounge up, and instead becomes something more akin to a lifestyle. If you are reading this, I want to take this chance to say with the deepest, and sincerest gratitude, thank you for helping make that dream a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Podcast\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Wild Life is a show that embraces curiosity, answers your questions, and reveals exciting discoveries through humor, story-telling, and interviews with leading experts.\u003c/h3\u003eThe Wild Life is hosted by brothers Devon and Richard Bowker. Here\u2019s what to expect: we\u2019ll start off each episode with the latest wildlife related news and discoveries, answer a question from our listeners \u2014 anything from \u201cwhat\u2019s up with worms?\u201d to \u201chow are snakes so fast?\u201d, or \u201chow come penguins can\u2019t fly but Porgs can?!\u201d \u2014 with the help of an expert, and blow your minds as we explore an entire planets worth of wildlife, natural history, and stories behind amazing discoveries and the fascinating people who make them. We\u2019ll end each episode with a new \u201cAnimal Sound of the Week\u201d.
