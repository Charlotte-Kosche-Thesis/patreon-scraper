    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWinter 2015: Alex Brown and Rebecca Mahoney came up with an idea for a podcast that had monsters, secret words, and a quest for answers. After a few months of deliberation, they shifted direction to create a whole \u003cem\u003enew\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0podcast that involved...monsters, secret words, and multiple quests for answers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis time, though, the setting was a bridge that spanned the Atlantic Ocean - and thus, the adventure began.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to July 2016: We launched The Bridge Podcast, and released the first half of season one every other week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, we\u0027re excited to bring the rest of season one, and more future season as well! Your donations will help ensure that our tale on the Transcontinental Bridge can continue!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting our Patreon, and for thinking about donating to our show. You\u0027ve all been so amazing, and we couldn\u0027t ask for better fans!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-----------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s an alternate 2016, and Watchtower 10 sits in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, keeping lonely watch over the Transcontinental Bridge. Each watchtower sits hundreds of feet away from the Bridge, broadcasting regular traffic reports to ensure that proper safety precautions are taken. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese lighthouses (for cars) are filled with a carefully selected (and very capable) crew.\u003cbr\u003eWatchtower 10\u0027s necessary personnel happen to be: a generalist DJ who spends her free time relaying folklore from abandoned parts of the Bridge, her supervisor (who\u0027s only there because he lost a bet), an unfailingly optimistic Bridge Travel Agent, and a groundskeeper who has a thing for romantic comedies.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eUnbeknownst to the general public (but totally knownst to each watchtower\u0027s crew), these stations also hold a secret that could potentially destroy the world...or save it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Bridge is a fictional serialized fantasy podcast about the monsters we fear, the monsters we can become, and the stories we leave behind.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*we\u0027d like to thank Molly Woodworth and Eliza Gray for creating our logo and banner, respectively!*"
