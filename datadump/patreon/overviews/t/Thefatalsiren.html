For the LOVE of the characters!\u00a0 I grew up performing on stage; mostly musical theatre.\u00a0 It is so much fun dressing up and becoming a character that you admire or with you could be like.\u00a0 I stopped for a few years but when I came back, I cosplayed Black Widow.\u00a0 It was so much fun and I met some amazing people.\u00a0 After a couple years, I started doing much more detailed work like armored Poison Ivy and other mash-ups.\u00a0 My next one I hope to have finished is my armored Pokemon Evee.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnother BIG reason I cosplay is because I have found that it is a big hit with kids.\u00a0 I love doing charity work and some of things I have been able to do as a cosplayer is go to hospitals and visit children.\u00a0 I cannot begin to describe how amazing it feels when you walk into a room and see that child\u0027s face light up.\u00a0 A face that probably hasn\u0027t been able to leave the bed of that room for some time.\u00a0 Or the feeling when a child runs up and gives you a big hug and says that you are their hero.\u00a0 It\u0027s indescribable.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to take my cosplays to the next level and this is where I hope you can all help me.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo why choose Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, this service is extremely helpful in allowing people who have asked to donate or support me in this process.\u00a0 It allows me to get to know you better on a more personal level and you get to see my progress and enjoy some benefits that others would not!\u00a0 Patreon also allows me to keep close track of who has helped and suggestions/feedback on anything I post.\u00a0 I love getting to know people and this service is the perfect way to keep in touch with all of you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am hoping that with your assistance I can continue to improve my cosplay and also do more modeling.\u00a0 Your assistance will allow me to set up better photo shoots, fund my cosplay, which will allow me to cover more conventions outside of California and Las Vegas.\u00a0 It will also allow me to give back to the community by sharing my cosplays with others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would like to close this by saying THANK YOU for taking the time to read this and get to know me.\u00a0 I am eternally grateful for the support I have gotten over the years and I hope to bring smiles to all of your beautiful faces!\u00a0 I cannot begin to tell you how much you all mean to me (even if we haven\u0027t met).\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd don\u0027t forget!\u00a0 If there is something you would like to see or want me to make, let me know.\u00a0 I plan on doing some video tutorials, which can be helpful.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
