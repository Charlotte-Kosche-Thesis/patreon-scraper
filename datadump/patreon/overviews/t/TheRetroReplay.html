That seems to be the norm nowadays, gotta do a Patreon because I swear YouTube is ripping me off when it comes to ad revenue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been doing game reviews on YouTube since 2011, I give detailed, honest and fair reviews on games (so I\u0027m told) and have recently been including a new series of videos based around the going-ons of the gaming industry and culture around it called Retro Rants. Currently these series are biweekly, alternating between each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost I\u0027m setting this up as a tip jar service, you don\u0027t have to give if you don\u0027t want to, secondly, I have no rewards planned at all so if that\u0027s a deal breaker for you, sorry, but I don\u0027t want people to feel like they have to or are being pressured into giving money to this to get everything. The \"rewards\" would be the new content that this Patreon would be supporting, like making Let\u0027s Plays and the Back Log regular things instead of when I feel like it. It would also bring reviews and rants to a weekly basis if the goals are met.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo I have high hopes for those goals getting met? The honest answer is no, I\u0027m keeping my feet firmly grounded in reality and I would consider it luck to even reach the first goal.\u003cbr\u003e"
