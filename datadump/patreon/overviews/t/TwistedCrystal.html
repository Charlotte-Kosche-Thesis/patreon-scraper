While I will focus more on making my website easy to use, and my games as polished and fun as I possibly can, Patreon will take care of getting the support from you, and giving you rewards while I work on things.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This Patreon is on a monthly cycle. This is to help you all feel more comfortable to know that every month there will only be one charge to you. If you are new to Patreon, you can pledge a chosen amount of money (monthly for me) to my cause, and you will reap the benefits for that amount. You are charged when you sign up to this patreon, to protect me from people who attempt to \"reward steal\". On the right-hand side, it shows the different levels I have come up with. If you have any questions, you may send me a message on Facebook or Twitter, or even by my email \n\t\u003ca href=\"mailto:yftechno@twicry.com\"\u003eyftechno@twicry.com\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Unlike Patreon proper, I also have \u201cUnlockables\u201d which are things that will happen when something happens that is not based on how much I get monthly, but on some other metric.

It attempts to solve all the issues that can come up with running a game with rules that are addon\u2019s to the system to help build the world. And a very basic structure for characters that allows them to be completely flexible. Best part of this game, is that it is\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e!
