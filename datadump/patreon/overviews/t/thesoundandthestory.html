I\u0027d like to think I would have continued this podcast if no one had listened to it, but I know that\u0027s not the truth, and I know I\u0027m not a very good liar. So, thank you for being here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca\u003eThe Sound and the Story\u003c/a\u003e is a music podcast that discovers the stories inside and behind your favorite records. Did you know Weezer\u0027s \u003cem\u003ePinkerton\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is based on an opera? Did you know Brand New\u0027s \u003cem\u003eThe Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me \u003c/em\u003eis basically a gossipy scenester soap opera? Do you know what Bon Iver means when he sings...actually, do you know what Bon Iver is singing at all? The answers to these questions and many more are found within the episodes of \u003cem\u003eThe Sound and the Story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI\u0027m not going to whip out crazy tricks or flashy videos to convince you to become a patron--I know you\u0027re smarter than that. I want to keep this show free without having obnoxious ads. I want to keep spending hours researching, writing, recording, and editing. I want to bring you more and more albums. I want to create a new type of episode, the 7\" Single Series, that goes into one song by a lesser known artist (and maybe even an interview with that artist too). I want to make you playlists and I want to send you interesting emails about how I make the show. I can\u0027t do that without your support. It costs me time and money to put this show together and instead of going to advertisers, I\u0027m coming to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any of this new stuff sounds interesting to you, then let\u0027s do it. If not, the main podcast will always and forever be free. But I\u0027ve got some really cool things cooked up and I would love to share them with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest with you, I love this shit. I live and breathe it. I want do more of it and I\u0027d love if you could make that happen. Thank you for listening, thank you for reading, thank you for supporting. It means so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo,\u003cbr\u003edavid\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca\u003ethesoundandthestory.show\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
