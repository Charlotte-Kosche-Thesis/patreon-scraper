    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo hey, I can tell you\u0027re reading this, let me introduce myself better in case you don\u0027t know me enough yet!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027 s two things I love in this world and I\u0027ve been doing them as a hobby for a couple years now; one is playing minecraft, I think I don\u0027t need to describe how awesome this game is, the possibilities are just endless, and I will always put all my creativity into it to build contraptions that will make your in-game life easier.\u003cbr\u003eThe second thing is editing, creating visuals that activates that part of your brain that loves art and exquisite quality in every frame which conforms a video. Fine art, oh I have always loved those words, inspires me to pursue the best results in my visuals, and also applies to life in general, that is the only thing that makes a product stand over others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFREE CONTENT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my regular content, which will come more often now, will always be free, don\u0027t worry about that. The quality and the content itself will never be let down. By exclusive content on certain tiers I mean just some aditional stuff that could be useful to some that want to start or improve their content quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY A PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAds ruin videos, I would never like to put ads on them, those are distractive, put in top of a good percentage of the video total area, and you have to click them away all the time. I just want to give you the best experience possible without annoying you and ruining my content. [Take in count that some videos that pop ads, got them because copyright claims].\u003cbr\u003eSecond, priorities, as all in life things are not free, my editing software subscription is not cheap, and as it is not I have to find a way to pay for itself. For the past years I\u0027ve been paying it my own, I don\u0027t believe in piracy as others do, if the tool I use is delivering me good results, why would I take it for free; so yeah, it needs to be payed somehow, and the problem is, if I have to work in order to get my subscriptions up, I won\u0027t have enough time to actually use it, and that\u0027s what I recently noticed is actually happening, I just don\u0027t have enough time to spare since I have to get money from external sources which require that precious time. And hey, let\u0027s not talk about how expensive the hardware is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePATREON SERVERS\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCertain tiers [most of them] include access to either the creative or survival server, or both. This is a project that will start depending on the outcome from your support, we will organize it together to create an ideal space for you all where you can share your ideas, collaborate with others and improve your skills being surrounded with others. The survival server will start at the point where all of you agree with all parameters to make it good space to play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO HOW OFTEN WILL NEW VIDEOS COME?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s complicated to answer, but as soon as I get enough support they will get done very quickly, and that doesn\u0027t mean poor quality, the quality will never be let down, if possible I would like to improve over time and get new software with better capabilities in order to increase the overall quality of the results!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEXCLUSIVE CONTENT, WHAT\u0027S THAT ABOUT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, I would like to create an exclusive video a month to start with, then we will see how it goes, but, what will the videos be about? Most likely minecraft technical bits, helping with stuff requested by you, and mainly motion graphics tutorials in the same way, you request and I do my best to deliver. As said, I promise one video a month!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
