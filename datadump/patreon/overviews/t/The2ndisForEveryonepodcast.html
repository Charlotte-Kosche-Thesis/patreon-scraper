    "summary": "\u00a0Since February 2015 I have hosted, The 2nd is For Everyone: Diversity Shoots (2A4E),\u00a0 a 2nd amendment workshop in New Jersey that attacks the negative media narrative of the firearms owner. We bring firearms owners, people of all races, genders, sexual orientation and background\u00a0 (that may have never touched a gun) together with national and local 2nd Amendment advocacy groups at a gun range. We have giveaways and prizes along with food and drink. We educate people on firearms laws, anti-gun legislation, and tell them how they can fight for their civil right to keep and bear arms. I have NRA certified instructors on the range introducing people to different firearms in a safe and fun way and attendees are encouraged to allow strangers to fire their guns. New friendships are formed and people have been made politically aware at each of these events. We also have a website \u003ca href=\"http://diversityshoot.com/\"\u003eWWW.DIVERSITYSHOOT.COM\u003c/a\u003e along with our 2A4E podcast, that spreads the pro-civil rights message. Join us in this mission to grow the firearms fellowship, educate people on gun laws and destroy the negative stereotype of the American gun owner.\u003cbr\u003e"

I am also a firearms owner that was frustrated at being portrayed, by politicians and the media, as a terrible, uncaring monster that should have my civil rights infringed upon. I started \"The 2nd is for Everyone : Diversity Shoots \" to get people of all races, religions, genders, sexual orientation and backgrounds to learn about their civil right to keep and bear arms and how to be a 2nd Amendment advocate. We have grown from just hosting events to add a podcast to reach people no matter where they are and destroy the negative media driven narrative of firearms owners.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
