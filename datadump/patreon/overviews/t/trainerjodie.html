When I started as a creator, I thought I was doing it to become a part of the Geek and Sundry family. \u00a0It was only after\u00a0I didn\u0027t make it that I realized the real reason I applied was I wanted to join this YouTube community and become better. \u00a0A better creator, a better person, just overall better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I started training myself. \u00a0I would create things, a lot of things, and always try to add new techniques or ideas. \u00a0I screwed up a lot, which helped me to learn even more. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimultaneously, I was training my audience. \u00a0I would teach them about the things I love, help new creators better themselves, and get a little silly at times. \u00a0All of this convinced me that this is what I want to do with my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now, I\u0027ve started this Patreon page. \u00a0So what are you doing if you become my patron? Well, you\u0027re basically saying you want to help me better myself and others. \u00a0You\u0027re helping me to improve my content to a level I can\u0027t achieve on my own, and to give me tools to help others I wouldn\u0027t have access to without your help. \u00a0Or you may just really enjoy me being silly. \u00a0Which is awesome too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to continue doing this until I physically can\u0027t continue, but with your help I can get to new levels and achieve great things that are simply out of my reach. \u00a0So, when do you want to start?"
