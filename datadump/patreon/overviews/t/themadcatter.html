This is my vacation you see, normally I\u0027m an abstract chaotic boogeyman of sorts, but every so often I like to inhabit one of your poor meatsacks and indulge myself in earthly delights. While other aspects of my decadence are irrelevant to what I\u0027m doing here, one of my favorite things is telling stories. What kind of stories you ask? Well, horror stories for one, as well as dark faerie tales, creepypasta, and weird fiction. All while sipping tea of some variety or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat am I doing?\u003c/h3\u003eTelling stories! Obviously. Oh! You mean in what way? Well, I was going to start off with a video series, but that is on hiatus as I am awaiting the acquisition of a new camera, what I have been doing with some regularity for the past couple months, however, is produce a podcast. Of course, I\u0027m a decadent creature, which means I want so much more...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat am I planning?\u003c/h3\u003eWell, I can keep doing what I\u0027m doing, but frankly, I want to do better than that! I want to get custom music, art, purrrhaps a new video camera so I can produce episodes on YouTube again. I\u0027d love to get more equipment, perhaps even merchandise, maybe even start a few smaller web drama podcasts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat do you want from me?\u003c/h3\u003eIf you can spare it, I\u0027d love a donation! Currently everything I am doing with this is coming out of my meager pockets, I\u0027d love to get this podcast to a point to where it\u0027s self sustaining, and beyond that, to a point where it is making enough that I can improve it without cutting too deeply in the wine bud... er, tea budget! $1, $2, $5 dollar donations are listed here on Patreon, and I might expand those further as time goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat do you get out of it?\u003c/h3\u003eFor the sake of simplicity, we\u0027re going to assume I\u0027m rhetorically asking that question of you: All subscribers get access to any past episodes I revise and reproduce for better quality. I won\u0027t be able to republish the episode, but I can at least provide a better experience for those who wish to listen again. Also, as I tend to complete my episodes earlier in the week, I\u0027ll provide access and MP3 downloads to episodes once they are complete, rather than having everyone wait until Saturday. In addition, I\u0027d love to take a page from Chilling Tales for Dark Nights and host a live reading via google hangouts, once a month. I\u0027ll come up with more perks as time goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eNo, seriously, what do you get out of it?\u003c/h3\u003eMoney, of course, hosting and producing these things isn\u0027t free, and while I\u0027ll continue doing this as a labor of love, I would like to offset the costs a little while also getting a bit extra so that I can improve the podcast and expand into other projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eCan you untie me now?\u003c/h3\u003eOh I suppose. You wouldn\u0027t be able to donate if I kept you trussed up here in my basement now, could I? That and dealing with providing kidnapping demands is far too tedious, and requires far too much effort, for far too little payoff. You may leave with all your limbs intact as well, can\u0027t say I\u0027m not terribly generous!"
