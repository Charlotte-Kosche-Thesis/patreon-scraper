My name is Jon, creator of the YouTube channel, \"Toy Bounty Hunters\". In 2011, my brother and I, Manny, decided to follow our passion for toys, video games, and tokusatsu, by creating video content. As lifelong Geeks and Gamers, we\u0027ve always been fascinated with history and the flow of information regarding the things that we like, so we figured why not share that with others? In 2015, my good friend, James, joined the party, and the quality of our work has grown substantially, but we continue to strive for improvement!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What We Do\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve worked on several different projects.
