    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eBlossoms for the May Queen\u003c/em\u003e was originally a novella that was\n published a couple years ago as part of an anthology. I received a \ngreat deal of positive feedback from readers as well as my publisher and\n editor. There is much more to tell about these characters, and I would \nlove to turn the story into a novel. So what is \u003cem\u003eBlossoms for the May Queen\u003c/em\u003e about? Quite simply it is \nthe story of a journey through a year of growth and discovery for a \ncouple thrown together unexpectedly by fate. It is also the story of the\n people they love and the community in which they live who share in this\n magical journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, what I need is the funds for a publicist as\n well as some funds to help me take time to finish writing without the \neternal distraction of work stresses. Since I am not likely to win the \nlottery, I figured maybe I could crowdfund this novel and the fees that I\n need for getting myself established as an author.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in: Patreon allows folks to become Patrons of the Arts by donating money to fund creative projects such as my novel. Patrons commit to donating $1, $5, $whatever, per chapter that I write of this novel. When I reach my base goal, which is $50 per chapter, I will post the first chapter of the story. I will continue posting each chapter I write from that point forward (no more than once a week, so no one\u0027s budget gets too stretched and so I don\u0027t lose my mind writing).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what happens if my goal gets met?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will get one chapter per week of this story until it is completed. My novel is being done as nine large sections with many chapters in each section. At the rate things are going, the novel will likely take 6 to 9 months to complete, so you can use that as a guide for how much you feel comfortable donating. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone who donates to the project will receive a free ebook version of it when it is completed. If anyone does something amazing and contributes $25 or more per chapter, they will get a free signed paperback copy of the book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
