    "summary": "Hi we are Antoine and Kanicia from Two People in Spain. We want to thank you for your continued support by visiting our blog regularly and sharing our adventure with us. This blog has been a creative outlet for us to share our experiences and help others to reach their goals. We started this blog before we moved to Spain from the United States in 2013. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then it has evolved from a way to keep in touch with family and friends to a way to share our story with those who want to hear it. We moved to Spain to expand our volunteer education work and it has been both amazing and challenging at the same time. So why did we join Patreon. Glad you asked!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to be able to give back even more which is why we joined Patreon. We have a lot of ideas for this blog that we know you will love so we thank you for your support so that we can make them a reality! Over time this blog has evolved from a resource to learn about ways to support yourself in another country to a place to learn about the experiences that one goes through when they move abroad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to be able to increase the quality of our blog posts and share more value. We also want to share more of our experiences through photos and video in higher quality. Running a blog takes time and money. Some of the things that come to mind are website hosting, writing posts, editing, reaching out to partners and the list goes on. We have given back a lot of value over the years and we are happy to be able to do so. We wanted to create a way for our readers to support our blog and help make it even better. So in summary this is why we are on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisit our blog at \u003ca href=\"http://www.twopeopleinspain.com.\"\u003ewww.twopeopleinspain.com.\u003c/a\u003e"
