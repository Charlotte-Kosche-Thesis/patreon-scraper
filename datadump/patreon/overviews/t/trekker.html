Meanwhile, please do keep in mind that whether \nyou pledge $1 per month, $5 per month $10 per month or any other amount,\n one new Trekker page is available each Monday on the website.

He\u0027s been plying his pencils and brushes ever since, and along the way he created Trekker, his signature comics work. He lives in Portland where he spends as much time as humanly possible drawing Trekker stories while listening to records (large, flat vinyl things) on his vintage Dual turntable through the same speakers he bought in 1985. His beautiful wife is occasionally able to drag him out into the world , and as a founding member of Periscope Studio he also finds himself spending a deal of quality time with many of the most vibrant and creative cartoonists working in the field today.\u003cbr\u003e",
