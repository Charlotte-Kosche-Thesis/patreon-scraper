    "summary": "Hey Now Cabalists! The Founders have been producing the The\nSecret Cabal Gaming Podcast for over three years now and have poured their\nblood, sweat and tears into this labor of love. We have been more successful\nthan we could ever have imagined and feel it\u0027s time to step it up. To date we\nhave funded the show nearly entirely out of pocket and with the help of\nsponsorship. Currently our sponsors solely cover the hosting of the podcast and\nprize support for the show (all those prizes we give out throughout the year)\nand the rest comes from our wallets. With your help, we\u0027d like to make some\nchanges and upgrades that will only make the show better. We\u0027d like to do more\nshows and provide different kinds of content, upgrade our equipment and\nsoftware, help with our convention travel costs, costs of hosting those meet up\nparties we do at conventions, and having more petty cash for prizes and\ngiveaways, making pint glasses, badge ribbons, dice and more swag! Man, we could do so many cool things, but cool things take money and that\u0027s where you guys come in. Patreon is a great way for us to continue producing the show while\nensuring that not only will our current show\u0027s content stay exactly the same,\nbut we can improve it (potentially but not limited to fewer advertisements) and\nallow us to give you guys more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the left you\u0027ll see that we have some milestones. Those are just some of the initial things we\u0027d like to do but it doesnt end there. In addition to adding the \"Fifth Wednesday Show\", 2015 will be a great year. We have some cool stuff simmering on the stove.\u003cbr\u003e"
