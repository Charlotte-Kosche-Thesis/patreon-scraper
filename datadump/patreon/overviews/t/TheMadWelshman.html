    "summary": "(2016 Edit: Yeah, now things are definitely full time, and I need your support to pay the bills. Thanks to those who\u0027ve supported so far!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, my name is Jamie Durbin. Some folks call me The Mad Welshman, some folks call me JamieTheD. I\u0027m a 33 year old dude, living in the darkest wilds of Wales, and I love gaming, writing, singing, digital art, and I dabble in a few other things. I\u0027ve been gaming since... Well, put it like this: My first ever game was Rogue, on an IBM Terminal, and my first ever home system was the BBC Micro B. I\u0027ve been a reviewer at a couple of places before, but people keep telling me things about a thing I enjoy doing, namely\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://themadwelshman.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewriting about games, gaming history, game design, and game culture\u003c/a\u003e. (That\u0027s the link to The Mad Welshman, where my current reviews are, by the way.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Oh, it really doesn\u0027t pay the bills.\"\u003cbr\u003e\"Oh, it\u0027s not a \u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0job!\"\u003cbr\u003e\"You can\u0027t know how to score an open-world RPG in \u003cem\u003eonly\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e26 hours of play!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, you might be wondering right now: \u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I give this guy money for his writing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, first off, I have previous experience. First with a small site called Gamerfill (Sadly defunct, but you can find some of my oldest video review content\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj7ewtlN55c\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e), then with a canadian place called Game-Boyz (Where I wrote both reviews and op-ed posts. The site appears to be breaking down, so I\u0027ll be placing a reprint on the Mad Welshman with proper attribution). I also never really \u003cem\u003estopped\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0writing or recording vids, as I also do Let\u0027s Plays (That\u0027s talkin\u0027 over videogames)\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/JayLPsShiz\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, and have a small\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://madwelshgoon.blogspot.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e to which I added content every now and again (Again, some of which will be redrafted and reprinted on the site).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProblem is, I can\u0027t review or write just for love and fistbumps. Even just reviewing games, let alone writing about the culture, history, and design around them is stressful work, and, make no mistake, it \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0work. Fact-checking, dealing with PR folks, getting review copy... Dealing with that segment of readers whose \u003cem\u003enicest\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0comment is \"You suck, go die in a fire!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs anyone can tell you, even writing is stressful. So love and fistbumps only go so far, I want to be able to pay my bills doing this, and you can help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s Very Simple\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe more I collectively get a month, the more content I can have time to create. There are some milestones, noted on the right, and the real humdingers are the part where my monthly income switches me from my current \"definitely unemployed\" state to \"This man is self employed enough that we\u0027re going to give him \u003cem\u003emore paperwork\u003c/em\u003e.\" I\u0027d like to hit that one especially, and pass that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I said it was very simple, didn\u0027t I? There are some caveats, but they\u0027re for any developers, publishers, and PR Folk who have read my work, and liked it enough to contribute: If you are staff of one of these, please declare it to me via the work email, and limit your donation to \u00a320/month. Not that I \u003cem\u003eexpect\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0anyone to donate \u00a320/month, but that\u0027s what I would define as \"significant investment\" as far as conflict of interest goes, and any higher than that, I\u0027d have to declare it on a review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose sorts of declarations on a review aren\u0027t terribly helpful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, regardless of whether you, personally donate or not, there\u0027ll be a minimum of four articles a month, mostly reviews, but there will be musings on the state of the industry, on past games, on game design... It varies. No review will have a score. I want that out the way right now, I don\u0027t find them helpful, and I do summarise my thoughts at the end of a review. At least one of these a month (Starting from the second month of operation) will be a sort of \"Forum\" post, where I tie together some of the comment emails I\u0027ve gotten into a coherent theme, usually arguing for or against either a game or something in one of the previous month\u0027s articles (Although obviously, this depends on you getting in touch!). The more I end up making, the more content I can devote my time to, and the more the scope of the site will spread.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuture possibilities include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA Podcast.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSupplementary video content.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCovering some of those shiny events where we all share games. Y\u0027know, like Eurogamer and the like.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGuest Articles: It\u0027s important to get other perspectives, and guest articles would do exactly that. But I do want to pay whoever writes for their work.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s only one real, physical reward you\u0027d get, and that\u0027s at the $15/month mark. Sorry, but reviewing and making videos takes a lot of time, and the only thing I can really give back beyond the work I\u0027m being paid for by you is a digital art print (A thing that also takes time to do well).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs stated, I also do Let\u0027s Plays, and if you like those, as opposed to the reviewing, I\u0027m certainly not going to stop you donating to this Patreon for those!"
