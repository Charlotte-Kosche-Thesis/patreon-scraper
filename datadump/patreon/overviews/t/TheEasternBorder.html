I live in Riga, Latvia, I have a master\u2019s degree in western philosophy from the University of Latvia (and I\u2019m working on my PhD), and The Eastern Border is my podcast about the life in and the history of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in general. I explain the other side of the cold war - using both historical sources and the stories of the people who lived there. I talk about how it really was like, to live in the USSR, and while doing this, I preserve the stories of those common folk that won\u0027t make it in the history books. We have lots of dark humor, tragic events and real human suffering. Questions about identity, responsibility and the value of human life. We have strangeness and paradoxes. That is The Eastern Border. Enjoy your stay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are also a part of the Dark Myths network, which assures our quality."
