The work focuses on both the Inner Game and Outer Game of overcoming a life of suffering and lack.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Inner Game \u003c/strong\u003ework is about mindset liberation, learning to see oneself without the limiting, negative filters that have been trained into many people. It is also about learning how to master one\u0027s emotions and adopt new perspectives at the leading edge of thought.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Outer Game\u003c/strong\u003e work is about how this economic system works. It is focused on step-by-step, exercise-based training for both entrepreneurs and career-track professionals, and those who wish to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrograms are currently organized into 3 primary offerings that move people from where they are at the point of first connection with The Winning Start, to the point where they are ready to do the deeper work of the training program.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eSisters Manifesting Destiny\u003c/strong\u003e social media page, which introduces people to the liberated perspective of The Winning Start in a non-threatening manner. (This is a motivational \"easy\" point of entry for those new to the incorporation of a psycho-spiritual approach to success.) Currently serving 3,298; goal of 10,000\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003ePeople of Color Manifesting Destiny\u003c/strong\u003e group, which provides a supportive community container for practicing a new way of living and learning from others doing the same. (This step helps people \"get ready to be ready\" to actually do the hard work of self-mastery.) Currently serving 1,162; goal of 3,000\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Destiny Accelerator\u003c/strong\u003e training program, which provides in-depth psychological and business/career training to those ready to commit to mastering both their Inner and Outer Games of thriving as a person from a family that\u0027s experienced generational persecution. (This is the primary focus of everything that leads up to this point, to get folks the training and support they need to create real change in their lives.) Currently serving 20; goal of 100\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI plan to also add a website with a blog to reach even more people and provide another way for people to learn and connect to those they can grow with. With your help that will be possible, and that is a big part of my second campaign goal.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eThe Evolution of the Work\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nI\u0027ve been doing service projects for decades now. I\u0027ve spearheaded the building of a land trust community for Native Hawaiians. Taught meditation to incarcerated teenagers. Served on the boards of various non-profits, and so on. Each time I was motivated by a desire to help create a world of economic justice and personal liberation for all, regardless of the family histories that denied us access to that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut this one, this one came to me through my spiritual connection to my late grandmother. When I was going through a difficult period of adjustment to the new political reality in America following the 2016 elections, I connected with my ancestral line in a completely new way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn deep meditation and prayer with my half-African/half-Cherokee grandmother, I saw for the first time how the family had had to adapt to oppressive circumstances just to survive. I also saw how those adaptations were still destructively holding sway over our family even now, though the laws no longer codify our oppression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDrawing upon the combination of my Masters in Counseling Psychology and years of related experience and the fruits of that meditative inquiry, my work with The Winning Start was thus born. Just as the material that I developed then helped me unwind those dysfunctional patterns in myself and my family, I have now organized it to teach other descendants of persecution to do the same for themselves and their families. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI hope you will join me in supporting this important work to whatever extent you are able. Thank you in advance from my heart to yours.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBelow you\u0027ll see sample posts of content from The Winning Start programs.

I\u0027ve spearheaded the building of a land trust community for Native Hawaiians. Taught meditation to incarcerated teenagers. Drawn the non-violence community together for Occupy Oakland. And so on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBut this one...\u00a0This one...\u003cbr\u003eThis one came to me through my spiritual connection to my late grandmother. I\u0027ll leave out the details for the sake of brevity, but essentially when I was going through a difficult period of adjustment to the new political reality in America following the 2016 elections I connected with my ancestors in a completely new way.\u003cbr\u003eBefore that I was very spiritual, and actually I have been channeling since 1999. Yet oddly, I simply did not believe in ancestral connection as spiritual connection. I thought of our connection as being a matter of the body, so that once the body was gone, so was the connection to anything other than memories. I never imagined the possibility that relationships might continue after death, simply in a new form, and that there was a reason for them to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYet at that time, it was my grandmother who came to me to provide the insight, perspective and healing I needed to not only find peace within my disillusionment, but help others to do the same. She showed me the family legacy of persecution and successful adaptations to that persecution going back many generations, back to people I\u0027d never even heard of before. Some were enslaved Africans. Others were Native Americans. All were there for me, connected to me through her. I saw how those adaptations, though necessary for each of them to make to survive at the time, were still holding sway over our family, only now with a destructive influence.\u003cbr\u003eMy work with The Winning Start was thus born, as I learned to unwind those patterns in myself and my family, and then to teach other descendents of persecution to do the same.\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will join me in supporting this important work.",
