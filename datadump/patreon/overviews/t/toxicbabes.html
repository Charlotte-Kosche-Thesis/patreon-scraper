I will draw the characters, build them in 3D, animate them and make them come alive in the Unity3d game engine so that you guys can walk through an evironment with the Toxic Babes and hunt down monsters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there is enough support even a fully developed game could be possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what are the Toxic Babes? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://toxic-babes.com/pct/ToxicBabes_TradingCards.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe original Toxic Babes were a \u003cstrong\u003etrading card set\u003c/strong\u003e and a screensaver presented at the San Diego Comic Con at the end of the 1990s for several years in a row. It was the time when Image Comics was founded and creator-owned comics were the big thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://toxic-babes.com/pct/ToxCoverFree_RGB.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was also the time of \"flashy graphics over substance\" in comics.\u003cbr\u003eWe were at the booth of Amok Productions/ Edition Quasimodo and tremendously enjoyed the wonderful creative atmosphere of the con.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe concept of the Toxic babes is pretty simple, exploitative, trashy and fully in the spirit of the time it was created in:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine a world where a virus or a poison of some sort has turned all the males into monsters. A handful of beautiful female survivors are fighting for survival in this toxic world. For unknown reasons these females prefer to wear skimpy outfits and look really sexy while surviving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://toxic-babes.com/pct/ToxicBabes_TradingCards2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs simple as it is, Toxic Babes would work wonderfully as a\u00a0\u00a03rd person shooter computer game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to design the new Toxic Babes in collaboration with you patrons.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to collect your input, comicbook-fantasies, weapon and monster ideas and weird fetishes and merge them into fresh designs for the next generation of interactive Toxic Babes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://toxic-babes.com/pct/Patreon_Chart_Process.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I will build the characters and monsters in 3d\u00a0one after the other and program them to make them run around in an environment in the Unity3d game engine. Next step I will program it so that the girls can hunt down the monsters (and the monsters can attack the girls).\u003cbr\u003eI have all the necessary skills it takes for this step and also own a Unity Pro licence so the look of the game can make use of all the fantastic tools of the engine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://toxic-babes.com/pct/OWuensch_GameModel1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://toxic-babes.com/pct/OWuensch_GameModel2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://toxic-babes.com/pct/ToxicBabes_TestGameCharacter01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://toxic-babes.com/pct/ToxicBabes_TestGameCharacter02.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you think it would be fun to take part in the creation process or just watch the Toxic Babes come alive, support me here on patreon.com and enjoy the ride.\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your interest.\u003cbr\u003eYours,\u003cbr\u003eOliver"
