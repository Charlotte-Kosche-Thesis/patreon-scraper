As I\u2019ve experienced different types of mental health illnesses, and am still living with them, I find that it\u2019s extremely difficult to socialise or sometimes even go out into the world. By knowing that there are people out there who understand me, and can help me it makes me feel a lot secure and I know that I am not the only one who feels like that!\u003cbr\u003eAs well as posting other people stories, I am also here to post any helpful links, quotes, stories that have helped me and still are helping me through my journey with mental illness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://thisiswhatapersonwithmentalillnesslookslike.wordpress.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
