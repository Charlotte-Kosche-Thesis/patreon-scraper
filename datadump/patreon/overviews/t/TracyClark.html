Together, we grow happiness!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, who am I? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a published author with a passion for fictional stories and personal stories that uplift and inspire. I\u0027m a mother of two teens, a teacher, and the founder of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tracyclarkteamtlc.com/\"\u003eTeam TLC\u003c/a\u003e--a place that\u0027s all about building daily habits toward being your Highest Self. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy showing support on Patreon, you are helping in two ways:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027re supporting Writer Tracy!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is only thing I\u0027ve ever wanted to do. It\u0027s also the one thing I\u0027m most qualified to do. I feel that it\u0027s my calling and I\u0027m sure that the reason I write stories for young adults is because I have a deep need to connect with that age group in a way that lets them know they aren\u0027t alone. I needed that as a teen and hope I\u0027m giving that now. It\u0027s been one of the most meaningful experiences of my life to know that my published books are out in the world and enjoyed by readers. A dream come true!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGettin\u0027 real: I have to be honest with you though, the realities of making a living as a writer are harsh, y\u0027all. Even with four books out, I can\u0027t pay for my life with my writing. Not even close. Very few writers can. Even after having a foot in the door, you\u0027re not guaranteed to sell your next work. A book that you spend months/years on may never get picked up by a publisher. Ouch. Yet I keep creating because to not create is a death to my soul.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do other things, too, to make ends meet. Seasonal jobs. Freelance work. Whatever it takes. But my dream is to continue to write as much as I can. Your support ensures that great content can be created without fear and the burden on its back that it must sell to a publisher in order for me to, you know...eat.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027re supporting a movement--Team TLC--Transformational. Life. Courses.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is \"TLC Tracy\" in action. (Helps that it\u0027s also my initials!) Team TLC and my \"Total Life Course\"\u00a0began as a personal experiment during a time of frustration and darkness in my life that\u0027s resulted in a true passion for helping others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027ve been a writer for the last 7 years, I\u0027ve always been a self-help devotee. I seem to have an unending hunger for personal development and potential and probably own more books in this genre than any other. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring this time, when I was struggling in nearly every way, I soul-searched and came up with a 90-day \"reset\" to overhaul my life so that I could get back on track toward being the woman I dreamed of--the \u003cem\u003ebest\u003c/em\u003e version of me. The results were amazing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI soon realized that there are a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of people feeling the way I was and that I could help them do exactly what I did. Helping people for the win! I started a private\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/TeamTLCTotalLifeCourse/\"\u003eFacebook group\u003c/a\u003e, which I invite you to join. I\u0027m in the midst of writing my first nonfiction book about it and creating an online course. (I have lots of courses planned, including courses for writers!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a new and exciting endeavor and with your help, I\u0027ll be able to continue to work full time on this amazing project and community. I truly believe that change starts in the seat you\u0027re in and that the world can change for the better by being our best selves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to be able to write, create, mentor, help, and inspire and that\u0027s what your support will allow me to do.
