Because to settle means that we\u2019re not giving space for more underrepresented voices to be heard. Because to settle means that we\u0027re not disrupting bigger media platforms like they need to be. \u003cstrong\u003eBecause to settle means that \"diversity\" in media will always be a myth - never a reality. \u003c/strong\u003eWe always want to continue to grow and expand, whether it be upgrading website capacity, creating videos, developing podcasts, hiring team members, etc. We\u0027re a very small group and we tend to overextend ourselves both physically and monetarily, doing everything from covering breaking issues to to editing videos to building all our own designs in-house. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re here to make it possible for you to have the media you always wanted. \u003cstrong\u003eBut we need your support to do the work that we do \u2013 and provide space for voices to be heard, to be supported and to be empowered. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what we need! Will we get all we\u0027re asking for?
