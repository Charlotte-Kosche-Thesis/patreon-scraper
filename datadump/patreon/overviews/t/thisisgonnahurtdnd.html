We are a 5th Edition Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons podcast and we\u0027ve already got one season under our belts and we\u0027re excited for the rest!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love doing this, and we love interacting with people who like listening to us. However, running a podcast does come with some costs. From hosting the podcast itself to hosting a website as a central hub to equipment maintenance to editing time, it all adds up really fast. So we had an idea. We thought setting up a Patreon where you, the listeners, get some more access to the podcast and the people behind it while also helping the podcast remain funded would benefit everyone involved. We tried to think of the things we would want from a podcast we like to listen to, and we hope you like the rewards and goals we\u0027ve chosen. We\u0027ve even got plans for another podcast or two and some other awesome projects that we think everyone would enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything you can contribute to keep us going would be appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOwen, Jeremy, Craig, Steven and Alex\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
