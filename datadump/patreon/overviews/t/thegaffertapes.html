The help and love received from the community makes all the hard work worth it. \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThree years ago Tom, Craig and Ash set out to make the worlds best fantasy football podcast. Each show is a mix of comedy, footballing tips and chaotic nonsense. From humble beginnings, recording the show on an coffee table using an iPhone, the lads have come along way. Each week the show gets more and more popular, recently even scooping the coveted \u0027Best Football Podcast\u0027 award, at the Football Blogging Awards.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEach member of the cast brings their own unique style:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/556ad679e4b08ba26c0e01d7/t/55c206fce4b074f3e2168c9f/1438779132447/?format=300w\" style=\"float: left; width: 180px; margin: 15px 15px 15px 0px;\"\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCraig Hazell\u003c/h3\u003e\n\tCraig is a TV professional, writer and Heart of Midlothian fan whospecialises in 90s pop culture, puns and of course football.

He is a former top 100 ranked FPL player and is The Gaffer Tapes resident number cruncher.
