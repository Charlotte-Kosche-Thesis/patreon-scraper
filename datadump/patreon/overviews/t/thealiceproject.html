We started this last summer in July with Wide Awake, and plan to keep on going well into this summer.  At the end of our moon drops, we plan on releasing a vinyl album (if we have the funds) with all of the songs plus a very special video that combines all of our moon drops into one whole cohesive story.\nThis requires a tremendous amount of effort to do every month, and we have been lucky to have the support of our fans, family and friends as we have been tirelessly working to create these moon drops.  The purpose of this Patreon is to hopefully cover our filming costs and to also fund the vinyl pressing of The Thirteenth Album at the end of our release schedule.  Any amount you can give will help pave the way towards us being able to continue working so hard to get these Moon Drops in your hands.  Thank you!"

However, in\norder to make tangible pieces of art and to be able to tour, we need your\nsupport.  We are getting ready to record\nthe next AL1CE album, with the \u00a1Bash! acoustic album on deck next.  We would love to share our studio process\nwith you, as well as our creative process. \nCollaborative art is truly an art, and we will be sharing our continual\nevolution as we record these next albums and make our future ones.  Your support will make it possible for us to\npress physical copies of our albums, make various forms of merch, tour, make\nvideos, and ultimately help us tell the story of The Alice Project.
