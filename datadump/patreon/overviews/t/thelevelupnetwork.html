Many of you watched us grow from a gathering in a tiny basement apartment to an interactive talk show. However, we have aspirations to grow much bigger and thus we have created The Level Up Network and this Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Level Up Network\u00a0won\u0027t just be a network of shows, but also a network of friends/family all sharing in their favorite hobby. We love the gaming industry and we love talking with our fans, but there are many more out there that we want to bring into this wonderful community. We will continue to create entertaining and informative gaming content, but the desire is to go beyond that into other mediums as well. That\u0027s where YOU and Patreon come into the picture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur roots will always remain in gaming, but we would love to cover all forms of entertainment including movies, television, comics, and more! If you would like to help us in improving the network and helping us achieve our goals, please make a monthly donation. However, feel in no way obligated to do so. Our Patreon is meant more than anything to be a rewards club for the Level Uppers that have given us so much these past couple years. We want to give back!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLIVE EVERY SUNDAY (10 PM ET) AT\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://TWITCH.TV/THELEVELUPSHOW\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTWITCH.TV/THELEVELUPSHOW\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
