    "summary": "Not long ago we were a small but lucrative beef cattle operation.  We were raising cows, selling off bull calves and retaining heifers to continue to grow our herd.  We have always been lovers of animals.  Animals have been part of both our lives.  Growing up on a cattle ranch in central Florida I was very aware of the industry.  My father was a rancher and although he was a kind hearted man he saw cattle as nothing more than profit. This was his up bringing and his livelihood, I knew it was all he knew.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n     At our ranch, unlike traditional ranchers, we tried to be very selective about whom we sold our calves to.  We always wanted the best for them, hoping that the ones we sold would grow up to live their lives as herd bulls, adding great bloodlines to other herds.  During  this time we slowly began weaning ourselves off meat.  We did enjoy meat, however we were always questioning our choice to consume it. Since we were animal lovers how could we sell and consume beef, the same animals we loved?  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e     We then had a life altering experience. In our head we had rationalized that if we are going to consume meat, it must be our own. We made the decision to take an older cow to be slaughtered. That experience was the turning point in our lives.  It was one of the worst days of our lives, more so for my husband as he handled the whole process through a local packing facility.  Are hearts were broken, we thought for sure this was the way to do it if we were going to be consumers of beef.  We ended up giving most of the beef to friends and by some odd chance the freezer door did not seal and the remaining meat went bad.  We never looked back after that.  We swore off all meat as well as all animal products.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e     We officially had our last ham Christmas 2016.  Needless to say, We have never felt better or more healthy, both mentally and physically.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e     We choose to go forward in our lives not as consumers of animals but as ambassadors for them.  We turned our 100 acre ranch into a sanctuary.  We kept all the animals we had at the time and even bought back many that had been previously sold.  Our goal is to educate and bring awareness for the animals.  We believe every animal deserves the life it was given.  No animal wants to die, just as no human does.  Animals are amazing soulful creatures. They are all different and have unique personalities. They are intelligent, nurturing, loving, and down right funny.  They feel pain, loss, sadness, compassion, and even grieve the loss of another animal or family member.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e     We are so grateful to have the ability to surround ourselves with animals.  We encourage everyone to get out and visit your local sanctuary and make some animal friends!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e     Compassion goes a long way.  Be compassionate, consider making changes, big or small, in your everyday life that would provide a better life for an animal.  When we become aware and our eyes are open, it\u2019s easy to see how the smallest changes in lives could be worth a life to an animal.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are committed to rescuing and providing as many animals as humanly possible a forever loving home. \u00a0We are committed to being a voice for all the voiceless.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor every monthly donor we have, we are afforded \u00a0the ability to rescue, \u00a0rehab and provide forever homes to a variety of animals. The monthly donors allow us the ability to expand and grow. \u00a0We want to do as much for the animals as we can and we need your help! \u00a0Please support us and share what we are doing with others!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
