    "summary": "Hi,\nEveryone! This is Paul Gilmore from Twin Flicks, and welcome to my Patreon\npage. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nTwin Flicks\nis a YouTube show that we\u2019ve been doing for 2 years now. Originally, it started\nas a fun little side thing to introduce movies and talk about filmmaking based\non our personal experience working in film. \nAs more people started watching, we really began to take it more\nseriously. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOver the\npast year, the show has evolved, and I\u0027ve incorporated more content. We are now\ncovering more topic videos about filmmaking, what made this film work compared\nto this film that doesn\u2019t work.  Also,\nsince we are filmmakers, we want to start including short films and skits to\nthe channel. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is\nsomething we have heard about but never thought about using because we felt and\nstill feel watching our videos should be absolutely free. However things have\nchanged, YouTube has now changed its policy towards smaller channels by not\nmonetizing any videos and this includes us. \nYouTube has helped us to grow the channel and continue to produce high\nquality videos with monetization.  Now\nthat has been stripped from us which means we have lost all revenue from\nYouTube.  Now we need it more than ever.  After losing my job and not able to work a \u201cnormal\u201d\njob because of a botched surgery that left me with nerve damage and partial paralysis\nand now with YouTube\u0027s ad revenue completely gone, it\u2019s now impossible for a\nsmall channel like us to keep going. (more on this in the video above)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI want to\nmake this absolutely clear I\u0027m not and will never charge for our content and\nthat\u0027s not what this is about. We will continue to make content with or without\nrevenue, it will just be much harder. The only reason we are using Pateron is for\na sort of virtual tip jar.  If like our content\nand would like us to be able to continue, throw us a few bucks. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe are\nnot in the same league as some major YouTube hotshots out there\nwhich means we also can\u2019t get sponsorship.  Since this is the case, your support is\ngreatly needed and appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI like to\nthink that we\u2019ve put out some of our best material in the last few months. It\u0027s\nan uphill battle getting noticed on YouTube, but we are slowly getting there\nand we\u2019re getting some great response. You can find\nall of our Twin Flicks episodes on YouTube. \nWe are also wanting to churn more independent filmmaker reviews, like\nthe interview we did with Writer/Director Nicole Jones-Dion who worked with Sean\nS. Cunningham, we also want to take more viewer requests and short films/skits.\nand anything else I think you folks will enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve fine-tuned\nreward packages, but I\u0027m always looking for ways to make them more appealing.\nIf you have any ideas, feel free to suggest them to me. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, we thank you for your support. We love\nmaking these videos, it\u2019s our love and passion for Cinema and Filmmaking that\ncontinues to drives us and we want to share that with you and this helps us to\ncontinue doing so.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
