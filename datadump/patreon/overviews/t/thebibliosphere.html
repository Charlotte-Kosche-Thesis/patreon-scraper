Procrastinator by day and anguished writer by 3am the morning before the deadline, I\u0027ve decided it\u0027s time to take all the hints everyone keeps dropping into my inbox about becoming a professional writer and try to and pawn my crackpot ideas off as literature. So far it seems to be working.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the deal, this patreon has been set up with a single goal in mind: \u003cstrong\u003eto let \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e better entertain \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get so many requests on a daily basis to Write More, as well as people asking if they can send me books, both the good the bad and the downright bizarre in the hopes that I will turn my nearsighted Sauron eye toward it and tear it apart with a mixture of good natured humor and regret. (Mostly regret.) And this is where you, my dear friends, come in. For every dollar I earn here, is less time I have to spend looking for extra work to keep my head above water, so for just a few dollars a month, you can help me do the thing that I love the most, which is to make people happy with words. Whether it\u0027s my crackpot humor or the smutty romances you all keep tricking me into writing. Seriously, I have a folder on my desktop called \"Siri How Does Tumblr Keep Tricking Me Into Writing Vampire Novels\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/MENNuXV.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThis is all on you.

Each month I\u0027ll be reviewing a different book from the collection of works which you the readers have decided represent either some of the best or worse romantic erotic literary fiction you\u0027ve ever seen. So if you\u0027ve got a god awful book which you think merits my attention, feel free to bring it to my attention, drop it into my kindle or mail it off to my PO Box and watch the hilarity unfold through snapchat ($3+ reward) or as I liveblogging e-books over on tumblr.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo add to my ever growing collection of the bad, mad and dangerously good, books and other questionable packages can be sent to: \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJOY DEMORRA\u003cbr\u003e# 250\u003cbr\u003e2038 FORD PARKWAY \u003cbr\u003eSAINT PAUL\u003cbr\u003eMN 55116\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003ePlease, no body parts.

Your support enables me to spend more time on my blog fielding questions and requests that come my way, whether it\u0027s personal anecdotes, writing stories, editing questions or something random like essential oils or how best to fight off a fae attack at 3am with a frying pan and a spool of thread.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI now have a backlog of recipe posts which I hope to have going out once or twice a month depending on how my health is doing, and given the popularity of my chatroom, I will also be hosting other content which I am keeping under wraps at the moment but hope to share with you soon. Needless to say it\u0027s going to be pure and utterly joyous chaos and I hope you\u0027re going to enjoy watching it as much as I have making it. So stay tuned for further updates and new content :)\u003cbr\u003e"

It\u0027s a 3 year procedure but even just being able to start the last of the surgery to prepare for it would be such a relief. Plus I\u0027d be in a lot less pain and as we know less pain = more vampires. Everyone wins. In the long term it would allow me to have something resembling minimum wage income from my writing, which also means more vampires. Basically vampires.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs ever I truly, deeply appreciate the support that has been shown to me over these last few months, thank you so much.
