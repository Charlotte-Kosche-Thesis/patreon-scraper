    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Is The Honduras Report?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn April of 2015 a young writer who had lived in Honduras for 2 years but left to go to college grew dissatisfied with existing news coverage of Honduras in English. At this point even news outlets that started in Honduras in English had gone silent so he decided to start his own. That news outlet was named Honest Honduran News. In February of 2016 this group would be renamed and the name that was chosen after a poll was made to allow readers to choose the name was: The Honduras Report.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Honduras Report is a publication that was created by a foreigner for foreigners who want to learn about Honduras. It exists to educate readers and to keep people who aren\u0027t fluent in Spanish aware of critical ongoing events throughout the country from the Bay Islands to Amapala.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Runs The Honduras Report?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Honduras Report is entirely managed by a single person. His name is Luciano Gonzalez and anything published on any of our pages is published by him and probably written by him as well. From the beginning he has run the site, whether it was back when all of the publications were merely Facebook posts, to when all of the posts were published on a Weebly site, to now when the posts are on a WordPress site. The Facebook group, page, Twitter profile, and even older YouTube videos that used to be shared on the social media accounts were all written by him as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLuciano Gonzalez is a brand new college graduate who earned a degree in History with a minor in Anthropology from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and graduated in May of 2017. He is a Puerto-Rican writer and translator who currently lives in North Carolina. He moved to Honduras in December of 2010 and then moved away in December of 2012. He wants the Honduras Report to thrive, particularly as we get closer and closer to Honduras\u0027s general election in November.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Support The Honduras Report?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Honduras Report is currently one of two existing news outlets entirely dedicated to Honduran news and commentary in English that still creates content. The other outlet is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://hondurasculturepolitics.blogspot.com/\"\u003eHonduras Culture and Politics\u003c/a\u003e. This is frustrating because English-speakers live all over Honduras, from missionaries in small communities, to retirees in the beautiful Bay Islands, to diplomats in Tegucigalpa, and many more including people who are born in Honduras to Honduran parents but are solely taught English for a variety of reasons including often living in areas dominated by tourists. The Honduras Report has connected over 1,100 English-speakers and Hondurans (and of course the gigantic number of people who are both Honduran and English-speaking in and out of Honduras) and has the potential to reach many more. The Honduras Report has the potential to connect tens of thousands if not many more people throughout Honduras and people outside of Honduras who lived there when they were younger or just visited and fell in love with the country. But we cannot do that without your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to fulfill its maximum potential The Honduras Report has got to upgrade and the easiest way to help those upgrades happen is with financial support. One of the main reasons why this needs financial support is because this entire project has been done by a single person. Everything. The same person who first created the Honest Honduran News Facebook group is the one who is writing this post on Patreon, and that same person once created a monthly newsletter containing summarized news in English with links to sources which were originally in Spanish. And sooner or later that\u0027ll probably have to change and in order to get the best possible results when that change happens it is necessary to have revenue to be able to hire reporters and photographers and web-designers. The Honduras Report has the potential and ambition to start creating real news outlets in English in Honduras, and not just digital ones but hopefully other types of outlets in Honduras one day. But that cannot happen without your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the main reasons why we are creating and launching a Patreon to gather funds is to empower anyone who writes for us and contributes their time to be financially compensated for it. Both translating articles and creating original ones requires time to do and a willingness to do extensive research. Ultimately we want to be able to compensate anyone who helps us create content and help them and ourselves build a real career out of making the news in Honduras more accessible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to support us it\u0027s monthly payments because the \"things\" that we create, we post and publish daily so each tier is not a single payment per day but a recurring one that happens on the first of each month. If you pledge 1 dollar, on July 1st you\u0027ll be charged. Same for 5 dollars, and 10 dollars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRewards For Support:\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027ll be more detail about this off to the side but here\u0027s a summarized list of the most important ones: credit for your support including a chance a place a link to your website or business, getting mentioned in any videos we create at the end of the video, and a personalized thank you email each month. There are more but they are listed off to the side.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
