My web site-\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thoskitedesign.com/\"\u003eThos Kite Design\u003c/a\u003e- documents some of that.\u00a0I also grew up playing all kinds of games and have continued to do so with family and friends right up to now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanksgiving 2016 a series of things happened that brought all the pieces together going back more than 40 years. Then the real magic started- Pelta Games. An idea based on this- \u003cstrong\u003ePlay is Art and Art is Play\u003c/strong\u003e. To find out more, you can go to \u003ca href=\"https://peltagames.com/magic-table/\"\u003eHow Pelta Games got Started\u003c/a\u003e and check out the rest of the site including the 1st game- \u003ca href=\"https://peltagames.com/peltapeeps\"\u003ePeltaPeeps\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s a rich backstory driving ideas for a trilogy of games now grown to 4 or 5 more games related to the 1st. And there\u0027re many other concepts that cross all sorts of lines between Art, play, games and things that make you feel good to hold in your hand or turn over in your mind.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support will make these wonderful things appear sooner and in greater number. Also, you\u0027ll be in on the process (giving feedback) as well as have access to early prototypes. Last, special patron discounts will be offered on finished games, Art thinking about becoming games, and Games thinking about becoming Art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I\u0027ve been making art for a long time. But lately, it\u0027s occurred to me that Art has a side to it that I\u0027ve never been comfortable with- something kind of narcissistic and removed. Turns out what I\u0027ve been doing all these years has been connected by a playful disregard for the formalities of Art while taking great enjoyment in it\u0027s unassuming side. The side that captures your interest like a shiny penny or full Moon. \u003cbr\u003eGames have this and reach people where Art has failed. As a kid playing games I loved the tactile immersive experience of playing with objects that were truly magical, imbued with all my imagination could conjure up. So that\u0027s were I\u0027m headed now- where art is play and play is art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
