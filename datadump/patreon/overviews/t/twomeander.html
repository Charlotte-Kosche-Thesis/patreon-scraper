We are both long-term full-time nomads, TBI Thrivers (traumatic brain injury), published authors, and avid \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqExmxPovDEvJHxRAJlBHLQ\"\u003eYouTube Creators\u003c/a\u003e. We have been friends since we first met in 2016, and have traveled together off and on since then. Currently, we enjoy meandering in one van and are having a blast. We have joined forces to create videos, photos, articles, and books for our loyal viewers and readers. We are so excited that you are interested in being one of our Patrons! This is work that we both find rewarding and meaningful, and nothing brings us more joy than hearing from a viewer or reader that has been impacted or touched by our lives, our survivor turned thriver stories, and our many creative projects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs much as we enjoy creating for our viewers and readers, we still need to find a way to pay the bills each month. We earn some money from book sales and advertising on our website as well as our YouTube channel, but oftentimes it is the support of our viewers and readers who appreciate our work that allows us to invest the time needed to keep creating and giving back. We could not do what we do without the support of our loyal and amazing viewers and readers. And there\u0027s so much more we want to do! Just take a look at our milestones and goals! We are excited about the possibilities of our future endeavors. With our Patrons, the sky is the limit! We look forward to being on this journey with each of you, and we look forward to providing the rewards and services for the tier you select. Thank you all so much! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCONTRIBUTIONS v. DONATIONS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019ve both been on the road for over two years now, but we\u2019re just beginning our travels together. Our goal is to inspire people to live the life of their dreams, whatever that may be, and never, ever give up, no matter what. Our Patrons make that possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy becoming a Patron you directly support us in the form of new gear, new software and travel related expenses. We will never spend your money frivolously or by traveling first class or by buying \u201cthings.\u201d We are committed to being transparent and to showing what life is like on the road with different-abilities also known as disabilities. Our Patrons help us deliver that message.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRobert still works full-time and we put in many hours producing videos. Patreon is not our full-time job. If only 1/3 of our YT subscribers chose Tier 1, we would have just enough to get by and run our multi-media business full-time. That would allow Robert to spend less time working for others to make ends meet, and both of us could concentrate more on creating awesome videos and writing books for your pleasure.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eGRATITUDE \u0026amp; PASSING IT ON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you find our content entertaining or valuable in some way, we hope you will consider becoming a Patron. We are not asking for donations. We promise to fulfill each Tier, and we will keep working hard to bring you free videos as well as improve our channel. As the number of our Patrons increase, we will also write more books to show just how AWE-mazing life can be when you \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003estop being afraid\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ekeep on keeping on. \u003c/em\u003eKOKO!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThank you Patrons for supporting our art.
