I sit in my toy room\nfixing and restoring vintage and retro toys, and making videos on how to do this\nso that it helps others do the same. In the evenings I chat and\nrespond to the messages I get in via social media and give as much\nhelp and advice as I can to other peoples projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp\nuntil now I have been filming and editing this with some very basic\nequipment, my desk lamp, a piece of white card, and a second hand\nvideo camera.  I\u0027d like to improve what I do and make the videos\nbigger and better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA\nbetter camera, proper lighting*, a microphone, and a new piece of\nwhite card*, things like that. I\u0027d also like to take on bigger and more complicated projects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patreon you would be helping me achieve this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have not heard of Toy Polloi follow the links above to YouTube and give it a watch. New videos are uploaded on Tuesdays and Fridays.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently my Patreon is set up to charge on a per restoration video basis. So all other videos (reviews, etc) will not be charged for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDave - Toy Polloi\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* A big thanks to my Patrons as I have been able to tick two things of my list. I have a new piece of white card and more importantly I now have proper lights. These are making a big difference to my videos already. You\u0027ll start to see the difference over the coming weeks as these newly filmed videos start to appear. Thanks\u003cbr\u003e"
