After many years playing, making, and running role playing games for my friends, I\u0027m ready to do something official. Unfortunately, life costs money, and money takes time. As much as I\u0027d love to make games for a living, it doesn\u0027t pay the bills. I wish I could promise lofty goals and fancy rewards, but for now, all I can hope for is enough money to actually make progress on my projects at a reasonable rate.\u003cbr\u003e"
