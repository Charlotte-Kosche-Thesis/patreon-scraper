I never really thought I\u0027d be making a Patreon but with a little encouragement I\u0027ve decided to take a chance and set one up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making comics pretty much my whole life and this is the first one I\u0027ve managed to sit down and dedicate more or less ALL my free time to. I love it with all my heart, and my girlfriend and I work on it on a daily basis together. However, having the writer support is nice, but I am the sole artist and that brings on a loootttt of pressure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me here you\u0027ll be helping make my life livable. Not kidding, I have a lot of expenses and lots of things I need to take care of and not nearly enough income to do it. My dream, and yes I\u0027ve decided once and for all it\u0027s my dream, is to make comics people will enjoy and maybe, just maybe, make a few tips on the side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I guess, consider it like a tip jar. If you want to help me keep making this comic anything and everything is appreciated. I\u0027ll do my best to provide you all with content you might like to see and I\u0027m always open for suggestions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I could make even $10 off of this I would be in heaven. There is nothing I want more than to do this for a living, and though that dream may be far off I hope to at least do the best I can sharing this with all of you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the rewards and see if you\u0027d like to donate. I\u0027d really, \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e appreciate it."
