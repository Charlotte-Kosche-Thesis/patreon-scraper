    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eHello There!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI\u0027ve loved drawing since I was just a kid especially Anime and when I got my drawing tablet last year I was very excited because doing digital art was something I always wanted to do but had never been able, but for the past 8 months I have been practicing and getting better and developing my own style that I love to make. So I wanted to make\u00a0this Patreon page as a way for me to grow, since all I do is just draw digital art for mainly Deviant art I thought I would try to use this opportunity to continue growing, do what I love and share my art with anyone who would take time out of their day to look at something that I made. I would love to be able to get as many people to join me on this journey as I can. Any type of support I can get would\u00a0go towards improving my own quality of life, and help me move forward in the world doing something that means the world to me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has been about 10 months since I\u0027ve started drawing digitally and have become quite accostumed to it at least alot more than I use to. My confidence in my style is better and anyone who would like to help support me and my drawings would be very much loved, and appreciated! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEdit: It\u0027s been a while since I have gotten my new drawing tablet and I\u0027ve put a lot of work into it and think that there has been a noticeable improvement in my drawings and I\u0027m going to keep getting better at my work for you guys as well as myself. I want to be able to make whoever is a fan of my art proud that they are following a smaller artist like me, and we\u0027ve just reached a milestone of 3 pledges and even that in itself to some people may be small, but to me it is absolutely wonderful and it really means the world to me. Hopefully we can keep growing and get bigger, but from the bottom of my heart thank you guys for the support! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso you can find me at\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://asukapride.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehttps://asukapride.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://xtaylormoonx.deviantart.com/\"\u003eDeviantart\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://xtaylormoonx.deviantart.com/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
