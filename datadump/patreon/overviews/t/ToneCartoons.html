I can do more of what I love so that you can see more of what YOU love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou also get additional exclusive rewards depending on the level you pledge. These will be released after I receive your payment on the 1st of the month. Your access to the Activity Feed is available immediately.

It\u0027s our own virtual, private club.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If you pledge at Skaro level, you get an exclusive view of new cartoons a day early and get a shout out on the Daily Dalek Facebook page, Instagram, and Tone Cartoons Twitter, to say thank you, \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u0027re amazing!\u003c/strong\u003e plus a follow back on all social media.
