I\u0027m creating an action platform hentai game that is quite different from the ones you may have played before. I\u0027ve always found it rather strange that you can only see hentai images and animations if you take damage or die in most hentai games. It\u0027s like rewarding you for being poor at the game.\u003cbr\u003eMy game, Bond of Blood, takes a fresh approach from your basic action platform hentai game, while at the same time offering many game play features you wouldn\u0027t expect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlot \u0026amp; Setting\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game takes place in the fictional country of South Masian. Ruthless enemy soldiers from the North have suddenly invaded, murdering, and pillaging  to their heart\u0027s content. Wendy Park, the main protagonist, fights to protect her family, free captives, and to liberate her town from the occupational forces. \u003cbr\u003eTaking place in a modern setting, it\u0027s not about slaying ogres with a broadsword, but rather killing Communist invades with a sub machine. There are a slew of real world firearms in the game as well as heroines that use martial arts. Limited physic powers and clone soldiers are the only real fantasy elements. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGameplay\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBond of Blood has two main gameplay modes; story mode and battle mode. In story mode the player will control Wendy as she walks around her parents\u0027 hotel, which acts as a base of sorts. She can talk and interact with many NPCs. To Include family members, friends, allied soldiers, normal townsfolk, and former enemies that has been convinced to switch sides.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe player can even take control of different protagonists, then discover all new dialog from the NPCs.  If you like hentai games with drama and humor, you\u0027re in for a treat. However, I designed the game so the player could skip it all and go directly into battle mode if they wanted. Read as much or as little dialog as you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBond of Blood\u0027s battle mood is sure to leave a lasting impression on you. Start off playing as Wendy and members of her family, each with their own stats. There are no power ups. And with limited ammo, health that doesn\u0027t recover, and unique character skills, the player is greatly encouraged to swap out heroes. It\u0027s fun and in some cases necessary, if you want to overcome some obstacles. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll heroes and heroines can evade enemy fire by \u0027hiding\u0027 into the background. You can also use a melee attack and reload at any time. (Assuming you have any bullets left.)\u003cbr\u003eSome missions has objectives you must meet before you can clear them. Others have a sandbox feel and you can come and go as you please. Additionally, some heroes are exclusive to select missions. I try to go the extra mile to keep things fresh and interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn most missions there will also be captives you\u0027ll need to save. The poor soul is being tortured and it\u0027s up to you free them. But afterwards they don\u0027t just thank you and disappear; freed captives join your party!  Moreover on the main quest, your party will get progressively bigger with each stage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHentai\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMake no mistake, this is a hentai game. However, seeing animated pixel sex during battle mode isn\u0027t the only xxx scenes to be had. There are hidden hentai illustrations to be discovered in story mode. And some male characters can gift female NPCs items to, *ahem*.. get on their good side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy wife drew the illustration you see here, however there are other artists contributing art work as well. The game also features music from two different composers. All pixel art is by done by your\u0027s truly, and I pride myself on never using stolen sprites or tile sheets. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSummary \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am confident that if you try Bond of Blood you will be hooked. Give the demo a spin and tell me what you think.  If you walk away impressed please consider supporting my project. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
