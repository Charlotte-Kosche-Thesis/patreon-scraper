Subscribers get access to unique feed items (art, scripts, etc...) while the content you support (the webcomic in this case) remains free for everyone. These contributions will allow Holly to rely less on commissions and put more time into the comic, which means more content for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You\u2019d Be Supporting:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.terra-comic.com/images/patreon2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2309 an interplanetary war has torn the galaxy apart. \u003cem\u003eTERRA\u003c/em\u003e follows the crew of the Evening Star as they fight alongside the Resistance, rebuilding a better galaxy where all sentient alien life will be equally represented and valued. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.terra-comic.com/images/patreon3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eTERRA\u003c/em\u003e has been running since March 2009 and updates Wednesdays. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Your Contributions would Help:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis patreon page will allow us to concentrate more of our attention towards the comic, which means more content.

Holly was diagnosed with MS in 2013 after a relapse that caused vision loss and loss of feeling in the left leg. She has since mostly recovered (but is still left with residual symptoms and a slight loss of vision in her left eye).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.terra-comic.com/images/relapse.jpg\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePics taken during Holly\u0027s hospital stay. It was her first relapse/treatment.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\nLiving with a chronic illness like MS can be expensive due to interferon medication, physical therapy and equipment (such as mobility assistance devices, cooling vests, etc). Any amount that can help alleviate the stress of these expenses is greatly appreciated. Contributions will also of course go towards the comic, for things such as software/hardware expenses, printing costs, convention merchandise and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019ve greatly enjoyed providing the comic for all of you over the past several years. We look forward to continuing to provide you with as much quality content as possible in the future. Thanks for your time and we hope you\u2019ll consider becoming a patron of \u003cem\u003eTERRA\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
