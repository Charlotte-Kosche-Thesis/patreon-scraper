I co-founded and do creative stuff for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.vinylmeplease.com/\"\u003eVinyl Me, Please\u003c/a\u003e during the day and write poems, essays, and stream of consciousness stuff at night. Things have been pretty heavy in my personal life for awhile now and I\u0027ll be spending the summer writing my way through it. I\u0027d love to have you join me and at the end of it, I\u0027ll be putting some of it into a book and self-publishing it if it sticks. By following along, you\u0027ll get access to everything I write along with some other cool one-off things I\u0027m still putting together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is post something a few times a week and I imagine some weeks will have more than others. If you want a physical copy of any of the things that I write here just shoot me a message and we can figure something out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommissioned Work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also available to write poems or other personal pieces for you. For now, any commissioned work is $100 but that price will go up sometime soon. If you\u0027re interested, shoot me a note at tyler at vinylmeplease dot com and we\u0027ll figure out the details. All commissioned work will start with a call to talk through what you have in mind and then will come with a handful of edits where applicable once I\u0027ve sent you the piece. I want to make sure you love the work and also that I don\u0027t get yanked around too much in the process and I\u0027m not worried about it. We\u0027re all reasonable folks here."
