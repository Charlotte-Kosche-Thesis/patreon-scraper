    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul here. Unabashed fantasy nerd. In fact I\u0027m such a fantasy nerd I wanted to create my own, so I went from fan to writer:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been a lover of fantasy for as long as I can recall. From using Lego blocks to form armies at age five, through to ravenously consuming \u003cem\u003eFighting Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eLone Wolf\u003c/em\u003e game-books and playing \u003cem\u003eDungeons and Dragons\u003c/em\u003e, to reading countless novels, and of course celebrating when my much-loved genre first began to lose its stigma via the \u003cem\u003eLord of the Rings\u003c/em\u003e films, and then became a phenomena thanks to \u003cem\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI moved from being a fan to a creator within the genre six years ago (I have previously released other works in different genres), but instead of attempting to add to the constant avalanche of fantasy novels being released, I chose to tell my story via comics, as I believe the genre is spectacularly and powerfully realised by that medium. Actually \u003cem\u003eseeing\u003c/em\u003e the gods and sorcerers and sweeping battles affords the reader a completely new way to experience an epic story. Here\u0027s a few examples of what Michal Dutkiewicz the artist for \u003cem\u003eThe Battle for Arn\u003c/em\u003e, is capable of, beginning with just\u00a0a few of the titles he has worked on for DC and Marvel, among other publishers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://killeroo.com/patreon/Collected_titles_preview.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, the cover for \u003cem\u003eThe Battle for Arn\u003c/em\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://killeroo.com/patreon/Final_Red_Cover_preview.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a vignette of the Dismissed found on the Prologue page:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://killeroo.com/patreon/Cropped_Dismissed_preview.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd an example some character designs. More art will be available exclusively for supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://killeroo.com/patreon/Massive_Man.jpg\" style=\"width: 255px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://killeroo.com/patreon/armor.jpg\" style=\"width: 254px;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Battle for Arn\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e mingles echoes of Paulo Coelho\u2019s \u003cem\u003eThe Alchemist\u003c/em\u003e, George R.R. Martin\u2019s \u003cem\u003eA Song of \nIce and Fire\u003c/em\u003e and Orson Welles\u2019s \u003cem\u003eCitizen Kane\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e What distinguishes \n\u003cem\u003eThe Battle for Arn\u003c/em\u003e from many other works in its genre is its handling of\n prophecy. While many fantasy titles are concerned with whether a \nprophecy will come to fruition, this story reckons with the aftermath of\n a dark foretelling \u2013 in this case, the death of a God - having \noccurred.\u003cbr\u003e This monumental event plunges the populace into \ndespair, causes economic collapse, gives rise to insurgents and ignites a\n civil war. \u003cbr\u003eThe realm\u2019s downfall is seen through the eyes of three \nestranged brothers, one of whom scours the lands for his mother, who \ndisappeared in mysterious circumstances a decade earlier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOK, enough with the hype. Convince me why I should support you - and aside from a warm rush of fairy dust through my veins - what do I get out of it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eT\u003c/em\u003eo pay the artist a fair and worthy rate, to pay my editor so my writing is as sparkly as it can be, and to pay the letterer so the dialogue and sound effects appear top notch on the page. I am a father of two little humans. Any parent will tell you how expensive those things are to run. I also have a mortgage, and I find eating helps sustain life, so I\u0027d like to keep that up. Simply, after all those expenses there is not enough left over to pay for the production of the book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf your book is so good, why aren\u0027t you submitting it to publishers?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e1) We are. However, the publishers we are interested in approaching only take on already completed books. They do not take story ideas. They also do not assemble a creative team around a writer. You submit your book and if they like it, they print, market and distribute through wide-reaching channels. That said, we may submit it, or we may go our own way, but we need to get it completed first. Being in the age of Patreon and Crowd Funding means that the traditional means of having a work published is no longer the only option; the creator has been empowered. Also, publishers can drop a book if it is not performing well, even after only a short time, meaning those that enjoyed it will never know its end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Maintaining creative control: As mentioned above, Publishers have their own way of doing things. That\u0027s fine and if one picks the book up, we may go with them. However, they have a plethora of titles to produce, distribute and market. Whereas, we know our book, so by retaining control over its production and promotion, we can get it to the people who would most like to read it, in the form that it should be read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou say you went from fan to writer only six years ago?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn the fantasy genre, yes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://killeroo.com/patreon/Number_1_best_seller.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://killeroo.com/patreon/Number1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have previously produced a 200 page psych-horror graphic novel, \u003cem\u003eThe List\u003c/em\u003e, which has garnered much praise from critics around the world, hit the number 1 selling horror graphic novel spot on Amazon (beating out \u003cem\u003eThe Walking Dead\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eHellboy\u003c/em\u003e and other titles of note), had its film rights optioned (sadly, they lapsed (98% of options do; but it\u0027s still a testament to the strength of the work)) and currently has around 3500 Facebook fans and 500 Twitters followers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from that I have written in several respectable anthologies, produced short stories and Mattel published a boardgame I co-created, \u003cem\u003eRoad Warrior.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u003cimg src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic30030.jpg\" style=\"width: 570px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHmm. Board games, short stories, horror comics... seems I took the long road to get to my favourite genre, fantasy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, fantasy is demanding to write; if you manage to come up with an original take on the genre, it then takes takes extensive research, rewrites and, oh yes, more research and rewrites...\u00a0 But I \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e this story; I knew I had something I had never seen in the all the many works I had read/watched. So I put in the hard yards, sitting down and writing a 72 page, 30 thousand word outline... while working full time and raising a family (you really must have full faith in a story if you\u0027re prepared to put yourself through that). But then the \u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e challenge arose: find an artist. But not just any artist; I need one who could imbue the book with all the power and majesty the script demanded; an artist whose work would immediately draw the reader in; to make them \u003cem\u003ebelieve\u003c/em\u003e as I had believed the many stories I had read/watched.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAn artist of Michal\u0027s calibre does not (and should not) incur low fees. I wanted the best, I got the best, but that comes at a price. Second to that, should this campaign grow to a substantial enough level, the books would be completed faster, and more rewards would be offered to those good enough to have stuck by us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat a book it could be! We aim to create a publication of surpassing beauty, not just with regards to story and art, but also production values (we would ultimately love to produce a single hardcover tome; the complete story in one magnificent volume). A book we aim for readers to treasure, to read over and over again and feel proud that they contributed to it becoming a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are fan of fantasy and delight in the thought of owning a 450-500 page epic fantasy comic that I have poured every ounce of my being into making sure is fresh, avoids cliches, blows you away with the spectacle of sieges, warring arch-sorcerers, intrigue, and massive battle scenes, while making you care for its characters as if you knew them personally, then please consider supporting us in the production of \u003cem\u003eThe Battle for Arn\u003c/em\u003e. We certainly intend on making our appreciation known.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you decide against supporting us, that\u0027s fine... but expect a certain visitor:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://killeroo.com/patreon/Dismissed_Cropped_2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
