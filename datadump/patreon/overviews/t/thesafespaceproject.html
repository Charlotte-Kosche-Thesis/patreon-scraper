    "summary": "I am an experienced advocate and case manager for victims and survivors of domestic violence. I have worked at a number of Bay Area agencies over the years, providing services and counseling. Since the need is so great, my focus now is on facilitating support groups for women in crisis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI expect no financial compensation for myself, but would appreciate assistance paying for childcare and dinners for participants during group sessions, transportation, and anything else the women need so they can comfortably attend the group. Many of my clients are financially dependent on their abusers, or homeless and living in shelters. Some are mothers to young children. They come to rely on the group for meals and other basic needs. After assessing the women\u0027s\u0027 circumstances, I intend to use your donations for gift cards that they can use for groceries, female hygiene products, winter clothes, school/baby supplies and anything else they\u0027re short of.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDomestic violence is devastating not only for the victims but their children too. The cycle of violence is perpetuated through generations and can end in fatalities. Without support and a place to talk and receive counseling, getting out of the relationship is almost impossible for many victims. The stigma, shame, guilt, and feeling of helplessness can take years to overcome. Support groups can help empower women to find their voice and strength again. For a women thinking of getting out, the system is murky and extremely difficult to navigate alone. Finding women in similar circumstances who can offer experience and their own perspectives is invaluable. Many victims have never told anyone of the abuse they live with. It is a huge step for any woman to reach out for help. I will be there when they\u0027re ready.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the support groups I provide a safe, confidential space for women to share their stories and comfort one another. We discuss healthy relationships, and learn to challenge societal norms and gender stereotypes. I offer parenting techniques specifically for traumatized women and children, guest speakers, and much more.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you would be supporting my current groups in Fremont, and hopefully Contra Costa County in the future (where services are very very thin on the ground). I will update patrons as and when there is something new or interesting to share, but specific details of my work and the lives of my clients are confidential.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour generosity means a great deal to me. Knowing that I have a monthly budget will make my work a lot easier. Please know that you would be making a direct and substantial impact on the lives of vulnerable women and children.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading, and your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRani Sanghera\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
