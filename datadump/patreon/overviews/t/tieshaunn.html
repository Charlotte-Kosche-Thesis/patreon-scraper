In the present, a teenage boy named Basil Blake with a strange past awakens the ability to create marvelous technology, and sets out to become a hero - or so it seems. Instead he finds himself caught in a web of family loyalties, twisted memories, unexpected friendships and vicious enemies.\u003cbr\u003eIt is meant to be just the first book of three, which are planned to encompass several turbulent years of the setting\u0027s history as Basil and his friends try to forge their own path... for good or ill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Dreaming\u003c/em\u003e started as a side-project and so far remains one, having only had very sporadic updates; it\u0027s an urban fantasy/horror story and has been heavily influenced - which I\u0027ll freely admit here - by the Dresden Files; though I believe I have managed to make it truly my own.\u003cbr\u003eThe story revolves around Aisling Blackhill - known to most as Ash - a teenage girl who stumbles by pure accident into the hidden world of magic and monsters that hides behind the mundane world; a world she is utterly unprepared for. Lacking a teacher, a protector or anything of much use but an old, cynical shadow of questionable trustworthiness and two steadfast friends, she finds out that her home town is far more complicated than she ever believed, as century-old plots, rivalries and enmities are coming to a head, rapidly approaching utter Pandaemonium.\u003cbr\u003eAnd that doesn\u0027t even account for a two-hundred year curse that\u0027s about to make its true terror known.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are more serials in the works, for when I manage to complete one or both of these. While I\u0027m not writing them, I am however refining the settings and their plots - I make a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of notes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, though I tend to represent myself with the image of a Lich, I unfortunately do not share their most awesome features - a complete lack of the need for sleep, food, proper clothing and shelter. As such, I need to support myself somehow to be able to justify spending time on this labour of love; providing entertainment for countless people may be as noble a goal as they come, but I do have to take care of myself and my family. Thus I am now here on Patreon, humbly requesting that any who find any worth in my work support me with whatever they can afford - every little bit is appreciated and goes towards providing more quality entertainment for you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTieshaunn Tanner\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
