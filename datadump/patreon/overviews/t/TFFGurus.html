    "summary": "Welcome to the Gurus family! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering pledging to us! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me take you on a journey of how this simple kid from Lee, NH decided to start up a fantasy football website, but before I do let me take you back to where my love for fantasy football all started. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was the fall of 2001 and I got invited into my 1st ever fantasy football league. I was just turning 21 and my sister\u0027s boyfriend (who is now her husband) asked me if I wanted to play in his fantasy football league. I had heard of fantasy football but had never played in a league up to this point. The league was called \"Doug\u0027s Gridiron Challenge\" and I was hooked immediately. I fell in love with the weekly grind of setting a lineup, trying to find diamonds in the rough on the waiver wire and of course winning! I found myself beginning to watch more than just my favorite team, the New England Patriots. I wanted to see how my fantasy stars were doing and see if someone I never heard of was jumping off the screen and looking like a future fantasy star. In my first year, I was able to have some beginner\u0027s luck on my side and I rode it all the way to a championship birth and a 2nd place finish. To this day I am still a card holding member of Doug\u0027s Fantasy Football league which has gone through some name changes over the years. That league holds a special place in heart because it was the first league I ever played in and it sparked my interest in fantasy football. Since then I have grown as a player and have expanded in the amount of leagues I play in per season. I am now playing in 6 redraft / keeper leagues as well as 1 dynasty league format. All have their own unique challenges but it\u0027s the friendships I\u0027ve made that I love most about playing in each of them and of course winning the league championship!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we are in the summer of 2013 and I am an Admissions Representative at a small college in Nashua, NH. A buddy of mine had come on board that summer and as we always would do, we began talking about fantasy football. Now it was nothing new for me and any of my co-workers to strike up a conversation about sports while we were in the office but that summer something changed. The talk seemingly would always turn back to football, more importantly fantasy football and people in the office and around campus began to ask me for help with preparation for their upcoming fantasy drafts. The demand started to become a bit overwhelming and It was at that moment I felt that I had something that allowed me to give back, something that would have helped the 21 year old me as I was just beginning my fantasy football journey. So while sitting at my desk on a Wednesday afternoon in the dead of the summer, I logged onto Twitter and I created The Fantasy Football Gurus Twitter page. My buddy who had just joined knew Twitter a lot better than I, so I told him to set it up and to show me how to use it. I am telling you I was so green on Twitter when we first started, I didn\u0027t even understand how hashtags worked or that they could be used in a sentence. With his help and guidance I was able to increase my knowledge of how to use Twitter to market my company and within one fantasy season I went from having 1 follower (Me from my personal account) to over 1k! I owe my buddy a huge thank you for getting me off to a good start and teaching me how to grow my brand on Twitter. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward three years later and the TFFGurus has over 3k followers on Twitter, 140 on Facebook, a website that produces over 95 articles a year, we have a nationally distributed podcast called Trophy Time, and the respect of some of the very people we look up to when we first started. Today, I am no longer alone in this journey. I have been able to expand and have the good fortune to bring in my closest friends and family to join me for the ride. I was able to bring in my now Brother In-Law Doug Eddy who is the director and host of our podcast Trophy Time as well as a writer; my Cousin Christopher Dugas who is also a Co-Host on Trophy Time and the writer of the world famous \"Hogs n Dogs\" article; and our good friend Everett Begor who recently joined us as our IDP \"Individual Defensive Player\" specialist to help feed the forgotten few of the fantasy community, that have been starving for content for awhile now. These gentlemen along with myself make up the roster of writers and contributors of content for the company and we are excited to see just how big we can grow it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the day we are just looking to live out our dream of being able to talk about fantasy football and at the core of everything we do, help as many people as we can win their league championship! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, we ask you to help us in our journey so we can hopefully take the next steps in the evolution of the company I started just three short years ago while sitting in a cubical in Nashua, NH.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
