As you have seen on our YouTube channel, we have recently uprooted ourselves from the \u0027daily grind\u0027 of the 9-5 office lifestyle, created our own business/remote careers, and moved into an RV! The hope with sharing our journey (both the ups AND the downs) is to encourage YOU GUYS to live out your dreams, whether it involves selling all of your possessions and going minimal, or finding a career that you are \u003cstrong\u003etruly\u003c/strong\u003e passionate about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I (Blair) battled for quite some time with whether or not to put ourselves out there via Patreon or not, but here we are! Our goal on Patreon is to continue to improve both the quality of equipment on our RV (for safe travels), continue improving the quality of equipment for our YouTube channel, and ultimately help us to reach our long term goal of bringing\u003cstrong\u003e food and care packages\u003c/strong\u003e to those that need it as we travel. For anyone that enjoys the channel, our long term goal with this lifestyle, and would like to play an even bigger part in our journey, you can choose to play a financial role in helping us meet all of these goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE LONG TERM GOAL:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Our ultimate goal is to actually create a non-profit organization to help bring compassion and food to homeless individuals throughout our travels. One of the hardest things for me to see whenever we travel anywhere, are people who are forgotten; people who have maybe lost their way or are down on their luck; people who are without the comfort of a home, bed, or even guaranteed their next meal. As we increase in subscribers and Patreons, we hope to be able to put a significant amount of the ad-revenue and Patreon donations towards preparing \u0027care packages/goodie bags\u0027 for those on the streets. We have been doing this for quite some time out of pocket, but our hope is to be able to create even more bags with the following necessities:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003efood (snacks, water, sandwiches, protein bars, fruit)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003etoiletries (toothbrushes, toothpaste, tissues, feminine care products)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eumbrella/poncho\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003esocks\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003egloves/scarf (for cold seasons)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003esunscreen\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003esocks\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eother various items\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cem\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eAs of March 2018, we have been able to put together 70 care packages/items to put into the hands of those who need them. Thank you to everyone who has been a part and helped contribute to bettering the lives of 70 people thus far!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 We will take every cent from Patreon donations and put it towards our goal of helping the homeless,\u00a0bettering the channel, and safety in travels.\u00a0Thank you for coming along this journey with us. \u0026lt;3"
