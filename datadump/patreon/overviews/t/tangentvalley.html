That\u0027s how it happened...What were you expecting? An Epic tale of Triumph and Adventure? No no, you wanna see Dirty Harry for that story. You\u0027ll find him out back behind the bar. Little advice; Don\u0027t accept any of his fish sticks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, we\u0027re not here to discus how this comic got started, that isn\u0027t what\u0027s important. It\u0027s KEEPING it happening, now THAT\u0027S what we want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who don\u0027t know, I write and draw a little Web Comic by the name of \u003ca href=\"http://tangent-valley.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTangent-Valley\u003c/a\u003e, and post my work for free over on DeviantArt. What IS Tangent-Valley you ask?\u003cbr\u003eWell...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTangent-Valley is a story about a young man by the name of Felix, who suddenly finds himself pulled from his world and home and into a strange realm knows as \"The Valley\". As stressful as such a situation may be, it would actually be infinitely better if it wasn\u0027t for the fact that Felix\u0027s form has also been changed upon entering\u00a0 this new world. Into what you may ask? Well, even he\u0027s not certain of that. Some sort of young cat-person as far as he can tell. But oh, if only it ended there. Because you see, there\u0027s just one other major problem Felix finds himself faced with. Something that makes everything else he\u0027s gone through seem miniscule by comparison.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, Felix...is now a girl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will Felix do now? What sort of Characters will he meet in this strange new world? And will he over-come his new changes, and find a way back home? I absolutely can\u0027t wait to show you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
