This series inspires makers young and old.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also cohost a weekly podcast called \"Reclaimed Audio\" and have worked most of my life as a musician. I often make instruments and incorporate original music into my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to do more and better videos and builds.
