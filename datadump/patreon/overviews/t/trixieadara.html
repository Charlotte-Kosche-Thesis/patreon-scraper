    "summary": "My name is Trixie Adara, and I write steamy stories. I try not to label my writing as simply erotica, though it does have sex. I wouldn\u0027t call it romance either, because sex is a focal point for what I write about. But I\u0027m obsessed with mind and identity. I\u0027m interested in attraction and preference. I wonder how fluid all of us are and what it would take to push us into new territories. Most of my stories involve some level of mind control, hypnosis, or magic. However, that is not my kink. My kink is seeing people changed, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. What could change you? Do you need your inhibitions lowered or your will dominated? What\u0027s the difference? Who is in control? What do we want and what gets in the way of our desires? All of my writing attempts to answer or engage those questions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is an attempt to empower me to write more. I\u0027ve been doing this for six months now, but I\u0027ve received a lot of positive feedback and a small clan of fans. Patreon felt like the next step to becoming a real girl. The money you donate will help me scale back on some of my other priorities and drive writing to the forefront. I\u0027ll start small; I\u0027m not greedy. But easing some of the burden of taking care of my family will help me write more of the content you love. Consider your dollar a pledge of your approval and fandom, encouraging me to keep writing and to improve as a writer. It\u0027s a seed that hopefully will soon grow into a beautiful tree of self-sustaining creativity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t feel pressure to give more than you are comfortable with. I\u0027m quite chatty, and I\u0027ll probably use this page as a place to talk to my fans as much as a source of income. I like to have everything in one place, and this seems like a good spot. Give enough to be a part of the conversation if that\u0027s what you want. Whatever you are comfortable with is what I want.\u00a0"
