I would like to be able to share with everyone around the world how amazing Japan really is. I haven\u0027t even discovered 10% of what is to offer here. I would like to be able to travel around places people are interested in to make videos to help those interested in visiting Japan. Travel is quite expensive in Japan, so being able to raise a few yen, can mean more exposure in my videos.\u003cbr\u003eWhether its $1 a month or $20 dollars a month.... all will be used for transportation and time. With the 2020 Olympics coming my goal is to be able to create videos to show the world why you should come to Japan and fall in love with this country just like I did.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAll patreons will be mentioned in videos with a special thank you!\u003cbr\u003eI plan to have made a few hundred videos by the time the 2020 Olympics and hopefully have evolved with the help of my supporters!"

     "about": "Hi Everyone.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Drew, originally from Hamilton Ontario Canada and living in Tokyo Japan for the last 12 years. I currently work for an English teaching school chain in Japan and I am the manager of the Kanto area. I love Japan and all that it has to offer. I like to vlog my experiences about daily life here in Japan with hopes that it will help anyone planning to visit Japan and/or just to see different cultural things about Japan.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have a full time job so WHY am I on Patreon? I will make it as simple as I can get.....\u003cbr\u003eGuys, I\u0027ve decided that I\u0027m going to take a more direct and honest approach with you, my viewers. And part of that real talk has to do with something most Youtubers are not that willing to talk about - money.\u003cbr\u003eThe thing with Youtube ad-revenue is that it really doesn\u0027t make channels money, and the only way smaller channels can earn an income worth the time spent making videos is with lots of low quality content, or sponsored content.\u003cbr\u003eThus, I  started  Patreon to help with the costs of producing these videos. There\u0027s a few costs like: travelling around Tokyo, entrance fees and the cost of my time (hundreds of hours scripting, shooting, editing).\u003cbr\u003eA lot of my fellow YouTuber friends are using Patreon so that their audience can support them directly. I would LOVE to make working on my channel my full-time job, so If you feel that my content is worth it then please help support \"The Tokyo Drew\" community.through here.\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make awesome vids together:\u003cbr\u003eI like to keep things as REAL and RAW as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlease enjoy my content and thank you for being a Patreon!",
