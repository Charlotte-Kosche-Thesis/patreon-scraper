We run a podcast called The Film Room (\u003ca href=\"http://thefilmroom.podbean.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewhich you can listen to right here\u003c/a\u003e)! As such, we have an ongoing discussion on where we are, where we were, and where we\u0027re going as the filmic landscape changes. Our format is very fluid, we cover a LOT of topics! Our goal is always to entertain, make you think, make you laugh, take you back, and just share our passion of the moving picture with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we release the cast for free, it does cost a little money to run. Between maintaining the feed and having access to movies (we rent/buy a lot of the films we watch for the cast), costs can add up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you, our loyal listeners, come in. If you enjoy what we do and would like to support our efforts, consider donating! Every little bit helps, and if we get more than needed for current expenses, we\u0027ll be able to expand our cast a bit! This includes things like putting out more content, having more guests, getting our own domain name, having a cool website, possibly upgrading software/hardware, you name it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage means we can more comfortably and consistently put out at least two episodes per month, as well as get you more bonus content! Look below for our direct rewards to you, and our milestone goals can be found in the sidebar! We have some exciting things in store, so keep an eye out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd hey, if you can\u0027t donate, that\u0027s cool too! You can always support our cast by word-of-mouth, spreading us on your social media, and just generally listening to our show and interacting with us! We are an extremely interactive cast and love having y\u0027all be part of the experience!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Albert and Austin"
