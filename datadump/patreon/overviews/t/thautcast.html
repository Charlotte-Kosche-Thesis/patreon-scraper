Now I would like to return to devoting more of my time to creating media for autistic people and the people who support us. In order to be able to do that, I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease considering donating $1 a month or more to support my work. In return for your donation, you will get access to patrons only posts. I used to post several times a day to my Facebook page. I have learned that it is best to stick to one post a day there and to keep the posts as positive and uncomplicated as positive. If you are interested in getting more frequent posts from me that sometimes delve into more difficult subjects, I think you will be interested in the posts I am doing at Patreon. Even if all you are interested in are the kinds of things I post to Facebook, I still hope you will consider donating to support my ability to do the best possible work on those.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am starting with only one reward level because I want to focus on nurturing the Patreon page for now. I don\u0027t want to promise I will do more than that unless I am able to gain enough support here to give up some of my other commitments. I hope to be able to create a variety of autistic media for you-- new cartoons, a newsletter for parents and professionals, animations, posters, new books, podcasts. But in order to do any of that, I will need your help and support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, please, become part of my Patreon community. For your one dollar donation, you will get access to several patrons-only posts each week. If you can afford to give more, please do. And if you cannot afford to support thAutcast financially, I still want to thank you for giving me the most important kind of support: your willingness to read what I have to say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLandon\u003cbr\u003e"
