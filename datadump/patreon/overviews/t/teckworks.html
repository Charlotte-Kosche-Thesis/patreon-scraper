I mainly partake in anthro/furry art, as well as some Pok\u00e9mon, Animal Crossing, or whatever other subject matter catches my fancy. In case you don\u0027t know, I do mostly NSFW stuff, like sexually explicit things, as well as tame stuff like pin-ups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, commission work is pretty much my job. \u00a0So even something as small as $1/mo would help me out. I want to thank you for coming to this page and checking it out, and hopefully consider dropping something nice into the jar~ I also want to thank every one of my fans and friends who stand by me and appreciate my work~"

     "about": "In west Kansas City, born and raised, on the NES is where I spent most of my days~ Grew up on NES and Sega Genesis, and corny 80s hairmetal, Weird Al, and synthpop. I do like to try to make music from time to time, but it\u0027s more of a hobby than something I\u0027d want to pursue seriously. Who knows, though, if this art thing doesn\u0027t work out, I could always try the music field. I do love cartoons, Western and Japanese alike. I\u0027ve started to get dried out on Anime, though, so I\u0027ve been looking back at old American cartoons from the 80s onward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, when I was about 7 years old, I was exposed to a video game called Super Mario Bros. 3. I played it almost religiously and found myself collecting a lot of Mario toys. There was a time that I would go through the TV Guides and magazines around the house and started drawing raccoon ears, tails, and leaves all over the photos of the people inside. Boy, deeprooted interests and influences come from the weirdest places, huh?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuper Mario 3 is probably my favorite game ever, since it pretty much sparked my influence in art. I used to fill spiral notebooks with Mario doodles and hand-drawn level maps. Plus I thought the raccoon thing was pretty cool. As a result, I\u0027ve specialized in this form of art where you draw an animal with human-like qualities, or \"Anthropomorphism\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso I like boobs and thick girls/guys, so I also draw that too~\u003cbr\u003e",
