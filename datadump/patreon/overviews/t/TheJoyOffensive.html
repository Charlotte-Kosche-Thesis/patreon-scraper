The aim is to highlight intersections and make it easier for teams to support each other across borders of all kinds.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlacing power in the process: art starts well before it meets an audience. The means of producing a work, the conversations surrounding it and the discoveries made while creating are as valid considerations as the impact of a work performed to/in front of a crowd.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn sum, bringing artists together in \u003cstrong\u003efun \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003efury\u003c/strong\u003e, learning, discovering and being there for one another.

Often these costs can\u2019t be covered by ticket sales, particularly when tickets are kept at reasonably accessible prices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe top priority is \u003cstrong\u003emaking sure the work happens\u003c/strong\u003e. Next is \u003cstrong\u003eartists\u003c/strong\u003e, then \u003cstrong\u003eadditional costs, \u003c/strong\u003elike branding, marketing and wider production budgets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(NOTE: This Patreon is in USD.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s \u003cem\u003ehighly, highly\u003c/em\u003e unlikely that I will personally see any of the money that comes through Patreon. That\u2019s completely okay (please don\u2019t worry about me). I would love to make this producing practice sustainable for me, but that\u2019s a problem for future-me to solve if/when we think about stabilising \u003cstrong\u003eThe Joy Offensive\u003c/strong\u003e as a business. Right now, it\u2019s about getting the projects up and running (and ideally not running at a \u003cem\u003emahoosive\u003c/em\u003e loss). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you made it to this page and to the end of this you\u2019re probably either: a) a kind, inquisitive and patient person or b) somebody who has been kind and wonderful enough to have supported me or any of the artists I\u2019m working with. In either case, I want to say \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e. If becoming a patron isn\u2019t a thing for you today (or ever!), give us a share on your socials and I\u2019ll give you a giant digital hug.\u00a0Also, I\u0027m going to cap contributions at $20 per month. Some loose change per month is more than enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove, peace, and joy,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2764\ufe0f Jules\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
