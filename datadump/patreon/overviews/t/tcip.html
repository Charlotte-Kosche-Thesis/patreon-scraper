We strive to keep all donations as anonymous as possible so that we can maximize your heavenly reward (Matthew 6:1-4).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to financially support the work we do at our church you can do this by one of three ways (listed in order of preference):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1.

Most banks allow you to set up a reoccurring transfer if you would like to support us on an ongoing basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003econs: \u003c/strong\u003eThese\u00a0cannot be done anonymously. Whilst I never reveal any personal information about who gives to our ministry, some people may wish to keep their donations anonymous for spiritual or practical reasons. This option is not cost effective for overseas supporters due to the transaction fees involved for international direct deposits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Cash Donations\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe keep a small black key-return box near the entrance of the hall where we meet.

There are no transaction fees so the church receives the full donation and your personal information is completely anonymous.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003econs:\u003c/strong\u003e There is a security risk if there is a lot of cash on hand. There is also the time involved to physically count and visit a bank to deposit the cash into the church bank account.
