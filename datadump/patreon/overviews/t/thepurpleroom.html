At first, it was simply somewhere I could record podcasts, videos and capture gameplay footage. Over time, a notion grew out of this little project. What I had been referring to as \"the purple room\" came to mean a whole lot more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Purple Room is a place that\u0027s both tangibly real and intangibly abstract. More honest than a brand; The Purple Room was the idea of an open, friendly, fun and welcoming space for anyone to be and, for those people to talk amongst themselves or just do whatever they wanted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \n\nRight now, The Purple Room is the office I sit in as I write this post. It\u0027s also a youtube channel, a twitch channel, and a twitter Page.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the next year, it will grow to be a group of people and voices of different backgrounds and with different loves and desires - voices that will appear across the spaces already created but, also in new spaces and mediums. We\u0027ll be creating video content, hosting live streams, writing interesting essays, and appearing on freely available podcasts for anyone who\u0027s interested.#\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis patreon is here to help support and build our idea - that abstract and vast place - one penny at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWelcome to the purple room! \u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make something, fun, free and special together. \n\n- Robin Smith, Creative director and guy behind The Purple Room\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/-r43YH0JbWT4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/82W1wdjcWSc/s100-mo-c-c0xffffffff-rj-k-no/photo.jpg\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
