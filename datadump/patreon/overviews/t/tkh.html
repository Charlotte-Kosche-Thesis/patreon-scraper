    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello, and thank you for considering becoming a Patron!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jonas but most people know me as tkh. When I\u0027m not at work or doing family things I create videos and put them on YouTube. I love video games, so naturally my videos are mostly game videos of various kinds; let\u0027s plays, tutorials, creations, first tries/spotlights and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making videos in 2013, and I\u0027m mostly known for various Minecraft tutorials, but the channels has always been a multi-game channel as I enjoy a varity of games. Over these years I have created content both from my own pick and from subscriber requests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking money was not the plan when I started my channel, and since I\u0027ve had a full-time daytime job all this time I have not been dependent on a side-income. However, after all these years it\u0027s time to make a decision; either step up or step down!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are basically two reasons for starting this page:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI often get comments saying that my video saved them hours of work and I spend lots of time helping people when they ask questions of how to set things up or when a Minecraft build is not working. Patreon\u00a0can be a way for viewers to make a safe and friendly donation as a way of saying \"thank you\".\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWith additional earnings I can justify investments in better tools to make videos in higher quality; hardware upgrades such as a better graphics card, new editing or recording software. Or replacement parts if anything unexpectedly breaks.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the extreme and ultimate goal: I\u0027ll quit my job to create the content you want on full-time! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor Patrons:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, thank you! On launch, I have on purpose only created low-tier rewards. The idea is to create both rewards and goals together with those who support me. Who else but you could better say what you\u0027re interested in? In time we can surely find rewards both you and me are happy with, so feel free to start supporting and we\u0027ll take things from there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
