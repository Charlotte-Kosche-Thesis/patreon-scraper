    "summary": "I\u0027m a musician living between amateur and professional status. I am a lover of song and songwriting, and music and music making. But more importantly, I am a husband and father keeping up a day job, teaching instrumental lessons, accompanying as a church musician, playing for all kinds of events, and writing and performing music on my own and with my musician wife, as I am able. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have three children, and we\u0027ve always tried to keep music deeply integrated in our family life. Since 2016 we have increased our involvement in local community organizations and groups that seek to support and cultivate the arts in our home region of Northeast PA, because we feel that the music we make should contribute not only to our well-being, but to the well-being of our family and our neighbors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are privileged to teach music classes for children and adults on behalf of our local cultural center, the \u003ca href=\"http://dietrichtheater.com/\"\u003eDietrich Theater\u003c/a\u003e. We offer similar programs to other regional organizations and events, like churches, schools, and music festivals. Through our involvement with the \u003ca href=\"https://northbrancharttrail.com/\"\u003eKitson Arts Alliance\u003c/a\u003e we have done much to advocate for and develop opportunities for creatives of all kinds. I\u0027m also happy to present a program for regional songwriters at and with \u003ca href=\"https://gatheringplacecs.org/\"\u003eThe Gathering Place for Community, Arts and Education\u003c/a\u003e. This program, called the \"Songwriters\u0027 Roundtable\" has proved inspirational for all those involved, and I look forward to participating each month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0In the spring of 2017 I completed an album of original music entitled \u003ca href=\"http://timothyziegermusic.com/music/\"\u003eNorth Light\u003c/a\u003e, which I recorded in my converted garage and had mixed and mastered by a local engineer. I am frequently writing new material and enjoy focusing my efforts on specific projects. I\u0027m humbled to have my original music featured at various venues in our region and beyond, including the Old Lynn Concert Series, PA Live, WVIA\u0027s Homegrown Music, Blues \u0026amp; Roots Radio, and the Mostly Folk podcast. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have learned much through each of these experiences, and I want nothing more than to grow as a father, husband, neighbor, and creator. As a parent I feel a strong burden of responsibility to be upright and productive in what I do. This music habit has been a prominent feature in my life, and I\u0027d like to justify the time and energy it takes. I\u0027d be further honored to be able to focus my energy on it more so as to pursue a number of projects that I\u0027ve imagined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing creatively and financially supported by those who value my efforts would enable me to do more and do it better. I believe the Patreon platform can help me continue creating meaningful music and enable me to get it to the people that it will serve the most.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for considering supporting me--and my family--in our musical efforts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
