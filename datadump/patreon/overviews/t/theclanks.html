It means that you care about what I\u2019m doing, about who I am and about the ideas I have written about. We all have aspirations that we try to follow. This is mine. I have always wanted to write stories, create worlds for people to get lost in, and create entertainment that meant something. My goal for creating The Clanks was to create something that makes your day just a little better. This podcast is for me, and it\u2019s for you. Your donation helps me keep going. I currently write this in my free time (which I don\u2019t have a lot of), and by being a patron, it helps me keep going when I\u2019m tired, or when the day has beaten me down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money contributed to Patreon lets me keep doing this. I can eat, get more music, microphones, and hopefully, if you like this podcast enough, I can spend more time writing for you. I have so much more that I want to share with my supporters and hopefully if this is successful, I can bring more content for you. I hope that my stories bring something into your life. I hope it is one of the things you look forward to on Tuesdays. I hope that we can share more stories together. I hope that this reaches you in some way that makes you glad you found us in the millions of podcasts. This is a labor of love from me, and I hope that you find that it touches you and makes you want more. I truly care for what I am doing and by contributing, you are showing me that you care about what I am doing, and I can\u2019t put into words what that means to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, The Clanks can continue to bring you something to look forward to listen to, and can continue to be something that I look forward to creating for my fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, for being part of, The Clanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Ben"
