The Writers\u0027 Rooms endeavors to bring these wonderful ideas together and help all writers with their craft. We strive to encourage and foster community-based knowledge to help lead literary sessions and provide a safe, positive writing environment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Rooms are moderated by both our Concierges and the members of our\u00a0community. Community-led sessions tap into the wealth of our collective knowledge, allowing our writers to both share their own experiences and learn from other attendees. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Rooms can\u0027t exist without you and your passion and experience! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Rooms\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Rooms are small, focused communities of writers. We meet 1-2 times a month for two-hour sessions in locations all across the Iowa Creative Corridor. Our first hour is dedicated to sharing community news, providing a writing lesson developed by community members, and discussing the topic. The second hour involves working on writing prompts or personal projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe provide a safe, inclusive environment where writers can be themselves. We encourage our community to ask questions they might otherwise be afraid to ask, and share in the joys of the literary journey with others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Rooms are created based on community need. As the call for a genre- or topic-based Room grows louder, it rises higher on our list for consideration.
