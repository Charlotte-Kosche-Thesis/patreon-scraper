Everett and I have played strings on so many wonderful records for friends who became clients and clients who became friends, and Everett has produced several records for the same. Over the past two years, we have slowly become sustained by our audio production business, Red Yeti Audio, but it\u0027s not checking all the boxes of what we need. We always preach that musicians have no silver bullets, only silver buckshot; we want to show the world all of the music we\u0027ve got, in addition to supporting the dreams and music of our clients and friends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003ewhat we want to do\u003c/h2\u003eIn order to have time to be creative in our own music and spend time with our amazing daughter, Everly, we need your help to fund the time taken away from our other work.\u00a0With your cooperation, we can be free to provide creative and unique instrumental music for licensing and download.
