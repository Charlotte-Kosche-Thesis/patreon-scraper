    "summary": "This Patreon is only for Tramigos members. Tramigos is a private community of super friendly and passionate travelers from all over the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHola Tramigos,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have landed here, you are the reason behind what I do and the fact you have clicked on this link means the world to me. Merci!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing friends with fellow passionate and super friendly travelers from all over the world has always been one of my biggest dream and couldn\u0027t be more proud to share this dream with you guys. The world is much smaller now! For example, our French speaking group have people from the following countries talking (or trying :D) to each other: Mexico, Belgium, Peru, Senegal, Tunisia, Albania, Angola, Norway, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Ghana, Morocco, France, India, Nigeria, Spain, Brazil, Portugal, Zimbabwe, Sweden and Indonesia. That\u0027s how \u003cstrong\u003eglobal\u003c/strong\u003e we are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese mini communities alongside other projects aim \u003cstrong\u003eto give you the\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003epower to connect with the world on a intimate level. \u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s our mission and we will do our best to make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis has not been built in a day though. Building our small global village has been difficult, stressful and required significant investment of time and money. Tramigos has been self funded since September 2017 with the profit of my previous business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever,I cannot afford anymore to keep investing on the development of our platform or spend as much time building our community without generating any revenue. That\u0027s why I am going to start looking for ways to make Tramigos profitable. I thought to use Patreon as a first attempt because of the following:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Fully transparent\u003c/strong\u003e: Unlike some of our competitors, we don\u0027t want to implement a \"verified members\" functionality and play with some psychological tricks to make you buy it. We are fully transparent and tell you straight how we will make money and what we will do with it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeer / voluntary basis\u003c/strong\u003e: Bring Tramigos to a bar for a beer in your city! Posh bar if you are generous or cheap one if you are broke haha. We love this concept because we are not forcing anyone to pay \"x\" amount of money to be a member. It\u0027s only based on how you value Tramigos and how much you can afford. The price of a beer in a bar in Norway is definitely different than in Congo.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPS: If you want to contribute, the minimum recommended is $2.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon takes 5% and Paypal takes 2.9% + 30 CENT per transaction. And on top of that we have to pay currency exchange fees. Hence if you send less than $2 per month, we will receive around 50% of it so that\u0027s better to keep your money or pay a bit more."
