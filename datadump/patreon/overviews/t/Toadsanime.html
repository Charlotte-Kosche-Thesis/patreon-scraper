I sometimes appear on BBC Radio and other various outlets to talk, where I also talk about video games (SHOCK!) Many of you may simply know me for my coverage on Twitter, where I post breaking news and commentary to such a quantity that it could be considered spam.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI LOVE my work, and I love running my side projects like Gameiversary (which posts video game anniversaries every day) and the Toad on Games podcast (another gaming podcast with journalists, developers and industry experts as guests talking about specific gaming topics.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I\u0027m away for work 12 hours a day, and on top of reviewing games at home, I struggle to find the time for these efforts. I have practically dedicated my life to work these days, which is absolutely fine, but sometimes I wonder if it\u0027s worth it. There are also small costs involved with some of these projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like any of my work from anywhere, or just think I\u0027m kinda a neat fella, anything helps! I am not struggling to pay bills, but games journalists are not rich folk, and I often lack enough money to pay for games I would like to review. I can\u0027t even get a Nintendo Switch yet, which I could really do with for work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, as well as covering small costs (Soundcloud account, new microphone) for projects and helping me purchase games for my work, this also just acts as incentive for me to continue with various projects. I have more in the pipeline too, of course!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for any help at all! Please don\u0027t feel any pressure to give, or to stick around indefinitely, and please don\u0027t give if it puts yourself in a more difficult position financially. \u0026lt;3\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
