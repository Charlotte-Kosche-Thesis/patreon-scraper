High school friends Alan Le and Neil Allen started up the idea\n of the band along with some mutual friends. The first band, \n\u003cem\u003eUtopian \nVision\u003c/em\u003e, was formed with five people and played its first show in June 2013 at a parish \nfestival in Costa Mesa. \u003cem\u003eUtopian Vision\u003c/em\u003e played its \nlast show in June of 2014 before disbanding on good terms. Shortly afterwards, the \nremaining members of what was \n\u003cem\u003eUtopian Vision \u003c/em\u003eregrouped to form \u003cem\u003eThe \nSkylight\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0

technicality and is very disciplined in his work. \u00a0 His family also has many ties within the music industry as his mother used to do office work for a record label.\u00a0 These connections are essential to the progression of the band because of the unlimited opportunities they have to offer!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLead singer, guitarist, pianist and producer Alan Le has been involved in music since he was eight years old.\u00a0 A classically trained singer and musician as well, he has had formal piano lessons for eight years, been involved with church bands, as well as various groups and choirs for eleven years, is a self-taught guitarist for nine years, bassist for six years, and has been in the recording and production scene for four years.\u00a0 He has also been
