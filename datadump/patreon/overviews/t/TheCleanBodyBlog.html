    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the Clean Body Blog?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! My name is Kate Ashton and I am the founder of Crating Wellness \u0026amp; The Clean Body Blog (CBB). I created Crating Wellness in July of 2017 to shed light on the harmful ingredients found in beauty/personal care products, food, and household products. My passion is to empower people to make informed, healthier product decisions, as well as to introduce them to healthier ingredients and safer product alternatives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the course of a few months, I felt drawn to narrow my topic to information on the lesser-known personal care and beauty industry in order to help inform people of the many harmful ingredients found in their products.\u00a0 In October, I decided to change my business from a snack subscription box business to an educational/informational blog that concentrates on sharing the truth about ingredients and products found in the personal care/beauty industry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe information I have found is alarming. Many of the ingredients found in personal care and beauty products are harmful and/or toxic to us. Most people don\u0027t possess the knowledge about beauty care product ingredients because they have not been informed, ingredient names are often ambiguous and the front of the packaging misleads people to believe that the products are healthy for us. This is one of the problems that I plan on addressing with the CBB blog, and I need your help to get the word out to more people. With my budget below we will be able to reach more people with your help than I will be able to reach on my own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnowledge is power. One of my goals for CBB is to empower people with researched, informative information so that they can make informed decisions on the products they use every day. I spend 2-4 hours per blog post researching information regarding each ingredient or product.\u00a0This is partly because of the lack of regulations and databases available for ingredients and partly because I am being thorough in researching all the available information on each topic I write about. I will then spend 2-4 hours planning, writing, editing and reviewing my blog post to get it ready to post. So you can see that each post can take between 6-8 hours for each topic. But I spend this time on each topic because each one is important in order\u00a0for my readers to make safer, non-toxic product decisions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some reasons I want to share the CBB with everyone:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) CBB is needed and wanted by readers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy readers have been shown time and again that they want to be better informed. They want to make healthy, informed product decisions for themselves and their family. Your contributions will make this blog sustainable for years to come, help me to reach more readers and help to make changes occur in our personal care/beauty industry. The more people know the more we can change what is in our products.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) We need CBB to be a long-term, sustainable blog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I want the blog to be around forever, I need to make CBB a self-sustaining blog. Here are some options I came up with to make CBB sustainable:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ea) The Clean Body Store. This option will help slowly, over time as I gain more readers, more authority and more of a presence in the beauty and personal care. So, this option needs to correspond with a sustainable blog, which leads me to my next option.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eb) Patrons. Here at Patreon readers can donate what they want per month and their donation becomes recurring each month thereafter. This option allows for a recurring, sustainable amount to keep the blog going and growing every month. A donation of $1/month and up will start the snowball rolling in helping to empower more readers and change what ingredients are allowed in our products. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the money you give to CBB, we can make the CBB a lifelong, sustainable blog that empowers others to make healthier, informative product and ingredient decisions they can trust. Speaking of trust, here is a breakdown of what I will be using the money for. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is $6998.37/month. We will use the money we receive from our supporters at Patreon to help keep empowering people to make healthier product choices, reach more readers with life-changing information and help make improved changes in our beauty industry because of what we are doing at of CBB. Your contributions will help sustain CBB forever.

We use email to keep our readers informed, to send newsletters about our current blogs and events as well as updates on our blog.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook/Instagram Campaigns\u003c/strong\u003e Campaigns allow us to reach our current readers as well as potential readers. We want to share what we have researched and discovered with everyone. Facebook and Instagram allow us to grow our readership through campaigns that target interest groups that align with our\u00a0goals.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduct Research\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0This takes time, and a lot of effort to research products. Your assistance will help me focus on what is really behind these products and why they\u0027re safe or unsafe for us.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduct Purchasing \u003c/strong\u003e- As many of you are aware, many of these products are expensive, which poses a real challenge for a small start-up company.\u00a0 Again, I appreciate your support and financial assistance.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduct Testing\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Any product that I blog about I have used myself.\u00a0 This shows my readers that my word is trustworthy and honest no matter if the I give the product a good or bad review. Some vendors will send free samples, many will not.\u00a0 Each of the products I review will be thoroughly researched before they are purchased to ensure they are healthy, quality product alternatives.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3rd Party Product Testing- \u003c/strong\u003eChemical analysis for one product ranges from $220-400.\u00a0 I would like to be able to test at least 1 product per month.\u00a0 This will allow us to fully disclose what is truly found in products.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Salary\u003c/strong\u003e There are some basic necessities I need in order to make this blog happen. Basic needs include food, shelter, electricity, clothing, paying the bills and the like. I am not making a profit here, instead, once our initial goal is reached my salary will allow me to work fulltime as a blogger and will allow me to produce more researched and reliable blog posts.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne part-time employee\u003c/strong\u003e- I need someone to review to my blog posts before they go live, help with email distribution, media correspondence, inquiries, research, customer service, social media, comment reviews and the like in order to grow. This will free me from spending time on items that take away from writing blog posts.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose are the basic costs that will help us to take our blog to the next level.
