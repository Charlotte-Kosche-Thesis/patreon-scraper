     "about": "Biography\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eTyrone Simms is a 32 year-old young man living in the community of Parade Gardens located in Central Kingston, Jamaica. He is part of a single parent family and was parented by his Mother.\u003cbr\u003eHe is a very confident, and self-motivated and strives for nothing less of excellence. He is every dedicated and takes every task very seriously. He has a friendly, caring and cooperative personality and therefore is one of the few positive role models in his community as well as in other settings. He also enjoys devoting time to voluntary service.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, these attributes were not easily attained. \u201cMy early year were spent living on March Pen Road, in Spanish Town, St. Catherine. I live a quiet life and had very humble surroundings. All of this changed however after a life threatening accident that almost left me paralyzed or worse dead. I fell from a cane truck and broke my hip. This caused me to miss a few years out o school and added financial pressure and strain to my already poor family. In addition, due to the lack of finances in my family to cover some of the expenses, the threat of going out of my way for money and becoming a crime statistic was always strong and very much present however I was determined to stay on the right path. In addition, where I come from, people tend to think that they can\u2019t achieve much,\u201d Tyrone shared.\u003cbr\u003e\u201cWhen I was much smaller, I remembered playing around with gadgets and thinking I wanted to be an electrical engineer. I knew at that age that I didn\u2019t fit in and I was meant to be something special. However all of that changed after the accident and my self-esteem got really low. Mainly due to the fact that I was finding it extremely hard to catch up again in school and I eventually dropped out early. I was devastated,\u201d he continued.\u003cbr\u003eThe great news is, since coming to Kingston where more opportunities were present and more support systems such as youth clubs, NGO\u2019s, and getting involved in the Diaspora Youth connect program\u201d, all helped lift his self esteem. He began to realize again that success is definitely possible. He enrolled in a few vocational skills and that\u2019s when he found his passion; photography and producing and from there chose to start his own company. \u201cFor me success is doing what you love, where your passion drives you and being able to help others from it,\u201d Tyrone continued.\u003cbr\u003e\u201cOf course failure tries to creep in but I see failure as a lesson so I listen to some music and move on. I try to rely mostly on intrinsic motivation and talk to veterans to see how they coped. Also I try to keep my mind focused on what is needed to move forward. For example, this very time around a Canon Mark 111 DSLR Camera Lens and some lighting kits is my focus. Looking towards the future, I see my company impacting the island. I honestly believe the Jamaican culture is great and when documented, it can be used for varying developmental purposes. I want to be doing documentaries and short films.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
