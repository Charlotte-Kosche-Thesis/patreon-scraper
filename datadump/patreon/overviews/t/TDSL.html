    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0With TDSL nearing its end we hope you liked it, and we hope you will support out next Super League project (which has its own Patreon):\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/SuperLeague\"\u003eVintage Super League\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdate: Wizards of the Coast has stepped in to make sure this show is funded! We are officially ON for a May 16th launch! (Look for a Patrons-only preview video in the next two weeks to reveal and size-up the field.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeams are awesome. Drafts are awesome. Super Leagues are awesome. Combining all three together should make for some great shows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plan is to have 8 teams of 3 players each compete against each other via Magic Online, and to stream the festivities in the usual Tuesday night Super League time slot of 5pm pacific time on twitch.tv/Magic (with VODs then being posted to YouTube afterwards). We\u0027re hoping to start on May 16th.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing has been finalized yet, but check out some of the teams that have already expressed interest:\u003cbr\u003e    Luis Scott-Vargas, Eric Froehlich, Ben Stark\u003cbr\u003e    Jon Finkel, Chris Pikula, Jamie Parke\u003cbr\u003e    Marshall Sutcliffe, Kenji Egashira, Paul Cheon\u003cbr\u003e    Paul Rietzl, David Williams, Matt Sperling\u003cbr\u003e    Owen Turtenwald, Reid Duke, William Jensen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I have barely started spreading the word and asking around! The bragging rights alone seem to be enough to motivate everyone who can make the time zones work out, and I suspect the trash talk will be flowing fast and furious on Magic Twitter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach team match-up would use the \"side draft\" format of choice for the last 20+ years: 3 v 3 booster draft where everyone plays everyone (aka, the first team to win 5 of a possible 9 matches wins). With 8 teams, the season works out to be 13 weeks long so if we start in May then we\u0027ll finish in August.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve been this excited about a Super League since we got the first one up and running 3 years ago. Please help us make this a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Note: there is a significant amount of work that needs to be done before the first weekly episode, especially on graphics, so we will be charging patrons for a short \"Episode Zero\" which will preview the field. This bare-bones episode will not stream live or feature any gameplay, but it will feature the first formal announcement of all the teams that will be involved, and the link to the video will only be available through the Patreon feed. All other episodes will be streamed live and then posted publicly.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eQ. How is this connected to Vintage Super League?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. The same team that produces that show (Randy Buehler and Athena Froehlich) is also producing this one. There will be a break before VSL Season 7 and we\u0027d like to fill that break with this. (You can read more about VSL on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://vintagesuperleague.com/\"\u003eVintageSuperLeague.com\u003c/a\u003e and you can sign up to support it on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/SuperLeague\"\u003ePatreon.com/SuperLeague\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. Isn\u0027t Limited a bad format for event coverage?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. It can be hard to follow everything that\u0027s going on at an \"IRL\" Limited event, like a Grand Prix or a Pro Tour, BUT Magic Online actually solves those issues for us. The MTGO draft interface makes it very easy to watch a draft, and being able to see exactly which cards both players have in hand at all times makes the gameplay dramatically more interesting to watch. I thought the Limited rounds at the Magic Online Championship (which this team produced) were very entertaining, and the viewership numbers seemed to back that up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. Who will be doing commentary?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. The players from the competing teams will do most of it. I (Randy Buehler) will also do some. We will bring players in from other teams to help out with draft commentary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. What will the schedule be like each week?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. First we pick one \"featured\" drafter and watch them draft (plus build). Then two matches will start and the 3rd member of each team - the ones that aren\u0027t playing - will do commentary. We will pick one match to watch in its entirety and then if it ends first we will catch the end of the other. We repeat that pattern up to 4 times and then if no team has won yet (aka, it\u0027s tied 4-4) our fifth \"match slot\" will have just the 9th and deciding match.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. What\u0027s the structure for the \"tournament\"?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. Two rounds of Swiss, then the two 2-0 teams advance to the Top 4, the two 0-2\u0027s are eliminated, and the four 1-1 teams are paired up to play for the other two spots in the Top 4.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ. How do you pick the teams that get to play?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. There\u0027s no formal qualification process. Rather, we will try to pick the teams that make for the most compelling show. We strive for a mix of great players, fan favorites, and compelling personalities while keeping in mind that everyone also has to be able to make the Tuesday night commitment work. I will definitely be asking patrons who they want to see, so do not hesitate to express your opinion on the Patreon feed after you pledge!\u003cbr\u003e"
