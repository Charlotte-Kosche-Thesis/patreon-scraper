People give so much support in so many ways, and monthly support give me piece of mind so I can focus on giving more and better stream content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you watch my stream, you get Coins which can be used to play mini-games, request music, create quotes, increase their dwarf\u0027s status in Dwarf Fortress, participate in auctions and raffles, and suggest games for me to play. VIPs get Coin multipliers and discounts which allow them to participate even more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStream content includes Speedruns, EVE Online, Survival games, FPS, and Lets Plays.

On my Twitch channel we speedrun games, explore dangerous locales, and decide the fate of the hardy Dwarves. My stream is striving to be as interactive as possible, with viewer-suggested music and content, as well as raffles. These pledges will go towards expenses for producing the stream."
