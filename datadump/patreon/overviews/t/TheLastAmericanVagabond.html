Yet, we see it as our moral imperative to not only provide the most up to date, factual information available, but to give you our assessment as to how that information affects you. We will never pass along our opinion as fact, and will never denigrate the truth to suit our agenda, which is all too apparent with the vast majority of corporate media.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Intent\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery dollar that is given will go toward the hiring and paying of a wide range of writers, the acquisition of recording and broadcast equipment, and conducting the most in-depth\u00a0research and\u00a0investigative journalism possible; that which quite literally no longer exists in mainstream media.
