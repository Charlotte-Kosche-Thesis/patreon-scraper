And as the calendar gets fuller, so do our expenses! Having $1k a month would make it possible to get make our live shows run a little smoother, get our music a little farther, and make all of your hearts a little fuller! We\u0027ll get to new cities and states and be able to get our music in all kinds of new ears and hands!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we hit our first goal and start making over $1k a month on here, \u003cstrong\u003ewe\u0027ll be so excited we\u0027ll have no choice but to throw a party!\u003c/strong\u003e And guess what?
