Give me the magic and the monsters!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing as a hobby for over ten years - I have several novels nearly done, and a small armada of exclusive writing snippets, scenes and prompts to share with you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMission Goal:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMonsters and villains have a literary history of being queer-coded in stories in a\nway that makes it clear that the fact that they are LGBTQA or LGBTQA-coded is only there\nto make them more frightening to the reader or protagonist. So I want to create stories about LGBT protagonists and antagonists where it\u0027s not just about coming out, and where an antagonist\u0027s sexuality can\nbe a positive or humanising aspect of their character instead of threatening or dismissible. Your villains should be frighting, but not because of that. Mainly, I want more LGBTQA novels in the world. We\u0027ve got a lot a lot of catching up to do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, gotta love a good antagonist right? Dark sides are important, everyone has one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e___________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging: You pledge a certain amount a month, however much or little you like, to access exclusive writing snippets, writing content and rewards. This can be as little or as much as you like - it can even be a swing by for a month! You can change your pledge at any time, if I\u0027m no longer creating the type of work that you want to read, or for any other reason such as you want more awesome stuff and your current tier isn\u0027t quite scratching all your cravings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCommunity: Share your thoughts with me and each other!
