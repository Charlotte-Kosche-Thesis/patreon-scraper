Whether you\u0027re just watching my videos or liking/subscribing/sharing them, you\u0027re already making an enormous difference in helping my channel grow! But if you\u0027re considering doing that little bit extra or you\u0027re just new to my channel and what to know more, let me take a second to tell you what I do and how your funding would mean the absolute world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eMY CHANNEL\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight now I have 3 kinds of videos:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn-depth Reviews \u003c/strong\u003e- Where I thoroughly critique every aspect of a game\u0027s design including gameplay, story, visuals, setting and music. These will often be older games from the PS3/360 era and I particularly enjoy examining popular titles which perhaps never received any form of critical analysis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nh5H_E7TDHg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverlooked Games - \u003c/strong\u003eA shorter, more informal series where I highlight an interesting or innovative aspect of a game\u0027s design which I think has been overlooked in some way in terms of audience or industry recognition.

For the last two years I have tried to juggle working my day job with producing content in my spare time, but it\u0027s often difficult to find a balance between the two as the need to pay bills will always win out in the end.\u00a0Your contribution could help me financially and allow me to spend more time producing these videos and maybe one day even make a living doing something I truly love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that allows you, the fans, to directly fund content that you enjoy, without any third party influence. I really think that YouTube, coupled with Patreon, is changing the way we consume video game media. It means that content creators can work \u003cstrong\u003eindependently\u003c/strong\u003e; free from the pressures and influence of publishers, deadlines, advertisers and distributors. Patreon feels like the only truly viable method for me to be able to support myself financially from making videos without having to compromise in any way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eHOW IT WORKS\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always strive to upload at least once a month but as my videos can take so long to create, I\u0027m not always able to meet that deadline so I think a \u0027per video\u0027 approach to funding is the fairest. Paid videos do \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0include Overlooked Games episodes, you\u0027ll only ever be paying for the longer, more difficult to write/research In-depth Reviews or Game Design videos. The max I\u0027ll ever upload is once per month so whatever you pledge, it would be a monthly pledge at the absolute most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eYOUR REWARDS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eI only have two reward tiers.

(I\u0027m also open to suggestions if there\u0027s something else people would like to see).
