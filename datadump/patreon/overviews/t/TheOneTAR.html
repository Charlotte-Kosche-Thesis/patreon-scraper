    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Tiffany. I really like board games, and I think that not enough people are playing them. Let\u0027s change that. I make videos once a week about games, gaming, or other nerdy topics that I think will help get people more interested in board gaming. Why am I setting up a Patreon? Well, partially because it\u0027s new \u0026amp; shiny and partially because one day I want to quit my day job(did that!)\u00a0and travel the world, telling people about the fantastic hobby of table top gaming. I would like to be able to play games with people all around the world, and share those experiences with the Internet.\u00a0I\u0027m hoping that people who enjoy my work can use Patreon to help support these travel and review goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy don\u0027t I just run ads on my channel? Well.. I hate to watch commercials, so why would I make my viewers watch them? My videos are ad-free and I promise to always keep them ad-free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u0027t a Kickstarter, this is just me putting a digital coffee can next to my videos \u2013 a coffee can that I will tap into when I need to book flights and hotels to GenCon, BGG con, PAX, Origins, or maybe just for an epic cross-country gaming road trip of Awesome. I\u0027m going to keep making videos, as often as I can, so feel free to support me once, monthly, or never. Give as little or as much as you like, all is welcome :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get for helping, aside from that warm glowing feeling deep inside? Well, monthly supporters will (at least) receive access to my Patreon-only feed, where I\u0027ll post updates about what I\u0027m playing, what I\u0027m dying to play, and ask YOU what I should be playing next. There\u0027s even a level for Patreons to get access to a monthly Patreon-only Hangout, where we\u0027ll just chill, talk games, and maybe even play something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhysical goals that we\u0027re working towards together will change, and I\u0027ll be upfront and public about it. So far I\u0027ve used these funds to buy a steadicam rig, a tripod, and plane tickets to PAX South. Now I\u0027m saving up to use these funds over the summer and trips to Gen Con and BGGcon. It\u0027s a never ending road, and I\u0027d like to walk it with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my videos and can\u0027t \u2013 or don\u0027t want to \u2013 support me, that\u0027s fine. I\u0027m glad you swung by and checked out my page, and I hope you have a fantastic game night soon.\u003cbr\u003e"
