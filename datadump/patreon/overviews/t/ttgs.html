    "summary": "Hello and welcome to the TTGS Patreon. I\u0027m just getting\nstarted so things are pretty basic around here for now, but that will change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI like to make things. All kinds of things. I was that kid\nwho loved getting new toys so I could take them apart and put them back\ntogether again. I have a thousand ideas: stories, games, devices, toys,\netc. And I will never know if any of\nthem are any good if I don\u2019t create them. There are so many people out there with ideas,\nbut have no clue where to start to turn the idea into a real thing. I want to be an advocate for creativity in\nall its forms, from invention to art, writing to sculpting, acting to\nengineering. I want to show everyone how\nvital, and how fun it is to not just be creative, but to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI believe the best way for a person to find their creativity\nis through exposure to... well... everything. Not just the end result but the\nwhole process beginning to end, to success or failure.Once you know how something works you can\nimprove it, or combine it with another process to make something totally new.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI make videos, for anyone to watch, that detail my creative\nprocess for many of the ideas I have decided to turn into projects. These\nprojects range from items I want to produce to solve a problem or fill a need\nto board game design to props and cosplay. But, materials aren\u2019t cheap and no\nworkspace ever has \u201cenough tools.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s where you come in. I want to\nchallenge myself, and in doing so show potential creators that ideas can become\nreality, and even if an idea does not work out it was still worth trying. Join\nme, and help expression and creativity flourish.\u003cbr\u003e"
