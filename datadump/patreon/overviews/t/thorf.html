In fact, I want to map the whole world, continent by continent.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBruce brought me in on his Calidar project back in July 2013, and I\u0027ve been working with him on it ever since.  I spent six months of that time developing a digital elevation model for the heart of the setting, the Great Caldera.  But that\u0027s just one small (though important) region of Calidar. \u00a0There\u0027s so much more still to do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn Calidar, Bruce has created not just a world, but a whole solar system, including three major planets, three large moons, three dwarf planets, and an alien dungeon world. \u00a0All of these need mapping, and I can\u0027t wait to roll up my sleeves and start.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy cartographic palette these days is based on 3D digital elevation models, which I use to create pseudo-satellite style maps, as well as more standard topographical maps, and of course the hex maps that I\u0027ve become most well known for.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll of my maps are designed to be as accurate as possible. \u00a0They are georegistered using custom coordinate systems that I have created for each planet. \u00a0This opens up lots of possibilities, from presenting the worlds in different projections, to Google Maps-like interactive interfaces.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut I need your support to do this.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.thorf.co.uk/calidar/images/Calidar-patreon-1a-03.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCalidar Publishing is an indie publisher, financed mostly through Kickstarter, and working on a tight budget to produce the best products possible. \u00a0If Calidar ever becomes big enough for Bruce to employ me full time, I will be there in a heartbeat. \u00a0But in the meantime, financing extensive maps is just not on the cards.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have poured my heart and soul into this project for three years now, and I will continue to do so. \u00a0But with your support, I could do so much more.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo how does this thing work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re familiar with Kickstarter, it\u0027s a similar idea, but on a smaller scale and without an end date. \u00a0The Reward tiers and stretch Goals are very similar.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhere it differs is this: with Patreon, you can pledge to support each map I publish here with however much you like. \u00a0You become a patron of my work, enabling me to create more maps for you all. \u00a0Here\u0027s a quick summary:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eChoose how much to contribute for each map I publish.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eSet a monthly limit for your contribution. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI plan to publish 1-2 maps each month\u003c/strong\u003e, so feel free to set your limit at double your \"per map\" contribution, which means that if I ever publish 3 or more maps in a month, you won\u0027t be charged for them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease, only pledge what you can afford.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 I\u0027d hate to be a drain on your cash flow, so please only pledge from your disposable income. \u00a0If you can\u0027t afford to, know that there are other ways to support my work, such as spreading the word, and sharing my posts on social media. \u00a0Thank you for your kindness! \u00a0You are amazing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinished maps will be released to the Internet\u003c/strong\u003e (at standard resolution), and may be shared freely. \u00a0In fact, please share them and help spread the word about my maps and Calidar!\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eYou can get private access to higher resolution versions at the higher reward tiers. \u00a0These versions are for patrons\u0027 personal use only \u2014 please do not share these files.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAll maps are official World of Calidar maps, produced with the consent and backing of Bruce Heard.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eCopyright for maps belongs to Calidar Publishing, and select maps may appear in future Calidar products. \u00a0Bruce has consented to release the maps I create for this Patreon under a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCreative Commons\u003c/a\u003e Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.thorf.co.uk/calidar/images/Calidar-patreon-1a-04.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally, here\u0027s a special message from Bruce Heard:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"It is with great excitement that I await what new wonderful maps Thorfinn comes up with.
