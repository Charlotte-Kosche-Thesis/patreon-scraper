I devoured books. I read everything from Horror and Science Fiction\nto Political Thrillers, but my main love has always been Fantasy. I used to annoy people to no end, telling\nthem about my ideas until one day in 2001 my wife told me it was time to put up\nor shut up. \u201cWrite that book!\u201d. So I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took me over a year to write my first novel, squeezing\nwriting time in after my work hours. I then spent the next ten years submitting\nmy work to agents and publishers, racking up over 80 rejections before friends\nfinally convinced me to self-publish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn May of 2012 I released the first book of the Bowl of\nSouls Series, \u201cEye of the Moonrat,\u201d on Amazon.\u00a0 Since then I have published two or three books every year and I was able to quit my day job. My books have sold over 200,000\ncopies in Kindle and audiobook formats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHowever, in the last two years something changed in the self-publishing\nlandscape. Amazon doesn\u0027t push indie writers like they used to and many of us have had to go back to day jobs. My sales have suffered as well. I have been trying every\npromotional technique I can, but nothing has worked. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I have to go back to a day job, I will still write but the speed I am able to complete new novels will suffer greatly. This is where Patreon comes in..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://trevorhcooley.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Why-Patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePatreon is a membership platform that makes it easy for creators to get paid\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eand for fans to join in the creation process\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will allow you to go around the traditional publishing system and cut out the middle men. You can pay me directly for the entertainment I am creating and in return\u003cstrong\u003e you will be able to join in the the creation of my books\u003c/strong\u003e. In some tiers of \npatronage I offer rewards like becoming an alpha reader or naming a\n character or even designing a monster.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what tier you choose, all Patrons will gain access to an exclusive community of like minded fans and my Discord server.  I will post constant updates, telling readers where I am in the current novel and other details regarding my books and the worlds they inhabit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, you will be entered into monthly drawings for swag or audiobooks or whatever else I can dream up. Let me know what would interest you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, you could have my help with your work. Are you writing a novel of your own? A short story? I could help you with your process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons are charged at the beginning of each month and you can change your tier of patronage or cancel at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://trevorhcooley.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Where-will-your-money-go.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might wonder what I will do with the money you pay me. Being an independent writer is more expensive than you might think. I have to pay for every aspect of the publishing process such as:\u003cbr\u003e- Office supplies.\u003cbr\u003e- Cover art (Bowl of Souls covers run $700 each).\u003cbr\u003e- Advertising and Marketing. \u003cbr\u003e- Physical copies of books. I do have an inventory I need to keep to bring with me to events.\u003cbr\u003e- Travel expenses: Table space at conventions, hotel rooms, etc . . .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to those work expenses, I have a family of six to support. There may be tight months where sales are bad and your patronage would pay my mortgage or power bill.\u003cbr\u003eAgain, my main goal is to continue to write full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease, join with me. Lets have fun and expand the worlds in my books together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Trevor H. Cooley\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBooks by Trevor H.
