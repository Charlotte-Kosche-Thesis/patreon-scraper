    "summary": "Let\u0027s be real, if you\u0027re here it\u0027s probably because I linked to it on my social media somewhere and you either like the stuff I write on the internet or um, I dunno, maybe you are my ex-wife and you\u0027re just *curious* what I am up to. If it\u0027s the latter, I\u0027m sorry I never bought you a Ferragamo purse or that horse you wanted. If it\u0027s the former though, hey, good to see you, I got some good news for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though I\u0027m not a straight white male improviser named John, I am going to launch a podcast. Yeah, pretty brave of me, I know. It\u0027s called You Can Tell Me Anything, and it\u0027s all about confessions. Every episode, my guest tells me something that they\u0027ve never told anyone before. And then we play a game. It\u0027s pretty fun. Anyways, if you are here it\u0027s because you like the stuff I write on the internet, so I have made the assumption that you will like my podcast too. So that is why this is considered \"good news\" for you. If you actually don\u0027t know who I am, I\u0027m honestly surprised you read this far down.. my name is Teresa Lee and I\u0027m a standup comedian in Los Angeles with a heart \u0026amp; hair of gold and you can learn more about me by going to my website: teresaleecomedy.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast is free to listen/download and I will have it up on Apple Podcasts \u0026amp; wherever you get your podcasts, but if you join the Patreon club, I\u0027ll post exclusive bonus episodes like secret host confessions, shoutouts, and things like that! I\u0027ll even do fan confessions \u0026amp; interviews if you guys are into that kind of thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve already recorded episodes of this podcast \u0026amp; the guests and their stories are really killer. Here are some guests that have been on so far:\u003cbr\u003e- James Austin Johnson\u003cbr\u003e- Kate Willett\u003cbr\u003e- Ever Mainard\u003cbr\u003e- Edgar Momplaisir\u003cbr\u003e- John Trowbridge\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuture guests will include Cracked alums, comedians with credits, comedians with no credits but real cool personalities, and like, whatever I feel like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou Can Tell Me Anything will launch on 4/18/18.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I seem to have over-written this description. So that\u0027s all for now!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
