    "summary": "Hello! This is Destinee and Dazja, but you can call us Des and Dazj for short..\u00a0We are twins currently in the process of being amateur Animators. We don\u0027t have anything to animate yet, but we do pride ourselves in drawing anime/manga, cartoons, and storyboards! A friend recommended this to us as a way to help us show our brand as well as connect with other great creators.\u00a0Even though we draw the same style, you can still tell\u00a0our drawings apart. Note\u00a0it might take Dazj a while to post her art, because she\u0027s a perfectionist when it comes to drawing. We\u00a0also take drawing requests(within reason), so don\u0027t be afraid to ask us to draw anything for fans.\u00a0In the meantime, we\u0027ll draw small comic bits and characters until we advance further. If we advance further then we may make an anime or manga adaptation."
