I\u0027m a gamer who loves to create! I started out working towards a degree in photography and I found a passion in graphic design to go with it. I discovered just how impactful YouTube was for me while dealing with an interesting transitional period in my life. Because of how positive it made me feel, I wanted to try and contribute as much as I could back to those that helped me. I discovered Twitch shortly after and it brought to light a whole new way of getting to communicate with like minded people. I\u2019m hoping to continue to do this as long as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019d like to be able to provide content for as long as I can but right now my time is limited. I\u2019d love to be able to devote more time and energy into creating videos and streaming! If I\u2019m able to meet the current milestone goal, I\u2019ll be able to stream 7 days a week!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main focus has always been on games that I find fun or appealing! A lot of times I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by games that have either been suggested to me that I never thought I\u2019d enjoy, or by games that I\u2019ve stumbled upon. I plan on getting into more mainstream games soon such as Fortnite and other FFA games. I\u2019m currently playing a lot of 7 Days to Die, Don\u2019t Starve, Fallout New Vegas, and other long games on Twitch while on YouTube I focus on Twitch Highlight, Minecraft adventures, Indies games from Itch.io and Game Jolt, as well a story driven action adventure games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you can expect from me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating content is a passion. Patreon will serve as a blog for ideas and a means for me to be able to create more and connect with more people. Here I will be posting my thoughts, potential games I will be playing, different video ideas, sneak peaks to future videos, and more. Rewards for contributions are listed here on the site and all are greatly appreciated, not matter how much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope to never disappoint.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
