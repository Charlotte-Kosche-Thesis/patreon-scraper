    "summary": "Welcome to our patreon. Being in a band is an expensive career choice but we love doing this more than anything else. Every month, as a band we have certain costs; vehicle insurance, bank fees, production fees for our album and much more. As it stands, not a single one of us have made a dime from this project in 2 years and as a matter of fact, we have all put a huge amount of our own personal income to keep this band afloat at times. Every dime, dollar and cent we make as a band goes back into the band.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe past 2 years as a band have been absolutely insane. By the end of our first year of playing together we had played just shy of 100 shows, recorded an EP, toured the United States and Canada as well as crowd funded our debut album which we began recording in February of 2016. Since then we have continued to play shows, toured Eastern Canada and are constantly working on writing new songs, learning new covers and diversifying our sound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon, is a wonderful tool that musicians, artists and creators of all kinds can use to maintain a steady income. If you like what we do and want to be the first to receive our content you can become a patron. From as little as $1 a month you can help us with our monthly expenses and be the first to see our cover videos, new songs, blog posts and much more. The more patrons we have the more we\u0027ll be able to invest in equipment that can also help us create better content for you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what we do, want to hear more and want to support an indie band then why not become a patron to us here on Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove from,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Wilderness (Karl, Henry, Sacha, Jonas)\u003cbr\u003e"
