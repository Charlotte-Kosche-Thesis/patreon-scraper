Life\u0027s a mess, but we might as well have a little fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe 10 year marriage of Micah and Jennie Murphy has produced a LOT of creativity. (Seriously. We have 5 kids.) An instructional technologist by day, by night Micah is a geek-of-all-trades, teacher, web and graphic designer, and foodie. Meanwhile, Jennie followed up on her 8-year tenure as a catechetical leader in the diocese\u0027s largest parish by becoming a stay-at-home mom who handles web, graphics, and social media for a booming seminary and college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn our free time - yes, we somehow have free time on top of all that - we have to let loose and get creative. Micah handles the drawing and Jennie does the sewing. The 5 kids? They do the dishes.\u003cbr\u003e"
