I started Tipharot back in late 2015. Someone asked me once if I could sum up what Tipharot was in one sentence. So, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to try to do now. Actually, no, scratch that, I\u2019m going to do one better than that. I\u2019m going to sum up Tipharot, in just 5 words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA guide to your mind.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe name Tipharot originates from Tiferet, a sephira on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It\u2019s sometimes seen as the heart centre of the Tree of Life. The balance of opposites. This is something I strive for with this channel. Taking our logical, rational mind, into the world of the strange and alien world of our minds, of consciousness, of our dreams, ideas, and subconscious. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to help you to better understand your own mind, and utilise it to its full potential. Taking control over your dreams (both in the sense of the dreams you have at night, and your real world dreams and aspirations). Learning to communicate and work with your subconscious mind. Calming negative thoughts and learning to be happy. All of this and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat happens when you support the channel?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you\u2019re interested in supporting me here on Patreon. First of all, thank you! You\u2019re awesome. You might be wondering what exactly happens when you support the channel. Where does that money go? Do you get anything in return?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell as you may or may not know, I\u2019ve been making YouTube videos full time for a while now. Between ad revenue, product sales, and services like coaching, I make just enough to keep providing awesome content for you guys. As we all know, the YouTube monetisation program has suffered some major blows recently. Ad revenue has dropped, many creators have lost ad revenue entirely, videos are getting demonetised, and it looks like things could get worse before they get better. I\u2019m hoping, with the help of you guys, to get Tipharot to the point that it no longer relies at all on ad revenue, and so even if YouTube were to remove all ads from the channel it wouldn\u2019t matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to protecting the channel from the ups and downs of the many changes to the YouTube partner program, support here at Patreon helps fund awesome things, like the new camera and microphone I bought in March to deliver higher quality videos to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to give something back to you! While I\u2019m sure your support is coming out of your own generosity, I think it\u2019s only fair you get something nice in return. So I\u2019m offering a range of different benefits available to my most dedicated viewers, you, my Patrons! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of April 2018, I\u2019m going to be posting frequent content to my Patreon feed. Posts/articles, behind the scenes, early access videos, special Patron-only videos. There\u2019s going to be a lot coming up! Rather than repeating myself though, hey, look over there to the right. Yes, that big list of tiers. If you scroll to the amount you\u2019d like to pledge in support, you can find out exactly what you\u2019ll get for your support. Remember to read the other tiers too, as you\u2019ll also get all the rewards in previous tiers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again: Thank you. It absolutely amazes me just how generous and supportive so many of you are. Stay awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Matt\u003cbr\u003e"
