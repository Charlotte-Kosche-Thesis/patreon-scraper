    "summary": "Hi friends. \u00a0Feel free to watch the video if you hate reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re about to try something very new for us.  We are going to record, produce, market and distribute the next generation of Kindo songs, without the aid of a record label.  And we are going to do that right here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re also very excited to give you a new Kindo song today for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s how it works. When you make a pledge, you will receive \u0027Human Convention\u0027 free of charge today.  You won\u0027t be charged for your pledge until the second song is released to you next month. \u00a0You\u0027re essentially making a promise to buy our next song in exchange for getting \u0027Human Convention\u0027 today for free. \u00a0By pledging as little as one dollar per song, you will be amongst the first people to own a copy of our new music, as we are creating it. \u00a0These songs won\u2019t be for sale to the public until the album is completely finished, so please don\u2019t upload them to youtube or torrents. \u00a0Just don\u2019t do it. \u00a0Please. \u00a0We\u2019re aiming for a 10 song album here to start, and we\u2019re on track to release a new song each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow let\u2019s imagine some of you want to pledge more than a dollar a song.  God bless you.  We have a bag of goodies we\u2019re cooking up that just might sweeten that sort of arrangement for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I said, if you simply want to pledge a dollar a song, you will be amongst the few and privileged who get to hear our new recordings as they are completed!  They won\u2019t be available to non-patrons until the entire album is complete and officially released and they\u2019ll be delivered in a high quality .mp3 format with original artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next reward tier is for those of you who want to pledge five doll hairs per song.\u003cbr\u003eFor you, we are going to record an exclusive audio commentary and discussion between us on the making of the song, as well as the original demo recording of the song idea.  You\u0027ll receive both .mp3 \u0026amp; 24-bit 48K wav file versions of the new Kindo songs as they are completed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, for those of you with a benevolent obsession with our music, I think you\u2019ll really like what we have for you at the 10 dollar per song tier.  In addition to everything else I\u2019ve just mentioned, you will receive an exclusive video short documenting our musical journey each month.  You will also receive an 8-Bit Remix of the new song being released for that month.  Now, for those who don\u2019t know, we have 8-bit remixes of the last two albums we\u2019ve released. They\u2019re done in the musical stylings of the original 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System.  And we think that\u2019s cool.  While we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s toss in a stripped down acoustic video of a Kindo classic each month.  We might even feature a special guest performer here and there.  And for a little cherry on top, you\u2019ll get a PDF of handwritten lyrics by yours truly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now, here\u2019s what you gotta do. Go to patreon.com and click \u2018sign up\u2019\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can choose to sign-up via Facebook, or just enter your email and a password, and that\u2019s it!  You\u2019ll get our latest song \u2018Human Convention\u0027 for free as a token of our gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs independent recording artists, we, like so many others, have had to find other ways to support ourselves and our families while we\u2019ve struggled to make time to create and produce new songs and recordings.  To be honest, there have been plenty of times where things got so difficult, we each had to wrestle with the very real possibility of hanging up the towel.  That\u2019s just life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then there\u2019s you.  Call yourself a listener, a fan, a patron, a supporter.  It doesn\u2019t matter.  What matters is that every time my bank account got down to double digits, or I\u2019d simply had my fill of sleeping on the floor of a motel 6 room with 3 other dudes and mysterious stains on the carpet just inches from my face... I\u2019d think of you folks... and then it was somehow worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you.  At the very least for giving us a few moments of your time to hear our pitch.  And thank you even more if you decide to support us and what we\u2019re trying to do.  It means the world, and the cold hard reality is, we simply can\u2019t do this without you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really believe this is gonna be the start of an exciting new journey for us.  With your help, We\u2019re gonna make our best music yet, play our most exciting shows, and accomplish things we\u2019ve only dreamed about.  Thank you.  Sign up at patreon.com now, and pledge to your hearts desire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, visit www.thereignofkindo.com for a good time."
