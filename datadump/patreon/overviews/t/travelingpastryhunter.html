That\u0027s where TPH does things differently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTPH recipes take a lot of experimenting before they can be published, especially because most have to be created from scratch. On top of that, the creation process is also far less straightforward than high-carb baking because the gluten, starch, and sugar that would normally provide important structural and textural elements are missing. This means TPH recipes take a lot of extra time, work, and resources when compared with full-carb baking. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs is common for channels and websites that are less than three years old, TPH expenses and income have only just started to break even, meaning the budget is very tight and not much is available to invest in improvements to video quality, website building and other aspects of online business. This is where our Patreon family can make a difference! Whether you can pitch in a few dollars a month, or even a few dozen, you will be directly supporting TPH and helping provide the world with more delicious, decadent desserts that won\u0027t cause insulin resistance or tooth decay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePerks of Being a Patron:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBACKSTAGE PASS ($2 / month): \u003cbr\u003e-- Access to Patron-Only Activity Feed (\u003cem\u003eincluding early-access info on upcoming recipes and eBooks, plus behind-the-scenes looks at how TPH runs and the filming studio\u003c/em\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBACKSTAGE PASS + FREEBIES ($10 / month):\u003cbr\u003e-- Access to the Patron-Only Activity Feed\u003cbr\u003e-- Early access to and FREE downloads of all TPH eCookbooks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTPH ROYALTY ($20 / month):\u003cbr\u003e-- Access to the Patron-Only Activity Feed\u003cbr\u003e-- Early access to and FREE downloads of all TPH eCookbooks!\u003cbr\u003e-- Your name (or username of choice) will be shown in the description of every TPH recipe video going forward, as long as you continue to support at this level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
