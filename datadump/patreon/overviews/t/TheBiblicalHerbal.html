Caregiving came natural to me. I started nursing school for my LVN at 17 years old. I truly loved nursing but as the years passed Western Orthodox medicine went in a direction that I no longer fully supported. Through health issues and trials God brought me to the path of herbalism. As a Messianic believer I consider myself a biblical herbalist. Faith and prayer is an integral part of my work with others, therefore\u00a0I use the word of God, and prayer in my writings and consultations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt\u003ca href=\"http://shatulwellness.com/consultations/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Shatul\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eI provide education and consultations helping people to find Wellness and restoration in every area of their life. Together we go back to Bereshit (the beginning) and find that it is God who created and Planted herbs and provided them for our wellness and nourishment. Together we can reclaim this system of wellness from the roots up.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy desire is to restore the ancient biblical roots of herbal healing to the people of God. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat is why I am walking on this new journey in creating The Biblical Herbal E-Magazine\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eBiblical,\nAccurate, Herbal Wisdom in Your Home\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nI am joining with about a dozen herbalists from different denominations who love Yeshua (Jesus), the bible, and herbs to bring you a resource you and your family can treasure for decades. The Biblical Herbal is a\nquarterly biblical e-magazine providing herbal education articles rooted in God\u2019s Word.\u00a0Our\ndesire is to be a light to the people of God by restoring the\nknowledge of His healing herbs in creation. Bringing wellness deeply\nrooted in the word of God. The e-magazine will have articles to speak\nto the housewife and mom trying to care for her family as well as for\nthose who desire more advanced academic and accurate knowledge of herbs.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur first issue is set to come out in March with a focus of restoration, deliverance, Spring, and Passover.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\"Patreon is a way to pay your favorite creators (ie. me) for making the stuff you love.\"( ie. herbal creations). You can choose to support this journey of creating The Biblical Herbal by pledging your financial support per article sample, video, blog or other creation posted on the members only blog.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is not the actual magazine subscription. How to subscribe to the magazine will be announced with herbal joy in the coming months!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eWhy should you become a patron?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eIf you are reading about this journey in Biblical herbalism and it resonates with you, becoming a patron is a way to assist in bringing it to fruition. Your pledges will go to pay for the start up, as well as continued cost of \u003cem\u003emagazine creation and perhaps support in future projects.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eThe content at Shatul\u0027s blog as well as blog post on the upcoming The Biblical Herbal E-Magazine website are all still free. For pledging a per creation amount you receive varying levels of\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cem\u003erewards,\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e starting with access to the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003emembers only Patreon community, a blog, and activity feed\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e where you can learn from the creations you pledged as well as comment, discuss, or ask questions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eH\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eow much should I pledge?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003ePatreon works different than other crowdfunding in that you pledge per creation and not a set one time amount. Therefore you can pledge as little as $1 per creation or upwards of $100 per creation. My current plan is to post no more than 4 creations a month but will be sure to update this if that changes. If I post 4 creations that month you pay your pledge per each creation. Pledges continue on an ongoing basis each month until you cancel. This way you can continuously support the vision and journey of creating The Biblical Herbal E-Magazine and if desired any future projects, with the ability to cancel at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you on a limited budget and worry I might get crazy with posting tons of great content you can\u0027t afford? No worries you can set a max monthly pledge amount to fit your budget. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you want to make a one time pledge only? You can do that by donating via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick\u0026amp;hosted_button_id=V244E4DTUC6NQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePaypal.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eWhere will the money go?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThe current goal is to get $300 worth of pledges per creation per month. That would be 300 people pledging $1, 3 people pledging $100 per creation, or any combination. This will provide approximately $1200 (with 4 creations) to help pay for the cost of the website, magazine, social media, and affiliate creation. My son Richard and I are working many hours every day to get this magazine project off the ground while scraping our nickels together just to pay any fees. \u00a0All monies will go to pay fees, and cover the costs of our time and effort. What my son is providing his mom (free)\u00a0alone in website creation is worth hundreds if not thousands of dollars, therefore I am eternally grateful and would love to see him compensated.
