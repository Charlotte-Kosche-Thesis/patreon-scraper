    "summary": "Hi, welcome to my Patreon page. Thanks for caring enough to visit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an editor and author by trade, but the central theme of my life is my endeavour to live in peace and clarity and help others to do the same by using my creative talents. Over the last couple of years I\u0027ve been\u00a0writing and vlogging on the theme of reflections on the spiritual path, most recently writing for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://whatnow727.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhat Now? Blog\u003c/a\u003e, and vlogging on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOXdrQZwAjK5SZMLF57qdOw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLiving in Peace and Clarity You Tube Channel\u003c/a\u003e on the topic of procesing revelations of abuse in my Tibetan Buddhist community.\u00a0Prior to that I recorded\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5POHREycYL8sEy4fQzGCfGQcDrx_DIDa\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHappiness Hints\u003c/a\u003e interviews\u00a0as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://happinesshints.podbean.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epodcasts\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eand vlogs, and wrote\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tahlianewland.com/bookshop/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evisionary novels\u003c/a\u003e as well as contemplative\u00a0blog posts on my personal website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI set up this page when I needed patron support because I was involved in full time volunteer work supporting victims of emotional, physical, sexual and spiritual abuse in my Buddhist community and during that time I had no means of income. Now that I have re-established my editing business, I no longer need the ongoing financial support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I can get enough contributors, however, I may collate a book about abuse in my Buddhist community. The idea is that such a book will be a healing tool for those writing it and for those reading it. At this stage I can\u0027t say if it will happen or not, but if it does, I will create a separate page to raise the money to pay for editing and publishing such a book. The time involved to do so will be enormous and I can\u0027t afford to take that time away from my paying clients, so I will need financial support to complete such a project. Any income from sales would be shared amongst contributors or given to an appropriate charity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course,\u00a0 if you would like to support my blogging and vlogging generally, you are still welcome to become a patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.tahlianewland.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC08409WEB.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
