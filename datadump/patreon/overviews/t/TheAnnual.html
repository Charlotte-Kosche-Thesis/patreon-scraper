Now the world has its answer. It all started in 2012 when Cullen Dolson and Kevin Cole met Susan Daughtry, the staff chaplain at an Episcopal Summer Camp where the two worked, the infatuation was instant. By 2013 it had evolved to recurring desperation as the two would proclaim \u201cMarry Me!\u201d after every interaction with Susan despite the fact that she was married, residing with her husband on the same mountain. Eventually, Kevin and Cullen would have to justify their frequent proclamations of love and Marry Me would be born.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e---\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNot only are you helping to cultivate art and conversation, but we\u0027ve got a plethora of print editions of The Annual that we will gladly send your way as a thank you for your pledge.
