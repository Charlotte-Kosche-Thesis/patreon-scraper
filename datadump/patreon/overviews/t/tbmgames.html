    "summary": "Hello, everyone! My name is Christopher Knapp. I\u0027ve been playing fantasy tabletop role-playing games since 2009, starting with 4th Edition Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, but I\u0027ve played a smattering of just about everything from AD\u0026amp;D to Pathfinder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the biggest jobs as a game master is to tell interesting stories while still giving your players control over their own characters. To that end, I have found myself writing large amounts of content to augment my stories, from new player options to new monsters and a campaign setting which I\u0027ve used since 2011. With Fifth Edition quickly becoming my go-to tabletop RPG for its simplicity and flexibility and my own background in game design and development, it seemed natural to decide to make a blog which provides Fifth Edition content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.tbmgames.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTBM Games\u003c/a\u003e is a blog devoted to producing new Fifth Edition content for both players and storytellers and offering reviews of tabletop gaming books published by groups whom you may not have heard of. The dream, someday, would be to produce physical supplements to the games I enjoy, but for now, I\u0027ll be sticking with creating free blog posts and, once a collection is finished, paid PDF compilations(with some content which won\u0027t be available online).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage would go towards each \u003cem\u003eoriginal \u003c/em\u003earticle I write, meaning that your pledges would be for 5E content that I specifically write rather than reviews, miscellaneous plugs, or guest posts. These contributions would primarily go towards improving the site, allowing me to cover costs associated with running the website, hire artists to illustrate future content, and, as a last priority, purchase new books and gaming accessories to review(since I\u0027m likely to use those for personal entertainment anyhow!).\u003cbr\u003e"
