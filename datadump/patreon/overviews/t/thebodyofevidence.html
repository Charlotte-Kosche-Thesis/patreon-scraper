    "summary": "We are a scientist and a\nmedical doctor--science communicators who joined forces in 2015 to bring good\nscience to health issues you care about. Our podcast is a labour of love, which\ninvolves not just us but fantastic collaborators like comedians and musicians. We\nalso make videos about crucial concepts in science in order to promote\nscientific literacy. We have thrown an amazing stage show together once; have\ndone two live podcast recordings at Montreal\u2019s biggest English-language science\nsymposium; and at least one of us is regularly featured on the radio and on TV\n[J: yeah, yeah Chris, big deal. Do you have a 6000-view video on YouTube?\nDidn\u2019t think so].\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll of this work represents\nweeknights and weekends of research, production, and editing. Want to help us\nmake it even better? This is your chance!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Pitch\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIs it true?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDoes taking massive doses of\nvitamins really reduce the size of a cancerous tumour? Are pharmaceutical\ncompanies poisoning us with chemicals and is \u201cnatural\u201d where it\u2019s at? Should we\nall be gluten free? or fat free? or carb free? Can the signs of ageing be\nreversed with a 300$ tube of beauty cream?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Internet allows fantasies to\nthrive, but your health (and wallet) should not be the target of nonsense.\nThere is a body of evidence out there, and Dr. Christopher Labos and Jonathan\nJarry are staring it right in the face.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThrough a podcast, a shared blog,\nand videos (and even appearances on the radio and in person), we explore what\nreproducible evidence has to say on important medical topics, and how\nscientific thinking shouldn\u2019t be the sole purview of researchers. The bickering\nis just the cherry on top.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListen at: http://www.bodyofevidence.ca (also on iTunes, Google Play, and Stitcher!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Christopher Labos\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDr. Christopher Labos is a cardiologist with a\ndegree in epidemiology and biostatistics. He spends most of his time doing\nthings that he doesn\u2019t get paid for, like doing research, teaching, and\npodcasting. Occasionally, he finds time to practice as a cardiologist so he can\npay his rent. He realizes that half of his research findings will be disproved\nin five years: he just doesn\u2019t know which half. He is a freelance contributor\nfor the Montreal Gazette, National Post, and Globe and Mail, and has also\nappeared on CBC Radio and CBC Television. To date, no one has recognized him on\nthe street.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eJonathan\nJarry\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJonathan Jarry is a biological scientist born\nand bred in Canada who once worked for the U.S. Armed Forces, using the power\nof DNA technology to identify really old American soldiers. He has also helped\nto characterize a new form of muscular dystrophy and spent many years in a\nclinical laboratory, designing assays and managing rapid-turnover diagnostic\ntests which allow physicians to make informed decisions regarding cancer\npatient care. He is a rationalist who believes each and every person should be\nempowered with the necessary knowledge to make rational, informed decisions\nabout their health and the world around them. And he wears waistcoats. The\nworld better get used to it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe\nPlea\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWould you consider a gift of a few dollars each\nmonth to contribute to the work that we do?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHave a look at our goals to know what you\u2019d be\nhelping us with, and take a gander at our reward system.
