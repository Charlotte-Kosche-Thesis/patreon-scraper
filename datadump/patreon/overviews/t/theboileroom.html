    "summary": "Hello!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Boileroom is a music and arts community hub in Guildford. For 10 years we have been producing live music events at our 300 capacity music venue. Over the years we have developed our programming considerably, bringing national and international touring acts to Guildford like Soweto Kinch, Ed Sheeran, Catfish \u0026amp; The Bottlemen, Reel Big Fish, The Bronx, First Aid Kit (to name a few); as well as booking for external events like The Boileroom stage at Redfest, Guildford Beer Festival, Magic Summer Live, and Staycation Godalming. 2016 saw the launch of our very own 8,000 capacity, green-living community, music, food and arts festival, Always The Sun at Guildford\u0027s Stoke Park.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e We are avid supporters of our local creative community and have many projects that we run, including:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrash Canteen: \u003c/strong\u003eWorking in partnership with Waitrose and FareShare; Trash Canteen serves Pay-What-You-Feel cafe serving healthy, vegetarian meals with surplus food. Unfortunately due to financial constraints, we have had to close the cafe temporarily while we find a new kitchen partner. Do email lydia@theboileroom.net if you think this is something you could assist with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Project: \u003c/strong\u003eCommunity youth music programme for 8-19 year olds, currently engaged with over 50 young people providing mentoring, performance opportunities and apprenticeships (currently running 8-10 work placements each year). The Project aims to give young musicians who are just starting out the experience of performing to a live audience, assisting in finding their creative identity and guidance on their journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePunk Rock Yoga:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Punk Rock Yoga classes are dynamic and designed help you Look, Work, Accept and Transcend in both body and mind.\u00a0Like the punk genre, the music is quite varied and ranges from acoustic skate punk to hardcore, as well as throwing in some ambient post-rock songs for sequences and pranayama.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGamer\u0027s Lounge: Retro Gaming Club:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eDelve into nostalgia at The Boileroom\u0027s Gamers Lounge, and play games systems from the 90s including:\u00a0Nintendo 64 SEGA Mega Drive Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Super Nintendo (SNES). The Gamers Lounge is a great way to come and meet like minded people, and is open to all ages. The Gamers Lounge is open on Saturdays once a month from 12pm - 4pm, and entry is a \u00a35 donation, which goes towards getting more retro games for each club.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDrink \u0026amp; Draw: \u003c/strong\u003eDrink \u0026amp; Draw is the perfect place to enjoy drawing, and getting to know the Guildford creative community. Bring your sketchbooks, pens, pencils, and if you\u0027re feeling generous, some of your favourite equipment to share. Drink \u0026amp; Draw is free to attend, but we accept donations to help us fund future drawing events - life drawing, artist tutorials, sketching trips and more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014/2015 we were awarded the title of Best Bar None overall winner and also picked up the award for Best Independent Pub. Unanimously selected by the judges, we were praised for exceeding Best Bar None criteria, for its excellent community and charity engagement, and for investment in young people. We were also applauded for taking the emphasis of pub life away from \u0027vertical drinking\u0027 by providing a place of entertainment that offered a positive and safe experience to our customers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe were also the 100th venue to be awarded Bronze status from Attitude Is Everything, an organisation that improves deaf and disabled people\u0027s access to live music - inclusivity is really important to us, we believe that there should be no barriers for anyone to enjoy live music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, we were\u00a0included in Guildford Borough\u0027s Council\u2019s list of Assets of Community Value.\u00a0An Asset of Community Value (ACV) is land or property of importance to a local community which is subject to additional protection from development under the \u003ca href=\"http://theboileroom.createsend1.com/t/i-l-kdtydjt-l-y/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLocalism Act 2011\u003c/a\u003e. Assets can be nominated by parish councils or by groups with a connection with the community. The acceptance of the nomination highlights The Boileroom\u2019s work in furthering the social well-being, and social interest of the local community. We were also awarded the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://theboileroom.createsend1.com/t/i-l-kdtydjt-l-j/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBest Entertainment Venue\u003c/a\u003e by both Surrey Life and Guildford\u2019s Best Bar None awards in 2016, and managing director Dominique Frazer was also named as one of the \u003ca href=\"http://theboileroom.createsend1.com/t/i-l-kdtydjt-l-t/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e50 most influential figures in independent music\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor 12 years, we have developed and thrived without financial aid; but due to many factors this has become increasingly difficult, and to ensure our survival we are reaching out to our local community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need your help to continue with this work and develop our new creative space, we love what we do with a passion that is limitless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease invest in us so that we can continue to invest in Guildford\u0027s creative community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
