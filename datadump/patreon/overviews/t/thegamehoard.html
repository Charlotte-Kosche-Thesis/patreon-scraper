What I am good at is playing video games and thinking about them way too much, so I\u0027ve decided to put those skills to use. With no limits on what kind of game genre I enjoy, I hope to bring you critique on all kinds of games from all throughout the medium\u0027s history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://thegamehoard.com\"\u003eThe Game Hoard\u003c/a\u003e is part of my goal to play every video game ever released, and along the way, I hope to be able to give my thoughts on the games I\u0027ve experienced to help others find great games, help them avoid bad ones, and just join them in exploring the things that make the video game medium so captivating. With my easy to understand rating scale, I hope to create a format that is both entertaining and informative!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bd5YK2c03XQ/Wbo2HxJwWXI/AAAAAAAACdc/NfZOSeMS0WIhIPwO4vQaV2-nj204uwEIwCLcBGAs/s1600/The+Scale.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eRather than using a rating scale that has numbers that are up to interpretation, you\u0027ll be able to tell how good a game is based on a simple word and color rating! I try to write my reviews with a professional air, only deviating into humorous articles for the Disaster Report series on the worst games ever made. For the most part, expect high quality articles on games for all systems and from all eras!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I hope you\u0027ll join me on this journey!
