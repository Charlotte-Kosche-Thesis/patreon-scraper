Kaiju Files - \u003c/em\u003ea series of profiles for various giant monsters/kaiju in my upcoming novel, \u003cem\u003eThe Atomic Time of Monsters.\u003cbr\u003eThe Midgaheim Bestiary\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0- a fictional biology text covering the various fantastical monsters of Midgaheim, my vaguely-Medieval European fantasy setting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many more but this summary is already a bit long.\u00a0 Horror Flora will update with one article for every ten dollars my patreon brings in a month - since each article takes at least an hour to make, that\u0027s roughly minimum wage.\u00a0 If this patreon ever gets into truly ludicrous amounts of money I\u0027ll probably have to amend this - maybe bring in some other creators to really get you your money\u0027s worth - but that\u0027s unlikely to happen anytime soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to getting updates to the website, backers will get exclusive access to concept art for future illustrations as well as rough drafts of novels I am working on, including the long awaited book \u003cem\u003eThe Atomic Time of Monsters\u003c/em\u003e, which starts the giant green retrosaur Tyrantis you\u0027ve probably heard so much about from my past work as an unpaid blogger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting and drawing while working several part time jobs and constantly searching for better part time or full time work is difficult, and it\u0027s thanks to support form people like you that I can manage it!\u00a0 Thank you!"
