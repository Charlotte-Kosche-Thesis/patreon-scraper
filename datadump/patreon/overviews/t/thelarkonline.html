If you are on Patreon, you already have some affinity for that kind of thinking. \u003cem\u003eThe Lark\u003c/em\u003e is a curated expression of that notion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, we wanted to build this platform together from the ground up and get our hands as dirty as possible in the process-- we wanted to build the website together, learn to code together, reach out to contributors together, screen submissions together, talk through our visions together, adapt together, learn together. \u00a0Collaboration, transparency, and adaptability make up the bones of \u003cem\u003eThe Lark\u003c/em\u003e. It is always changing and evolving as we learn, in small and subtle ways-- and we are doing our best to listen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Lark\u003c/em\u003e is able to support artists and thinkers by virtue of support from people who believe that the ubiquity of the internet is not a reason to accept diminished quality in publications, or to skip supporting contributors. We believe the very opposite is true. This publication is able to be what it is, for those who want it to be what it is, without selling advertising or subscriptions, simply because we asked people if that was something they would be willing to help see in the world. The answer was, and continues to be, a resounding yes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining us in this journey-- it is humbling and heartening to know that people support our vision of the arts and want to help us hold this particular door open.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith love and gratitude,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEmily Heinz\u003cbr\u003e\u0026amp;\u003cbr\u003eLaine Leah Kuehn,\u003cbr\u003eCreators and Co-Editors\u003cbr\u003e"
