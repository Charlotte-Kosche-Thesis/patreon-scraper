    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"https://tango.capital\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTango Capital\u003c/a\u003e brings the music, dance, lyrics, history, people, and happenings of tango to Australia and around the world in English on radio. Exploring linkages and connections between elements and aspects of tango over the last century or so, Tango Capital brings a 21st century perspective to the only Australian radio program and associated podcast dedicated to tango. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s right- Tango Capital is a weekly one-hour radio program PLUS a podcast of 20 to 40 minutes, 2 to 3 times a month, together with a blogsite at \u003ca href=\"https://tango.capital\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTango Capital\u003c/a\u003e. You understand that there is a lot of research, networking, and interviewing needed for that, plus studio time and infrastructure costs for recording equipment also required to make it all happen. Your support through Patreon will enable these essential requirements to be met on an ongoing basis, making Tango Capital interesting, wide-ranging, and reliable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen considering sponsoring this podcast, please understand that copyright restrictions around the world prevent inclusion of much of the music that is  a key part of the radio program. But there is a lot more depth to the material than will fit into a radio broadcast, and so I will be able to bring uncut interviews and extended material to podcast patrons. In other words, the two media are complementary. So listeners to the radio program will still enjoy and benefit from the podcast.  And if you can\u0027t make it to the radio broadcast then you will find the podcast an invaluable guide to the world of tango around Australia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can you help? Sponsorship is for a small amount per month on an ongoing basis, and so you can manage your finances Patreon allows you to cap your pledges to a maximum monthly amount.\u00a0 Of course, the main reason you want to support the Tango Capital is \nbecause you also want to support tango, and please also check out the rewards for some suggested amounts that are my way of saying\u003cem\u003e Thank You\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to meeting you in the Tango Capital \u003cimg src=\"https://www.facebook.com/images/emoji.php/v5/z4c/1/16/1f642.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...ann\u003cbr\u003e"
