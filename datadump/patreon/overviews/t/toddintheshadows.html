Who are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m a guy who listens to pop music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd since 2009, I\u0027ve had an Internet video series where I discuss the most overplayed songs on the radio in-depth, under the name Todd in the Shadows. I call myself that because I do this under the cover of shadow while I play my piano.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a silly gimmick. But it\u0027s a silly show! You can\u0027t sit and talk about Pitbull songs without being kind of goofy. But in between the silly jokes, I like to think I provide an insightful and witty look into the music most people write off as disposable junk. Because I don\u0027t hate pop music; I \u003cem\u003elove \u003c/em\u003epop music. I love listening to it, writing about it, analyzing what each song means.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what specifically do you look at?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have two main shows: the first is the one I started with, Todd\u0027s Pop Song Reviews, where I take one current smash hit song and take it apart, break it down line by line, see what parts work and what doesn\u0027t, and analyze where it fits within both current trends and the artists\u0027 body of work. And I might liven this up with a bunch of jokes, perhaps by injuring myself in a comical way. Ha ha!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other main show is One Hit Wonderland, where I take a look at the full careers of bands and artists known for only one song. This series is a trip through music history, as seen through the prism of a particular artist who only had one hit before fading from memory. Why did they fail? Who came along to replace them? Were they any good? Did they deserve better?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with those I do quite a few specials along the way -- Top Tens and Bottom Tens at the end of every year, plus for randomly selected years every so often; reviews of badly received pop-star movie vehicles; vlogs of major musical events like the Grammys; and whatever else passes my fancy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I give you my money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecause my show is awesome! And I\u0027ve been giving it to you for free for years!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, there are rewards! Pledge up to $10 a video and you get your name in the credits. Plus I\u0027m planning some exclusives! Perhaps some other things as I see fit! Let\u0027s find out together!\u003cbr\u003e"
