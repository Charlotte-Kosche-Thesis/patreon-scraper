My first goal is to get enough in donations so that the show pays for itself. My second goal is for the donations to be able to cover all of the cool things I \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to do with the show. Lastly, the stretch goal is to make enough money from the show that I can retire for my full time job and begin working on TW full time as well as creating awesome new shows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here and you don\u0027t feel like the show is worth contributing to then that\u0027s cool. I don\u0027t want you to feel any pressure and I won\u0027t think less of you. In fact, I\u0027d like to thank you for listening. I think you\u0027re awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand, if you feel like you\u0027ve gotten something out of the show and you want to begin to support it then would love for you to choose a tier on the right hand side of the page and set up a donation. I can\u0027t wait for the day when I can open up the Trivial Warfare Army page on the website and see a huge list of people and where they are in the army.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for all of your support!\u003cbr\u003eJonathan\u003cbr\u003e"
