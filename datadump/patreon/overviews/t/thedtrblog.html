My name is Kristina Harutoonian and I\u0027m the main awkward storyteller behind\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thedtrblog.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe DTR Blog\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy best friend Sammie and I started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thedtrblog.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe DTR Blog\u003c/a\u003e a year ago to talk about the more \u003cstrong\u003etaboo topics within christian culture\u003c/strong\u003e - things like mental breakdowns, therapy, and whether or not it\u0027s okay to take anti-depressants. (uhh yes.)\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eOur goal is to help readers define their relationship with God, themselves, and others through stories of faith, dating, mental health, and of course, comedy.\u003c/strong\u003e We found that people were dying to be real and share their experiences in a safe community - to take the mask OFF. We opened up the floor for people to do just that...and the resu\u003cimg\u003elt was overwhelming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe received story after story of people wanting to talk about their journeys with things like \u003cstrong\u003edepression, ptsd, broken dating relationships, sex, porn, divorces, homosexuality etc.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eWe found that comedy was a great way to break down the barriers and let people know that it\u0027s okay to talk about this stuff and be honest about their struggle.\u003c/strong\u003e I for one, have a hard time being serious all the time, and will crack a joke when I feel uncomfortable. \u003cstrong\u003eI live for these awkward funny moments in life. \u003c/strong\u003eMy therapist says I prob need to work on this but I do love laughing\u00a0my way through life and connecting with all of you through it...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSince then, we have grown and expanded our vision into a podcast and live videos, along with resources to help you in your weaker moments of life.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eOur podcast is only 4 episodes in, but listeners are already voicing their interest in being open and real about what it\u0027s like to walk as a Christian in things like social media, self-image, and dating relationships. With a missions and bible education background, I hold a strong belief in following the example Jesus left us to walk on this earth, while also being vulnerable about how difficult that can feel sometimes. Sammie being newly married and me, #notsomarried, we use the podcast as a platform to share the things we talk about in private, in hopes that people can come to a place of honesty and freedom within themselves and with God. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no shame in our game. Or our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thedtrblog/\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe like to tag ourselves as, \"not quite your Proverbs 31 woman,\u0027 not because we don\u0027t support women who identify with this tagline, but more because we don\u0027t consider ourselves perfect or try to be anything other than who we are, Kristina and Sammie. We want people to take off the mask and show the real them, without the filter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe use social media to create humor and memes, but also to ask questions and create scenarios so we can here from YOU. Thats why we do this. We are passionate about hearing your stories, and we love when our followers share their opinions and voice their concerns via social media, or through our blog.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur vision has expanded and we hope to bring DTR to you\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eWe want to create live podcast gatherings where we come to your city and bring a roundtable discussion along with interviews, comedy (can we please make fun of Christian Mingle the movie together), and forums for you guys to share your stories live, and hear from people just like you, going through the same thing. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition - I have a dream to write a devotional for the \u0027not so perfect Christian woman\u0027...something that\u0027s fun and raw and obviously funny, from the perspective of a 31 year old navigating things like dating and how much sex I\u0027m \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e having. FOR REAL THO.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to THANK YOU so much for your support on this journey of ours, and we are so excited for whats to come. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll find the ways in which you can partner with us, and what you\u0027ll get in return in the Patron section - exclusive #uncensored cuts (maybe too saucy for mainstream christian world, and some real-life devotions by yours truly). We\u0027ll even throw in a t-shirt....obviously.\u003cbr\u003e"
