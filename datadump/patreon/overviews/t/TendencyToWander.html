(THANK YOU for being here!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn June of 2017 we left Boston, MA and set out on a yearlong road trip with our\ntwo cats \u2013 Duncan and Kodachrome \u2013 and our VW camper van. Our goal: to amplify voices in small towns and big cities, to discover what makes each place tick, and to appreciate the diverse beauty of our country. From mountain towns to Big Sky, we\u0027re out to document it all - and we want to share this adventure with you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n Along the way\nwe\u0027re taking in freelance projects, commercial photography campaigns, photographing\nweddings, events, and anything and everything to help pay the bills. We\u0027re using this time to tell the story of our\nadventures and to see what we can discover in this big ol\u0027 country of ours.\n\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in - by joining us on this adventure, you\u0027re helping us create the work that otherwise can\u0027t be made.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBy backing us at any level you\u0027ll have access to photos and behind the scenes\nstories. We\u0027ll also be sharing travel tips, from the best ice cream in each town we visit to how to best travel with a disability. We also will share interesting articles about places, ideas, and\npeople, as well as links to other artists\u2019 collections; we\u0027d love for this to be a\nspace for thinking about photography. We\u0027ll be making monthly videos about\nour favorite photos and adventures,\u00a0as well as regular interviews with\nthe\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/campercats\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCamper Cats\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is not just an online tip jar (although we really do appreciate the\nfinancial and emotional tips!) - by backing us you\u0027ll be receiving monthly\npackages of prints and postcards as we share our experiences with you. Take a\nlook at our various tiers of support and see what might work for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e\n- let\u0027s make some photos!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
