With your support, I can continue creating work that transports the viewer to another time and place. I also will be able to prioritize creating my best, most ideal work, rather than work that does not align with my visions in order to pay the bills. My backers will enable me to continue capturing incredible moments to share, and there are still so many stories to tell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, Patreon does not grant my account the \"Pay Up Front\" option.
