    "summary": "I have been running a YouTube channel related to hockey since May of 2016. I have videos on my channel pertaining to all 31 teams. Yes, I have videos for the Vegas Golden Knights. I also have done videos regarding defunct or moved franchises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I looked at the hockey landscape online, I found a lot of Toronto-centered shows and channels. I found this to a lesser extent for the other Canadian teams as well. The easiest way for me to build this beast would be to discuss the Canadian teams and ignore the American ones. It would also be a fool\u0027s errand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support me here? You get my content free on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI agree. I do. That\u0027s why I provide certain content here which is not accessible to my main YouTube channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t have dreams of wealth from doing this. I know that there are plenty of options online for you to get news regarding the NHL. I try to add my own slant on things, maintain my honesty and admit if I am wrong or flat out don\u0027t know the answer to a question. I will seek out the answer though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver 15,000 people have subscribed to watch me talk about hockey. That makes this channel the most important part of my life I am not related to. Hey, a wife and kids tend to come first or they\u0027ll be gone first. I try to include them at points and my cats appear in my videos because they are cats. They don\u0027t take instruction.... ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also maintain a solid upload rate during the summer while other sportscasters take time off or talk about other sports instead. Why talk about other sports when hockey is so awesome? I also have over 100 jerseys now so I can do numerous videos ranking them in different ways and I am going to do exactly that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome for the comments section. Stay for the fun and continued evolution of something special that we are building with this channel. I say we because the comments section is kept largely clean thanks to the amazing group who frequents my channel. Good, honest debate is always welcome here. So, if you find you\u0027re curious enough to throw a dollar a month to support me, you get a thumbs up from me. If you don\u0027t and instead watch the channel and subscribe, you get no less respect from me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for being a part of something special.\u003cbr\u003e"
