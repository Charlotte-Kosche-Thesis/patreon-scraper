I\u0027m going to try to work about 20 hours a week on freelance work and 20 hours a week on ministry. This is certainly a leap for me, but it\u0027s not a leap for God. His plans don\u0027t always make sense, and they do require faith, but they also lead us to a better place. And that\u0027s where I want to be\u2014wherever God is leading. If my videos are valuable to you, I ask you to\u00a0consider joining with me. Even a few dollars a month would help a lot (but please don\u0027t feel obligated\u2014this is really just for people who have been impacted by my videos that want to give back). Video equipment is costly too, and my hope is to keep improving and making the content on my channel as professional as possible. With your help, these videos can be a tool to\u00a0change lives and introduce Jesus to many people who need Him.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eImpact / Testimonies\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral months ago, I shared a video on Youtube in which I encourage viewers to pray with me to receive Jesus as their Lord and Savior.
