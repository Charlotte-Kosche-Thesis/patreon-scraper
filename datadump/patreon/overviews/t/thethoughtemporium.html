    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Justin and I\u0027m the guy behind \"The Thought Emporium\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some examples of the sorts of things I do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cjClTnZ4Xh4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd a few more:\u003cbr\u003eHow DPSS lasers work:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF2RDJISnAs\u003cbr\u003eDeveloping a permanent treatment for lactose intolerance:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3FcbFqSoQY\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this channel back in high school as a way to learn at my own pace, and then share what I learned with the world. Back then, I realized that my problem with school wasn\u2019t the content, it was simply the way it was conveyed. So I started experimenting in my home lab and recording everything I did. I thought that if just 1 person saw my stuff and learned something and maybe were entertained more than a regular class it\u2019d be worth it. And 8 years later I\u2019m still at it and I couldn\u0027t have done it without the continued support of my amazing audience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little over a two and a half years ago, I decided to change directions a little bit. Rather than mostly replicating experiments out of textbooks to learn about the basics, I decided I wanted to do real research and show that off instead. This way, people could see that science isn\u2019t a thing that\u2019s confined to shiny expensive labs. Anyone, anywhere could do it, and push human knowledge a little further. However while I make sure that my work is as accessible as possible, science still comes at a price.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore I continue, I just want to say a preemptive thank you. If you\u0027ve made it this far, it means you like what I do and care about the continued production of science videos. You also probably have an idea of what goes into making each video. Especially in a time when science is being demonized, you have my eternal gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor every minute of screen time, it can take me anywhere from 1-8 hours of time in the edit/animation booth. Right now, every graphic, animation and more is done by myself. And for every 1 video that makes it out, there are 3-4 experiments that either didn\u0027t work, or didn\u0027t make it to the final edit. This represents a huge investment of both time and money on my part. While I try and make my experiments as accessible as possible by trying to only use readily available materials, even the cheapest experiment will take half a dozen trys to get right. This means going through a lot of consumables.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what will your donations do? Well first and foremost, they\u0027ll help offset the cost for the raw materials to do the experiments. This means I can try more exciting experiments and make more videos more often. Beyond that I\u0027ll be able to invest in better equipment to record the videos. Things like a new high def camera, lighting, mics and more. Eventually I\u0027d also like to be able to hire a proper animator and maybe even an editor so I can spend more of my time making content and less time editing. Beyond that the money will go towards keeping food on the table. Right now I work a second job on top of making videos and research so I can pay the bills but what I really want is for this to be my full time job. I love making content for you and I want to be able to have more free time to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow other than a deluge of new videos and my eternal gratitude, you\u0027re probably wondering what you get for your donations. There are great rewards at every level. The lower rewards give you access to the patron only feed, access to the occasional patron only live stream, and the opportunity to ask questions and suggest topics for the grab bag videos. Higher levels come with a selection of free merch, and credit at the end of every video. For even higher levels, I\u0027ll help you design an experiment so you can do science wherever you are! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for taking the time to check out my page and read this far. I really couldn\u0027t do this without you and appreciate all of your ongoing support\u003cbr\u003e"
