So too has the art of\nspeed running (beating games quickly). However, there are no definitive\npodcasts about speed running retro games\u2026UNTIL NOW!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJoin us, Chad (holder of\nmany world records and general video game kick ass) and John (collector of\ngames and speed runner of adequate merit), as we review some of your favorite\nold games, along with ones you perhaps have never heard of! This podcast is\nintentionally directed to both casuals that just like to play video games and\nto serious speed runners. All are welcome! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy pledging to this\npodcast, you will assist us in creating a fun and informative podcast with\ncontent that you cannot find in any other podcast. The incentives listed will also\nhelp us create other content we think you will enjoy. Contributions will also help us pay to host our podcast and to purchase decent equipment to improve our sound quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhether you intend to\npledge or not, please feel free to check us out on iTunes and leave a review\nwith your feedback!

This money will also help pay our talented producer who makes this podcast happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do I find the podcast/contact you guys?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFind us at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theframesavers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.theframesavers.com\u003c/a\u003e!
