    "summary": "First of all, thank you for even being on this web page to read this sentence. That means you\u0027re considering supporting what I do, which means you\u0027ve gotten something meaningful out of what I do, and that is a great compliment, which I must recognize.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePresuming that you\u0027ve listened to the podcast I make,\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cocaineandrhinestones.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCocaine \u0026amp; Rhinestones: The History of Country Music\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, you know that I throw my entire life in to creating every single episode. I\u0027ll spare you a list of the details but creating an average episode takes around 100 hours of work. The first season has 14 regular episodes and it took me seven months to make. That\u2019s two 40 hour work weeks plus 10 hours every weekend per episode. There are no research assistants. There is no recording engineer, script doctor, producer or editor of any kind. It\u0027s all me, which is the way I believe it has to be in order to come out the other side of that process with this podcast. As you can imagine, it\u2019s not possible for me to have any sort of job while creating \u003cem\u003eCocaine \u0026amp; Rhinestones\u003c/em\u003e. In order for me to to be able to keep doing this, \u003cem\u003eCocaine \u0026amp; Rhinestones\u003c/em\u003e has to become my job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, I\u0027ll spare you the details but I went way out of pocket to make the first season of the show. Nobody asked me to do that. I\u2019m not complaining about anything, I\u2019m not saying anyone owes me anything and I certainly don\u2019t regret doing it, as I\u2019ve seen enough of a response to believe it was a smart investment in the future. All I knew when I started was that this is important and that I had to try. I knew I had to let you know what I was capable of doing before you could decide whether or not it has value to you and how much that value may be. You know, the first taste is free.\u00a0So, I made the decision to do that and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done. You\u0027ve heard what I can do and what I want to spend the rest of my life getting better at doing. If you want to help make it possible for me to keep doing it, this is how.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve already received several messages from listeners asking for a way to help support the podcast, which makes setting up this Patreon page much easier than it would have otherwise been for me. For those of you, like me, who are new to this. It\u0027s a way for you to make a monthly financial contribution to the show.\u00a0It can be as little as $2 a month. To put this in perspective, the average price of a movie ticket in 2017 was $8.97. Let\u2019s round that down and call it $8. If you choose to send in $2 a month to me for one year, that comes out to $24. So, for the price of three movie tickets, you can do the bare minimum it takes to support one year\u2019s worth of \u003cem\u003eCocaine \u0026amp; Rhinestones\u003c/em\u003e. Of course, if you want to, you can send in more than that every month. There are multiple tiers at which you can support the podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel like I\u2019ve already given you something with the first season of the show and you want to give me something, this is how. If you love the podcast and want me to keep being able to make it and make it even better than it is now, this is how you can help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[For everyone who can\u0027t sign up for monthly support but wants to make a one-time \"donation\" to the podcast, the best way to do that right now is by sending however many books can be bought from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/2EfdfVE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis Amazon wishlist\u003c/a\u003e using the amount of money you wish to contribute. These are all books I\u0027ll need to buy in the future anyway. Feel free to browse until you see an artist or topic that interests you or just sort them by cost and buy as many as the cheapest ones as you want, it\u0027s all good. Checkout as you normally would on Amazon and they\u0027ll get the book(s) to me. Thank you.]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo more things I want to point out, though:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you love the show and want to help me create it but that\u0027s difficult for you to do right now, please do not become a patron of the podcast at this time. \n\nI need you to understand that \u003cstrong\u003eI do not want your money if it\u2019s difficult for you to give it to me\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u2019m not a televangelist. I do not want your last dollar. Figure out who your richest friend is and get them to start listening to the show. They can give me their money. (Okay, I\u0027m slightly joking but telling people about the podcast is a huge help and it\u0027s greatly appreciated.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatreon is different from what we\u0027re used to doing as fans of art. It\u0027s not a way of paying to receive a product, like a book or an album. It\u0027s a way of contributing to the process that results in a product that you enjoy or that you think is important. There will be several months a year when new episodes of the podcast are not being released.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00ba\u003c/strong\u003e Those are the months when I\u0027m working hardest on the show. Those are the months when your ongoing support is helping me create \u003cem\u003eCocaine \u0026amp; Rhinestones\u003c/em\u003e. If you\u0027re reading this in the first quarter of 2018, those months are happening right now. All of the money spent on creating the second season will be spent before you hear one minute of it. So, if you want to help me do that, if you want to become a patron of the show, there is no better time than today.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-TMC\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00ba\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t expect creating the second season (or any future season) to take seven months, like the first season did. In that time, I had to self-learn everything about making podcasts, build the website, read books that can be used for future episodes, develop a workflow, etc. Many of these tasks will not have to be done ever again and the process will continue to become faster.\u003cbr\u003e"

Those are big mp3s and hosting them costs money. Right now, I\u0027m having to pay a monthly penalty to go over the limit on the only plan I can afford, which lets me deliver 128kbps files in mono. That\u0027s very low quality audio for a show about music. I\u0027d love to be able to offer a better-sounding show, perhaps even in stereo.

To be frank, this podcast gets made in a basement (with concrete floors) and it has to be recorded overnight or else you\u0027d be able to hear cars driving by outside. That means I\u0027m losing (at a minimum) two nights\u0027 sleep for every episode that gets made. At the very least, I\u0027d love to be able to upgrade this home recording setup. If enough people contribute, I could even start using a real studio during the day and sleeping at night.\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, Tom T.
