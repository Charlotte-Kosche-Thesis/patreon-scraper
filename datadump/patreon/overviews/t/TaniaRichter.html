    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Tania, a freelance author, illustrator, and knitwear designer. I draw dragons and create fantasy knitting patterns.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I make ~\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eArt, both digital and traditional, of dragons and fantasy creatures I\u0027ve designed. You can find examples of my art on \u003ca href=\"http://aetherfang.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDeviantart\u003c/a\u003e. It usually takes me approximately 1-2 months to finish a large sized digital piece. I\u0027m currently concentrating my efforts on my Dream of Dragons series, the first of which is \u003ca href=\"http://aetherfang.deviantart.com/art/A-Dream-of-Flame-and-Fury-444825708\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eA Dream of Flame and Fury\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eKnitting patterns featuring fantasy creatures. I design patterns for scarves, shawls, cowls, sweaters and more! You can find my patterns for sale over on \u003ca href=\"http://www.ravelry.com/designers/tania-richter\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRavelry\u003c/a\u003e. Most of my patterns are reversible and use a technique called double-knitting to achieve that effect.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNovels for my characters to run amok in. I have approximately 15 work-in-progress novels with more brewing, all set in a full-fledged fantasy universe.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, art supplies such as yarn and markers are expensive. With your support, I will be able to acquire more yarn and art supplies and upgrade some of my current equipment to create more projects and release more patterns and prints (and eventually even a book).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a lot like Kickstarter, only instead of a single donation towards a large project you are giving continued support towards an artist\u0027s continued work. It gives creators extended contact with patrons, and helps the creator create more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much should I donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe amount is up to you! With a minimum of $1 per month, you will help me acquire the supplies I need to keep creating knitting patterns and art! There are different rewards such as prints and raffles of test knits, check out the tiers below!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy monthly?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI do a lot of projects across mediums, so I decided that monthly would work best. This way you the Patron get to see all of the neat stuff I\u0027m up to and I don\u0027t have to worry about flooding you with new projects one month and having less the next.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I stop my subscription?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYep! Anytime you want, you can stop your subscription or switch to a different support tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://images4-b.ravelrycache.com/uploads/AetherFang/223156774/IMG_1949_medium2.JPG\" style=\"width: 610px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll backers at the $2 Pledge Level and up will receive monthly Coloring Book Pages!
