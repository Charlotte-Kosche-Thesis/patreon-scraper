I am a Graphic Designer and self-taught 3D artist from Italy, with a basic photography knowledge and a sleepless brain.\u003cbr\u003eIt all started like a simple hobby a long time ago, but now I\u0027m trying to transform my art into a real business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a form of monetary support many artists and content creators use to either get an extra income or earn for a living doing what they love. I honestly can\u0027t tell how this will go in my case, but my goal is to earn visitors and supporters (also without any monetary support) in order to expand my content and reach a bigger audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently my account is set as monthly, which means your pledge will be validated between the first and fifth day of each month. If you are a patron you will be able to see my early access content which will only be visible to the public the following month. You also get the chance to request some free reward which you can find listed on the right. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t/don\u0027t want to support me with money that is totally okay. You will still see my public posts and the locked content as soon as the early access period is over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I offer?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will share with you all my exclusive (not available on other sites) full resolution images, tutorials, 3D comics, turntables and before-after comparisons. Nudity is included, but I don\u0027t make sexual content.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight now I am mostly concentrating over the recreation of video game characters and plan to add more from Assassin\u0027s Creed, Dragon Age, Life Is Strange and Final Fantasy. Movie and TV shows characters could appear as well from time to time, though (see Pennywise from IT).\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eShould my page grow I will consider to add more original stuff, because I have a very important project in store and I\u0027ll need all the support I can get for it (and again, not just in terms of money!)\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat am I using?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst of all, I need to clarify that nothing showcased for profit here is copyrighted. Each character I render is created by myself in DAZ Studio and ZBrush, sometimes using FaceGen to make the basic face texture and lots of Photoshop to fix it and add more detail, nothing has been provided by the original companies or designers. \u003cbr\u003eI am practicing with Iray at the moment, but I feel more comfortable rendering in Blender through the Cycles engine for how I manage to control the nodes and different effects, plus direct modeling/mesh editing in the scene. The postproduction is always made in Photoshop, while the parallax/fx animations are created in After Effects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do plan to learn 3D animation in Blender too, however, so that could be implemented in my page as well in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, I don\u0027t make headswaps. If you happen to \nbe a developer and want me to prove the posted content is indeed made by\n myself, I am totally willing to send you as many files as you need!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are all free to interact, comment, chat with me and so on. If you happen to be a patron please do not share anything you get from my posts before the early access period is over. You are free to share on social media or wherever then if all the needed informations (credits, Patreon links, etc) are included in your post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by, whoever you are \u2665\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote: \u003c/strong\u003eI am studying hard and learning constantly, so a few changes may happen anytime regarding rewards and type of posts. You are free to donate more than $10 if you want (and in that case THANK YOU!!), but for now I want my prices to stay low because I need to be sure I\u0027ll come up with the right rewards for higher tiers in the future and I know not everyone is willing, nor have the means, to pledge high amounts for art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have to credit and thank from the bottom of my heart my friend \u003cstrong\u003eNightyswolf\u003c/strong\u003e, who sometimes offers her GPU to render the finished scenes my system fails to store due to the limited memory causing me a CUDA error. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to request anything from your tier of choice, please do remember that I will not accept anything involving porn, gore, abuse, racism, homophobia, general hate, etc. Nudity, MxM and FxF content allowed.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on your request I may need some time in order to finish it. Worry not though, because I always deliver what I promise!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
