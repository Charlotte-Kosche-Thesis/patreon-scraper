I\u0027m sure if you\u0027re looking at this page, you already know me from somewhere (most likely\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/billybob11432\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundCloud\u003c/a\u003e), but I guess I can explain for those who don\u0027t. Online, I\u0027m known as Tangle, and I\u0027m a creative little guy with an urge to make people happy. Literally every person who I entertain with my work, whether it be musical, visual, written, 3D or even something as simple as a friendly chat is what motivates me to keep doing what I do. I want to do more, so I come to you all, asking for you to show me what it is you want. You already help me out by experiencing the things I create, and for that I\u0027m forever grateful. If you help make my life just a little easier in a different way, then I\u0027ll be able to make so much more for all of you to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing perfectly honest, I really wish I could more sufficiently thank literally every single person who\u0027s followed me, listened to any of my music, liked any of my art, or offered me words of encouragement. The best I can do is offer my appreciation to anyone who reads this, and even considers supporting me more than they already have. You\u0027re all the reason I\u0027m even trying this, so it would mean a lot if you all gave me the motivation to keep up with it!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/nHa5Xt6\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://snek.in/extimg/tangle/own/scbannerdiscord3.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease, please, please if you have the time, follow me on my Twitter on the left, subscribe to my YouTube as well if you like my videos, and join my\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/nHa5Xt6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDiscord server\u003c/a\u003e if you wanna hang out around me and share a chat or two!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOh, also, send me cute sneks.
