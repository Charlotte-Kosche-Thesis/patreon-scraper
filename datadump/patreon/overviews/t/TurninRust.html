    "summary": "Firstly, We want to thank each and everyone of you that has supported us in getting this Series started! From coming to our live release night of the show, to the shares, and all the encouragement!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to take Turnin Rust to the next level, and share our vision with you guys. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are unsure what Turnin Rust is, it\u0027s a new YouTube Series, a Father/Son duo, rescuing old classic vehicles by preserving their original look as they were found, get these vehicles off the farm/woods and into the hands of a new owner! We document each and everything with the vehicle, from picking it up, to fixing it up!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to hire a second filmer, currently our main filmer is a full-time wedding videographer. Making it hard for us to film our projects in a timely manner, since there is such a scheduling difference. With a second filmer, we would be able to bring you guys more content faster, more film days, more bonus content, win-win for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we are growing very fast, our YouTube series has quickly surpassed over 5,000 subscribers, and our Facebook has just passed 10,000 likes within three months, there is definitely potential for our niche. We truly believe there is not another show out there like ours. Majority of the shows out there is about completely restoring these vehicles. We are in the flipping business, we want to share the history of the vehicle, document how we rescued it, and create a story around the vehicle. And to even make it cooler, you can purchase the vehicle! We list every pick on eBay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything we film is real, there is no script, we show up to a pick, and explain to the client who we are and what we do. Put a mic on them, and capture how it goes. We have a strong belief that what we show, is what really happens. We are car show fans aswell, but we really want to stand out, and want to be different. We put religion before everything, if it wasn\u0027t for God, none of this would be possible. We keep everything clean, allowing the show to be family-friendly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are asking YOU for help, if you guys see potential in our show, and support us please consider becoming a patreon! If we are able to hit our goal, we will introduce a second filmer, allowing us to grow and bring you guys more content! And reach our goal of making this a full time show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
