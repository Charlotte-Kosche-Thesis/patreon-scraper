We can draw and paint ourselves, but things like playing cards, socks, pins, blankets, posters and even prints take some capital to get started. That\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow This Works\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs they stand, these rewards and goals mean the money will cover the launch of the product itself. \u003cem\u003eIt\u2019s not for profit, the supplies for the original art, or for the time we\u2019ll spend creating it. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u2019re delighted to give and share what we have with the community!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is built and intended to be a steady-ish source of support for creators to continue doing what they do, knowing the community/fanbase is behind them. It\u2019s different from kickstarter and most other crowd-funding sites in that those tend to work for one project at a time, and therefore asks for only a one-time contribution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere are bonuses and rewards at every level of contribution, as detailed below (and on desktops in the sidebar to the right)! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eFor Patreon, it\u2019s better to pick a contribution level you\u2019d be comfortable paying at least once per month. We\u2019ve set up our page for per project\u00a0instead of per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/blockquote\u003eThat means you contribute to the creation of each project we put out, unless you change your preferences, which you can do at any time. Starting out, we won\u2019t be putting out more than one a month, but you can set a monthly limit, so even if we speed up and put out more, you only pay what you\u2019re comfortable with. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport options start at $1 per project\u003c/strong\u003e, (about once a month or less, at the moment)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you just want to be supportive and be a part of the conversation for what we\u2019re doing, support at the $1-5/project range is a good bet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting anything $49/project or below, you\u2019ll get a say in what we do, listed bonuses on the right, and you\u2019ll be the first to know about new releases in the store. At levels above $10/project, you\u2019ll also get a store discount!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $50 or above, you\u2019ll get all of that, plus we\u2019ll send you the finished physical product when it\u2019s ready, every time you\u2019ve supported it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also change your support level at any time, so if you\u2019re supporting at $10/project for the portraits, for example, but you want to make sure you get the next product when it\u2019s out, you can switch to $50 for that project, get it sent to you, and then switch back down to $10/project afterwards. You can also switch to a lower level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat you\u2019ll get:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter project launch, everything we\u2019ve made will be available on \u003ca href=\"http://littlemhouse.com/\"\u003elittlemhouse.com\u003c/a\u003e (Emma\u2019s toymaking store/site), or linked to from that shop page (for things we don\u2019t directly manufacture, like mugs and t-shirts). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eReward Levels:\u003c/h4\u003eThis is how it all works right now. We\u2019re new at this, and we want to make sure eveybody is happy with the rewards, and also that it\u2019s sustainable for us to give what we do! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe might change up the levels or offerings as we go, to best fit what we can give and what you enjoy. Don\u2019t worry! We\u2019ll always deliver on our promises when humanly (or bearly) possible, let you know when things change, and if you don\u2019t want to support at that level anymore, you can talk to us about what happened, change your support level, or cancel at any time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1+ Become a Patron - Virtual hugs to wherever you are! Trouble will follow you on social media to be closer to you and your own story, and you\u2019ll have access to the patrons-only feed, where we\u2019ll ask for most collaboration and feedback, and share behind-the-scenes progress of the projects!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$3+ Digital Delivery! - Everything above, plus, since we want to make sure we\u2019re sharing as much art as much as possible, you\u2019ll get a digital version (as much as possible) of the thing we made. Most of the time, this\u2019ll be a high-quality wallpaper, or a printable. Plus, we\u2019ll have your name (or instagram handle) in the credits of everything you support, either on the object itself, on a certificate that goes along with it, or on the purchasing page when it\u2019s completed, as well as when we post on patreon and instagram and other social platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$5+ - Be part of the (larger group) ART! - Everything above, plus for large-group art projects (like the deck of cards, poster, snuggly blanket, etc.), you or a buddy of your choice is included and/or drawn into the art! Limited to 15 at this level, for now, since we want to make sure everybody on the art gets to shine!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$10 - Get a Drew\u2019d You! - Everything above, plus we\u2019ll do a personal portrait of you, and send you a digital copy, signed by both Emma and Trouble. Plus! You\u2019ll get a discount code for everything in the Community Art Shop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$20 - Be part of the (smaller group) ART! - Everything above, plus for things like batches of enamel pins and socks, where there\u2019s not as much room for as many buddies, you\u2019ll be at the top of the list! Plus, we\u2019ll send you a hand-painted watercolor portrait postcard!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$50 - Hold the Art in your PAWS - This is the easiest way to get the goodness flowing to you, us, and the rest of the world at once! Everything above, plus we\u2019ll send you the finished product of every art project that doesn\u2019t cost us more than the support itself (this should be most of the projects. If we do a project that does cost too much to send you at this level, we\u2019ll give you a huge discount code for the Community Art Shop instead)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$100 - Commissioned Work - We\u2019ll get to fly a little with this one. Thank you so much!! Everything above, plus the first time you support us at this level, we\u2019ll work with you to create something unique and special with the gifts we have (painting, drawing, music, toy design) and the gift you\u2019ve given us to deliver something spectacular you\u2019ll love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow (else) this helps the world\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDefinitely in art, but not just through art.
