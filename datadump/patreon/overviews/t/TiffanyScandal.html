    "summary": "Hey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Tiffany Scandal. I am a published author, Managing Editor at King Shot Press, and host of the podcast \"In The Kitchen with Sylvia Plath\" (coming soon!). I\u0027ve also worked as a photographer and model for Suicide Girls, and have had modeling/photography work published in a handful of domestic and international publications.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy published work has gained much acclaim over the years -- including praise in starred reviews for Publisher\u0027s Weekly, coverage in international publications, numerous \"best of\" lists, etc. My second book, \u003cem\u003eJigsaw Youth\u003c/em\u003e, was made into an audiobook which I narrated myself for publisher Talking Book. My third release, \u003cem\u003eShit Luck\u003c/em\u003e, was a Wonderland Award finalist for best novel and received an option for film. I also edited a non-fiction anthology (\u003cem\u003eNasty!\u003c/em\u003e), which has been covered on KPTV\u0027s More Good Day Oregon, headlined an event at Powell\u0027s City of Books (the largest independent bookstore in the country), and has been praised for pushing boundaries raising awareness during these critical times.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy podcast (\"In the Kitchen with Sylvia Plath\") features interviews with creative types wherein we discuss craft, feminism, hopes and fears, and show no shame for our language or views.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSince the publication of my first book, I\u0027ve always set out to accomplish more than the year before. And so far, I\u0027ve delivered on that. I\u0027ve accomplished more than I ever thought possible in the short amount of time I\u0027ve been at it. And if you\u0027re reading this, I probably have you to thank for that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2018 and 2019 are going to be my biggest years yet. I have a handful of books and anthologies lined up for publication, as well as tons of exciting announcements I can\u0027t quite make public yet. I\u0027m constantly working on writing, editing, recording, and creating outside of my day job schedule. And I love every moment of it! With how we communicate on social media constantly changing, I\u0027d like to keep this Patreon as a more intimate way to engage with subscribers without being drowned by weird algorithms and advertisements. \"But isn\u0027t charging people to engage not punk rock?\" Kathleen Hanna once said that when she stopped doing free shows, she started performing for people who actually wanted to see her. There was less heckling, less shit thrown at her face, and there were MORE people excited to meet and engage with her. I\u0027ve had my life threatened, my books pissed on and set on fire, and people attack me on free social media sites because an empowered woman is frightening. While a lot of that is unavoidable, I\u0027d like a space to communicate and engage with people who like my work and want to see more of it (and not have trolls get in the way of fun). So if you like me, my work, cats, whatever, consider subscribing to stay up to date and engage in a more meaningful way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading. Thank you for being you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
