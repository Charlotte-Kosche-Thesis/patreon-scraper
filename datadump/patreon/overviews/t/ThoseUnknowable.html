In fact I hope you do, but I\u0027m hardly going to make either side unlikable. One of my least favorite narrative styles is black and white morality - nobody \u003cem\u003ethinks \u003c/em\u003ethat they\u0027re evil.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me means I get to tell the story faster!Even if I don\u0027t get paid I\u0027m going to keep making the comic, so you don\u0027t have to worry about whether your dollar will be wasted! What will happen, though, if I get the support I need, I can start creating this and possibly other content at a much faster rate. I can see myself making 4 pages a week instead of 2, possibly even 5, speeding up the rate of plot advancement substantially and letting me get to other parts of the greater storylines of Those Unknowable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeet the Characters:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJaunt\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Z5p4uzI.png\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eJaunt is a Dimensional Shambler currently residing in the realms of Earth, specifically in Innsmouth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVery few in Innsmouth are aware of his presence there, though his truly alien nature has lead to various nicknames such as \"The Kook of Whippoorwill Manor\", and \"The Creep from the Hill\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis innate ability to shift between dimensions and relocate at will, partnered with his understanding and command over eldritch energies allowed him to fall naturally into a leadership role. Those closer to him know that he associates with Nyarlathotep on occasion, so his greater motives aren\u0027t known, but his overt objectives appear to be protecting the hybrid Deep One production from reaching the public eye.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJack\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/IYNp5sh.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJack is a Byakhee that through a series of events ended up working for Jaunt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile his origin has not been revealed yet, it is clear that he has a chip on his shoulder from his past, often keeping himself guarded and a bit enigmatic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can often find him eavesdropping, swooping from roof to roof to manage things from the shadows and spy on the goings on in town. He manages to be very stealthy, however the occasional spotting or two have lead to local legends of a winged beast that steals naughty children into the night, though Jack has never done so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHugh\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/an4Y6z5.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHugh is a hybrid Deep One who is undergoing a slow transformation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the beginning of our story he is seen driving the bus from Innsmouth to Arkham, as he\u0027s retained his occupation from when he appeared mostly human. He is very well-natured and mannered, juxtaposing his horrifying condition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor reasons not yet made clear, he is considered one of the trio of Innsmouth\u0027s main defenders, working closely with Jaunt for the occasional assignment or mission. He is large, of above-average intelligence, all while still maintaining a good amount of his humanity and good nature, which has been a problem more than a few times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBarry, Marco and Al\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/CfdQDdJ.png\"\u003eHugh\u0027s friends and companions in the secret lodgings for slow-transforming Deep Ones in the lower level of Innsmouth General Hospital.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBarry is a rough-and-tumble sort with a rebellious attitude and sharp wit. He\u0027s often the one to come up with the night\u0027s entertainment, and is quick to offer a shoulder for people to confide in him. He doesn\u0027t seem at all worried or affected by the implications of his transformation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarco is an typical case among deep one hybrids, becoming more sluggish, having reduced cognitive capability and a massive increase in body and muscle mass. The chemical changes from the transformation cause imbalances in his brain that makes him more quick to anger than his friends, giving him violent urges that he has difficulty controlling over time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAl is a former librarian and hobby-hunter who has not given up his prim and proper ways. He does not see his slow progression into an ocean dwelling beast as a reason to give up his old ways until it\u0027s time for him to join his brothers and sisters of Dagon. As a result, he remains very reserved and dresses very neatly, an occasional source of irritation for Marco. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNyarlathotep\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NJMkfio.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFew need to be introduced to the Elder God with 1,000 faces, however his appearances in the story so far suggests that there is more to the goings on than meets the eye.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is avoiding getting directly involved with the conflict because of concerns that enlightened humans may be tracking his activities, though he has warned Jaunt of coming troubles. It\u0027s also apparent that he is the one that discovered Jack in New York City, an event that Jack seems to be uncomfortable revisiting - though who can blame him?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChase and Clara\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mfta0bX.png\"\u003eTwo investigators that arrived in Innsmouth for reasons unclear at first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChase is a former Police Detective turned Private Investigator, apparently due to events that resulted from him pursuing a case involving the unseen world. He has very impressive observational skills and good aim, it seems he is very aware of the danger of their presence in the town.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClara is a student from Miskatonic - she has stayed beyond completing her curriculum and currently studies the unseen world with her colleagues. The same event that called Chase to Innsmouth appears to have attracted her attention as well, as she insists on going with him. She is not as prepared to fight or perform underhanded acts to obtain information as her counterpart is, however her knowledge of the unknowable and quick mind will prove more useful than the P.I. could ever imagine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading - I hope you enjoy the comic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Seth Witfoth\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
