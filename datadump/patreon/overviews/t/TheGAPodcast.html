    "summary": "The GAP is Australia\u0027s longest running podcast about video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting in 2009 at BigPond GameArena, we\u0027ve released over 350 episodes delivering hours of content each month. We\u0027ve won awards - well, one award - and we\u0027ve hosted live shows at PAX Australia as well as charity streams (before it was cool). In 2015 we went fully independent which saw us launching our own site in order to gain more control over what we do from week to week. The core idea for The GAP is to have a sample of people from different media publications as they come together talk about the things they all enjoyed \u2013 video games. The crew working on The GAP has been featured in a wide variety of publications including GameArena, AusGamers, Australian Gamer, GamePlanet, PC PowerPlay, Hyper Magazine, GameInformer AU, Kotaku AU, Stevivor, Red Bull Games, GameSpot, IGN, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the (eight!) years we\u0027ve been running, listeners have asked how they can help support our show and generally the answer has been tell your friends, but some want to do more. Which is very cool! This Patreon will allow those that want to contribute further to The GAP the opportunity to do so, and will enable us to evolve the show and deliver even more fun content to people."
