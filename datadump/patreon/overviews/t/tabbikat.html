I\u0027ve been streaming since June 2nd, 2014 and my focus has primarily been on the series I enjoy such as sonic, rune factory, mega man, mario, ect. I\u0027ve done both good and bad games and continually work to expand my horizons with the projects I do, always working to improve my quality and my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStreaming to me is something I do daily on top of full time work. It\u0027s always important to me to do what I do because it\u0027s not just because people who watch enjoy it, but I do as well. Entertaining people is something i\u0027ve discovered I enjoy to do, and the bonds it creates out there for people is amazing, and i\u0027d never give it up for the world. I would love to transition this to a full-time job eventually, but for now I will continue to do what I do, and I want to thank you just for coming to take a peek at my page here. If nothing else, taking the time to help me out and help out the wonderful community is appreciated, even just by reading this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou make the internet awesome!\u003cbr\u003e"
