     "about": "The first thing that grabs you is the voice.\u003cbr\u003e\nCrisp yet emotive and utterly indifferent to gravity, it glides then soars over a deceptively simple foundation of guitar and piano alternately conjuring jazzy pop and poppy jazz with a smidge of folk that\u2019s utterly unlike anything you\u2019ve heard before but something you instantly want to hear again.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is the music of Taylor Angus, the fast-emerging duo featuring namesake singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Taylor Angus and her partner, guitarist/songwriter Logan Brown.\u003cbr\u003e\nTogether, the pair - by their reckoning, spiritual cousins to Buckingham Nicks but musically closer to Ella Fitzgerald and Joe Pass \u2013 crafts original songs so unique yet accessible that their brilliant new six-track EP, Sympathy For You, can be viewed as both an artistic statement and a statement of intent.\u003cbr\u003e\nWorld domination is in the crosshairs for the Kingston/Ottawa-based musicians, a point corroborated by their dazzling 2016 debut First Light of Dawn which electrified music fans, radio programmers and even British synth-pop star Howard Jones, who invited them on tour.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u201cOur hope is that this EP will do what our last record did: open doors for us as artists able to do this full- time,\u201d Brown says. \u201cThis is a total blessing, and to have First Light of Dawn garner real fans that weren\u2019t our parents was amazing,\u201d the guitarist howls.\u003cbr\u003e\nJudging by the early success of the new EP\u2019s saucy, guitar-goosed focus track, \u2018You\u2019re Gonna Wish I Stayed,\u2019 it looks like Taylor Angus\u2019 desire to \u201cshoot for the moon and land among the stars\u201d is very much on track.\u003cbr\u003e\nRecorded over a few intense days in winter 2017 at Hamilton\u2019s Catherine North Studios with bassist Oscar Ansetti guesting, Sympathy For You is a snapshot of Angus and Brown\u2019s total convergence as a duo after performing solo: she at Ottawa Bluesfest and recording a demo with legendary producer Thom Panunzio at Interscope Studios in Los Angeles, and he winning multiple guitar and songwriting awards across Ontario.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe duo\u2019s easy harmony is palpable in songs like \u2018Cry Me A River\u2019 which finds Angus\u2019 voice draped like a shawl across Brown\u2019s supple acoustic guitar, and in the earwormy and sprightly \u2018Your Choice\u2019 which, along with plaintive ballad \u2018Lay Down,\u2019 features Brown sharing lead vocals for the first time.\u003cbr\u003e\nThough they tend to write songs separately, Angus and Brown confirm their status as a couple impacts their music. \u201cThere is a chemistry people pick up on,\u201d Brown says. \u201cWe love each other and we love the songs and, without getting too cheesy, that\u2019s prevalent whenever we perform. People just seem to get into a good mood... whether we\u2019re playing a pub or a concert hall.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\nThat Sympathy For You comes with 3D glasses to better enhance its cover image is further proof the couple follows their instinct no matter what. \u201cIt is an undertaking to include the glasses in the CD,\u201d Angus laughs. \u201cBut we thought it would be cool.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\nSometimes, cool is enough... especially when you boast the inimitable sound and style of Taylor Angus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
