My name is Justine Dee, also known as The Princess Bard and I welcome you to find the magic and become a Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubscription based creating is becoming a more popular concept again, even the newspapers are returning to this model. I think it is a great way for creators to connect with readers and fans, keep them up to date and often granting access to advanced release content as well as providing exclusive content.\u003cbr\u003eAnd lordy, do I have a lot of content waiting to be shared.\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon some of the stress can come off the creation and publishing process and I can bring my work easily to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have already posted my Work In Progress list, but in quick summary. By joining me on this journey you get to enter the world of The Wiccad, which stretches from Ancient days through Victorian England, the World Wars to modern times and beyond. You will find tales of other realms in the Faeted stories. In the Shadow of Avalon, you will see if the souls of Arthurian times can right things this time around. Bloodied Briar will take you on a journey of discovery and demons. And that is just scratching the surface. You will also get behind the scenes, poetry, character information and so much more.\u003cbr\u003eAnd it\u2019s just so affordable and easy to sign up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the main tasks of the Wiccad and the Faeted is to bring complex and interesting female characters to the world. To provide a place for women of all ages to find inspiration for overcoming the battles they face, finding their own light and strength, and seeing themselves well represented in lead characters and strong supporting roles. I am passionate about these topics and am excited to have you joining this journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome and share the journey, meet the voices and enjoy a wide range of rewards and my endless love, devotion, and thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether we can make the world Wiccad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://theprincessbard.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/thank-you.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Born and bred in Middle Earth, I mean Narnia, I mean the gorgeous country of New Zealand.\u003cbr\u003eI am a creatrix and word witch.\u003cbr\u003eWriting is my life. Tales of the Wiccad, Faeted Tales, Shadow of Avalon, The Bloodied Briar, are among some of the works I am creating. Supernatural, Historic, and Fantasy Fiction, with a focus on female representation. In my works, you will find strong female characters in the lead and supporting roles.\u003cbr\u003eWiccad is more than just the name of a series of stories. Wiccad is not just about phenomenal cosmic power as in the books but about finding the power within ourselves and becoming who we are meant to be. I am passionate about helping others find their own path, their own light and embrace their dreams and goals. I dream about my stories touching the souls of the readers and helping them see they are not alone and that they are faebulous!\u003cbr\u003eWhen I am not writing, I am creating in other ways. I craft necklaces, decorate hats, created mixed media art, and create greeting cards and Wiccad Affirmation cards. I also have been known to dabble in writing Role Play in my spare time. \u003cbr\u003eI have been writing most of my life since I hit double digits and began to Indie publish in 2016. I have dozens of novels, novellas and short stories all waiting to be shared with the world, and new plot ideas happening every other day. \u003cbr\u003eI would love the chance to share my precious babies and hopefully be a light in the world. As the world needs all the night it can get right now.\u003cbr\u003e",
