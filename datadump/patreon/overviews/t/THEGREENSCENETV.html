I started in San Francisco in 2010 at a startup called Vidsf. Since then I went on to the East Bay where I hit the streets as an Indie journalist. From my hard hitting on site interviews at vigils and protests, to my studio interviews at Chopsticks urban art space in the heart of Oakland, CA with underground Rappers, I learned the lessons that only producing my own show could teach. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy journey brought me to the home of legalized Cannabis, the state of Colorado. More precisely the Denver Metro where there are more dispensaries than I\u0027ve ever seen in one place. I wanted to see what it would be like to live in a state where cannabis had some history as a legal recreational product. California had history with decriminalization but with the ink on legalization still wet on the paper where it was signed there was little concrete data to explore through my journalistic lens. I just had to know what this felt like and what the rules of engagement were. How much could one consume? What were the taxes from this consumption doing for its citizens. How has legalization affected the physical and mental health of the community? Of course, is the care taken in production of Cannabis and its related products better under legalization? I grew even more curious about the data produced from the years of legalization. And, as many say, Colorado law in many ways is becoming the template for legalization around the United States. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to the eighth season, where you\u0027ll witness the evolution of me as not just an advocate and indie journalist to an actual investigative reporter offering insights, expos\u00e9s, stories and cases I\u0027ve followed for years. In this context I will be exploring the science, the health data and economic actualities of legalized Cannabis in its first legal incarnation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJoin me on our new journey as I explore and report to you the world of legalized Cannabis from the home and national template for legalized/recreational cannabis.
