I\u2019ll start off by quickly explaining what this is all about...\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is helping to create a platform where people can once again become patrons of the arts, people who support artists in their creative endeavors.  It\u2019s a huge blessing to know that people are behind you in your creative work and this is a place where that can happen.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/677/32356508806_37f2fc719e_o_d.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Trevor Ransom. I love to make music and have been doing it for the better part of 8 years. In recent months my music has been played on BBC Radio, was featured in blogs such as \u003ca href=\"http://www.dummymag.com/news/premiere-trevor-ransom-glimpses\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDUMMY\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/new-music/discovery/ambient-producer-trevor-ransom-streams-atmospheric-debut-ep-glimpses\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Line of Best Fit\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.wepluggoodmusic.com/2016/07/19/wpgm-interviews-trevor-ransom-human-frailty-unanalysed-creativity-and-making-people-notice/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWhen the Horn Blows\u003c/a\u003e, and has been compared to the likes of \u003ca href=\"http://popmuzik.se/2016/05/premiar-trevor-ransom-temples-video/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMoby\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.giveitaspin.gr/2016/09/give5aspin-e09.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNils Frahm\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CTEAKa9XIAAwR5B.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBrian Eno\u003c/a\u003e. It has been a privilege to grow in my musical skills, share my music with others and connect through it. When I hear a song that moves me, it means \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e. Maybe it helps bring peace when I\u2019m in a tough spot, or it inspires me to hope for something. I want to do the same for others with my music. My heart is to bring hope and light into this broken world and to you all through music.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cjcAVAnOHhg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019ve heard my music, like it, and feel like you want to contribute financially then this is one of the main places where you can do that. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m currently working on new music and will continue to write and share art as long as I\u2019m able, regardless of how much money comes in here.

Right now, it\u2019s somewhat difficult to set aside the kind of time for music that I\u2019d like to in order to produce the art that I want. I plan to continue creating in whatever capacity I can no matter how little or how much money I make. However, any donations you\u2019re able to give directly enable me to set aside time for creating music. Whether, it\u2019s $1/month or $100/month, it all helps me. This does not go to fund some sort of frivolous lifestyle, but rather helps me meet the necessities of basic living (room, board, etc\u2026) so that I can focus on doing what I do best - making music. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m so grateful for everyone who listens, participates, donates - joins with me.
