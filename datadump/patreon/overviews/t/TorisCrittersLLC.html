    "summary": "Tori\u0027s Critters started out as an animal rescue for small common and exotic pets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThere were plenty of dog/cat and livestock rescues but no one that would take in the fish, reptiles, birds, invertebrates and small mammals so we decided to fill that roll.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe would easily have 50-100 animals at any given time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt was clear quite early on that most of the animals came to us because their owners either got the wrong information about the Animal\u0027s needed care, or did no research whatsoever.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBecause of this we began to do free animal education classes at local events to help teach the public about how to care for their animals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhen the rescue shut down in 2015 due to lack of funds and a death in the family, we really missed the education aspect so we began to focus on just the educational classes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe now do classes all over the tri-state area at low cost as well as many many volunteer events locally.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThere are currently over 100 animals in our care, mostly rescues. \u003cbr\u003eWe are advocates for all types of critters and we do our best to help people understand that all animals deserve our respect, not just the cute, cuddly ones.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been in many local news articles and have had the opportunity to do classes for all types of wonderful private and business clients.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTori works 3 jobs to support the animals in our care but sometimes that still isn\u0027t enough. We would LOVE to do more volunteer events, but it\u0027s hard to cover the expenses to get to these events.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eExotic animals are very expensive and time consuming to care for and it\u0027s always a huge help when someone donates to us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe we are NOT a 501c3 because of the way non-profits need to be set up and instead opted to become an LLC.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBut we still take in animals in need, we still donate our services and we are asking for help to continue our good work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we are asking for help to do more educational outreach sessions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- For every $100 we raise, we will do 1 free local scout or library educational class.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- For ever $250 we raise, we will do 1 free local school class.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- For every $500 we raise, we will do 1 scout or library educational class in Philly, Camden or Atlantic City.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- For every $1000 we raise, we will do 1 free class in Philly, Camden or Atlantic City.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou are more than welcome to let us know where you would like your donation to go to (for instance, if you donate $50, you can let us know you want that to go towards a scout class in Philly)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money we raise will cover:\u003cbr\u003e- gas/tolls\u003cbr\u003e- paying our wonderful helpers for their time/travel\u003cbr\u003e- And help cover the missed income of Tori taking off one of her other jobs that day that will all go towards the animals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this and please feel free to reach out to me with any questions."
