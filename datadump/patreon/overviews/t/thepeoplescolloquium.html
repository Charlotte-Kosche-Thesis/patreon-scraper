Here\u0027s one example. A participant in an academic lecture could write an essay on a lecture topic and submit it to our writer\u0027s workshops, or they could compose a speech and present it at an open mic for ideas and art. The participants at the writing workshop or the open mic also have have participated in the lecture, and could thus critique and respond to the essay or speech in an informed fashion. There are many other possible examples of how our educational ecosystem integrates together, and this ultimately leads to a personalized experience for each participant at The People\u0027s Colloquium.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhat do the lectures look like?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4623/39794891004_4160ee7227_z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4669/39811175554_eaf0ded342_z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhat do the workshops and discussions look like?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/946/41634469092_639bdf5295_z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/903/41634470932_617ecaf94a_z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/947/40784025635_a34796f851_z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eThank you!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eTogether we\u0027re building a resource for all those living in the greater Portland metropolitan area, visitors to our wonderful city, your friends and loved ones, and - you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, because The People\u0027s Colloquium is a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit, all your donations are tax deductible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo find out more about The People\u0027s Colloquium, its mission, and its educational ecosystem, please visit PeoplesColloquium.org, our \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/302783856820952/\"\u003eFacebook Discussions Group\u003c/a\u003e, or contact us at ThePeoplesColloquiumPDX@gmail.com.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eCurricular Themes - Summer/Fall 2018\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSummer of 2018 (July-September)\u00a0\u2013 Speculative fiction and Philosophy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNarrative and philosophy have always enjoyed a close relationship, but with the advent of genres such as science-fiction, fantasy, horror, and related, this relationship arguably broke new ground  \u2013 or at least allowed for old ground to be explored in new and interesting ways. Also of note is how speculative narratives have taken philosophical issues mainstream through the use of modern medias, including television shows, movies, video-games, and others, introducing new generations to old philosophical problems in unprecedented fashions. The diversity of philosophical ideas, approaches, and solutions can boggle the imagination for newbie and expert alike.

During this quarter, we\u2019ll explore the works of a variety of theorists and critics, focusing in particular on art, literature, and culture, but ranging into philosophy and the sciences as well.
