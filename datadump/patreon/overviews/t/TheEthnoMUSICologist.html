    "summary": "Right now, where can you go if you want to learn about the\nmusical cultures of the world? Wikipedia is a truly wonderful resource, but it\ndoesn\u2019t have nearly enough recordings or in-depth analysis. The EthnoMUSICologist\ncould become that resource. If you live in rural America\nand enjoy going to hear that live band at the local honkeytonk, write about it,\ntake a video and let us know! Are you visiting a wonderful but lesser-known\ndestination? What kind of music was that band at the bar playing last night?\nGoing to see a traditional performance with some local friends? What can you\nexpect, what should you listen for to truly understand and enjoy the\nexperience? Do you want to hear recordings, see videos, and read articles about\ncultures around the world? How about an interactive map where you can click on\nany little town anywhere in the world and listen to the music that is being\ncreated there? That is what you are supporting when you become a sponsor of The EthnoMUSICologist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon Rewards Explanation-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nScripts: I script every video I make, including editing\nnotes, but often the final product is different from the script. If you\u2019d like\nto see the process and find the discrepancies, then you\u2019ll enjoy perusing the scripts\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPhotos: I take a lot of pics for the theme videos and\nListen! series, not to mention just pics for personal use. Only about 1% of\nthose end up in videos or on Instagram. The rest will be featured right here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nVideo clips: As with the photos, not everything I film makes\nit into the final video. If you\u2019d like to see behind the scenes footage,\nbloopers, extra video clips, and just some extra interesting clips, then check\nout these videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGoogle Hangouts: A fun opportunity to get together and talk\nabout\u2026anything. I hope and plan for this to be a monthly event, but internet is\nunreliable here, especially when travelling. So, I put every 3 months in the\nreward description so that you don\u2019t subscribe for something that I can\u2019t\ndeliver on.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eVotes: This one is a bit complicated, but hopefully will be\nfun and rewarding for both of us. It\u2019s important to me to make content that you\nare interested in watching and interacting with, so I will periodically be\nasking for votes on what direction to take The EthnoMUSICologist in and\nespecially where to go for the music and travel series, Listen! How it works:\nfor example, if I\u2019ve budgeted and planned a trip that will work in either\nThailand or Indonesia, I\u2019ll open voting to see which continent you\u2019d rather\nsee. Or if I\u2019ve planned a trip to a specific location, I\u2019ll take votes on the\nroute I should take. I\u2019ll open voting to all viewers and subscribers, but\npatrons will get extra votes based on your support level.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eVlog: I started vlogging in December of 2016 as a way to\ndocument my experiences and research on The EthnoMUSICologist. I record them\nmonthly during regular times and up to daily while traveling for the Listen!\nseries. I\u2019ve placed the vlogs at a fairly high pledge level because they\u2019re\nmuch more of a personal vlog. They document what I\u2019m going through and how I\nexperience things as they come. I record the for myself, not as a show for the\ngeneral public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
