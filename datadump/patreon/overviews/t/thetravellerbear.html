If you are reading this that means you went through the trouble of clicking some link someone shared somewhere, and that you are giving me some of your time to read this. Bear with me a little longer (pun very much intended) and let me explain what this is all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m looking to tell the stories of my travels, and the stories of others who I get to meet on the road. I also like to jot down every bit of information on my journal and share it with others. I realize how all of this information could serve as a I guide of sorts. Imagine seeing a guide with all of the information about a location, telling you a few tips on how to take advantage of the place, and even where and how exactly I took a photo by sharing all the data and GPS location so you can too take incredible photos or video of your own!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy journal will also include reviews of locations, photo \u0026amp; video gear, camping \u0026amp; outdoors gear. Artful videos and photos I get to shoot of different locations around the world to encourage you for your next trip, or even simpler things such as recipes you can cook during your next trip, or reviews of restaurants nearby. At the end of the day, what I would love is for you to make the most of your next trip, and if you can\u0027t take a trip at the moment, then I would love to share the beauty of the places around us, near or far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
