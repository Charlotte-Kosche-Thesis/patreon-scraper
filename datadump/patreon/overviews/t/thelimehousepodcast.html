    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello and welcome to the beginning of something really exciting!\u003c/strong\u003e As some of you may already be aware The Limehouse Podcast is a political podcast based in sunny London, England. We are of course your \u0027Liberal Speakeasy\u0027.\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThanks to you\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003ewe\u0027re in a position to truly believe in this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e We\u0027ve worked pretty hard to \u003cstrong\u003ecreate\u003c/strong\u003e a place where you can get easy access to \u003cstrong\u003epolitical issues\u003c/strong\u003e and discussion from some really great sources. The guests we\u0027ve had on \u003cstrong\u003eThe Limehouse Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e so far have included \u003cstrong\u003eNick Clegg, Clive Lewis, Lynne Featherstone, Jo Swinson, Mike Galsworthy, Amnesty U.K, Jolyon Maugham, Michael Heseltine, Vince Cable, Peter Tatchell and Peter Egan. \u003c/strong\u003eWe are of course now looking to GROW!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e How can we possibly do that? Well the two guys running this show, William and George are doing this part-time for the love of it however I think you\u0027ll all agree to take it to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ethe next level\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, a higher standard shall we say, the show needs investment! To do the show full time would mean way more material for you, the listener and fan. We\u0027d be able to really explore the outer reaches of issues and take our mics and equipment to the very source of each developing story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment the podcast is in a tiny living room in south east London with one microphone and a dodgy laptop. We need better equipment and days free to edit and create more exciting content for you! \u003cstrong\u003eYou can become a true \u0027Limey\u0027 and gain access to some of the great achievements we will create thanks to your generous contribution\u003c/strong\u003e. We have so many great ideas and landscapes we want to build for your \u003cstrong\u003ebrilliant imaginations\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The wall of restrictions and \u0027the old way of doing things\u0027 is fast collapsing thanks to forward thinking and \u003cstrong\u003egenerous people like yourselves\u003c/strong\u003e. You are able to see what William and George are trying to achieve and generous backing from you could help release something truly fantastic upon the podcasting world!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
