The most famous one is probably the \u003ci style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eInstitut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0in Frankfurt. Faculty there (such as Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno) and associated thinkers (such as Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, Wilhelm Reich, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, and Angela Davis) produced much of the intellectual basis for the political visions that motivated New Leftists during the second half of the 20th Century. These were not limited to working class movements, but included radical feminists and women of color, gay liberationists (including women of trans experience such as Silvia Rivera, Marsha P. Johnson, and organizations they helped start such as the Gay Liberation Front and Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries), and Third World People\u0027s movements (such as Third World Gay Revolution and the Black Panther Party).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting in the German (and later, in exile, the American) context before, during, and after World War II, Frankfurt School thinkers are often credited with being one of the only cohorts of intellectuals who adequately responded to the rise of fascism as it was happening, and with the urgency and force necessary to ideologically confront the crises of capitalism and institutions that led to the conditions which made fascism possible in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a newer \"Institute for Social Research\" in Brooklyn that offers classes to folks who can afford a modest fee. A larger one at the University of Michigan does a lot of survey research.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are building a new kind of Institute for Social Research in Atlanta. What does that mean?
