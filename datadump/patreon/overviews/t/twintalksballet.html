    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello there!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kirsten, and I run a YouTube channel called TwinTalksBallet where I share ballet-related advice and inspiration from my perspective as a university-educated professional ballet dancer. I have a passion for sharing my thoughts and experiences in the hopes that I can be the valuable source of information that I wish I had as a young, aspiring dancer. Thankfully, YouTube is a wonderful platform to do just that! If you\u0027ve watched my videos, you know that it\u0027s not all serious stuff on TwinTalksBallet. Being genuine and enjoying a good laugh are a priority on this channel, and I love sharing that with this awesome community of viewers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did I start a Patreon account?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs a dancer trying to make ends meet, I work several small, part-time jobs outside of ballet in order try and support myself financially. Sharing information about the ballet world and creating content on YouTube is one of my passions, but I have found recently that I am simply unable to devote much time to the channel due to the fact that it does not provide me with an adequate source of income. I have found myself picking up other online work in my spare time (which, in my opinion, does not give as much value to the world) instead of posting more frequently on YouTube just in order to increase my earnings. I started this Patreon account in the hopes that it would enable me to pour more effort into growing TwinTalksBallet and reaching more aspiring dancers and ballet enthusiasts alike.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you get for supporting me on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you become a patron, you can look forward to enjoying exclusive content form me as an expression of my appreciation! This will include personal updates about my life as a ballet dancer as well as exclusive photos and videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is the word \"twin\" in TwinTalksBallet?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUnless you have been a long-time TwinTalksBallet fan (as in back to the \"twinstalkballet93\" days), you may be a little confused as to why the word \"twin\" appears in my channel name. This is because I have an identical twin sister, named Kelsey, who I used to share this channel with! She and I danced and basically did everything together until she sustained serious foot injuries that took her life in another direction at the age of 18. This was sad at the time, but she is doing extremely well in her business career, and we are both very happy for each other! We are still extremely close, though we have really enjoyed growing as individuals in our very different life paths!\u003cbr\u003e"
