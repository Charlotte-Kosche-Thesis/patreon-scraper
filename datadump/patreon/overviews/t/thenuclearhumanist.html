    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Mathijs Beckers, and I am a Nuclear Humanist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring my research on energy and climate change, I learned one essential thing. If we have enough energy, we can do just about anything! However, for many people in the world this seems like a far cry. Many people live in a state of energy poverty, and this brings about disease and death caused by water scarcity, bad sanitation, and malnutrition. Because the world-population is growing we may expect these problems to endure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFortunately, we can solve these issues, but this takes careful investigation and scrutiny. Some people like to paint an overly optimistic future, serious academics included, but fail to substantiate their claims. I\u0027m here to tell you whether these plans are realistic or not. I am also going to show you how I have built my case for nuclear energy from a humanistic viewpoint. Which is not unique, because Alvin Weinberg, one of the early designers of nuclear reactors, was a humanist himself and very concerned with the future of our species and our planet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve written three books on Climate Change, Energy, and Politics. I am \nalso aspiring to give presentations, and create videos on these subjects\n regularly. I want to create a mix of short and long videos from 60 second explainers to half hour presentations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my mission to leave this planet a better place than I found it. I have two kids and don\u0027t feel comfortable with mortgaging their future. I\u0027m not doing this for them alone, I want all the kids on this beautiful planet to have a good future of plenty, safety, and meaning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that you see value in the content that I want to share freely with everyone, and that you will support me in expanding my possibilities as a nuclear and humanist activist. I can\u0027t do this without your help!\u003cbr\u003e"
