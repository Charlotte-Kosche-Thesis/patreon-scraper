I also have a\u003cstrong\u003e massive\u003c/strong\u003e gaming collection that literally spans the entire length of gaming history, from \"Colossal Cave Adventure\" (released one year after my birth in 1976), to cutting-edge new releases. I don\u0027t let my diseases stop me from gaming, having fun... though they do occasionally knock me off my feet for a day or two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0want to share my fun with you. I like playing games with other people, even if they just quietly watch. I like making other people happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like kicking-back, even when my Mito disease makes me tired, and playing games of every conceivable sort. I live-stream me playing them via Twitch, YouTube, and Mixer (because different people prefer different services). I just like chatting, making jokes (I have a very dry sense of humor), and playing whatever happens to be on my screen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI stream live weekdays from 2-6pm EST, as well as 10 (ish) till midnight (ish).
