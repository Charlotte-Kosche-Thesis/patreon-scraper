If you have actually signed up for it..... why tho?? No really it means a lot. This channel has grown to mean so much to me, and I have a lot of fun talking and fangirling with you guys. I never thought that this would actually be something that I would want to work towards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt started out me just wanting to show my friend (Hi Cami\u0026lt;3) the KNK comeback.. and now it has turned into my hobby. I have met so many wonderful people through this channel, everyone of you are so supportive and I cannot express my appreciation enough!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery donation through patreon will go directly to the channel / the purchase of albums. I will make sure to post updates on what is being done to put out better quality content for you guys. (I\u0027m currently using my phone to flim... heh). I want to be able to cover EVERY comeback eventually and be able to branch out into other types of videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e-- Topp--"
