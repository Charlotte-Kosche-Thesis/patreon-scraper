    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Trevor Nielson and I draw comics. I\u0027ve worked here and there creating and illustrating other peoples works and have more than a few of my own to show. Currently I\u0027m in the middle of telling the story of... myself. kinda\u0027 a diary/ graphic novel about me and the things I\u0027ve done (Army, Artist, Indian chief) O.K. I may have made up that last one...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe new book is called \"The Body Politik\". I can only work on it on my weekends and what little time off I have as I try to support my family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve put up various web sites to promote this idea in the past and had limited success finding an audience that was into comics as a storytelling form. \u00a0I am trying focus on completing a really good novel and gain a wider audience to share it with. Hence the reason I\u0027m here on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why am I here on Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I\u0027d love to be able to create graphic novels for a living. The goal here is to complete streams of constant income that allows me to more fully concentrate on investing 100% on creating comics. i would love to do a complete novel every year and Patreon is now allowing me to get another stream of income and allowing my supporters help out making my dream a reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat and When are the Updates:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to post 2 pages of content per month. As we progress and I am more able to fully realize the dream that would lead to more pages per post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can put a limit on the amount of money you want to contribute each month so feel free to cap out your donation if you only want to pay for one paid post each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Body Politik will always be free to read online but anyone who becomes a patron, in addition to helping me get this project finished, will also have access to the Patreon blog where I will post sketches, and work-in-progress stuff. This will allow you to make comments about pages before the rest of the world gets to see it plus you\u0027ll get to see other projects as they mature and get art previews before I post them on my other sites. I love getting reader feedback and it helps me strengthen my work, so who knows, you might even be mentioned or become a character...its my life, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for any and all support you give to The Body Politik, whether it\u0027s sharing it with your friends or contributing to its funding. I\u0027m nervous to see how this will work out and anxious to see what the future holds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrevor Nielson,\u003cbr\u003eArtist, writer, and general nuisence...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisit our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://luciferlive.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edeviantart page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eor check out our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thebodypolitix.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003every own website!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eor even better...follow us on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Trevor_Nielson\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eour twitter page!\u003c/a\u003e"
