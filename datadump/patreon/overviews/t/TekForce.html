    "summary": "My name is TekForce and my job is to make dope music and videos for all my nerds out there! I grew up as a kid that loved video games, anime, and cartoons. Along with my love of hip-hop, these are the things that defined me. As I got older I wanted to do combine both my love of Hip-Hop, and nerd culture so I came out with my first album Tek Support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI covered everything from different consoles like the NES to The Incredible Hulk. I even mentioned one of my favorite anime series of all time MACROSS! But this was just the beginning of my journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m ready to build on what I\u0027ve created by giving YOU more content.

     "about": "Tekforce, started out with a real love for hip hop from the time he entered this world. He had the benefit of having a big brother that played everything from Slick Rick to LL Cool J. This helped build a bond that would last his entire life. The one the group that planted the hip hop bug in him was: A Tribe Called Quest. When he heard their seminal album Midnight Marauders, it changed his world forever.\u003cbr\u003eFast Forward some years, and he started taking his music career seriously by creating tracks on his Playstation 1. A program called \u201cMTV Music Generator\u201d, gave him the tools to craft mini masterpieces  from samples and basic all kinds of music. His Emcee career began from this and he started to write to the songs he created\u2026..\u003cbr\u003eHe has been a gamer for as long as he can remember. His love affair started with Atari, and still continues this day through Xbox One and Playstation 4. Tek, eventually started crafting songs about his gaming experiences that he\u2019s had.  It began with his song \u201cLevel Up\u201d, which is an autobiographical recount of his life through the different  systems he\u2019s played.\u003cbr\u003eAs of now TekForce, is actively pursuing a Hip Hop career and making moves necessary to achieve his goals. His first album is going to be released in 2015 by the name of \u201cTek Support\u201d.  Tek, also has a tribute album in the works dedicated to the original 1982 classic \u201cTRON\u201d, called \u201cThe LightCycle Chronicles\u201d.With all the projects coming out and the promise of a bright future, 2015 is looking better than ever!!!!!!\u003cbr\u003e",
