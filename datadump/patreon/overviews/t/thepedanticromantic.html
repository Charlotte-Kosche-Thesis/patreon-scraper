    "summary": "I was a pretty good student so I\u0027d gone off to college like all good bois do, and it was there, the college paper specifically, that I began writing about anime. \u00a0Having consumed so much analysis of anime so ravenously (to the point of being a name a number of anime Youtubers would notice due to my presence in their comments) helped me get off to a fast start, and I started making videos during the summer break after my first year, where I was faced with a decision: Do I go back to college and go into more debt in order to get a degree that I don\u0027t want to be using? \u00a0You see by this point the creative satisfaction I was deriving from making these videos was so great that I\u0027d already determined that I too wanted to do what some of my favorite creators had done and make this a career. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m happy to say that creating videos has become my life. \u00a0I\u0027m often up into the early a.m.\u0027s typing out scripts that I can\u0027t get to sleep without finishing, and it\u0027s been wonderful. \u00a0The great response from those who have already becomes fans of my work, and the positive feedback from creators I loved who have checked out and in some cases seen fit to shout out my work has inspired a lot of confidence in me. \u00a0I\u0027ve devoted myself to reaching a point where I\u0027ll be secure in my ability to do this from here on out, which is where you come in. \u00a0It is only through people\u0027s appreciation of my work, and their determination that it is something whose existence is worth contributing to, that I can pursue this passion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI already feel such an immense level of gratitude for what this platform has enabled me to achieve so far, and if fueling some of my blazing otaku spirit yourself interests you then please consider joining those who have been doing so.\u00a0 Whether you\u0027ll be supporting me, or just humored me by taking a look at my rambling here, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
