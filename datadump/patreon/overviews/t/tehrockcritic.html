    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey-o guys! My name is Crash Thompson and since 2012 I\u0027ve been making album reviews, artist retrospectives, and other types of videos via my YouTube Channel: The Rock Critic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere\u0027s lots of cool stuff to check out here, such as my Quickies review series on new releases, my full length episodes (which tend to cover notable rock albums from the past), and my Top 10 episodes on various Rock-related topics. There\u0027s also my new series on Bad Album Covers as well as other various videos that we do simply for laughs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo... why should I contribute?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been doing this for a while now, and if I\u0027m being completely honest, YouTube\u0027s ad revenue just doesn\u0027t add up to much for a channel of my size. I have lots of new ideas for episodes, new series, and even new channels! But writing, shooting, and editing videos is hard work, and things like props, equipment, and expenses can really add up over time. As much as I sincerely love doing the show, it\u0027s currently done completely out of pocket and it can take it\u0027s toll on my finances. But if you like, you can help make the load a little lighter. With your support I\u0027ll be able purchase lots of various things to help improve the overall quality of the show, and perhaps even be able to make videos full time! Anything that you contribute would be EXTREMELY appreciated and would go towards helping to make the show even better!"
