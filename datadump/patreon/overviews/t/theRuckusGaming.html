As someone who loves playing games with friends, I think it\u0027s only right that I try to turn this hobby into a career. To do that though, I need your help! There are plenty of people out there creating quality content on YouTube and Mixer, but if you like what you\u0027ve seen on my channels, I\u0027d appreciate you contributing to the dream! Either way, I\u0027ll continue putting out great gaming content as long as I\u0027m able to do so, so please, don\u0027t feel pressured or required to do anything. However, if you\u0027d like to help me turn this fun past-time into a real job, well, I\u0027d be very grateful! I don\u0027t know how to thank you, so there aren\u0027t any rewards listed right now. If there\u0027s something you\u0027d like, just let me know what that is and I\u0027ll see if it\u0027s possible. For now, all I can do is say thanks and I really do appreciate it! See ya soon!!\u003cbr\u003e"
