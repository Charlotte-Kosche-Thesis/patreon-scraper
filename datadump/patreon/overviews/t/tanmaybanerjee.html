    "summary": "Art is not simply my profession, but over time it has developed into a passion and more importantly into a self-form of engagement that is self-revelatory, and that is what I have come to love and enjoy. The process of creation is the only real means for me to be able to express myself inside out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe graphic novel \"Into the Unknown\" (Man\u0027s Journey Into his Own Subconscience), one of my very recent projects is turning out to be an engaging process, from my own creative point of view. It is to a certain extent engaging for those few who have had the chance of following my work, thanks to a couple of comic book festivals that I have participated in Paris, as well as few local exhibitions in galleries. Through the response of the public, I have realised that my work is in many ways, and at various levels engaging to the reader, to say the least...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eInstead of keeping my work neatly arranged in my portfolio, I would like to use Patreon as a platform and make my work accessible to a larger public, who are generally interested in traditional comic book art techniques, or simply for those who appreciate any\u00a0artwork, done with great passion, patience,\u00a0and intent. \u003cbr\u003eThe very nature of the work might be a compelling factor for certain readers to disqualify this work as a graphic novel of some sort, due to varied reasons. The narrative is abstract, with complete lack of text; there is no precise storyline, nor a preconceived storyboard based on which the final drawings are done. It is only the process of drawing that determines the way the story line will develop. But, despite these unusual ways of engaging in the process of creating a novel, I feel this work is very much a graphic novel, thoroughly graphic in nature, abstract, dark, unnerving and yet absorbing. It is a project meant to engage the reader purely through the visuals. The understanding of the narrative is left to the reader\u0027s perception of things. At times it could be a superficial understanding of the sequence of images, in other cases the readers could respond to the narrative from a deeply personal and emotional understanding of either themselves or even a projection of themselves. And that is more important to me from a creators point of view\u00a0because a great number of deeper interpretations of the drawings are left unsaid or un-clarified, as far as the storyline is concerned. If the readers are in some sense perceptive to that, I feel satisfied as a creator."
