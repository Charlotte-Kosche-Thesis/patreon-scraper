One of my favorite ways to explore this is by reading about goddesses from different cultures throughout history.

A lot of time, energy and research goes into each photography session.

Every photoshoot I do is based upon a Goddess, a story, an environment, and imagery and artwork throughout history. This all takes planning and research, but is mainly a question of choice - which Goddess, which story, which environment? For my all-star level 6 Patrons, you will plan this all with me.
