    "summary": "It started as a joke. Something we could work on together, a funny way to keep our FC members informed and share some inside jokes. Then someone said \u201chey, this is pretty good. You guys should post this on Reddit\u201d, so we did.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA few hundred upvotes, and a full 24 hours as the top post on the FFXIV subreddit later, we realized we might be onto something here. There were plenty of people out there who enjoy reading about FFXIV as much as we do, so we got started on a second issue. \n\nSo far we\u0027ve published over 8 issues, and we take great pride in the fact that each one has been both longer AND better than the last. We\u2019ve evolved from a simple FC newsletter into what we like to think is a pretty impressive monthly digital magazine, and we\u2019ve done it with literally a $0 budget.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far we\u2019ve managed to scrape by on huge amounts of donated time and trial versions of the necessary software, but if we\u2019re going to continue to improve and deliver even more high-quality FFXIV content then the time has come, dear reader, for us to ask for your help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you love \u003cem\u003eThe Moogle Post\u003c/em\u003e and want to help us continue to deliver the content you enjoy, we need your help. Whether it\u2019s $1, $5, $10, or more, donations of any amount would honestly be a huge help! The monthly fees for Adobe software and our website aren\u2019t cheap, and we simply can\u2019t produce a 40+ page magazine each month without it.\n\nPlease consider donating to our cause, and helping us reach our dream of becoming Eorzea\u0027s leading source for fun and unique fan-created content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCheck us out at \u003cem\u003ewww.mooglemedia.com\u003c/em\u003e, on Twitter, and on Facebook as \u003cem\u003eThe Moogle Post\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e"
