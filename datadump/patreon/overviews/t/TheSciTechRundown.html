    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eWhat is the SciTech Rundown?!?\u003c/h4\u003eThe SciTech Rundown is a weekly newsletter dedicated to bringing its readers clear, unsensationalized summaries of the most interesting, impactful, and bizarre stories from across all fields of science and technology. The newsletter is written for an educated, but not necessarily technical audience. It includes easy to read, humorous, short summaries of each included story, including a TL;DR for the super-short attention span reader. The SciTech Rundown will always avoid sensationalism (but not sarcasm), and strive to produce entertaining, mildly humorous mailings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhy did we decide to create the SciTech Rundown?\u003c/h4\u003eIn looking at the world of science and technology journalism, there is a gap in coverage. On the one hand, there is the non-technical media, which is fraught with misleading stories, authors who fundamentally misunderstand the basic science of a story, and editors who are more interested in page views than sober analysis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand, science and technology communities have various academic journals, industry forums, magazines, and other resources. While these resources have a high degree of technical rigor, go into great detail, and deliver high value content, that content is usually beyond understanding of anyone outside of the specific field, let alone someone without a technical background. Additionally, academic journals are not known for being amusing reads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think the masses deserve more and better! We think that you shouldn\u0027t have to be a geneticist to get a reasonably detailed summary of the latest developments in CRISPR. You shouldn\u0027t have to be a nuclear enginer to understand the latest news from Germany about the\u00a0Wendelstein 7-X. Science and technology impact all of us, every day. We want to provide a weekly review that is approachable to as wide an audience as possible, provides detail, and keeps a level head.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eHow does supporting us on Patreon help?\u003c/h4\u003eWe are a small operation with limited time and resources. We have day jobs to keep the lights on at home, and as of right now, we are producing this weekly publication because we feel it needs to exist. Your sponsorship will help us move closer to having independent resources for the newsletter (our own servers, etc), allow us to reward our content producers (and hopefully grow them in number), and overall to produce better content and more content. We\u0027d love to have subject matter experts from all over the world contribute to the newsletter, but that level of coordination is a full time job. Help us get there!\u003cbr\u003e"
