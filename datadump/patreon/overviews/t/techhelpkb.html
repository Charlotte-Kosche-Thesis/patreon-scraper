    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eNice to See You!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking a moment to visit our Patreon page, and for your interest in supporting our efforts. We are seeking to supplement a reduction in advertising revenue caused by ad blockers and search engine algorithm changes with direct contributions from those who benefit from our content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe created \u003ca href=\"https://techhelpkb/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTech Help Knowledgebase\u003c/a\u003e to show our parents and grandparents how to use technology instead of explaining it over the phone. Been there? Our mission is to create easy-to-understand technical help articles and videos that don\u0027t require a Masters degree in Computer Science from MIT to understand. If you\u0027re the first point of tech support contact in your family 24/7, then we are kindred spirits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTech Help Knowledgebase is located in the stunningly beautiful San Francisco Bay Area of California, USA.  Our writers and contributors have decades of customer and technical support assistance and writing experience, primarily in the areas of web-based software.  As such, our articles and videos are intentionally focused on applications like operating systems, web browsers, web browser plugins, and other peripheral software applications.  We enjoy creating helpful articles and videos not only about how to use software, but about security issues and risks that may arise involving software, and how they could impact you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to be your family\u0027s top-tier technical support resource for those common issues. That way, the time you spend with your tech-savvy family members can focus on life\u0027s other priceless bounties instead. Our site is a safe haven where no technical support question is too stupid to ask. The pace of technological change is so rapid today that it seemingly takes a team just to keep up. If you can relate, and find value in the helpful work we do each day, please become a patron so that our team can continue to reach those who need the most help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA word about ad blockers. Our site is supported only by advertising revenue and donations from people like you. Tech Help Knowledgebase supports a secure and private internet, and ad blockers help to improve security, privacy and speed. But as ad blockers propagate through the web browser ecosystem, ad revenue diminishes on a daily basis. Direct support of websites you love through programs like Patreon guarantees the survival of original, independent content on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf becoming our patron today is not an option for you, but you still want to help, please visit the \u003ca href=\"https://techhelpkb.com/donate/\"\u003eDonate page\u003c/a\u003e on our site to review other opportunities to support our efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for your kindness,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Tech Help Knowledgebase Team"
