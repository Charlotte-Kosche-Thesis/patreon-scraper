    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you to all our patrons. Your generosity and willingness to help is a critical life-line to sustain our efforts without any creative compromise. It is because of YOU that we survive and so naturally, effortlessly, uncompromisingly, THRIVE. Thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis Ain\u0027t No Disco is a voluntarily made live music showcase, representing some of the most talented but under-represented and hard to pigeonhole musical visionaries in Ireland today. Hosted by DJ (and former host of the cult 90\u0027s TV program, No Disco) Donal Dineen, This Ain\u0027t No Disco is produced with a skeleton crew of friends and music enthusiasts, directed and then edited by music documentarian and award winning cinematographer Myles O\u0027Reilly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur objective when we began in 2017 was to voluntarily make as many shows as possible, to amass comprehensive evidence for the unprecedented surge in\u00a0unique and interesting music being produced underground in Ireland today, and match that with what we know to be a hungry appetite among mature audiences on-line, for new Irish alternative music. In order to be free to document whom we choose, film in any location we want and work at our own pace, we believe accepting any kind of corporate sponsorship or partnering with broadcast television, would restrict the amount\u00a0of freedom we joyfully experience, and severely\u00a0inhibit our musical and cinematic\u00a0scope. The crew of TAND is small, we\u0027re close friends, and we all give our time voluntarily in-between other media work, for the joy of playing a part in something so creatively free, inspiring, nurturing\u00a0and liberating. In the words of co-creator Donal Dineen, in making TAND \"All boats rise\", and it\u0027s evident that both musicians and crew feel real benefits from participating in each program.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe came here to Patreon because of one minor stumbling block, the unavoidable expense of distributing\u00a0TAND to our followers and new audiences via promotional resources made available to us on-line. On Facebook, our most popular delivery platform, we must pay for every time you press play. Each episode to date has amassed over 100,000 views, costing on average \u20ac0.03 per view. We want to double, triple, quadruple those viewership numbers by putting all proceeds of this Patreon account towards the promotion needed to target wider, more far-reaching audiences. There is no limit to our reach, so long as we continue to recruit patrons and receive your pledges. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support, and through our continued efforts and your generosity, the artists we feature will potentially feel\u00a0benefits from participating in This Ain\u0027t No Disco, for the rest of their lives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
