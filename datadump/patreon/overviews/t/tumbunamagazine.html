    "summary": "Tumbuna Magazine was created to preserve the various cultures within Papua New Guinea. Its primary function is to further tell the story of Black people that have existed in a place for over 50,000 years without colonialization, yet are unspoken for at large. Just starting this, in 2017, Tumbuna Magazine symbolizes the voice of the ancients. Tumbuna, a word taken out of Melanesian Pidgin (one of the official languages of Papua New Guinea), means ancestor, in its most sacred context. Tumbuna Magazine is a gift to the indigenous people who are at the forefront of change within a cultural war. As diverse as the world is, missionaries convince people that their indigenous beliefs are evil on a daily basis in Papua New Guinea. Tumbuna Magazine is an outlet for those who wish to pass down their wisdom to the younger generation in Papua New Guinea. We love anyone who is willing to learn and welcome you. Inclusiveness over exclusiveness, is a Melanesian principle that Tumbuna Magazine thrives on; there is a place for everyone to have a voice in this world. Much could be learned from the ancient ones."

     "about": "I can tell you that I graduated from the University of California Santa Barbara, wrote 3 books, travelled the world for 7 years, and many more things, but would that really tell you, the reader, anything about me? I was born in Los Angeles, California on April 21st, 1988; growing up, I had a very hard time finding my true cultural identity. In the United States, everyone thinks about race (Black, White, Brown, Red, Yellow), but ethnic background is often overlooked and misunderstood. For example, my parents immigrated to the USA from a small, English-colonized nation in Central America/the Caribbean called Belize, but I was labelled Black\u2014and Black only, despite my Belizean background!\u2014which caused a lot of confusion for me as a child because I had a strong accent (think of how a Jamaican accent sounds). My elementary school said that I was speaking incorrectly: I would say \u201ctree\u201d in place of three; my accent was so strong that my school sent me to speech therapy sessions. The whole experience caused me to be ashamed and jaded when it came to my own people. I thought everything about my culture was wrong. I wasn\u2019t until I, at the age of 17, lost my mother that I took pride in my Belizean background. Most Black people brought to the Americas by European explorers were slaves; my ancestors, for instance, worked the sugarcane fields of Belize against their own freewill, but does that define me? No, I am neither a \u201cnigga\u201d nor \u201cnigger\u201d despite what is portrayed in mainstream U.S American music and movies. Black people around the world work hard for \u201cpeanuts,\u201d and they live in the dignity of taking care of their families the best way they could. Should we blame White people for what their ancestors did? Absolutely not! I only ask people to try to understand the lingering consequences of colonialism. Four years ago, I cannot count how many times White people pulled over to lend me a helping hand when I backpacked across Australia from Cairns to Melbourne, and onwards in Tasmania. My view is simple: no one was born better or worse than another regardless of race, sex, creed, nationality or otherwise, for I\u2019ve met homeless young men with the wisdom of a thousand and old business people with the intelligence of a goldfish; with that being said, it is important to acknowledge one\u2019s self. Tumbuna, in Melanesian Pidgin, means ancestor. I was inspired to create Tumbuna magazine by my first visit to Papua New Guinea\u2014an old man in Madang literally cried when he explained to me how much culture was dying. When the ancients die, where does the traditions and wisdom go? Tumbuna magazine is symbol of the  ancients\u2019 fading voice; they must never be forgotten. Ol tubuna, the ancestors, lived in Papua New Guinea for over 50,000 years, and to lose their knowledge is simply unacceptable. If a young Papua New Guinean can sing, word-for-word, an U.S American rap song, there is no excuse for why they can\u2019t sing, at a minimum, one traditional song from their origin because the information is still living within the elders of their clan. Keep culture ALIVE!",
