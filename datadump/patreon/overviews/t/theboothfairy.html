They tell me how much this is needed out in the world, that they want to see more of it.\u00a0 I agree.\u00a0 We are living in a wonky world and the effect from the bliss mobs, free advice booth, slow clap, etc. is undeniable.\u00a0 It is restoring people\u0027s faith in humanity.\u00a0 These \u0027happenings\u0027 are FREE and FUN and interactive.\u00a0 I encourage everyone to get involved.\u00a0 Show up and get out of our comfort zones.\u00a0 I have never felt more alive than during one of the \u0027happenings\u0027.\u00a0 \u00a0There is science behind this.\u00a0 It is healing to be touched, \u0027seen\u0027, and connected to each other.\u00a0 This positivity is helping to counteract all the negativity that people are bombarded with on a daily basis. I feel the shift that is being created.\u00a0 It is bringing people together.\u00a0 Giving us permission to connect again.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eThe \u0027shitty advice\u0027 booth creates a portal for human connection.\u00a0 Yes. sometimes there is silliness and laughing and dancing, I use humor to get people\u0027s guard down and open their hearts.\u00a0 There is also important conversation, tears, vulnerability.\u00a0 I love to help people overcome struggles that I have dealt with in my own life.\u00a0 I help people quit smoking cigarettes, eat better, discontinue negative habits, and give them permission to get out of their comfort zone too, and be fully expressed in their life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what I was meant to do in my life.\u00a0 I have no doubt.\u00a0 I will continue to live this mission.\u00a0 The bliss mobs will spread and will take place across the US, causing the collective vibration to rise, and bring happiness and love to people everywhere.\u00a0 As the project grows, more advice booths, slow claps, \u0027free hug\u0027 signs will be created and distributed to spread this message of connection.\u00a0 I am asking you to help monetarily. To give $1 or more per month, and also to please come join in one of the events.\u00a0 I promise you will leave feeling better and more connected.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MISSION STATEMENT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are creating a platform for people to connect with one another, share ideas and get inspired!
