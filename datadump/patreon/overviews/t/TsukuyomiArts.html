    "summary": "Let me start by introducing myself. I won\u0027t give my real name, but seeing as shes part of my mascot here, you can call me Riku, or if you like TA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m 30 years old and I love drawing anime, as well as roleplay and a number of other things. I decided to do Patreon for a number of reasons but lets just break it down to, I wanted to do a job that I loved to bring in money. Which... lets be real here... I\u0027m broke.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live a very beat down life, and I\u0027m barely getting through each month. You heard the term \u0027starving artist\u0027 before right? Yeah... no joke there. No. Seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll that said, what I do his commissions. Anime commissions. I\u0027ll also be posting my own stuff I felt like doing on my own time too, but come on lets be serious, you probably care more about what you get out of this, right~?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/18416556\"\u003eHere is a list of my rules\u003c/a\u003e for commissioning for those who are interested.\u003cbr\u003eFor my prices, please refer to the reward tiers on the side there as prices depend on which tier you are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will need references for any commissions you guys want done though. I can do little minor stuff off my head, like pillows or whatever, but... come on~. You didn\u0027t come here for a picture of pillows~. So if you want any commissions done, please remember to have your references ready. Doesn\u0027t have to be an anime pic, I\u0027m good with using real pics as references too, I just need an idea what it is I\u0027m doing. This goes for hair and clothing too. I\u0027m not a mind reader after all~. Of course, you are welcome to tell me I can do whatever with the cloths if you want me to make it my own style instead. But otherwise, just make sure you\u0027re all set before you commission me or it will take longer for me to get started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI typically am able to get things done within three days or less, but if it takes longer than that I apologize. It shouldn\u0027t take me longer than a week or a month unless I\u0027m really sick or something. If that happens, I will be sure to let you all know I will have to pause everyones stuff until I\u0027m better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I hope you enjoy my page, my art, and have a nice day~.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, a big thank you to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.pixelparticles.com/#\"\u003ePixelParticles\u003c/a\u003e for allowing me to use his beautiful night sky background for my banner background, as well as for giving permission for me to use it in promotional stuff~!\u003cbr\u003eHes a truly amazing artist, and you should go check out more of his work, linked at his Website!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA thank you also to Piccolo\u00a0of Piccolo\u0027s Pizza for offering to make my business\u00a0cards into coupons to promote my\u00a0work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

So I really would like to hit this goal also to have a bit more stability here at home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$100 a month isn\u0027t perfect I give you that, and I can promise I will still likely be struggling as once I hit this they will probably cut me off the 60 bucks, so I\u0027ll only have this to work with... which of course means getting that printer will take a long time...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut hey! If I don\u0027t eat, or get too sick I can\u0027t make you guys art right? So in the end this comes down full circle, and moves right back around to all of you at the end anyways~.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo lets all hope so the goal!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a side note I will also give out shout-outs to all of those who became patrons of mine within the last month before this hit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI will also give one free t-shirt commission to a lucky winner of whoever was the last to become a patron above the $1 mark.\u003c/strong\u003e",

Of course that depends on a bunch of things...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless, as a reward for hitting this goal I will give away five free t-shit commissions to the last five highest paying patrons of the last day of the month prior to the hit goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I don\u0027t yet have the printer I wanted to get by then, I will make sure that I get it quickly so I can get out the last winner\u0027s prize too. A note will be made as a reminder to myself on the Discord. So don\u0027t worry, you\u0027ll get your prize.\u003cbr\u003e",
