    "summary": "It all started in first grade when the music teacher popped in a VHS of Elvis Presley. It didn\u2019t take long for the phrase \u201cidentity crisis\u201d to start being thrown around. Just because a kid has his mom dye his hair black, wears a gold jacket, and writes ELVIS PRESLEY on all his papers doesn\u2019t mean that he has an identity crisis. Ok... I had an identity crisis and was devastated when I was forced to realize that I was not the King. I\u2019ve spent the rest of my life trying to make Tyler cool. \u003cbr\u003eI got lucky one day at Holly Bond\u2019s music store in Paris, TX when I crossed paths with a man name Roosevelt Twitty. I was eleven years old and was mesmerized by a Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins style blues that he was playing in the corner of the shop. Almost instantly, the hook was in deep. He asked me if I liked the blues. I remember thinking, \u201cIf what you\u2019re doing is the blues, then the answer is YES.\u201d After hearing him play for a few brief moments I knew that there was an immense amount of joy to be found in music. I had a dirt bike that went up for sale the next day and I went back to the music store to put an electric guitar on lay away. He was in there again and told me, \u201cIf you want to learn to play the blues, I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d\u003cbr\u003eI took him up on that. Thank God.\u003cbr\u003eI remember that he\u2019d pick me up from school and we\u0027d listen to John Lee Hooker on the drive from Honey Grove to Paris, TX where he lived. We\u0027d sit in his dimly lit living room and listen to blues records and watch live concert footage of guys like Bobbie \u201cBlue\u201d Bland while eating cold salami sandwiches. He played me B.B. King for the first time, as well as so many other artists that have changed my life. He taught me the importance of sharing music. It\u0027s made for that. Mr. Twitty poured gasoline on a spark that Elvis had started and I became obsessed with any sound that made me feel something. I\u0027d wake up every morning and get completely lost in my favorite albums. I\u0027d lay in bed and listen to Alan Haynes \"Live at the Big Easy\" and close my eyes and pretend I was there at the show. I felt like I was. \u003cbr\u003eAs I started to become a better player, Mr. Twitty and I started playing out wherever and whenever people would have us. The Paris News named us the Blues Buddies and it stuck. We were both surprised when we got paid $92 a piece after playing our music at a cafe in Roxton, Texas. We didn\u0027t do it for the money. We did it because it made us happy! \u003cbr\u003eHe passed on to me what his Uncle Lonnie passed on to him and I consider that gift of music one of the most precious things I\u2019ve ever received.\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to fifteen year old me. I saw the Black Crowes for the first time at the Palladium Ballroom in Dallas and had the realization that rock and roll was just the blues with longer hair and more distortion. I was changed yet again. Mr. Twitty\u2019s health wasn\u2019t allowing him to get out and play as much, so I figured it might be time to begin dabbling with the dark arts of distortion, flare pants, and Marshall half stacks. I did my rock and roll homework over the next few years just as I had done with the blues.\u003cbr\u003eWhen I turned seventeen, I knew it was time to move to a city where I could start a band. There weren\u0027t many players floating around my country town of 1,700 people.\u003cbr\u003e I fudged my way through my junior year of high school but was one credit shy of being able to graduate early. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of wasting away in school for another year when I knew what I was meant to be doing. I enrolled in an online class, convinced my parents that I\u2019d find a way to graduate and would never ask them for money, and set my sights on Nashville, TN. \u003cbr\u003eLooking back, I was totally the stereotypical long haired dreamer barreling down 1-40 with my guitars, my records, and my favorite t-shirts. I was moving to \u201cMusic City\u201d to start a band. I figured that whole process would be easier than it turned out to be, but after six months of striking out, I finally got one right over the plate. A friend of a friend recommended that I get together with this \u201chot shit\u201d drummer named Caleb Crosby from Winchester, KY. Caleb and I instantly got on the same page in a dingy rehearsal room and played our first show a week later at club that was connected to the Palladium that I had seen the Crowes in. Synchronicity, man. Our second show was part of what we called the thirty for thirty tour. We drove fifteen hours in a borrowed Ford Expedition from Nashville to Amarillo to play a thirty minute set supporting REO Speedwagon. Thirty hours of driving for thirty minutes on stage might\u2019ve seemed dumb to most people, but we were LIVING IT UP! We continued to tour that year and after a set supporting Heart in San Antonio, I drove through the night to Honey Grove to enroll in High School the day before graduation. Since I never technically changed my address to Nashville, it worked out and I got a high school diploma after a senior year that consisted of starting what would become Tyler Bryant \u0026amp; the Shakedown. \u003cbr\u003eThese days, I spend most of my time and energy on the road or in the studio with the Shakedown. We give everything we\u2019ve got in our live performances and put so much into making our records and giving love to our supporters. \u003cbr\u003eI never feel as alive as I do when I\u2019m on stage with that band and I feel so lucky to be part of it. \u003cbr\u003eMr. Twitty showed me so much more than music when he said, \u201cJust go for it. Don\u2019t be afraid to mess up.\u201d That gift introduced me to songwriting, my best friends, and showed me well over twenty countries just last year.\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s what brings me here. On this page, I\u2019ll be sharing the songs that I write that don\u2019t necessarily work for the Shakedown as well as guitar videos that will hopefully serve as an inspiration to some of you with your own playing. Here I will not be confined by genre. I will remember that my first concert was George Straight at TX Stadium. I will be the little kid who was in awe of that many people getting together to celebrate a common thread as well as the man who has been fortunate enough to stand in front of that many people so many times over the last year. This page is for my back bench-seat musings and all of the other moods that come from traveling. This page is for my three chord story songs that you would probably never hear otherwise. Here I will tip my hat to the songs I\u2019ve lived my life to as well as try my best to give you songs to live yours to."
