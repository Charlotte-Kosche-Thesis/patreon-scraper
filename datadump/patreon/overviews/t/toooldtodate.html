We couldn\u0027t be more excited that you find it relateable, funny, and addictive. We\u0027re going to do whatever it takes to keep bringing you more episodes, but to do that we need a little help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting, casting, and producing the show while maintaining its quality doesn\u0027t happen without the help of our patrons. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eESPECIALLY casting\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.

Not an advice show, a scripted show. Like on TV, but you can\u2019t watch it. You can listen to it though, and imagine that we\u2019re more attractive than we really are. You can feel comfort in knowing that you\u2019re not alone. Well, technically we\u2019re all alone. We all die alone anyway. But this show is funny! Way funnier than dying alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToo Old To Date consists of eight-episode seasons culled from the desperately lonely minds of creators Brad Garoon \u0026amp; Mike Tanzillo.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/too-old-to-date/id1198414984?mt=2\"\u003eSubscribe on iTunes\u003c/a\u003e and wherever else you listen to podcasts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
