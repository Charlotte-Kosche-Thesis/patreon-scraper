    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eThanks for Visiting\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI created this Patreon page so that I can dedicate more time to producing the content that you want to see.  I have a limited amount of time to create content, and right now I need to do it all alone.  Your Patreon support will help me to spend less time on web design projects and more time on the content you want to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat Do I Produce?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spend a lot of time in front of computers leading me to learn a lot over the years about various forms of technology.  My videos reflect my 20 years in computers and 15 years doing web design work.  I have had to work with clients on all platforms, including the various mobile platforms.  I have stood out as a teacher in these areas, probably owing to my time as a college professor.  Now I give back on some of my learning and expertise over the years to produce videos about the GNU/Linux operating system, other technologies, and privacy concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, my life has been touched by Christ.  I make the direct effort to not preach in my technology videos so that people interested only in the technology will not be distracted by religious themes, so I save those for my Christian-specific work.  I have volunteered several years as a youth worker in Christian camps, Sunday schools, VBS, and other endeavors.  I turned to writing and blogging to teach what I have learned about the Christian faith.  Your support will also help me spend more time on writing and content creation centering of faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been able to take on a busy schedule over the years due to my application of nutritional studies.  My education began as I started to study health and nutrition in high school.  This led me to study biological sciences for ten years after high school.  While my college teaching centered around these topics, I have generally applied my studies at home in the kitchen learning how to make fabulous dishes without the gadgets.  My Home Cooking Hacks channel will show you how I have created kitchen masterpieces as well as talking about health and nutrition according to sound science, not political agenda.  I can take the time to do this with your support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat You Get for Helping\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will offer updates and advanced schedule notices to my Patrons first.  For higher level patrons I will release up to two videos per week one day early before they go public and monetize with ads.  I will also be filming some behind the scenes, detailed Q\u0026amp;A, advanced software setup, and more that will not go public.  My highest level patrons will be able to receive a one-on-one 50 minute meeting over Hangouts, Skype, or some other medium to answer any questions, consult on a business idea, or anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat the Community Gets for Helping\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour Patreon support will help the channels to grow and increase in quality.  With your help I will be able to take on some part-time employees in the beginning, and maybe grow into more staff to help with content concepts, editing, producing, and more.  This will help to increase both the volume and the quality of the content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you again for your support and I look forwarding to serving you all in the future.\u003c/p\u003e"
