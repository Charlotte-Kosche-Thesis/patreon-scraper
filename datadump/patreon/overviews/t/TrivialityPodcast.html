As a way to sharpen our skills and kill some time, we decided to create Triviality- a weekly trivia show where as we say \u201ca lack of seriousness meets a little bit of knowledge.\u201d We would like to create the best product that we can and so we created this page to try and do just that. We hope the fact that you are on this page means you are considering supporting us. We would appreciate your support if you feel we have earned it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTriviality (Jeff, Ken, Matt, and Neal)\u003cbr\u003e"
