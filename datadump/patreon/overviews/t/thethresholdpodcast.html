    "summary": "First off, even if you don\u0027t end up becoming a patron,\nthank you. Thanks for taking some of your valuable time to check out what we\nare working on.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI live in a beautiful and amazing city that is known as\none of the most secular and unchurched parts of the country. It\u0027s a place where\npeople often mistake being polite for being kind, and where the value of\ntolerance often implies keep your nose down and not talking about things we\nmight disagree about. But in the middle of the culture that can seem anti-religious, I often have amazing conversations\nabout faith, belief, and life with friends\nwho are atheist, pagans, agnostics, or just don\u2019t fall into an easy category of\nbelief. It often seems that the only people\nwho don\u0027t want to talk about faith where I live are Christians. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNo matter what your religious background\nis, your beliefs shape your worldview and I want to break the stigma that your faith and beliefs are\nsomething that should be hidden. Faith is deeply personal\nand I have a hard time feeling like I really know you if I don\u0027t know\nwhat you believe in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI started The Threshold Podcast with my buddy Fr. Colin\nto do something I love doing at my Church - inviting people\nof any and every religious background to sit down for a short conversation about\nwhat they believe, why they believe it, and why it matters to them. If you also\nfeel like we should be able to have essential\nconversations about some of the biggest questions we face in life, I would\ninvite you to support this great new podcast. So I hope you join me every week\nas we eff ineffability and talk about what\nreally matters.\u003cbr\u003e"
