I am tiarawhy, an animator who seeks to create various silly animations as well as adult ones. For many years i\u0027ve found there to be a huge lack of adult related humor \u00a0as well as adult animations/games. Instead of waiting for someone else to finally produce content requested by many, i have decided to step up and do it ourselves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, animation and game creation takes a lot of time and work. To make projects in a timely manner i have decided to go full time in their creation. For this to function i will rely on a steady source of income via crowd funding. All the animations and games I\u0027ve made and will make will be free now and in the future! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus your contributions help greatly, no matter how small, to continue to allow me to create many games and animations. Your pledges can be anonymous, you can cancel your pledge at any time and you can easily set monthly limits.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYoutube CPM and animators:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis may be news to you, but animators on youtube have been leaving the site in droves since 2012, and many have converted to letsplays/liveblogs (like egoraptor or oney or ricepirate). Pre 2012, your CPM (CPM is cost of views per 1000 views) was calculated by total views. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, due to the reply girl scandal (where girls spammed comments with videos and ranked millions o views) google decided to change the system and make the CPM be ranked by watch time. This is why so many liveblogs/letsplays arose. The system rewards mass uploads and lenght instead of short works and quality. Now to earn from youtube you must upload 10 videos a week and have 10 minutes or longer to be put in a devent CPM range, otherwise the system considers you bottom barel\u003cbr\u003eBecause of this the exodus of animators began, no longer being able to earn a paycheck (and you can check their respesctive youtube channels with their comments on this subject).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA letsplay can put out 10 videos a week taht are 10 minutes long (many put out far more). Lets say only 20% of all people watch each video all the way through. That is still 2 minutes of watch time per video per day, which adds up to a lot of minutes. In comparison,  an animator, at best I can produce 1-2 videos a month of 1-2 minute lenght (if i really rush it too, often it takes more than a month to make one animation). \u003cstrong\u003eDespite having 100% watch time\u003c/strong\u003e, for the entire month i only have that 1-2 minute watch time total. This is why all the animators and other peolple who take time to make things have been completely trashed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where \u003cstrong\u003epatreon \u003c/strong\u003ecomes in. It allows you, the \u003cstrong\u003efans\u003c/strong\u003e, to support creators such as myself and allow us to take the time to produce content that you enjoy, and allow us to pay bills and focus on the things we love to do which is animating! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs this a content paywall?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbsolutely not!
