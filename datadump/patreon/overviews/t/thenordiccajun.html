    "summary": "Hello, my name is Jamie Burt, aka \"The Nordic Cajun.\" \u00a0And I am a storyteller. My medium? Comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up, I always had a very vivid imagination, creating characters, worlds, good guys, bad guys, creatures, and whatever else fit the mold to what I was thinking of at the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve created characters and, in my own mind, threw them into popular shows like Dragonballz, Naruto, One Piece, Teen Titans, and other web based comics like PPGD and Grim Tales. I placed them into these worlds, just to see how they would interact with the heroes and villains there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, I made places for them to call home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worlds that have a deep seeded history, characters in those worlds that you will love to love, hate to love, and love to hate. Their journey is amazing, but there is only one problem:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo date, i\u0027m the only one who\u0027s been able to enjoy them. So, with Patreon, i\u0027m hoping to change all that. I want to share my creations with the world and show you the characters i\u0027ve fallen in love with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first and main goal is to use Patreon not only as a launch pad to get my creations off the ground, but to help support my family. \u00a0I have a 4 month old baby that I want to share the world with, and this is going to help us get there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the day, however, it\u0027s about entertaining you guys. I want you to enjoy my creations and their journey just as much as I do. Maybe even a little bit more. Who knows, you may just end up creating your own story one day by seeing something in my stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are two comics I desire to do. The first is a webcomic story called \"Shut Up And Roll.\" It\u0027s a gaming comic about a group of people who get together to game in the realms of \u00a0MMO, Moba, D\u0026amp;D, and other types of table top fun. It\u0027ll be light hearted, fun but also have some drama involved with the crew.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other is my brain child. A comic I came up with at the mere age of 15. \u00a0It is going to be a major undertaking and will be my pride and joy once I get to start it. However, the grand scale of it requires much more of my time. \u00a0So hopefully Patreon and you will help me to realize this story sooner rather than later. It is known as \"The Darkness Chronicles\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal is to release 2 drawings a week to be seen early by my patrons, then one comic a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for your love and support! I hope to bring you smiles, tears, and gasps as I share with you my stories, my characters, and myself with you! Until our next crossing, stay classy!\u003cbr\u003e"
