    "summary": "Table of Two Cities is a food and story telling project of refugees and asylum seekers in Hong Kong. The project was created in response to the lack of media objectivity when writing about refugees and inadequate\u00a0crisis response from the government to assist asylum seekers in the city. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTable of Two Cities refers to the different lives led by refugees and Hong Kong residents, coexisting but seemingly living in different cities due to the differences in their lived experiences. We hope to bring two cities to one table, through the medium of food. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe are running test kitchens to document recipes but we need assistance to buy ingredients and support the participants from Hong Kong\u0027s Refugee Union who are cooking for the project. Right now we\u0027re focusing on Hong Kong, since it\u00a0has one of\u00a0the lowest refugee processing rates for a developed city. Refugees who find themselves here are\u00a0also given no international legal protection under the Refugee Convention, as Hong Kong is not a signatory.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe aim of our project is for refugees and asylum seekers to tell their stories directly, while sharing their culture. This project seeks to empower and give people pride and ownership in their work while raising awareness about the lives lead by refugees in Hong Kong. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur long term goal is\u00a0to crowd-fund a book of all these recipes and stories to continue to support refugee and asylum seeker services, particularly the ongoing\u00a0advocacy efforts of Refugee Union Hong Kong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tableoftwocities.org\"\u003eTable of Two Cities\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
