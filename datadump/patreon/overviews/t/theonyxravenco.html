Nice to meet you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you may have arrived here from my YouTube channel or maybe my Instagram, where I post creative content such as Planning, Papercraft project\u2019s, DIY\u2019s, Art Journaling, Vlogs and anything else I am passionate about. I just want to thank you so much for your support on my creative journey, it means more than you know and thank you for stopping by my Patreon to have a look.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY BECOME A PATRON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecoming a Patreon Raven will mean that you will have access to exclusive content, freebies, photographs, vlogs and other amazing rewards! These will not be available anywhere else, on any of the other platforms that I post to. These will be exclusively for YOU! I have worked really hard to create reward tiers that will suit everyone\u2019s preferences and budget (please look after yourself financially first!). It would be amazing to create to a community of Ravens who have similar interests, a creative spirit and the love of a good old natter! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to know a little bit more about me, you can find \u2018My Story\u2019 below.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY STORY.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI was a born crafter. I swear I came out of the womb completing one of those Galt craft sets. If you have no idea what I\u2019m talking about, then it means I really am approaching 30 and can officially begin to start sentences with \u2018When I was a young \u2018un...\u2019! Haha. Apart from various craft sets, I primarily made cards, dabbled in cross stitch and drew. I loved drawing so much as a teenager.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it came to choosing my GCSE\u2019s, I desperately wanted to do Graphic Art and Drama but they would only let me participate in one. I chose Drama (not lightly) because back then I had dreams of being a performer, I even went on to achieve a BTEC and a Degree in Performing Arts. Plus, 10 years of dance medals in Latin American and Ballroom dancing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the many highs of University, I also experienced some crushing lows and as a result never quite managed to get my much sought after Oscar!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter many years of taking jobs to just get by, highs, lows, being in love, experiencing heartbreak, moving more times than I\u2019d have liked and finding myself along the way; I met the green eyed love of my life, Liam. After less than a year of dating, I found myself living and working beside him at his business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was here that my life as I knew it would change forever... I found the Planner Community. You mean I can be the organisational freak that I am and be creative... AT THE SAME TIME?! I was introduced to it by an intern at the business, who has since become one of my closest and dearest friends. That was around October 2016. This lead me to the world of YouTube, which I had previously just used to watch live performances of Britney Spears and funny animal videos. Who knew it could be so much more?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January 2017, I started a YouTube channel, just as circumstances changed with my job and as a result our finances. I loved it from the word \u2018Go\u2019 and it sparked a passion in me. It combines both my love for art/creativity and performance. This has lead me here, to Patreon. Patreon has always been a goal for me. I have been a patron to a handful of creatives myself, for a while now and it brings me so much joy to support them. My wish is to be able to create more, exciting and high quality content\u00a0because I want to be able to give so much more. To you, to my fianc\u00e9 and family, to my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this and for considering becoming a Patreon Raven.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsh xx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
