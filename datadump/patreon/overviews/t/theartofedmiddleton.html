Thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess this is the part where i tell you a little about myself. Im a Florida native thats been an artist for as long as i could remember. I spent my childhood outside playing or gawking at Saturday morning cartoons. I decided to pursue a career in comics after college and i never looked back. My love of art stems from the feeling that people get when they view it. I love making people happy with using my imagination, \u00a0and its the driving force behind my talent. Come help me make more amazing art, and we can have a blast on this adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for the love and Patronage! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY GOALS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eMy goal is to make content that people love. Its to express myself creatively and fluently while entrancing my audience in the world that ive created. That wouldn\u0027t be possible without the aid of my backers \u00a0financially and creatively. There are ways that my audience can help influence the course of my work so that we can one day take it to a big animation studio and show that there is a demand for it.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT ME?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eDont get me wrong, you dont have to pledge support for me here on Patreon (although that would be amazing), and i dont want to twist your arm.

Ive always had a passion for drawing (since before i could remember). You can say that It\u0027s my first love. What really made me pursue it professionally was the impact that it had on the people around me. I discovered at a young age that i just wanted to make people smile doing what i love. I currently have 2 books in the works that i will be illustrating myself. I have published one book and have done hundreds of prints and cover art. I am well seasoned , and most of all Humbled by your Patronage :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow me on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EdMiddletonArt/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/emiddl01\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ed_middleton_art/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e",
