Distinguishing itself still further, TQR conducts \nday-to-day business on the site\u2019s message boards, making it the only \ne-zine with an editorial process that lets its investors see how the sausage is made. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur\n process has three stages. First, there\u2019s the Floor, where \u003ca href=\"http://www.tqrstories.com/index.php?option=com_content\u0026amp;task=view\u0026amp;id=5\u0026amp;Itemid=67\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esubmissions\u003c/a\u003e are initially received. Those that survive the first cut are sent up to \nthe Terminal for deeper scrutiny and discussion. Of these, a few may \nascend to the Executive Suite for a final determination of\u00a0whether it is worthy\u00a0of the mantle: Capital Gain. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this age of skinny zines publishing \ntiny stories, TQR supplies a niche to that endangered species of \nartist that fills up notebooks-worth of deathless prose.\u00a0 As \nour motto proclaims, \u201cStories are our Business.\u201d Stories, front and back\n and behind the scenes; churning, bubbling and rubbed together into a \nprotean brew that\u0027s been boiled down and reduced to its base constituents to bring you what we call Total Quality Reading: TQR.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Therefore, it occurred to him that an e-zine dedicated\n to the proposition \u2018Stories Are Our Business\u2019 should adopt a corporate \nbusiness model that treats its assets, venture capitalists and investors\n with the reverence and a respect any publicly traded company would, and\n has to continue to treat them in order to survive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTQR is first \nand foremost about capital gains, but also realizes the process of \ngetting to that designation can be just as interesting. Featured on its cover page along with the quarterly capital gains are the offices wherein the work that may eventually grace its mainframe are actively being vetted by a group of dedicated capital managers and brokers whose only goal is to find that work of exceptional quality that rises only on its ability to touch the monkey.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only is TQR after a healthy share of the \u2018serious\u2019 reading public, \nit also wants to appeal, in part, to gamers and/or comic book \nenthusiasts who enjoy ensconcing themselves in an alternate universe, \nwhere a man named Rorschalk wields the power to OK or nix a venture with\n a few strokes of his keyboard, thereby making a mortal enemy of his \nsubordinate, yet equally devious, Boligard Doomey, who may attempt to \nexact some kind of revenge in the following quarter or quarters to come \n[revenge is a dish best served cold, remember]. If TQR can appeal to \nthese people along with those who are purely capital gains enthusiasts, \nthen market share stands to be greatly increased. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
