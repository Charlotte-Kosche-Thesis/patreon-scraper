Each page is a window into a different moment in his life told out of order, focusing on memories both existential and mundane. A story influenced by personal experiences and stories told to me by countless individuals, This Is Jim rides on an emotional rollercoaster filled with somber notes and absurdist humor. The first chapter of this project (titled \u201cThis Is Jim\u201d) was released online in its entirety in the form of daily updates until its last update on May 23rd, 2017. Jim is now currently running again as a second chapter titled \"I\u0027m Sorry Jim\" (Monday through Friday!), which my Patreon subscribers will have access to early.

It\u2019s a comic that thrives on character dialogue and plays off various Hero\u2019s Journey/video-game tropes for its storytelling and comedic delivery. Updates every Monday and Friday!

A lot of original pieces, some fan art here and there...it\u2019s a good time. Plus, if you\u2019re one of my $2+ Patreon supporters, you\u2019ll get to see my process work on each of these pieces as they\u2019re being worked on. Bonus!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to someday support myself completely on my own art projects and freelance work, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve set up shop here on Patreon. With the help of my fans, I can continue to work towards my goal of forwarding myself as a creative and eventually sustain my lifestyle as a full-time self-employed artist. The Whatever Chronicles and This Is Jim are both projects that I always intend to offer FOR FREE online, as I believe art should be shared, not hoarded. That being said, gaining your support through Patreon allows me to put more time into sharing more exciting content with you, like my works in progress, commentary, and also hi-resolution versions of my art for you to enjoy that you can\u2019t get anywhere else. Don\u2019t have the cash to support me financially? No biggie, but always feel free to share my work with your pals and see if they\u2019d be willing to toss a dollar or two per month my way. It all goes a long way and helps me get that much closer to my goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for dropping in guys, I hope you\u2019ll stay tuned for all the fun! And even if you can\u2019t donate, be sure to follow my page for consistent updates and finished art that I share publicly. Stay beautiful everybody.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTanner S.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
