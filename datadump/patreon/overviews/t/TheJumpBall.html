    "summary": "My name is Mo and I bring 15 years of basketball experience at every level to this blog. I was a Manager with Santa Monica College and USC Men\u0027s Basketball (1999-2005), and the Associate Head Coach at Santa Monica College Men\u0027s Basketball team (2005-2006). After that I spent the following 8 years as Video Coordinator in the NBA with the Los Angeles Clippers (2006-2009, 2011-2014) and San Antonio Spurs (2009-2011). During my time in the NBA, I spent 3 off seasons as a member of the Australian National Men\u0027s Basketball team (2010-2012) including qualifying for and taking part in the 2012 London Olympics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo Coordinators are responsible for providing coaches, players, and front office with film broken down for analysis. I was responsible for assisting coaches with preparing for our upcoming opponents, going over our own film, and assisting the front office with draft preparations. VCs also prepare film for the players to review whether it is their own play or who they may be guarding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is through my years of experience that I am able to provide a different perspective to viewing basketball. I have studied under some of the NBA\u0027S best coaches like Gregg Popovich, Brett Brown, and Doc Rivers. I\u0027ve been extremely lucky to have worked with up close hall of famers, NBA Champions, and MVPs like Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Chris Paul, Chauncey Billups, and Grant Hill. I\u0027ve seen the growth of players like Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, Patrick Mills, and Matthew Dellavedova. I also had the pleasure to work with 2014 Sixth Man of the Year, Jamal Crawford. I even got a shout out in his acceptance speech.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/CjWq0Vyd2cg\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/CjWq0Vyd2cg\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can be reached at Mo@thejumpball.net and on twitter @MoDakhil_NBA\u003cbr\u003e"
