Without you, our followers, none of this is possible, and everything we do, we do because for you. And with your help, we will continue to pump out as much content as we can. So, from Tyler, Josh, and Brock, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you may have guessed, this is a podcast dedicated to all things nerd and geek, hosted by three nerdy and geeky guys--Tyler Lee, Josh Forrester, and Brock Parsons. On it, we discuss all the things we love, from literature, to video games, to comics, movies, TV series, manga, anime, tabletop, D\u0026amp;D, and so much more, sprinkling in pop culture news, interviews, and a whole lot of ridiculously stupid banter for your amusement. You can catch all of our regular episodes right down here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://nerdcultpodcast.com/\"\u003enerdcultpodcast.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside the podcast, we also have video reviews, Lets Plays on some of our favorite games, and You\u0027re Doing It Wrong where we...well...play video games completely the wrong way, video episodes of the podcast, and more. These are all found on our\u00a0Youtube channel, but our patrons get first look at them long before anyone else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you like it!"
