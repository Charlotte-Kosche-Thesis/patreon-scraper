We know people are busy and don\u0027t have time to play every game or to keep up with all the news so our goal is to be a resource for those gamers with video game news, discussions, game reviews and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe like to think of it as gaming with your friends. We all have a good time and hope you guys do too. Until now, we\u0027ve been paying for everything out of our own pockets. We\u0027ve put out well over 300 hours worth of content and in order to continue to provide that level of content we need to start making some revenue to continue to support our growing expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, we can improve the quality of the content we create and grow our community of gaming friends!"
