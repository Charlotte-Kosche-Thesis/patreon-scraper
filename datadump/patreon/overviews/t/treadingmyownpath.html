    "summary": "Hello! My name is Lindsay and I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re here! Creating\na world without waste is my passion. As well as doing everything I can\npersonally, I love helping, supporting and inspiring people to live with less\nwaste and begin the path to a more sustainable lifestyle. I create weekly blog\nposts packed with useful independent advice on my website \u003ca href=\"http://treadingmyownpath.com/\"\u003etreadingmyownpath.com\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also established\nthe Zero Waste \u0026amp; Plastic-Free Perth group, but my enthusiasm and focus\nreaches far beyond the online world. I\u0027m a huge believer in growing and\ncelebrating community. I\u2019m co-founder of the Rutland Corner Community Food Tree\nProject, Transition Town enthusiast, and member of several other awesome\ncommunity groups doing great things. We can achieve so much more when we\u0027re in\nit together!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy Patreon? Well. It\u0027s like this. As my website has grown in\npopularity, so have the upkeep costs and the time to maintain the site. Other\nblogs deal with this by using advertising and sponsorship to pay for costs, but\nthis isn\u2019t a route I want to go down. Many of my readers love that my writing\nis always independent and articles are free of third-party adverts, and we\u2019d\nall like to keep it that way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI won\u2019t write about a life with less stuff, and then try to\nsell people stuff. It\u2019s simply not my style. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is an opportunity for my readers who are inspired by what\nI do and get value from it to support what I do. Several followers have asked how\nthey can support my work, and Patreon offers that solution. It\u2019s\nvalue-for-value exchange \u2013 and that\u2019s what I love. Everyone wins. By becoming a\nmember you\u2019ll get access to new content (including video) that I only share\nhere, and behind-the-scenes glimpses created just for you. You\u0027ll get to hear\nabout my new projects before anyone else. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat\u0027s more, you\u0027ll even be able to help steer the direction\nof my website and the resources I create, by telling me what you want to see\nmore of. Who doesn\u0027t want to be a director?! And I promise, I\u0027m a very good\nlistener.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks friends. I couldn\u0027t do it without you. Here\u0027s to\nmaking the world a less wasteful place.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLindsay.\u003cbr\u003e"
