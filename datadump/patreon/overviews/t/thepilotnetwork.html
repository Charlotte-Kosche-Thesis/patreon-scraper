    "summary": "The Pilot Network intends to expand our pilot network and help us all in future endeavors; to \u201cpay it forward\u2019 as it were. With the aviation career field comes the unknown, and a good network is often the difference in sitting on the sidelines or getting into the game. Some of us have the job we want; many of us don\u2019t yet. The Pilot Network gives us the chance to reconnect to old aviation colleagues, seek out new avenues within this great career, or just give a helping hand to those coming up in this vocation. We have grown to over 7000 members and add more every day! We need to branch out: Facebook is only the beginning of the TPN platform and that takes money. With your support we can keep TPN growing while not forcing members to pay subscription fees. Stay tuned for big things! Whether you are seasoned veteran with 10,000+ hours or a newbie starting out, the right network can help you find your last job. Thank you for supporting The Pilot Network!"
