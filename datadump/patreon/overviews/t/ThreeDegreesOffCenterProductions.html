    "summary": "Hi there, I\u0027ve been making YouTube videos for over 9 years now and been having a great time doing it. I\u0027ve found that my body swap/transformation videos are always really popular, so I\u0027m setting up this Patreon page to help me fund the production of more of these videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the important thing for every supporter to know is that you\u0027ll only ever be charged when I put out a new body swap/transformation video, so if I don\u0027t make one of those, you\u0027ll won\u0027t be charged a thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always pushing myself to make really creative videos and to post as often as I can, but sadly I don\u0027t always have the resources necessary to make \u0027the magic\u0027 happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery video I\u0027ve made (up until the Website of Change) has been made with friends volunteering their time to help me out on my channel. This has been great and I\u0027ve made a lot of fantastic content with help of all of these awesome people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are however a few drawbacks to depending on people volunteering their time to make videos, one being that if they have the chance to make money elsewhere on a job, they will understandably cancel. A LOT of projects that I\u0027ve planned haven\u0027t been made because of this, so I get delayed a few months while others just get put on hold forever.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now with your help, I\u0027m going to start offering financial incentives to get my videos made.\u00a0I did this for the first time ever on one of my latest videos, The Website of Change, and the results speak for themselves. I needed an actress who spoke Russian and since I didn\u0027t know anyone, I hired Katrina to be in the video.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsW7n7U64HQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsW7n7U64HQ\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend a lot of time tracking down people to be in my videos, time that could be better spent writing, filming and editing. And I\u0027m hoping if I get enough Patreon support, I might even get additional help either producing or editing my videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support and for supporting independent film making!\u003cbr\u003e"
