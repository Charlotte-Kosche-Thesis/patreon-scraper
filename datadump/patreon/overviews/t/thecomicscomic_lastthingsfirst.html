    "summary": "Hi. I\u0027m Sean L. McCarthy, the founder and editor of thecomicscomic.com, your definitive guide to comedy and comedy news since 2007.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m finally launching a podcast so you can hear all the great inside stories I\u0027ve been hearing from comedians and entertainers over the past decade and a half. Last Things First asks comedians and funny people about the historic lasts and firsts in their lives as their comedy careers have blossomed. From young people with dreams to adult people living those dreams. Or still dreaming. Questions both big and small are asked and answered. Hopefully you\u0027ll find it both amusing and illuminating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast launched in July 2015, with new episodes coming twice a week (Mondays and Thursdays).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are some early testimonials from the funny people who\u0027ve appeared on Last Things First already...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePete Holmes called me \"the Ewok of comedy.\"\u003cbr\u003eMarc Maron: \"It\u0027s up! Finally!\"\u003cbr\u003eHoratio Sanz: \"I love this.\"\u003cbr\u003ePaul Scheer: \"Sean take his interviews seriously This is one of the best/most researched interviews I\u0027ve done. Listen\"\u003cbr\u003eMary Mack: \".\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/thecomicscomic\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@thecomicscomic\u003c/a\u003e has patience! Pod starts \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SweetleafLIC\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@SweetleafLIC\u003c/a\u003e (great Jo), moves outside \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/creekandcave\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@creekandcave\u003c/a\u003e, gets rained on...\"\u003cbr\u003eBrian Posehn: \"This is one of my favorite interviews I\u0027ve ever done. Short and sweet.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast is free, of course. But creating professional shows costs money. Not only the basic hosting of the content, but also the producing and post-production costs per episode, as well as the professional musicians (Camille Harris and Shockwave) and web designers (Gigglechick) I\u0027ve hired to work with me. And professional artists should be compensated for their work. We\u0027re all in this together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease become a paid subscriber of my podcast, Last Things First, via Patreon.com, and I\u0027ll give you bonus audio content, newsletters and more that other listeners aren\u0027t getting for free. It\u0027ll be worth your time and investment. Thanks!"
