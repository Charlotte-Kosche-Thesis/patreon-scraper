I have a lot of other passions and so many things i want to learn and become better at, there\u0027s barely any paths i wouldn\u0027t walk. I\u0027d love to see if Patreon is a place where i could make my passions and all these ideas i have come to life!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eCurrent projects\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been pumping out music for a long time now and just recently started slowing down my output because of my job, and because i want the quality of my work to be higher. This is a bit harder because i do all my own Mixing, Mastering and record all my vocals in my very home-made studio. I do most of all my production and well, everything else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eFuture Ideas\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh man where do i start. Music videos is a big one I\u0027ve always felt stressed about, i just don\u0027t want to settle for some poor quality rap video. I grew up on watching Youtube and gaming videos, and have made horribly embarrassing videos all throughout my childhood (like most creators, lol). i\u0027ve always wanted to start streaming on Twitch and things like that. I also love podcasts, and have so many ideas for topics and interviews that i would love to see happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eMY MUSIC\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/truettthehuman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundcloud\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://truett.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBandcamp\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://truettthehuman.bigcartel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\nSocial Media (mostly graveyards)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/truettthehuman/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Truettthehuman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e"
