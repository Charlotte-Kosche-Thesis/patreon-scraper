    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Blood Crow Stories\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is an anthology series of horror stories. Each season we will tell a new, original story over the course of 20 episodes. \u003cem\u003eEach season\u003c/em\u003e will have its own unique production and storytelling style.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur first season highlights the story of the \u003cem\u003eS.S. Utopia\u003c/em\u003e, a cruise ship in the early 1900\u0027s. Modern-day college student, Max, begins to do his thesis on the audio diaries of the passengers on the ship. What he didn\u0027t know were the horrors that were waiting for him among the tapes, and why the ship sank so mysteriously almost 100 years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur second season takes us out to the old western town of Blackchapel; a quiet mining community full of hardworking people. Sheriff Thomas has been married to his job for many years. However, when men start turning up dead, all in the same fashion, he sets out to learn about these murders plaguing not just his quiet town. There\u0027s a serial killer loose in the Old West.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn future seasons we want to search for terrifying tales around the world and all through time, and grow to be your favorite place to get scared.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is making this show?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show was conceived and created by us, Ellie Collins and Scott Moore. Ellie was a veteran podcaster of interview shows, and Scott was a regular audio engineer. Being fans of horror and drama, they decided to join to bring to life a story Ellie had been tossing around for a while. The decided to use what free-time they had to create something genuine that could feel like a love letter to the fans, even in the face of terror. With that, they did the first casting among friends, many of whom had never acted before. Everyone volunteered their time and skills to make this the best possible show. With the love and support of the fans and crew, the show rapidly grew from two friends wanting to make a good story, to a massive production with a dedicated audio team, writing team, and cast of over 30 talented people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where we need your support. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe want to be able to make this show better and better, and bring you terrifying things to creep you out and keep you up at night. Your donations will keep up going and searching for more stories, expanding our production capabilities, and so much more. They will afford us better equipment, more options for merchandise, and be able to dedicate even more time to producing this show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Blood Crow Stories is a labor of love, and all done with time volunteers from our extensive cast and crew. We have no professional company backing us. We are just artists who really love telling stories with rich, diverse characters, and bringing something special to the horror genre we love so much. We aim for there never to be a break between seasons, meaning you can always come to us for your fair share of drama and horror. To not take breaks is a massive undertaking, and one requiring a ton of consistent hard work. The more we make for the show, the more content we can produce, and hopefully bring you even more than we can possibly plan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u003cstrong\u003e love\u003c/strong\u003e scaring you, and want to continue to do so for as long as we can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e- Ellie (Director) \u0026amp; Scott (Audio)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOfficial Website: www.thebloodcrowstories.com\u003cbr\u003eTwitter: @TBCSPodcast\u003cbr\u003eFacebook: facebook.com/thebloodcrowstories\u003cbr\u003eTumblr: thebloodcrowstories.tumblr.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.teepublic.com/stores/the-blood-crow-stories-official-merchandise?ref_id=6076\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOfficial Merchandise HERE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e"
