    "summary": "It is said that music writing, much like the music industry, is slowly dying. The limitless and boundless freedom initially offered by the potential of the Internet has, ironically, proven to be the death knell for the arts. Now that every voice can theoretically be heard, it becomes harder and harder to stand out, and that this continuing trend will deduce writing to the lowest common denominator, treating the reader as a mere pawn in an advertising scheme. More than one person has told me that long-form journalism is internet poison. \"People don\u0027t read on the Internet,\" they tell me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t believe that. I don\u0027t believe that for a \u003cem\u003esecond\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I don\u0027t believe that, I started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.therecoup.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Recoup\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. I launched the website in 2012, and over the course of the past three years, I have watched it quietly grow and develop a loyal readership that also rejects such notions. I\u0027d like you to be one of those readers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be the first to tell you that yes, times have indeed changed. It is indeed a struggle to get one\u0027s voice heard over the fray of aggregated content, clickbait, churnalism, and listicles that passes for \"journalism.\" Furthermore, we are told that one should not expect to make writing about music a sustainable trade, simply because \"the reader\" (aka YOU) doesn\u0027t care about in-depth writing or things that do not capture their interest within a matter of seconds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a writer, I think more of you than that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that the future of online writing and commentary is upon us, one where the audience and the creators come together, forming a symbiotic relationship between patron and artisan.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support today and every month will guarantee our existence, so that we may continue to offer you, dear reader, a peek into the back streets and dark corners of the creative world. At the very least, I hope you come away with a newfound appreciation for the skill and the labor of those who create art for your enjoyment, often at a very high personal cost.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT THE EDITOR:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoseph Kyle\u003c/strong\u003e is a veteran music journalist.
