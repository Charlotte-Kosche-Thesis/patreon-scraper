    "summary": "Tubeist.TV is here to find talented, passionate content creators on Youtube that have yet to meet their true potential. With over 12 years of Youtube experience combined, we are excited to be able to bring our knowledge to those willing to learn and help them see marked growth on their channels and on social media. \nWe are doing this as a passion project \u2013 entirely for free. Why? Because we love meeting new people, helping people who deserve to be more successful, and relish the opportunity to see a creator grow from hundreds of views to thousands and eventually to millions. \nHowever, with some small monetary injection we could take our project to the next level. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goals are set out below, and with or without a single dollar we will continue to put our hearts and souls into helping those who have been downtrodden month after month by these massive networks. \nTogether, we hope to create a strong community atmosphere that will promote mutual assistance between those we are working with. Together, this community will take Youtube back from the grasps of massive networks that don\u2019t offer anything to their partners other than a few pennies in paypal each month.\nTogether we will change Youtube. Will you?"
