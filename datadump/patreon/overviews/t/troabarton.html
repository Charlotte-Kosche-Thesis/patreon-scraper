Starting with MechWarrior Online and currently featuring content from Elite Dangerous: Horizons and World of Warships. My channel is usually home to Science Fiction, Simulators, Role Playing Games, Strategic, and Competitive game play along with commentary, helpful tips, and tricks as I learn them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support from my subscribers on YouTube has been amazing and uplifting. A fair amount of you have asked me if I would consider getting a Patreon account. While at first I was hesitant due to my circumstances I have concluded that you are right. Its about time I take this to the next level and with your support I will be able to turn this hobby of mine into my livelihood. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeriously you guys and gals have helped me through the hardest of times with the support you\u0027ve shown, and I cannot thank you enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little backstory about myself, I am disabled due to a genetic condition called narcolepsy with associated anxiety and panic attacks. I am attempting to get by in life preferably on my own steam and doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I do this because I enjoy doing so it has become all that I am able to do. No longer a hobby I need to make ends meet, I ask you for help in allowing me to take control of my future instead of relying on possible future disability income and/or the current help of my family and close friends. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I do is not easy especially for me it take a lot of time, equipment, resolve, research, planning, skill, and consciousness to accomplish. This may have been my hobby but I see it now as my calling. Please help me make my dreams and aspirations become a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not asking for your pity or trying to pull at your heartstrings without warrant. I am asking for the opportunity of a career and my independence. Help me in accomplishing my goal, I intend to earn it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider becoming my Patron, anything you can spare will go a very long way in this, I really do appreciate it. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am a YouTuber and occasional streamer trying to make ends meet, I am disabled and unable to hold any job with a deadline or schedule. Because of that I have focused my efforts on YouTube. While this was at first a hobby it became my only source of income. I\u0027ve found that I have a nack for it and that it is unique in that it allows me to work when I am able to do so. \u003cbr\u003eI have decided to make it my career and to market myself here as a last resort instead of relying on disability I want to make my own way. I am still applying for disability but I would prefer to make a life for myself despite it if at all possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond that as a person I\u0027ve always been the tall guy trying to hide in a crowd. I tend to stick out and I\u0027ve always been reserved. This is likely why I got into computers, in college I studied web design, web programming, and graphic art. I began my YouTube channel about 6 years ago as a hobby and have gone from 400 subscribers to over 7000 in the last year alone with this year currently at 11K. Once my troubles began I escaped into my hobby for my sanity and it became more than a hobby. The support I\u0027ve received already from my subscribers has been heartfelt. Seriously you guys and gals are amazing and I really do wish I could get by without asking for more. \u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your support!!\u003cbr\u003e",
