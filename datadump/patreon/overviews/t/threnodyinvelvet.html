Rent and bills are considerably cheaper in a smaller town than in the big city, but I also miss a lot of opportunities by being far away. I do, however, get to do what I love as a career; which is making digital artworks for really wonderful fashion designers who make really interesting things that allow for my creativity to flow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend a lot of my daily life searching for new people to work with, and it\u2019s not that easy finding enough paid work every month in a market that is quite niche, but I wouldn\u2019t change this career for the world, it is what I love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon could allow me to worry less and be able to make more creative projects I can display to you. It will also be an exclusive place where you will get to see all my new pictures first, before they get shown in any of my social media pages (this is probably going to be quite hard because I usually can\u2019t wait to see what you think after working hard on each picture!) and they will also be in higher resolution. I would also be making exclusive content for you, behind the scenes videos, and at a later date, makeup tutorials where I will let you decide via poll which ones you would like to see! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am slowly but surely working on my first book; so I need your help to create as much fabulous content as possible and make my dream come true. I have been creating imagery for the last 15 years, working towards this publication and learning more everyday. The shoots I love the most are where I have complete freedom and I am able to work with several designers together to create a masterpiece I am proud to show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also currently in the process of moving to a bigger space where I will be able to create lots more new and more elaborate photo shoots, and in the future, video shoots! The new space, however, still needs some work and I am hoping it will end up being a space that I will be proud to bring my clients to. All my photo shoots up to this day have been done from my home/studio, with the rare exception of the odd hired location or London studio on bigger shoots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions will help massively to add peace of mind and liberate of the stress that is self employment every month. I would love to create amazing images for as long as I possibly can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven the smallest of contributions are important, as it all quickly sums up so please don\u0027t feel bad if you can only give 1$, it\u0027s as appreciated as everything else! \u0026lt;3 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course you can also still get prints on my prints store if you like!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://threnodyinvelvet.bigcartel.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://threnodyinvelvet.bigcartel.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
