After losing a few episodes with various recording softwares,  we\u2019ve found \u003ca href=\"https://zencastr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eZencastr\u003c/a\u003e. It\u2019s a great way to get good audio from many people, without everybody needing to make their own recording (and risk losses). It also makes it easy to edit many different microphones together, because it automatically synchronizes everything However, Zencastr requires a subscription, and so we need a bit of support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we are creating:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTales from the Hydian Way is our RPG discussion podcast where Ben talks with David and Tess about how to breathe more life into characters, look ahead into story lines and make them go where you want, and so much more from both sides of the GM screen. We also interview great guests such as Sam Stewart and other developers at Fantasy Flight Games, as well as Ross Rockafellow at Dice for Brains. With our expanded capacity, we plan to do more interviews in 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHeroes of the Hydian Way is our live play podcast where you can hear Ben and Kristine Co-host and lead a select group of players through Fantasy Flight Games published adventures to show how it can be done as well as get a few ideas of how players can react to the twists and turns of the adventures. The show will be referenced on Tales to create examples for the co-hosts to discuss. We are almost finished Dead in the Water and will be transitioning to Friends Like These soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Ask:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile a website itself doesn\u2019t cost all that much it does still cost as does reliable podcast recording software does. With the increase in costs we\u2019re passing the hat, and keeping the promises small, every pledge level and every stretch goal will be honest and attainable to make sure we can and will deliver. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny money that goes beyond our pledge level will be equally split among our hosts and editors. Goals will be updated as needs arise."
