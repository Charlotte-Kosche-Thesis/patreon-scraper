    "summary": "I\nstarted performing comedy on October 24th, 2010.  When I\nstarted there was only one weekly open mic.  It was every Monday at\nthe Yacht Club in Iowa City.  I remember one night about a month into\nmy comedy career, there were four occupied seats in the audience. \nThose seats were taken by my fellow comedians.  The Yacht Club still\nhas a show every Monday, but the are two more shows on Tuesdays, a\nshow on Wednesday, another on Thursday, even a show on Sunday.  The\ncrowds have increased as well.  It isn\u0027t unusual to see upward or\nthirty to fifty people at these mics.  I wish I could say that I had\nsomething to do with the creation of these five other open mics.  I\ndid little more than show up to these mics.  The reason why I am\ntelling you about this is because I will be performing my comedy\nwhether there is an audience or not.  If you like what you hear,\nplease by all means, support my comedy.  I will be performing if you\nchose to support me or not, but if you do support me it will be a lot\nmore fun.\u003cbr\u003e"

To be honest I was really drunk. \u00a0I stumbled onto an open mic night, that only had four comedians and a crowd of five people. \u00a0After the four comedians went up the emcee asked if anyone wanted to try stand-up and I was too drunk to say no. \u00a0After the first time I went on stage I got such a strong reaction that I was hooked. \u00a0I had to \u00a0keep getting on stage. \u00a0I started telling stories of \u00a0times when I was drunk, after I ran out of stories I started to come up with original jokes. \u00a0It has been four years since that first night doing stand up. \u00a0I have learned a lot in those four years, an hopefully you will enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e",
