    "summary": "Ever had a shortage of toilet paper? I have. Sometimes it gets used up faster than hot cakes in our house. The goal of this Patreon is to feed my TP needs and perhaps build incredible TP sculptures (not pictured above, as I am currently running rather low on TP).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHumor aside, I\u0027ve practiced different forms of art for about as long as I can recall, even at one point (roughly 10 years ago) creating an almost-complete full-body suit out of cardboard sheets. Toilet paper has the benefit of possessing the cardboard tubes alongside copious amounts of paper (which, when mixed with different liquids, solidifies). I also like making excessive amounts of food for myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny excess money from this campaign will go towards getting me a new phone (my ZTE-Skate is awful) and pizza. Lots of pizza. Like the campaign pic."
