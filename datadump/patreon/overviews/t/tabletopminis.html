     "about": "My name is Riyathe. I have been playing Warhammer and other tabletop games since around 1994. My interest in fantasy worlds started with fighting fantasy books, AD\u0026amp;D and this evolved into some of the 90\u0027s classics like Heroquest, Gorkamorka,Bloodbowl, Warhammer Fantasy and 40k.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a massive fan of online content and the community belonging to the tabletop wargaming industry and love watching battle reports and articles on the hobby we love. This is why i started our Youtube channel (2 of my brothers are also avid fans and help to make content). Playing games, making videos and interacting with our amazing fans is what makes us love doing this and it has been a sharp learning curve. Making high quality videos is a lot of work but it is very enjoyable to create a high quality product that people love to watch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAge of Sigmar and Warhammer 40k are our primary games but we also have and play many of the discontinued games such as Blood Bowl, Necromunda, Battlefleet Gothic, Mordheim and more. We also hope to be able to cover some of the other popular non-GW games out there such as Warmachine, Infinity, Kings of War and more.\u003cbr\u003e",
