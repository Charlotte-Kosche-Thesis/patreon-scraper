    "summary": "I skew quirky. I tend to write weird romance novels with unexpected twists, a Cthulhu-like whale in the Great Salt Lake with the requisite cultists for instance. Every time someone new comes to our chapter of the League of Utah Writers, someone always mentions I am the keeper of the whale cultists. I don\u0027t know why that should be my claim to fame but\u00a0\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to start writing and exploring more short form weirdness. And, I love my spreadsheets and everyone who uses them regularly think they\u0027re the best. They help me so much. I\u0027d like for them to help you as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m from Salt Lake City, Utah, which I still call home. I love the mountains and the amazing forests and deserts and lakes. Salt Lake has a rich, weird history. The iconography on some of the buildings downtown, the enormous salty lake to the northwest, the creepy inversion in the dead of winter. There are so many wonderful, strange things here. Almost all of my stories are set in the valley because it\u0027s just so great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll receive those Salt Lake City-based stories monthly. And, I\u0027m sorry to say I\u0027m a little bit fragile and if I get sick or a migraine knocks me out, you won\u0027t be charged if I don\u0027t get a story out. The spreadsheets will be scheduled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e And mostly:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for believing in me enough to back me. I suffer from a raging case of Impostor Syndrome. I write to entertain myself, to read the stories I want to read. If these stories entertain and touch you, it would just warm my soul. I love these weird stories of mine and would like to share them with the world."
