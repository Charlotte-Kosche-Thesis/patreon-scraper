Biography\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.1 Career Beginnings\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTonal had his first public performance at a school recital in fourth grade where he sung \u003cem\u003e\u201cMy tender heart\u201d\u003c/em\u003e by Lionel Ritchie. A couple of years earlier he had his first encounter with the guitar, as stated in a 2015 interview: \u003cem\u003e\u201c \u2026\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eFast forward to when i was in second grade, i remember the date, it was the 1st of April. A kid brought an acoustic guitar to school. It was one of those cheap, pawn shop, nylon string guitars, with cracks all over the finish, scratched, dirty, dusty\u2026 But at the time I thought that i had seen a \u201cMARTIN OM-18\u201d (an expensive, high-end guitar) and i wanted to play it so bad! Needless to say i had no idea how to play guitar but that didn\u2019t matter.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo during recess, when everyone went out to play, i stayed in and took the guitar. After 10 minutes a girl who also stayed in approached me and spoke:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e-You know that you\u2019re playing only one note right? \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI was playing different rhythms on that one note the whole time but i didn\u2019t know any better and didn\u2019t mind, i had discovered a new world there. After a couple of years my parents finally gave in and bought me my first guitar, a \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eblack Yamaha F-340.\u201d \u003c/em\u003eDuring his high school years he joined a lot of different bands and played everything from motorcycle club anniversaries to living rooms. In 2011 he signed a deal with a local label but soon realized that he wasn\u2019t going to get the desired results and that he was thurst into a sound that wasn\u2019t his own. It was this that pushed him into putting a home studio together in order to record and produce his work himself. Since then he has produced every recording that he has been part of. He had his first solo appearance on the 8th of December 2011 at a local caf\u00e9 called \u003cem\u003e\u201cOpera\u201d\u003c/em\u003e where he played a 3 hour set.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.2 Clouds As Skin (2013-2015)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn May of 2013 Tonal started recording songs for what would eventually become his debut solo record. He wrote and recorded songs in batches of four, changing his approach for each new four songs. The earlier ones were guitar driven and as he got better he switched to keys as his primary instrument. Tonal recorded 24 songs, 11 of which ended up on \u003cem\u003e\u201cClouds As Skin\u201d,\u003c/em\u003e which was released on the 10th of July exclusively in the United States and Canada for a limited time only. The record was followed by six music videos and a documentary titled \u003cem\u003e\u201cThe Heart Of A Broken Story\u201d. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring this time he also wrote columns for the Canadian magazine \u003cem\u003e\u201cStarlight Music Chronicles\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.3 Kolt (2014-2016)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the spring of 2014 Tonal formed Kolt, along with three other local musicians. The band released two studio recordings before eventually disbanding in 2016. The first record \u201cEquilibrium\u201d was released on the 12th of December 2014. In May of 2015 Tonal directed the short documentary \u201cThe Making Of Chess\u201d and co-directed the band\u2019s first music video. The second record, \u201cSolipse\u201d, was released on the 31st of October 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cThe music translates this pent-up frustration as \u003c/em\u003eKolt \u003cem\u003efuse British Blues with West Coast USA rock with a rumbling tempestuousness. In an intriguing format of difference with Kolt\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eit is often the vocal that reigns the compositions as the guitar waves a wand of moon-dust, whilst the percussion is given room to lay out space to explore and the bass forces the compression. This layout works well and the quartet is able to offer semblances of the familiar with the strikingly refreshing\u201d\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 Emerging Indie Bands.

Tonal would later state in a radio interview that \u003cem\u003e\u201cMoonraker\u201d\u003c/em\u003e has been the most challenging record that he has ever worked on because he had to reinvent himself from scratch; in the process departing from vocals, guitars, traditional arrangements and constant beats per minute tempos. In June of 2017 he embarked on the first leg of his European tour, promoted as the \u201c\u003cem\u003eVirtual Tears Tour\u201d\u003c/em\u003e and started shooting his first the feature length documentary \u003cem\u003e\u201cPhantasmagoria\u201d. \u201cMoonraker\u201d\u003c/em\u003e was released on the 31st of October at Discoteca Lazziale in Rome during the second leg of the \u201c\u003cem\u003eVirtual Tears Tour\u201d. \u003c/em\u003eThe third and final leg is in the works and will take place during 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Through 2017 Tonal produced, played bass, guitar and worked with Emilija Slavkovska on her debut record \u003cem\u003e\"Colours\"\u003c/em\u003e which was released on the 13th of December 2017. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*In February 2018 he singed on to produce Emilija\u0027s second record which should come out by the end of 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Is in the midst of recoding and producing a, still unnamed, record with Iyah.\u003cbr\u003e",
