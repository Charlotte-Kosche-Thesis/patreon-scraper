    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eSUPPORT OUR PROGRAMME\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\nWe are seeking support for our ongoing programming! In 2013 we received Arts Council funding for our 20th Anniversary and in 2016 we ran a successful crowdfunding campaign that directly supported our ambitious project \u0027Collective Intention:\u00a0Affirmative visions from communes, collectives and cults\u2019; an exceptional series of international, historical as well as contemporary exhibitions and events that celebrated work that is embedded within broader cultural narratives, work that has a profound emotional and identity-forming significance on our lives, work that champions an ethos of cultural multiplicity, collaborative collectives, community forming practices, work that embodies the importance of the broadest possible access to culture across a diverse range of activity and practice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to continue delivering an interesting and high calibre programme to our amazing audience. As the longest running 100% independent, not for profit arts organization in London, we would greatly benefit from some financial contribution that would go directly into our programme.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eABOUT THE HORSE HOSPITAL\u003c/h3\u003e\nBuilt originally by James Burton in 1797 as stabling for cabby\u0027s\n    sick horses, The Horse Hospital is now an important Grade II listed\n    building which has operated a Not For Profit policy, and provided\n    space for underground and Avant-Garde media since 1993.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n    The Horse Hospital is a progressive arts  venue providing an\n    encompassing umbrella for the related  media of art, film, fashion,\n    literature and music. We have been providing a unique and\n    distinctive arts and artist-led environment in which the arts can \n    flourish  for the benefit of local residents, visitors and\n    practitioners for the last 20 years. As the only independent arts\n    venue of its type in the UK, there is both a duty to aim for the\n    broadest possible access to the arts  across a broad range of\n    artistic activity and practice; and an opportunity to encourage\n    risk, innovation and experimentation. This ethos is strongly\n    reflected in the programming of our gallery, The Chamber of Pop\n    Culture, our film program, kinoKULTURE and various other events.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n    We are incredibly proud of the fact that since 1993 we have not only\n    been fortunate enough to have shown a vast amount of amazing work by\n    some of the worlds true visionaries such as Joe Coleman, Helen\n    Chadwick, Brice  Dellsperger, Jim Dennis Cooper, Cameron Jamie,\n    Laurie Lipton, Jimi Tenor, Bruce Bickford, Gee Vaucher \u0026amp; Crass,\n    Vivienne Westwood \u0026amp; Malcolm McLaren, Morton Bartlett, Craig\n    Baldwin, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Lydia Lunch, Destroy all Monsters,\n    John Sinclair, The Cockettes and The Unarius Academy of science to\n    name but a few, but that we have also had the privilege to support\n    and introduce literally hundreds of obscure artists, performers,\n    film makers and writers, who may otherwise have been denied a voice\n    by more mainstream organisations, to an ever-growing,  appreciative\n    audience.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
