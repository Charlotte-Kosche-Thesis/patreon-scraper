    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.teokuusela.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTeo Kuusela\u003c/a\u003e and as you can likely guess from the title above I am a fiction writer. While my main means of doing that is through the medium of interactive fiction, I am trying to break into genre fiction as well. That\u0027s where I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy philosophy is to improve, strive for better, and communicate with my audience during the writing process; I involve my audience in the shaping of the story where I can and in turn they can openly see the progress I make on any focus project I have. Being open and sharing my joys and troubles regarding my writing with my audience is something I find both helpful and inspiring. Yet that is only for my focus projects: projects I know I will be able to finish and for which I have allocated the time and financial flexibility to accomplish them.\u003cbr\u003eGenre Fiction on the other hand cannot be a focus project until I know I can go through a far more rigorous editing process to make them as much on par with the competition as I am able. Being a non-native to English writing I like to think myself still just as capable, but a straight-shooting editor to shatter that image is just what I sometimes need.\u003cbr\u003eHence the need for some kind of support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow let\u0027s get to some imaginary questions I have concocted for the sole purpose of swaying you into supporting me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What have you written before?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I said above I have so far only been able to have interactive fiction published, but I have plenty of unpublished works also hidden away in my drawers. As it stands, I am the author of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.teokuusela.com/lords-of-aswick\"\u003eLords of Aswick\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.teokuusela.com/best-of-us\"\u003eBest of Us\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.teokuusela.com/diamant-rose\"\u003eDiamant Rose\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eAll those titles have been graciously published by Hosted Games, a sister company of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.choiceofgames.com/\"\u003eChoice of Games\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What even is Interactive Fiction?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hear you! Nobody has a real concise answer that I know of, but I would say it is a rapidly developing genre of literature that flits along the blurry line between games and prose.\u003cbr\u003eEver heard of Fighting Fantasy? Those were popular Interactive Fiction gamebooks that existed well before the proliferation of the Internet, and still acts as a major inspiration to me. What I do is in an essence what those books were, except that I have the advantage of using your computer or smart device to do even more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"When can I see anything that I contributed to?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing flow guides me and my scheduling process as much as it can be allowed, although I will always try my utmost to stick with any dates that I have set down publicly. Add in editing times when I have the means of hiring someone and you\u0027re playing with a great bit questionmark at best.\u003cbr\u003eI do strive not to put out stories that are not up to my personal standards, which further complicates giving any real schedules.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you just get a real job?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, well, see that\u0027s where the problem lies. I might just have to, but I\u0027m already working day in and day out on writing. Yes, most of it is garbage that will never see the light of day, but occasionally I can come up with real gems and that\u0027s what makes all of the financial instability and ridicule about not having a \u0027real job\u0027 absolutely worth it.\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I might just turn this around into something that rewards like a \u0027real job\u0027 too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end I wish to make it clear that I do not see Patreon as the answer to any financial problems in my private life. No. The writing, development, and sale of my stories is the solution by which this can become a successful enterprise to me.\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, Patreon is a means by which I can, with the help of all you kind people who use it to contribute to me, improve my craft and make sure that what I release is top-notch quality. That in turn directly feeds back to the real solution, which is sales sales sales.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Okay, so why Patreon then?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are multiple platforms now where a budding writer can get their work out there. Of course the old-school way of just submitting manuscripts anywhere one can is still a viable option, but I want to have gone through as many steps as I can to make sure what I write is at least self-publishing quality before seeking any kind of publishing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy not something like Inkshares?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eInkshares is a great looking platform and I\u0027ve been wanting to crowdsource a book that way for ages. However I don\u0027t think that I have the reach and audience yet to succeed in doing anything but a Quill imprint, meaning ebook. With their pricing methods it is not convenient for you nor me to crowdsource anything on Inkshares when a likely goal would be to settle for their Quill imprint. This way you can support me through Patreon over a long period of time, with far greater flexibility for both parties, and greater rewards for you in the way of immediate access to my stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy not just put your stuff on Amazon, Bookbaby, or IngramSpark?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWell, I need to make sure my stories hold up first. That means editing fees which all of those great services also demand of me. I have not ruled out using one of those services to publish through when the time is right, but right now I cannot afford even their comparably competitive editing costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Why do you want my money monthly instead of per project?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is because I cannot promise that a single project will be the one seeing your particular bit of cash, as well as because a lot of the uses for your money will be well behind the scenes. It will go towards rounds of editing, proofreading, artwork, whatever is necessary to make the final product more presentable to both you and the wider public.\u003cbr\u003eAll of your generously contributed money will be set aside in a separate account where it shall gather until such a point as to allow payment of a proper reward to those who I might hire on for their hard work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What do I get out of this?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish I had more to give you in return, but while I relish in audience feedback I cannot promise very in-depth discussion due to it taking away time I require for my work. Due to the nature of crowdfunding I also cannot promise I will include a wall of names in my projects to give you ample credit for your contributions. I may if it proves plausible, but I cannot promise it.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, what I can promise you is access. Early access, but access nonetheless! \u00a0Depending on your chosen tier of support, you will be able to read early drafts of genre fiction, possible essays on the worlds I am building or have built, and access to the closed testing phases of my interactive novels!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you consider putting even a buck / dollarydoo / quid / euro my way, I wish to say thank you.\u003cbr\u003eTruly, my deepest thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
