Now the usual \"game\" for ensembles are things like sponsorship and larger donations that support individual events, like concerts. Timepoint is about something else, we are about growing a community around new music where we the ensemble have a bigger role than just \"putting on a show\". We maintain a bi-weekly podcast, and for those that support us here at Patreon there will be a whole bunch of other digital content (you can check that out in the \"pledge\" area). We think this kind of content will enhance the community and create a great sense of comradely between the audience and us, cultivating a true community around this fantastic thing we call new music. Your support and egagment mean we get to keep the lights on and brining you daring programing and unique digital content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can still give us massive mounds of money if you want by visiting our website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.timepointensemble.com/give\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.timepointensemble.com/give\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
