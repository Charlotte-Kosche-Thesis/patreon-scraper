    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe Switch\u003c/strong\u003e is delightfully strange, proudly crude and a sharply political comedy series. It\u0027s the  first series to ever have a transgender lead role, the first to have multiple trans characters, and the first to have all these played by transgender actors. In The Switch, we follow our cast as they navigate two separate worlds: cis and trans, comfortable and struggling, mundane and magical. They negotiate the social standards of living in both worlds to build a community out of their vastly different lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Comedy:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Switch introduces us to S\u00fc. Yesterday she was an upwardly\u00ad mobile software manager. Today she\u2019s an out trans woman, unemployed and sleeping on her ex\u2019s couch. Thrown into a world of marginal living and quasi\u00ad-legal employment, will she claw her way back to her old status? Or, to her horror, will she adapt and thrive?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show\u2019s content is often irreverent and quirky, but it\u2019s born from the intimate awareness of lived experience. The folks working behind the scenes share a lot in common with the characters in the show: a group populated by queers, activists, trans* individuals, kinksters, weirdos, and East Van rabble\u00adrousers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Company:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrembling Void Studios is based out of Vancouver, British Columbia. We make entertainment that is unapologetically fun, punchy and opinionated. We aspire to live in a future full of awesome. To that end, we make entertainment that moves us in that direction both socially and technologically.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cWe strive to provide all individuals regardless of their status the opportunity to shine.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u00ad Amy Fox, Executive Producer\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Project:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA TV show is a big undertaking with a big price tag attached. Trembling Void has filmed and finished the Pilot, but to complete the first season all with paid staff rather than asking people to work for free \u00ad that\u2019s where you come in. This show can delight and push the envelope in delivering content that\u2019s progressive, nerdy, and queer. And when people are doubled over in laughter, when they\u2019re struck by new ideas surrounding gender and sexuality, when they\u2019ve finally got some trans* characters to identify with on screen\u2026 they\u2019ll have you to thank. You\u2019ll have that warm glow in your heart, reminding you that you made something cool and quirky happen.\u003cbr\u003e"
