    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGreetings!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHello everyone, and thanks for stopping by the Patreon page! Hopefully you have already checked \u00a0out all the free audio content at \u003ca href=\"http://tabletopaudio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTabletop Audio\u003c/a\u003e, and are now wondering - \"how can I help?\" Excellent! I am committed to keeping the site advertising free and making it easier for you to access our content. To this end, every little bit helps, so thank you in advance!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Tabletop Audio?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://tabletopaudio.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTabletop Audio\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eis a website for players and GMs of tabletop (i.e. pen and paper) role-playing games who wish to add an audio dimension to their game sessions. On the main page, you will find dozens of 10-minute, situational audio files called ambiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEDITED! \u00a0\u003c/em\u003eWhile this site was originally intended as a resource for players and GMs of tabletop role-playing games, I have received \u003cem\u003eso many\u003c/em\u003e emails from other types of users that I felt it was time to refine this section.\u003cbr\u003eAccording to you all, Tabletop Audio is for: Role-players, boardgamers, writers, coders, artists, graphic designers, teachers, house-cleaners, lucid dreamers, gym-rats, distance runners, commuters and ANYONE who wants to immerse themselves in the audio-space of one environment, while physically inhabiting another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMany players and GMs already use miniatures and terrain to augment their sense of immersion while they game, adding audio ambiences takes this to the next level. Even if you are running a \u0027theater of the mind\u0027 style game, the addition of audio can really make a lot of difference. Seriously. Ask my kids.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m a professional composer and sound designer and I play tabletop RPGs with my kids (\u003cdel\u003e10 and 7\u003c/del\u003e\u00a011 and 8). I\u0027ve found that playing situational audio files - i.e. \"you\u0027re in a cave!\" increases the level of enjoyment, immersion and suspension of disbelief for many gamers. Just as some players like adding miniatures to amp up their games, I enjoy adding some kind of background audio.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy did you make this?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs any creative professional will tell you, working for clients usually doesn\u0027t scratch many creative itches. Tabletop Audio allows me free reign to do whatever I feel like (ars gratia artis!). Also, I really enjoy creating miniature 10 minute films out of sound.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI actually thought about this for a long time. Asking for donations doesn\u0027t come easily for me. \u00a0People kept asking me when my kickstarter was going to be and I assumed that was going to be my next step. But the more I thought about it, the less it made sense. I don\u0027t need a large amount of capital upfront. I\u0027m not publishing a book, or manufacturing something physical. I\u0027m already set up to do this. \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0027m already doing this! \u00a0\u003c/em\u003eNothing would make me happier than being able to do this more, but that, unfortunately takes time. And time is...well, you know.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRunning the site does actually come with some overhead. I pay for hosting, I pay for bandwidth. Plus I\u0027ve got some ideas for the site that are, frankly, beyond me coding-wise. I\u0027d like to one day get some help with that.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy monthly donations and not per-track?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAnother thing I\u0027ve thought about quite a bit. Each track is 10 minutes long. It takes me between 8 and 12 hours to complete a track. I release them when I feel like they\u0027re done. Since I launched the site back in February 2014 I\u0027ve released an average of 4-6 ambiences per month. I don\u0027t want to be tempted to rush things out just to complete another pay cycle. With a monthly donation, you won\u0027t have to worry about capping your donations because I\u0027m producing \"too much work\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a monthly subscriber/patron, you should think about tabletopaudio.com as a collection of work that you are supporting. The content is not time-sensitive like issues of a magazine or a blog. If the idea of a monthly donation does not appeal to you, you can always donate a single, one-time donation via the pay-pal link on the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA note on the reward levels below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHey Tim! What gives? I noticed that all the reward levels give the exact same thing, access to the site! Which I can get for nothing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the basic idea: I honestly give every spare second I have to making this site and the sounds on it. I want to keep this site free and, importantly, advertising-free. Your donation amount to Tabletop Audio should be based on what it\u0027s worth for \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e to have access to this type of service. I like to think in terms of coffee or pizza (hey, I\u0027m a New Yorker). If you can spare the equivalent of a latte, then that might be $3/month. If you can spare a latte and a slice of pizza, maybe that\u0027s $5/month, etc..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, if you honestly can\u0027t spare a dime, because you\u0027re a student, between jobs, broke whatever...that\u0027s cool too, I\u0027ve been there, but here\u0027s the thing - you can still have access to this site like everyone else does. When your fortune takes a turn for the better, maybe come back and put a tip in my jar.\u003cbr\u003e"
