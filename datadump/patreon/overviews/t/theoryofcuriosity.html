    "summary": "Hey, It\u0027s Kelly and Emily here. We make science videos. With a twist. We take a concept, learn it as best we can and explain it to you with grit,\u00a0sarcasm, and a sprinkle of inappropriate\u00a0humor (just for facts and giggles).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe learn and teach in video form based on our interests (because we\u0027re ultra nerds) and what the audience is curious about. Together we hope to keep you entertained and get you educated and engaged. \u003cbr\u003e---\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s Kelly here.\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to start this YouTube channel to have an outlet for my curiosity. I have spent 3-4 hours of almost every day of my life learning and reading with a purpose. From experiments is did as a teenager, to the building projects I have endeavored upon my entire life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up on a Hutterite Colony, I became accustomed to learning from everyone around me. That didn\u0027t go away after I left. My interests and skills are pretty diverse, having helped in a massive vegetable garden, a carpenter shop, as an electrical engineer building fire trucks and then as a CNC water-jet operator. Whenever I\u0027m talking with someone, my brain is always wondering about everything except for the conversation. Instead, I\u0027m trying to understand the fundamentals of our differing realities. This channel is about that inner voice of curiosity that we explore throughout our lives. ---\u003cbr\u003e---\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eI\u0027m Emily,\u003cbr\u003eI have two science degrees, one in general science with a focus on biotechnology and one in environmental health which concentrates on a wide variety of biological, chemical and physical hazards that can and do affect human health\u003c/span\u003e. I practiced as an Environmental Health Officer/Health Inspector for six years.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI am passionate about science - specifically biology and chemistry. I, on purpose, avoided physics and calculus in University because It annoyed me... but I do have a rudimentary understanding of physics. I also grew up in a house with two hippy types for parents who avoided technology like crazy. As a result of this, I only got a computer in my house when I was in grade 11 and it took half an hour to load up a page. Resulting in me being a Luddite. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI am super fascinated by history and human behavior. I find it intriguing how we put so much emphasis on learning from the past so we don\u0027t repeat it. Yet we so consistently fail in this regard. My vision for the show is to create a critical dialog regarding science, human behavior, history and how the future may be effected by these factors. I\u0027m very excited to learn new concepts and question my existing knowledge but I\u0027m only a little excited to have Kelly question EVERYTHING!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
