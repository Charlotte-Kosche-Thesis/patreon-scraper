    "summary": "Hey! Welcome to our Patreon! \u00a0This is our second round for Patreon. \u00a0We were one of the first content creators on the platform to come together and ask for your help. \u00a0But this time around, we are making some big changes. \u00a0But first, lets talk about who we are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat One Video Gamer/The Completionist\u003cbr\u003eJirard Khalil IS That One Video Gamer on YouTube. Each week, Jirard takes on a game and 100% completes it. \u00a0His show, The Completionist, has been on YouTube since 2011 and continues to grow as the moniker of what it\u0027s like to struggle as a Completionist. \u00a0Over the years, Jirard has introduced new content to his YouTube channel such as his personal Top Tens, Defend it!, a show about defending bad games from the internet, and he even started his own video game villain boy band called Big Bad Bosses. \u00a0Jirard is also the executive producer of the Pokemon YouTube channel The National Dex.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe National Dex\u003cbr\u003eAlex Faciane and PokeKellz LOVE Pokemon. \u00a0They love Pokemon so much that they created a channel all about it called The Dex! \u00a0On the Dex, each and every week, these awesome duo give you trivia and battle strategy for a different Pokemon each week! They also do fun themed battles every Friday on The Dex VS! We also do vlogs and special trainer tips episodes, and with your help, they\u0027re looking to do so much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Office\u003cbr\u003eThe That One Video Gamer office doesn\u0027t just consist of these two channels. \u00a0It actually consists of several of some the best YouTuber and Twitch streamers out there. \u00a0TOVG has become a community of friends coming together to produce all kinds of various content. \u00a0The office space includes Jesse Cox, Dodger, Sam Strippin, Octopimp, Lasercorn, Sohinki, Pamela Horton, and more! \u00a0Our community has become about supporting each other, and with your help, we can continue this support system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon Round 2 and Why now?\u003cbr\u003eSo for you fans of The Completionist, you may have recently seen that we had to remove a large portion of our back log and that\u0027s going to hit us quite a bit. \u00a0With the adpocalypse being in full swing, things have been a bit rough for us. \u00a0But enough about that crap - we want to step up our production game. \u00a0Between That One Video Gamer and The Dex, we have dreams of building bigger shows that are more consistent for us to produce. \u00a0So with your help, not only can we continue to create the content we are currently creating, but we can look forward to building out even more shows on a bigger scale. \u00a0Simply put - we want to do MORE and we want to give back MORE to YOU!\u003cbr\u003e"
