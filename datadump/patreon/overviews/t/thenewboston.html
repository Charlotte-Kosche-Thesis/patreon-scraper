We have built a platform that allows us to not only organize and arrange all of our courses, but also provides an integrated social network and community forum for all members. In doing so, users are able to easily ask questions about topics, meet friends, and connect with other all around the world through online education.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a cool website that allows you to support your favorite artists or creators through pledges.

We are constantly discovering and adding more free content to the website everyday. \u00a0There is already an enormous amount of resources online that can be accessed for free by anyone in the world, the main issue right now is that very little of it is organized or structured in any way. We want to be the solution to that problem.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to revolutionize online education.\u00a0With your help, we will continue to grow our platform where students\u00a0are finally free to choose how they learn, what they learn, and when they learn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe education system now is not about \u201ceducation\u201d at all. It\u2019s about memorizing instead of understanding and compliance instead of creativity. Education should be about freedom rather than simply doing the work you are instructed to. It should be more about learning to solve problems and less about test scores. The solution to fix the education system is not to patch it, but to rebuild it from the ground up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
