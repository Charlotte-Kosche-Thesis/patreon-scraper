Patreon has serious structural problems that aren\u0027t entirely resolved by moving to a per-creation model, so if you would like to purchase individual designs you can find them on \u003ca href=\"https://cults3d.com/en/users/ThreeForm/creations\"\u003eCults3D\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting me here on Patreon. I am Aaron Trocola, an Industrial Designer and Artist creating organic designs based on body scans and produced with additive manufacturing (3D Printing). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is ThreeForm?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI describe ThreeForm as the physical interface between the body and technology. Creations that interact with the body should \u003cem\u003erespect \u003c/em\u003ethe body, and the approach used by ThreeForm makes this possible. As a long term initiative it pursues esoteric technical goals described below, but as my guest here on Patreon, you\u0027d probably rather know in what form these ideas are manifested in a way that you can download, print and enjoy right now. ThreeForm creates:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40westdesigns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/figurine-comp.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0- 3D printable Figurines and Characters.\u003c/strong\u003e These sculptures are based on real people. They are professionally optimized and designed for 3D printing at home. I do \"3D Photoshoots\" with a variety of performers, dancers, and models to create a library of poses. These are carefully sculpted to perfection and tested to ensure they print beautifully. Some are further developed to include custom outfits and accessories that are used in real life fashion shows and performances, and many of those will be shared here for you to print in miniature. Your continued support ensures my team and I can create many more unique poses and outfits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40westdesigns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Dscn2488_ultracortex-evolution_half.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0- Wearable Technology.\u003c/strong\u003e These models take the form of cases, accessories and designer packaging for popular devices and computing platforms like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Adafruit products, and OpenBCI.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40westdesigns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fashion-comp.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0- Fashion Accessories.\u003c/strong\u003e Smoothly transitioning from wearable technology, the designs are morphing into fashion accessories. 3D printing enables universal customization, so our technology no longer needs to take one single form. It can be stylized to our liking. Expect to find customization templates that\u00a0 may be entirely about style, or contain a functional element from the wearable tech category.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40westdesigns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/tf-designs21.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe mission of ThreeForm\u003c/strong\u003e is to explore design on the body leveraging two synergistic technologies: 3D scanning and 3D printing. I conceptualize these as a portal between the digital world and the physical world. In the context of the body, this enables design to respect the body by conforming perfectly to our shape and movement. ThreeForm seeks to develop this approach by solving mechanical and material challenges in 3D printing technology, and by refining design techniques and developing software solutions to optimize workflows. This way the combination of these technologies becomes practical and useful. While many things are possible, they will remain very rare until efforts are made to reduce time, labor and cost, while increasing functional capabilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to experimental styles and gadgetry (which is the fun part) I also develop research tools and assistive devices such as the Ultracortex platform developed in collaboration with OpenBCI. Current laws limit the extent to which 3D printing can be applied in a medical context, and devices take a lot of time and money to gain approval, so while legislation will take several years to catch up, I am not waiting around. For five years I\u0027ve been developing solutions to make these technologies more applicable to improving people lives, and these will all transition from research and experimentation to daily life as soon as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile technology and society will continue to evolve and adapt to these new technologies over the next few years, a lot is possible right now, and I would like to share the excitement of exploring that with you. Your support is greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore about the scans and process:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40westdesigns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Shell-Lynn_Scanning2c_small.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe scans used in this work were made in association with various other artists and models. The scans capture their natural shape and pose with limited detail depending on which scanning method is used. When I started ThreeForm I used a method called photogrammetry which is based on photographs. The advantage of this method is that the design can be done directly on the body with makeup, which is a very intuitive approach that allows anyone to participate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gSkzMVPbuAo\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eHere is a video (without narration) that shows the original process I \nused to design the Seed of Life Corset in with artist Amandacera in \n2012. While the designs and techniques have evolved since then, the core\n idea of designing on the the body as an intuitive interaction was there\n from the start.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cimg src=\"http://40westdesigns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/photgrammetry.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still occasionally use this for clients who do not have access to a scanner, but it is fairly crude and requires a lot of cleanup. I now use laser or structured light based systems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40westdesigns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/LizaC_phases_all-comp_crop-wide.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40westdesigns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-5B_crop.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a multi-stage process of aligning the scans, cleaning up the data (removing noise and errors) and\u00a0 reconstructing the scan to fill in missing areas. At this stage the model is printable, but for select poses I do additional sculpting work to add in missing details like fingers and toes. I also smooth out the seams of any garments to restore their natural shape. The models are not nude during scanning (in the designs shown on this site), but wear minimal undergarments to ensure accurate measurements and shape of custom outfits. At this stage each scan has taken 5-15 hours of work. For exceptional poses that will be used to build an avatar, full replacement of the head is required to add realistic eyes, hair, etc. Many outfits have several layers made of dozens of spline curves and surfaces, composed of hundreds of individual control points.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40westdesigns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/control-points.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e By the time final meshes are exported, a full outfit can take up to 100 hours. The separate meshes are imported into rendering software to create realistic lighting and materials, which may take several dozen more hours, and may take several days to process the renderings in the case of an animation. Bringing the designs into reality with 3D printing is an even more elaborate process. There are many different printing processes, materials with varying properties, a variety of post-processing techniques to change those properties, and many solutions available for mechanical enhancement such as coatings, textiles and straps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40westdesigns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Dsc_0761_Parts_edit-half.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Assembly can include adhesives, fasteners, sewing, or heat bonding. I do want document this if there is interest. If you have any questions or requests, please ask.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40westdesigns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/VV-comp.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo see more of my past work, check out \u003ca href=\"http://threeformfashion.com\"\u003eThreeFormFashion.com\u003c/a\u003e"
