    "summary": "The Fantasist is an online quarterly magazine that publishes original fantasy novellas. We\u2019re trying to broaden the definition of fantasy, to deepen and complicate the conversation around speculative fiction, and to expand the role of fantasy within that conversation. In recent years, the role of science fiction in public discourse has increased considerably, and that\u2019s awesome, but fantasy hasn\u2019t been getting the same kind of attention. And we\u2019d like to change that. As much as fantasy is about the possibilities of magic, it\u2019s also about the possibilities of people. In most fantasy, something is wrong, and someone damn well does something about it, and there\u2019s something fundamentally hopeful about a fight that actually gets fought. We also love novellas. We write them ourselves. They offer the space to fully explore a world, or an idea, or a character, and to meander without detriment to other things. And yet, there aren\u2019t many homes for them, and it can be hard to find great new novellas to read. So we\u2019re publishing three fantasy novellas on the third Thursday of every third month, to try to be a small part of changing that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Far and Going Forward\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe recently published our fifth issues, which you can find on our landing page:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thefantasistmag.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethefantasistmag.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first four issues constitute our first volume, for which we hope to kickstart a print edition later this year.
