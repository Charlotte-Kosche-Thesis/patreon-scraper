Here we talk about the Dragon Age franchise as a roleplaying game, and how you can use all the specializations, talents, stunts, backgrounds, mass combat, and more to make your time in Thedas as wondrous as possible! We chat about Dragon Age lore, giggle about our runs through the video games, answer questions from listeners, and share some of the great community content created by us and the fans of the Dragon Age RPG!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.d20radio.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cropped-gamernation_logo_siteheader-2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast started as a pet project, inspired by other excellent podcasts from the very network we joined, the d20 Radio Network! Seeing as there were no podcasts discussing how the Dragon Age RPG works, we set to work to create a space to discuss mechanics, GMing techniques, storytelling tips, character concepts, and so much more! We\u0027ve grown more than we expected, and the fans we have are lovely folks. We\u0027d like to do more with this podcast, and this Patreon can get us started on that track.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://wondersofthedaspodcast.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/img_13651.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;h=\" style=\"width: 380px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a rotating collection of hosts for the show, but for the most part it\u0027s just Reyn and Jessica. Everything about keeping the lights on has been paid by us, and it works well by itself, but there isn\u0027t much room to grow yet. Because we have full-time jobs, positions as Venture Officers in Pathfinder Society Organized Play, and friends and family to keep up with, we only have so much time we can dedicate to the podcast, or extra projects that come up through the podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is here for you, the fans (we tentatively call you \"Thedosians,\" is that okay?), who want to help us make this podcast into something bigger than a humble, bi-weekly show about an excellent game.
