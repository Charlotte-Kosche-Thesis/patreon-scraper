Last winter we released our first album, which we recorded ourselves and are so excited to share with everyone on the road. We\u0027re here to tell you that \u003cstrong\u003eeven if you can\u0027t come with us on the road, you can still come with us!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee, our album is just the tip of the iceberg. There\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003eso much more\u003c/strong\u003e beneath the surface! Underneath the songs are layers and layers of stories, conversations, ideas, and characters that bind our songs together - \u003cstrong\u003eour own little folklore.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027ve decided that on tour we want to share not only our songs, but also this folklore that\u0027s at the heart of what we do.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSo for each week of the tour this summer, there will be a featured bit of \"folklore,\"\u003c/strong\u003e short stories and songs, trinkets marking the development of our music. On the road, we will present these trinkets to our audiences at our shows. \u003cstrong\u003eOnline, we will release them to you through Patreon.com.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether on Patreon.com or in real life, here\u0027s why \u003cstrong\u003ewe need you\u003c/strong\u003e to be our Patron: we believe that \u003cstrong\u003emusic is a gift.\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. With this conviction we have structured our tour so that we don\u0027t have to demand payment for anything. Every detail, every album or poster will be sold by a donation or name-your-own-price basis. To not only make this tour happen but \u003cstrong\u003eto stay true to who we are and to what music is\u003c/strong\u003e, we must trust that \u003cstrong\u003ethe gift will be returned to us.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron on Patreon.com, you decide what you wish to give per week throughout this tour. And the money we receive from this campaign will go towards \u003cstrong\u003esparkly, polished recordings of two brand new songs\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0from an actual studio. Similarly to Kickstarter, \u003cstrong\u003edepending on what amount you give, we will include you in the recording process \u003c/strong\u003eof these songs more and more from conception to completion by sending you \u003cstrong\u003edemos, updates, and mixes\u003c/strong\u003e from our studio sessions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can be our Patrons, and we don\u0027t take that lightly.\u003c/strong\u003e You are some of our sweetest friends.
