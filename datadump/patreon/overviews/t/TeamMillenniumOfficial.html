Season Zero and Beyblade Abridged are strictly not-for-profit\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. We do not gain ad revenue from them, and\nunfortunately that isn\u2019t helping us as a group. We consist of writers, voice\nactors, editors, musicians, artists and others that all do this \n\u003cstrong\u003ecompletely FREE.\u003c/strong\u003e They do this out of the kindness of their heart and their passion for the shows that you love to watch.\nUltimately this campaign is more of a reach out for us to allow us to pay our\nvoice actors, editors, musicians and artists among others for the hard-so far\nunpaid work. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis allows us to pay our current team for their work fairly as well as upgrading our current equipment.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eWhat else do you have up your\nsleeves?\n\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRight\nnow, we do have a few projects in mind.

But this\nmoney will also allow us to upgrade our equipment in a way that benefits our\ncontent as a whole.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe need\nto be perfectly clear here. This campaign will not speed up the production of YGOSZ\nor BBA!

If you have ever seen an\nadvertisement on one of our YGOSZ or BBA videos on YouTube, understand that,\nthat money is going to the owners of the footage, and very likely the owners of\nwhatever music was used. It is 100% within their right to do so, and we fully\nunderstand and support their decision.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are\nnot asking you to pay for YGOSZ or BBA. This cannot be stressed enough. We\u0027re\nnot here to try and force your hand for content that we\u0027ve already promised you\nand delivered to you for years. Both of those series are our little bundles of\njoy, we want to ensure you all know that as we continue to expand. Besides, we\naren\u0027t jerkwads... well we aren\u0027t THOSE kinds of jerkwads.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eAny sweet perks for us?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTake a look at the rewards to your right!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cu\u003eAnything else we should know?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\ndo decide to go ahead and become a patron, then know that everyone at Team\nMillennium thanks you for you continued support and that you just went that\nextra step further. For that, we love you, like really (no homo). Also note,\nthat there will always be hiccups in production as we learn to accommodate, adjust and managing new deadlines. So just\nstick with us and we\u2019ll supply you with your regular content you\u2019ve been used\nto getting since 2015.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\nhope you enjoy all our new content as well!
