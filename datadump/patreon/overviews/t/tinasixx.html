I had a quarter-life crisis and decided to turn my life completely around and drop off the face of the earth. It was a disaster. I was empty and didn\u0027t know what was missing until I realized it was art. I am a creator. A creator of art, music and events. I was doing hard labour jobs and I was too tired and in so much pain from work I couldn\u0027t even read a book let alone write a song or draw a picture. Fully realizing what was wrong, I have decided to dive right back into art and music. Rock\u0027n\u0027roll is my life saver."
