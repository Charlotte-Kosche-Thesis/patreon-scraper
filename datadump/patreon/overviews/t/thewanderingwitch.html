    "summary": "Once upon a time, there was a little girl who saw magic in the world everywhere she went. She saw magic in the garden and in the forest, in the kitchen and in the closets, in books, paintings, and under beds, in the people she met, and in herself. The magic was so beautiful, she decided that when she grew up, she wanted to become a witch, so that she could make her own magic to share with the world.\u003cbr\u003eThe girl kept wandering and wondering, reading and writing, seeking and creating beauty and magic in all forms. She learned to speak with the Tarot cards, to read and write in runes, and to use them to manifest her desires. She learned to listen to crystals and flowers and most importantly to herself. She painted and wrote poetry, performed in plays and operas, and made the strange and painful beauty of the human experience her passion and her study. In time, the girl became a woman. She fell in love and broke her heart, and though all the king\u0027s horses and all the king\u0027s men could not, she learned to put it back together again, mending the cracks with gold so that it was stronger and more beautiful than before. She sang her song louder than before. Visions danced before her, and she sang them into creation. She sang herself into creation. In this way, the woman became a witch.\u003cbr\u003eThat witch is me, Vervain Helsdottir, and I\u0027m finally making the transition from being a hobbyist witch to being a professional witch, because I firmly believe that it is through my magic, my creations, and my way of being in the world that I can add the most value to the world. I already have a website where many of my creations are available for purchase, and I am continuing to invest energy into that--creating magical objects and connecting them with their perfect owners is a huge part of my calling. But I\u0027m also called to serve my brothers and sisters in another less tangible way, by capturing the magic of the people and the world around me in words and images and audio and video and sharing that with the greater world beyond. I already do this to a certain extent through my Instagram (@wandering.witch), Facebook (/wanderingwitch), and blog (wanderingwitch.co), but I could share so much more. I could bring you so much more magic if I didn\u0027t have to constantly stress about the level of my (borrowed) gas tank, the source of my next meal, or whether strippers have an easier time paying rent than witches do.\u003cbr\u003eAnd so I ask, from my heart of hearts, if I or my posts have ever brought you joy, made you think, helped you grow, or inspired you; if I\u0027ve ever held space for you in a meaningful way; if magic excites you and you find value in the things I do or the way I live my life, please consider becoming a patron of The Wandering Witch here on Patreon. If that is something that you choose to do, please know that I love and value you, that I give you my eternal and undying gratitude, and that you are literally making magic happen by voting for it with your dollar--and when there are enough of us, a dollar each is really all it takes.\u003cbr\u003e"
