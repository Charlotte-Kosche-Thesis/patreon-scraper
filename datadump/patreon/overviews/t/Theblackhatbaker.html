    "summary": "Hello, friends and neighbors!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Matt Strenger, a.k.a. The Black Hat Baker, and I am all about three things- baking, fitness, and writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.theblackhatbaker.com/uploads/8/4/2/5/8425239/editor/18011170-10101097099001829-2892095381787526093-n.jpg?1500787291\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the last few years, besides being a professional baker and cook, I\u0027ve been writing a blog called \"\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003eOn The Bench- Reps, Rolling Pins, and Building A Better Baker.\u003c/a\u003e\" It started as a simple feed to keep people up to date on the doings of a small contract-baking business I was running out of my home kitchen. Since then, the blog has evolved and outlived the business it was meant to support. Inspired by my colleagues in the kitchen and the questions of my readers, \u00a0I write about baking, cooking, life in the culinary industry, exercise, and living well roughly once a week. I\u0027ve covered homebrewing, at-home fitness, dieting, education, philosophy- the works.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, the readership of the blog has expanded dramatically- what hasn\u0027t, however, is the time I can devote to it. As much as I love writing, I still put in full-time hours in the kitchen of a cafe to pay the bills. It sucks up most of my time and energy, and it means I can\u0027t make On The Bench everything I want it to be and give you all the stuff you want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a blogger, I have a few options for making money- selling ad space on the blog, reviewing things for cash, or take donations.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in- by donating through Patreon,\u00a0I remain answerable only to you- and with making it significantly less likely that you\u0027ll have to navigate around an ad for hemorrhoid cream.\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is essentially the continuation of the centuries-old practice of Patronage- people of means giving aid and support to artists and composers, paying them to make masterpieces. In this case, people choose an amount they\u0027d like to donate once, and the donation recurs every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhere the Money Will Go\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eIt\u0027ll fund:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCosts of Running the Blog-\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Webhosting, services charges, and web development. I\u0027m no programmer and I use a web editing service, but newer/better/fancier features and fixes cost.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTechnology-\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I spend a lot of time on the move.

Having a little more scratch on hand means I can do a bit more without burning a hole in the budget\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeeping the Lights on- \u003c/strong\u003eThis one is HUGE. Like I said, I work a full-time job, and the blog happens when I have the time and energy to make it work. Having a little more cash on hand will let me do more with the blog and make sure Em and I can keep ourselves in good shape.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we can make this happen, next steps for the blog can include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA YouTube baking show\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA \"Baker\u0027s 911\" advice service\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eEven if these things never take off, just getting to the point where I can devote more time to writing for you all would be incredible!\u003cbr\u003eBesides, Patrons like you will get access to great stuff like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe BHB Exclusive Patron-Only Feed where you can find out new stuff I\u0027m working on before anyone else!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRead drafts and see pictures from my blog entries, or read the entries themselves the day before I publish them!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWant me to write about something in particular?
