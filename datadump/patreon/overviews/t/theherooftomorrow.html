    "summary": "Greetings, everyone.\u00a0 My name is Eli Stone, and a while back, I had this crazy idea.\u00a0 I loved video reviews, and to me they are a form of entertainment just as movies and TV shows are.\u00a0 But I started to wonder that maybe watching them wasn\u0027t enough--maybe I could give something back by starting my own series.\u00a0 I\u0027ve always loved superhero stories, so I got this idea for a bitter superhero, The Cartoon Hero, that reviews animation, both good and bad.\u00a0 However, as time went on, that character\u0027s origin and his reviewing focus expanded, and he even got a lot less bitter.\u00a0 This is what I do now, just as part of the Cartoon Hero series: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Cartoon Hero Vs./Presents: These are your standard reviews, \"Vs.\" for negative reviews and \"Presents\" for the positive ones. I like to try and keep a balance between the two. \u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFrom Cartoons to Crap/???: In this sub-series, I take a look at bad, or sometimes good live-action adaptations of media that were previously cartoons.\u00a0 This could really go either way.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Art of Gaming: In which I take a look at video games--usually good ones, but there was that one time I reviewed a bad one (Lost Magic), and usually ones that I consider to be \"art\" in some way, which I explain in the video.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd the most recent one, \"Cartoons That Never Made It,\" in which I take a look at cartoon pilots that never went anywhere, for good or for ill...\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eUnfortunately, this didn\u0027t attract the attention that Blip wanted, and i quickly became a victim of the Blipocalypse, as many other reviewers had.\u00a0 Fortunately, my backlog has been saved to a site called riseofthecritics.com (though that has since gone down as well), but the most reliable way you can find my work is on my blog, \u003ca href=\"http://www.theherooftomorrow.blogspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Cartoon Hero\u0027s Lair.\u003c/a\u003e It\u0027s all there, and in order.\u00a0 And by the way, my reviews have a storyline, and it\u0027s a storyline that, despite the flack it\u0027s gotten, I\u0027m still rather fond of, so I\u0027m keeping it around.\u00a0 Sorry if you don\u0027t like that, but that\u0027s how I roll.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also currently the head of Red Ribbon Reviewers, a holiday charity organization for victims of HIV/AIDS to promote awareness in December, in honor of World AIDS Day.\u00a0 If you want more information on that, you can go to \u003ca href=\"http://www.redribbonreviewers.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.redribbonreviewers.wordpress.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve run into more of a problem recently after losing my \"real job\" as in a 9-5 one, and I still have expenses like groceries and phone bills to worry about, and not much money left over to put into my review series for things like props, special effects, or even the review material itself.\u00a0 Which is why I created this Patreon, since a certain site made it impossible for me to just get ad revenue and charge no one for the show, and YouTube\u0027s copyright bullshit makes it impossible for me to put the full videos on YouTube and monetize them, especially since with my area of expertise I\u0027ve got companies like Viacom and various animation studios breathing down my neck. But I swear that I will never spend your money on things that don\u0027t go to future reviews.\u00a0 I felt bad enough about asking people to pay for this show already.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI freely admit, I\u0027m not the greatest actor, or the greatest director.\u00a0 I just hope that, if nothing else, my show still manages to entertain you.\u00a0 If I convince you to see something based on my review, or if you enjoy a review of something negative, then I feel like I\u0027ve done my job.\u00a0 With that, I thank you heartily for your support.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEli\u003cbr\u003e"
