I have come to see that I am not a coach who writes, \u003cstrong\u003eI am a writer who coaches.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA couple of years ago, I landed in a pile of grief; I lost my ex-husband (who was also a really good friend) to suicide, my last grandparent to old age, a beloved mentor to some sort of heart-thing, and one of my oldest friends to cancer. By the end of the year, I was so broken. WHOA.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting was the only thing I knew to pull myself out of it, and as I tapped out what would be the first draft of three different books, I found a calling: to bring the conversation of grief, both from death but also from life, to our dinner conversations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, when we truly and bravely grieve our life events and our losses, we create a world where we don\u0027t shoot each other, where we respect other people, and where there is actual peace.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eErgo, I am writing a book for world peace.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo problem, right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut man, oh man, it\u0027s expensive. I have coaching clients and they help me to pay my bills, but to publish this book--and I mean *actually publish this book* (ie: not through Amazon as a free download that automagically becomes a best-seller) I am building a platform of an audience, I am working with a coach and editor to refine and perfect it all, and none of that is cheap. Team work makes the dream work, but they all need to be paid.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so I need your help, to bring \u003cem\u003eGrief: A Love Story\u003c/em\u003e to life, to create world peace. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support and for being here with me. I am on a mission and I hope you\u0027ll be part of my army."
