Who Speaks for Me? is a new non-profit and the work of this project is accomplished mostly by me and volunteers. I work as a legal consultant, but this is work that I have to do to get by. I love the work I do for Who Speaks for Me? and want this to become a national organization to interrupt the cycle of the trauma-to-prison pipeline for women and girls and to end mass incarceration. I am also working on my memoir and have been for some time.\u00a0 Most of you are familiar with my writing based on my blogs and political publications. However, I am writing my memoir in short-story form and they are the \"Cookie\" stories (that\u0027s not the title of the book). I realize I must start from when I was \"Sugar Cookie\", to unravel how I arrived where I am today. The stories are funny, sad, triumphant and moving.\u00a0 I have shared them with a few people. As a supporter you will get sneak peeks of my stories, as well as access to the patron only blog that will include stories about my ongoing reentry, stories of my jail and prison survival, and excerpts from the stories of the women I will be working with at the jail and in the community. Thank you for taking time to learn about my projects and hopefully joining me on this journey!\u003cbr\u003e"
