His work has also appeared on \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e Trading Cards.\u00a0He ROCKS. Me? I\u0027m a cartoonist and I love making comics. Hopefully you\u0027ve seen a comic or two of mine floating around the internet or in your local paper. I\u0027ve also been doing a daily comic since 2008 called \u003cem\u003eDADDY\u0027S HOME\u003c/em\u003e. Maybe you\u0027ve seen that one as it\u0027s distributed to 300 newspapers and newspaper websites in the US and Canada with a circulation of 35 million, daily. I\u0027ve also written for \u003cem\u003eMAD Magazine\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eCracked\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eNational Lampoon\u003c/em\u003e, to name a few. But that\u0027s not why I\u0027m here. I\u0027m here for my brand spanking, shiny new comic \u003cem\u003eAVANT GAUCHE\u003c/em\u003e, which I believe is some of my best work. That\u0027s why I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides doing \u003cem\u003eAVANT GAUCHE\u003c/em\u003e, I am often busy balancing freelance projects to keep myself and my webcomic afloat. Since I was never a fan of ads on my home site, I spend a lot of time doing stuff that\u0027s not \u003cem\u003eAVANT GAUCHE\u003c/em\u003e related for the sake of \u003cem\u003eAVANT GAUCHE\u003c/em\u003e. By supporting me on Patreon, you will be giving me the ability to focus more of my time and energy on my webcomic, which is my main priority. And... AND, as if gaining access to this ground breaking comic is not reason enough, you\u0027ll be getting the work of not one but TWO veteran cartoonists! Rich and I have the combined experience of more than 7 decades between us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, your support not only means more time to work on \u003cem\u003eAVANT GAUCHE\u003c/em\u003e, but it also means you\u0027ll have potential access to a brand new \u003cem\u003eAVANT GAUCHE\u003c/em\u003e comic every single day... 24/7, including holidays! With your help, We\u0027ll soon be busy writing and drawing exclusive \u003cem\u003eAVANT GAUCHE\u003c/em\u003e wallpapers, comics, and characters just for YOU. And that is exactly what I want to be doing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you have any questions about how Patreon works, see below: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what am I doing here on Patreon, you ask?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows you to offer to pledge money to my comics in exchange for rewards. Different amounts correspond to different rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you click the \u201cBecome a Patron\u201d button, you can select how much you want to pledge per month. You\u0027ll be charged automatically, and can adjust or cancel your pledge at anytime. Seriously though, there\u0027s no pressure \u2013 unless, of course you WANT me to starve to death.\u00a0I\u0027m KIDDING though. I kid. I\u0027m a kidder. But in all seriousness, I appreciate any support. It\u0027s really a good comic. I swear. But don\u0027t take my word for it.
