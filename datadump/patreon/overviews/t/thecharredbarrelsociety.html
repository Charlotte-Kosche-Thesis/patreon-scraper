What we do not like is spending money on a beverage that didn\u0027t live up to the price that was spent on said beverage. \u00a0We have started the process of providing a working database of beverage reviews that is easy to access and fun to learn about. Our reviews are blind tastings, which means that marketing and perceived value do not have an effect on the taste. \u00a0It takes about 8 to 12 hours worth of work to make one video review possible. We are looking for some financial backing to help with the cost of the tastings, glassware, studio time, editors and music for each video. \u00a0We are currently footing the bill, meaning someone is generously donating money and/or time to make all of those things happen. \u00a0We are producing one video every month and would love to turn it into a weekly publication. This could totally be possible with your support."

We realized through the course of bringing beverages to share with one another that there was a need for a database of sorts for the everyday person trying to make the best use of their money when choosing charred barrel beverages. And where there is a need, there is often a solution, which we found amongst ourselves, and hence The Charred Barrel Society was born.",
