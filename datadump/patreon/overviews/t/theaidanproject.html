Above all, I am seeking to facilitate honest debate and to provide analysis in the very same spirit. I am also passionate about history and culture. This gives me a large remit for potential exploration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in the East of England, and began podcasting \u2013 not that it was called this until much later \u2013 in the late 1990\u2019s. Back then, I produced short audio shows on entertainment, mostly for an American audience. I also became involved in amateur radio around this time. However, other pursuits took me away from the microphone for many years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the 2010\u2019s, I passionately began to feel that I had something to say, or perhaps more precisely, a duty to say it. I felt that there were \u2013 and are \u2013 debates in the public sphere that many people, not least my fellow liberals, were not being entirely forthcoming about. I toyed with the idea of launching a podcast for a long time. Eventually, I found \u2013 or made \u2013 the time. I am glad I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy influences as a commentator include George Orwell and Christopher Hitchens. The latter was greatly influenced by the former.  I believe we owe it to each other to seek common ground, even if this requires difficult conversations along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAway from my work on the world wide web, I am vegan (I am duty bound by the law of veganism to tell you this), straight edge and atheist. Whenever possible, I pursue my innumerable fitness goals, which, perhaps by design, are always slightly out of reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAidan Coughlan\u003cbr\u003eNovember 2017\u003cbr\u003e"
