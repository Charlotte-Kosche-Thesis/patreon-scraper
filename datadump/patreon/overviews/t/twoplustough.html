In that time, I have worked hard at building the community based around the tabletop wargame, Age of Sigmar produced by Games Workshop. My channel focuses on diving into the rich lore of the AOS universe and introducing the game to new players with tactical advice, product reviews and more. With your help and support I want to grow this community even more; battletome tactics, painting tutorials, convention travel and loads of more content. These things are possible with the support from patrons like you. Together we can make a massive and positive impact on the Age of Sigmar and wargaming community!\u003cbr\u003e"
