I\u0027ve been doing music stuff my whole life. I started learning classical piano since I was 5, and I studied in music in college. I also write \u003ca href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/dooplissmusic\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eelectronic\u003c/a\u003e and classical piano music (still unreleased!).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI work a normal office job otherwise--\"Marketing Operations.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(Some people in the competitive Super Smash Bros.

(Plus it\u0027s hard trying to explain this stuff in person.) So I started writing about it. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe thing that really motivated me to continue doing this was getting feedback from people who told me they didn\u0027t know how to read music at all, but were able to follow along with my articles and learn something.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd, who knows? I\u0027d love to do something music-related for a living.

Of course, essays on a single track \nor piece will be quicker than ones on an entire soundtrack. \u003cstrong\u003eBut even essays on a single track will be substantive--I take care to never release anything shallow or unsatisfyingly short.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003eWell, for one, I don\u0027t like ads. I don\u0027t want to put ads on my website, I don\u0027t want to put my articles behind a paywall, or try to sell them to some sort of publication.
