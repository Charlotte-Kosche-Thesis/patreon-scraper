It was\nthe far future, and the population of the Earth had left the Earth, leaving\nonly vast quantities of people in cryo-sleep who couldn\u2019t be citizens because\nthey were criminals. One of these unfortunately, Jamal Robinson Queequeg, is\nloaded up to be a popsicle\u2014a frozen colonist to increase population on\ndangerous worlds\u2014but the machinery goes wrong, and instead he ends up on the\nSolar Reef. Just like the Earth, the Solar Reef has been long abandoned by\nhumanity, but is now inhabited by other, stranger, and more dangerous things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd\nthat\u2019s what this particular Patreon is for: the exploration of this far future\nand the quest of Jamal to find a way to live in this barren, weird new world\nhe\u2019s found himself in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Process\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a writer, I start with a fragment of a figment and hope that fragment\u0027s been knocked off an entire plot. What you\u0027ll be getting here is an inner window to that process of creation, and the first look at whatever it is I end up creating. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is no different when I\u0027m writing a novel rather than a story. There\u0027s a general framework or a crystallized idea (like the dream of the Solar Reef) which has enough emotional pull for me to dive into it in the hopes there\u0027s a story there. And there always has been when writing stories or novels before. But only my novel-writing group and a few select friends have been privy to this process before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere I\u0027m encouraging you to come along. I\u0027m inviting you in to see both my successful moves forward and my false starts. At the basic level, this simply means seeing the novel as it\u0027s written, from start to finish. I\u0027ll revise as we go along, sometimes with drastic changes, sometimes with small adjustments. But it also means you will see the notes I come up with for future scenes, or elements of world-building, or character creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with all my writing, what I\u0027m offering is a chance to witness an experiment. Ideally, the experiment will end in a finished draft of a novel. And if you want to take this journey with me, please sign up. I\u0027m confident you\u0027ll enjoy the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExamples Of My Writing, Which You Might Find Interesting In Making Your Decision, And Which Should Give You an Inkling As To What You Should Expect Even Though These Are Stories And Not A Novel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://escapepod.org/2017/07/06/ep583-the-librarian/\"\u003e\"The Librarian\"\u003c/a\u003e on Escape Pod\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thediagram.com/10_4/kozma.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"You Have Been Murdered\"\u003c/a\u003e on DIAGRAM\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.albedo1.com/2014/01/17/albedo-2-0-fiction-showcase-6-winter-20132014-the-trouble-men-by-andrew-kozma/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"The Trouble-Men\"\u003c/a\u003e on Albedo One\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://dailysciencefiction.com/science-fiction/disaster-apocalypse/andrew-kozma/the-mountain\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\"The Mountain\"\u003c/a\u003e on Daily Science Fiction\u003cbr\u003e"
