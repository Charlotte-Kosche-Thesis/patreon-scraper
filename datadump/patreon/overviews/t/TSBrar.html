    "summary": "I believe deeply in values of freedom, democracy and truth, and that the United States Government is extremely important to our future. All of us diverse creatures have one Earth to share so we better figure it out. In this spirit I inflated a 30\u0027 Chicken Don near the White House two weeks ago that you may have seen go globally viral like the H5N1 avian flu. I did this because I believe the President is a bad leader and too afraid to release his tax returns and stand up to Putin, and now playing a destabilizing game of chicken with Kim Jong Un. Yet he wants a military parade in Washington D.C.? Well that\u0027s a ripe subject for mockery with my next project, Chicken March, which will feature dozens of Chicken Don\u0027s protected by cold air inflatable mock Russian arms on the grounds of the Washington Monument, our first President who famously warned of the dangers of foreign interference in our democracy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://time.com/4895763/donald-trump-inflatable-chicken/\"\u003eTime Magazine\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/us/politics/trump-giant-inflatable-chicken.html?mcubz=3\"\u003eNY Times\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40886178\"\u003eBBC\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ocregister.com/2017/08/16/o-c-mans-chicken-donny-balloon-near-white-house-attracts-fans-foes/\"\u003eOC Register\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a documentary filmmaker and have spent the last few years working on a feature documentary on the American scientist Charles Townes, who invented the laser, helped land man on the moon, and discovered the black hole at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Charles was one of the best scientists of all time and also deeply devoted to family and God and believed that science and religion are converging to provide a fuller understanding of the nature and purpose of our universe and mankind. Titled \"Unturned Stones\" to reflect his belief that the path of discovery is filled with stones (new discoveries) waiting to be turned over, the film will delve into his brilliant thoughts on man\u0027s place in the universe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
