    "summary": "The world of personal transport is changing at an astonishing rate. New cars are being launched all the time, new technologies are being developed, and we\u0027re more aware than ever before that the days of the internal combustion engine are numbered.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only that, but cars are getting smarter. They\u0027re getting safer. And soon, they\u0027re going to be driving us (and not the other way around).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know how hard it is to keep up to date with the latest news, which is where Transport Evolved comes in. Our goal is to bring you the very latest news in the world of cleaner, greener, smarter and safer transport, free from adverts and free from the editorial conflicts that comes from having a hidden sponsor bankrolling our efforts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe churn through the news, digest it, and then explain the important things you need to know in an easily-digestible way. We\u0027ll add context to stories, explain the background, and go the extra mile. And more importantly, we\u0027ll give you the information you need to make your next car purchase a cleaner, greener, safer and smarter one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are we on Patreon? Back in 2015, we decided, based on reader feedback, that our old Google Adwords policy just wasn\u0027t working. Readers were using ad blockers. Others were simply not sticking around. And they were missing out on the information they needed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we decided to make our site the equivalent of shareware. All of the information on our YouTube channel and our main site is free from ads. You can read as much of it as you want, completely free. And if you like what we do and want to see us continue, we hope you\u0027ll consider making a monthly donation through Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a bit like a tip jar: give us some money if you like what we do, and we\u0027ll keep doing it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we\u0027re super-efficient about our money and have an incredibly lean budget, the more money we can bring in every month means the more we can do. We can hire extra staff, buy new camera equipment, and cover more events around the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what are you waiting for? Help us report the news, and we\u0027ll make sure you get it on time.\u00a0"
