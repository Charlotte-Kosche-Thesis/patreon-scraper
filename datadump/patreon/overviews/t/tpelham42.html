Automated machine construction was sent ahead to create the Mercury facility, but something has gone wrong and your colonists awake to find the facility in ruin. Build structures, research new technologies and send out expeditions to the surface to ensure the survival of your new found home away from home.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMercury Fallen is heavily inspired by games such as Banished, Dungeon Keeper II and RimWorld. While there is no plan for combat, there will certainly be challenges your colonists will face. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.mercuryfallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mercfall_51-1024x577.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eGameplay\u003c/h3\u003e\nAutomated building technologies were sent ahead to ensure the creation of the Mercury facility and colonists, sent shortly after that, would be awoken from stasis upon their arrival. Due to a fault in the AI systems the colonists were awoken from stasis long after their intended time. In the mean time, without regular maintenance, the Mercury Facility has fallen in to ruin.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0Help your colonists rebuild the underground facility and ensure their surthrival (it\u2019s a word) on an alien world. Mine out materials and build walls, rooms, machines and grow crops. Assign your colonists professions such as Miner, Cook, Scientist, Engineer and more to better manage the daily activities of the facility. Research new technologies and send out expeditions to the surface to explore and learn about this new alien world as it may just turn out that you\u2019re not alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePlanned/Possible Features\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRobots\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWho wants to do manual labor?

Do you like supporting indie developers? Do you just like the cut of my jib? These are all good reasons to support the development of Mercury Fallen. I\u2019m focused and dedicated to creating a fun and engaging experience, but I need your help to do it. I\u2019m generally not good when it comes to asking for help, which is probably why I\u2019m the sole developer on this project. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love colony games and I loved Dungeon Keeper II. Dungeon Keeper II, of course, was more of a combat oriented RTS then a colony game, but my favorite part was digging out rooms and hallways and building awesome dungeons. I also love science fiction so Mercury Fallen is the game I\u2019ve always wanted to play. I look forward to creating a fun game for myself and others to enjoy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMercury Fallen Website: \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.mercuryfallen.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.mercuryfallen.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/search/page=1/sortby=popularity/query=publisher:994\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNitrous Butterfly on Unity Asset Store\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
