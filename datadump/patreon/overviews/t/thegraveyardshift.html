    "summary": "I would love to say that The Graveyard Shift was formed after spending money and time researching the best way to make an Irish podcast about Christianity that would connect with people but that\u0027s not how it went. What actually happened is that, after ten years of friendship with Greg Fromholz and Alan Breen, I (Scott Evans) left an hour long coffee with them and thought, \u0027I wish I could bottle the way I feel right now and share it with the world.\u0027\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast is the next best thing. We called it \u0027The Graveyard Shift\u0027 with our tongues firmly in our cheeks as we\u0027ve often heard people talk about Ireland as a \u0027missionary graveyard\u0027 because of the challenges of doing ministry here. For the three of us, our entire adult lives have been spent in ministry here so it\u0027s the only thing we know!\u003cbr\u003eOver the last year, it has evolved from the weird uncertainty and awkwardness of sitting around a single microphone to a higher quality and more streamlined system. Our meandering conversations have more structure to them (despite Alan and Greg\u0027s best efforts!):\u003cbr\u003e1. #NotSponsoredBy: Our intro segment where one of us brings a picture or video of a ridiculous piece of Christian culture that we are categorically not sponsored by.\u003cbr\u003e2. #SonDirection: Our weekly quiz where Scott reads out lyrics and Alan and Greg have to guess if they are from a worship song or One Direction. Once one of them has won 5 quizzes, the loser with have to do a listener nominated forfeit.\u003cbr\u003e2. The Conversation: From there, we pick one or two articles that have interested recently and allow our discussion to flow from there. This can be anything from crazy things televangelists have said to issues of faith in the Irish media to lessons we\u0027ve learned from our time in ministry. \u003cbr\u003eBy supporting The Graveyard Shift, you\u0027ll be helping us do a few key things:\u003cbr\u003e- cover the costs of hosting and production.\u003cbr\u003e- invest in technology and training that will ensure that our sound quality continues to improve.\u003cbr\u003e- drinking milkshakes at an inappropriately loud volume on an audio medium.\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to sample the podcast, you can listen to it on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/TfNfzn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/rxk9yz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStitcher\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/94VzdI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ein browser.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFor more info, check out our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thegraveyardshift.rocks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite here\u003c/a\u003e."
