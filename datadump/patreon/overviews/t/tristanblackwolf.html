    "summary": "Ha\u00e1he. That\u2019s a Cheyenne greeting, as Tristan Black Wolf is\nboth my Cheyenne tribal name and my \u201cnom de furry.\u201d Thanks for coming to visit\nmy Patreon account. Let\u2019s see if I can convince you to be a supporter (athletic\nor otherwise)\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been a writer almost since before I could talk. My\nfirst short story was published in 1977; I\u2019ve since published nine novels,\nabout 30 produced screenplays, and literally hundreds of published short\nstories, articles, reviews, blogs, and examples of running commentary. I received my PhD in Liberal Arts in August 2016. Since\nabout 2008, my writing has been singularly furry, with an emphasis on\nrelationships \u2013 each to his world, each to each other, each to himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut isn\u2019t all furry\nwriting just smut?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLike all genres of fiction, a chunk of furry fiction\ncontains naughty bits, or perhaps is made up entirely of naughty bits. There is\na huge variety of therianthropic fiction, and there are some great writers out\nthere who weave stories of singular worth without using foul language or explicit\nsex. Truth Time: Some of my work includes some graphically-described erotica,\nbut \u003cstrong\u003eno\u003c/strong\u003e lurid detail and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nif it is important to the tale (tail?) being spun. Much of my work could be\nrated \u201cG\u201d to \u201cLight PG,\u201d and explicit material is always explicitly labeled so\nthat you can avoid it if you wish. The vast majority of this account is \"Safe For Work.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m singularly honored to have been a multi-time featured\nauthor on SoFurry, the internationally-known site for furry fiction and art. My\nwork (nearly 200 stories posted) has received over 4300 \u201cFavorites\u201d and 5/5 votes, with well over 210,000 page\nviews and 800 followers, since late August 2011. To read some samples, click on \u003cstrong\u003ePosts\u003c/strong\u003e (above), then look for \u003cstrong\u003e\"Free Samples!\"\u003c/strong\u003e amid the tags on the left and click on that. This will bring up all the posts that you can download as PDF files. Enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat\u0027s in the works?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m polyphasic, meaning that I tend to think on multiple\nlevels at the same time. I have at least a dozen writing projects going at any\none time, some completely independent of anything, some linked with other\nstories or books. Currently in the works is a sequel to my novel \u003cem\u003eThe Man With Two Shadows,\u003c/em\u003e a tenth\nTristan and Aleksandr story, new chapters for a sci-fi time travel universe to be known as \u003cem\u003eWatch Dogs,\u003c/em\u003e continuation and completion of my long-running \u003cem\u003eExpectations and Permissions\u003c/em\u003e series (now at 46 chapters), and even a few experiments with\nother media (meaning a web comic, which will be funded separately and published\nthrough Black Wolf\u2019s Imaginarium, Inc., and some audio performances of my\nwork).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFollowing the example of other Patreon writers, I\u2019m setting\nthis account to pay \u201cper story,\u201d so that you only pay when I actually provide\nthe product. I put \u201cper story\u201d in quotes, as my post must be \u003cem\u003eat least 5000\nwords to qualify,\u003c/em\u003e and that might be (as an example) two chapters of a book or\ntwo very short stories presented as a single post. I prefer that my writing be\norganic, as it were, using just as many words as needed, no more and no less.\nMany chapters of \u003cem\u003eExpectations and\nPermissions\u003c/em\u003e are about 3500-4000 words, and it would be unfair to everyone\nto try to stretch the chapter simply to make the monthly cut. Most modern short stories are as brief as a mere 2000 words, so you\u0027re getting your money\u0027s worth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI may also provide \u003cem\u003enon-furry-specific material\u003c/em\u003e as a post,\nsuch as several blog entries, presented well before they appear on the BWI\nwebsite. Blogs include \u003cem\u003eWordsmything\u003c/em\u003e\n(about language and writing) and \u003cem\u003eThe\nWolf\u2019s Den\u003c/em\u003e (reviews and discussions of older books, films, and music that\nmight have been overlooked in today\u2019s modern world); these would be presented\nin \u201cbatch form,\u201d as the usual entry is about 750-1000 words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI will limit myself to a maximum of two paid posts per calendar\nmonth. but my goal is to offer something every Saturday of the year. I\u2019m also known as something of a\nstickler for grammar (I\u2019ve worked as an editor for a number of clients), so you\nwon\u2019t be getting the scraps; for the actual posts, I\u2019ll give you my best work.\nIt\u2019s the least I can do to repay your loyalty and support. The access to\nworks-in-progress is an added perk, and (I freely confess) may have issues\nranging from editorial goofs to plot holes the size of quantum singularities.\nI\u2019d welcome having that pointed out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOne last thing for me to cover, and I want to be clear: \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\nis not my intention to hide my work behind a pay-wall.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e In return for your\ngenerous support, you\u2019ll get to sample my wares ahead of others and get a few more perks\nin the bargain. If you\u2019re patient, or simply don\u2019t have the cash at this point,\nall of my work (with the exception of, for example, published novels) will end\nup being posted, without further charge. My hope is that you want and be able\nto help keep me clothed, fed, sleeping indoors, and connected to the Internet.\nAs Martha might tell us, It\u2019s a Good Thing.\u2122\u00a0\u00a0 ~__^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCome join me for some great storytelling, as attested to by fans from around the world!"

     "description": "I have been a voice actor for many years, for radio and television commercials, video games, and even English-language dubs of Japanese anime. If I get to this level, I will ask my Patrons to help me choose a story to read aloud, find a good recording studio, and make a professional presentation of one of my original works. When I get to this point, I may have to finagle a bit, since I don\u0027t know (yet) exactly what this will cost, especially if I add intro/outro music or extra time from the studio. However, we\u0027ll get it done. Patrons will have EXCLUSIVE access to a download of this work (MP3) for THREE MONTHS, after which it will be posted to SoFurry and available for downloading with request for tips. And if you really like it, maybe I\u0027ll be able to add other stories in future. We\u0027ll vote on it.\u003cbr\u003e",
