We\u0027re just a group of people on Facebook who like to make posts of all kinds, have fun, \u0026amp; make others happy if possible. We aren\u0027t all that fond of conflict \u0026amp; we love getting down to the meat of things by discussing whatever we can apart of the animated medium or even just about yourself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xfd1lhP.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re here to bring content to you, the community, the people who we strive to make happy every single day for as long as you follow us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe came to Patreon because a lot of people have wanted to show their support in any way possible for a long time. But that isn\u0027t the first reason-- that\u0027s the second. The first reason is that at the end of the day, we are content creators, but like many others, we have people that we want to support. We would love to support our families to the best of our abilities if possible, so we\u0027ll do just that with your support. Families first, but before we put ourselves first, we\u0027ll always put you guys, the lovely followers above ourselves. If there ever comes a time where we can\u0027t, we\u0027ll let everyone know. But for now? Let\u0027s just do what we can together okay?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9YlYs8S.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if your support is just a recent thing, it matters not as it is still support. Help us become better than before by just leaving us feedback. Our ideal is your happiness, since that\u0027s what we love giving to others along with entertaining content as\u00a0a whole. Once again, thanks for the welcome. You\u0027re all very wonderful people, not even just those who are reading this, but even the creators that founded Patreon. I love formats like this \u0026amp; I hope that all of us together will make something of ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePATREON REWARD SCHEDULE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/T2A89JN.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: \u003c/strong\u003eThe calendar is there to give an example of our drop dates.

It might even be one of the anime from the written reviews every month if I feel I should say more! (Note: This is irregular, it does take time to video edit, so it\u0027ll get done in due time)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.) Analytical Videos: (Irregular reward, not monthly) \u003c/strong\u003eYou guys aren\u0027t strangers to my romanticized views towards a lot of anime, so with that in mind, I feel there\u0027s a lot of interesting topics to cover. I\u0027ll simply say it\u0027s me being analytical towards anime, but it\u0027s probably a bit more than that. I have tons of video ideas, one of them being \"What Yu Yu Hakusho did for me as my first anime!\" and I\u0027ll talk about the maturity of the series, the nature of it all, and how it changed my view on media from that moment on. (I will post updates on the progress of these videos)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.) Fally\u0027s Tea-Time Roundup Guests!: \u003c/strong\u003eI will do my best to let guests onto the podcast. Hopefully schedules will align, but I\u0027ll either randomly select from one of the patrons that is subbed to this tier specifically or I\u0027ll try to get another guest if you guys request it. Anything to get you on here, out of your comfort zone \u0026amp; talk to tons of people out there! \u003cstrong\u003e(suggestions can be made whenever once I contact you lovely patrons)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5.) Half-Body Colored Sketch Request: (Monthly Reward) \u003c/strong\u003eEach month, Melwina will randomly select one of the Patrons from this tier \u0026amp; do a Half-Body Colored Sketch either of an OC (Original character) or a requested character from a series of your choosing, so long as it\u0027s in the realm of possibility for her. The tier image is an example of what would be done for you!\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like it was in my best intentions to explain the benefits of this tier, but also that some of the rewards are irregular or just simply monthly. It\u0027s monthly like the past tiers. In the $5 tier, you get a monthly written review, two chibi art pieces, \u0026amp; Fally Stories for instance.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this $10 tier, one lucky person gets art done of their OC or gets to make an anime character request \u0026amp; gets to sit down with me \u0026amp; binge watch an anime hopefully, but I also do expect to spend some time on the videos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if you aren\u0027t pleased with the $10 tier, by all means, just remember there is a lot to come with it, so thank you for showing support if that\u0027s what you\u0027re going for so far when it comes to this tier. At least rewards from previous tiers are available, so you\u0027ll always be left with something!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou get access to the rewards from previous tiers \u0026amp; will help support the creation of our manga or visual novel!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
