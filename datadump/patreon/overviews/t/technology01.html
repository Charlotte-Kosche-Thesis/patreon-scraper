    "summary": "When I was a kid, I loved to look at different schemes and descriptions of them. It was amazing for my young mind, I am very curious about the many devices around me.  Therefore tearing things apart to see what was inside them became my pastime, sometimes to the chagrin of my parents.  But what really made me happy was that I could understand how it all worked. \u003cbr\u003eAll my life I was deeply intrigued by the work of machines and devices around us, and the culmination of this was an eccentric knowledge base about gadgets and gizmos. Technological connections have begun as a way of sharing some of these things with you, in a way that I hope evokes the curiosity of viewers as much as the way things work for me.\u003cbr\u003eIn communication technology, my goal is to share with viewers how the mechanisms of individual devices work in research technology, as well as the history of the most technological innovation.  Connection technology was originally conceived to show the evolution of technology, beginning with fundamental concepts, and the transition to who discovered/invented what and how each individual contribution has led to better and better devices over the years.\u003cbr\u003eWith your support you can help technological connections grow.  Countless ideas for videos lie in my crazy brain, and your input will allow me to devote more-and hopefully all-of my time to making them.\u003cbr\u003eThank you\u003cbr\u003e"
