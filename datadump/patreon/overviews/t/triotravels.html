    "summary": "Why Trio Travels is on Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHey Guys!\u00a0It\u2019s Brad, Krista and Cole also known as Trio Travels\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks for coming to our Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u2019ve watched our videos you know who we are and what we are up to.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are a family of 3 that has, together with our son Cole, have back pack traveled together to close to 20 countries in the past 10 years and along the way we\u2019ve been making videos of the places we\u2019ve been, and the things we\u2019ve seen. \u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve moved onto a Sailboat now, a Catamaran, and we\u2019re traveling and exploring new countries by Sailboat. We\u2019re seeing just how far we can sail around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019ve been Videoing and Sharing our life at sea with you and the rest of the world through Youtube for some time now and we think you are beginning to like us \u00a0: )\u003cbr\u003e\nSo why support us on Patreon? \u003cbr\u003e\u201cIf you need money, why not get a job and support yourselves? (\u003cem\u003eand please keep the videos coming!\u003c/em\u003e\u201d)\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGood question. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSimple answer is: We need your help : ) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have been following us, you probably know we\u2019ve put up over a \u003cem\u003ehundred videos\u003c/em\u003e for the world to see, some short, most are longer, but they are all stories of our adventurous travel, most of them onboard our sailing Catamaran, Saltair 3. We\u0027ve enjoyed sharing our experiences with you, with the world.\u003cbr\u003eYou might want to know\u00a0what goes into making a video for Youtube?\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell to make interesting videos to share with you at home, we need to always be \u201con\u201d, by that I mean taking the video camera with us everywhere we go, always ready to capture what ever we are doing, seeing and experiencing, all of the time.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt only takes an instant to miss that interesting experience that we could have caught on camera. Focus and dedication, we need to always be ready.\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s only the start.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nVideo Editing takes time, lots of time. I won\u2019t go into detail, but a 20 minute video takes 15-20 hours of editing and working with the footage before it\u0027s done.\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u2019s a lot of effort for a 20 minute video! \u003cbr\u003e\nAdd in the downloads and the uploads, the screening and deleting of the bad footage, the external file saving for backup safety, and by the time it\u2019s worked and edited into a tidy little 20 minute movie... we\u2019ve spent a lot of hours just getting it ready to Upload to share on YouTube. Sitting in my cabin for hours editing and working a new video, somedays, it feels a lot like a job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt our current 2 movies per month\u2026 I think a land job to help support ourselves would eat up all the free time needed to produce these Videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe aren\u2019t afraid to find work, we have always worked, and we enjoy working, but a job would definitely put an end, or a long hiatus to our \u0027Trio Travels Youtube Channel.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you can see by all our previous videos that we want to Share our experiences with our friends out there in cyber space.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe don\u2019t need much, but every little bit you can pledge, we will put towards helping to keep the Trio Travel Videos coming.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019re not begging for money, we\u2019ve saved for this adventure and we budget daily for it, but the costs are becoming more than we expected and our budget somedays is stretched. \u003cbr\u003eWe always thought sooner or later we would have to find work, but finding work will soon put an end to \u0027Sailing Trio Travels\u0027 on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease Support us on Patreon and we will make it around the world, taking you vicariously with us along the way! We will show you many more wondrous people, places and things, and share with you all our amazing experiences, with a bigger insight into \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e we did it, and all through the wonders of video, on YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Next season, we\u0027re planning on spending a few months cruising Cuba! We will start up at Puerto Rico, then sail to the shallow and beautiful Silver Banks of the Turks and Caicos for the annual whale season. Then it will be down to the DR and through the Windward passage between Haiti and Cuba. We will explore the South coast of Cuba and then head down the central Caribbean to Belize, Honduras, Guatemala and continue South to the Panama Canal)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLife is simple out here and we don\u0027t need much to keep us going. We\u0027re good at budgeting and we only need a little help to keep the videos coming.\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re dedicated to making better and better Videos based on what you like and want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you appreciate what we\u2019ve been doing so far, sharing the updates and insights into our little Family as we\u2019ve traveled the globe, and if you appreciate the effort that goes into entertaining you through our Youtube channel then why not drop us a tip for making you smile or laugh, or for inspiring you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe tip at restaurants after good service, heck we occasionally tip after bad service. \u003cbr\u003eWe drop a buck or two tip into a buskers guitar case on the street corner for a minute or two of music, and we even tip a guy in a Yellow car just for driving us to the airport.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u2019re not begging for money, we just want to give you the opportunity to help keep the videos coming... the opportunity to tip us too.\u003cbr\u003eEvery tip counts, that\u0027s how Crowd funding works, the power of a crowd and it starts with just one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur videos will always stay free on Youtube and new videos will appear for as long as we can. \u003cbr\u003eWe enjoy seeing our Subscriber-ship grow and we love hearing from you in the comments, thank you for that! \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut we now need your help. \u003cbr\u003eHelp to keep us working at this wonderful job of travel videoing and editing, instead of working at a less wonderful job serving drinks and food at a restaurant, (although we\u0027ve done that a lot before too, and we\u0027re pretty good at it! Lol) \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do decide to become one of our Patreons, thank you! We want to keep the Videos coming and we\u2019re very excited your onboard to help.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019ve put together a few little rewards for the different levels of support. Nothing too crazy, they\u0027re just an extra little thanks from the three of us, a thanks for helping to keep the Videos alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Adventure and the Videos are only going to get better, you can count on it!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCheers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out our website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.triotravels.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.triotravels.ca\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
