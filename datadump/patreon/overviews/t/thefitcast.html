It began as a way for me to get in touch with the best fitness professionals in the field to learn as much as possible to become a great strength coach. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0No matter what was going on in my life, no matter where I was, a new episode of The FitCast came out almost every single week. Over 400 episodes have been produced and every single one is still available to download for free. And they will always be free for those that want to access the information to better themselves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupporting the Production of The FitCast\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMolly Galbraith put it best on Episode 303. Basically, if you want to keep good content coming, at some point you may have to support it. Kind of like \"Putting your money where your mouth is.\" With your support I can deliver great, high quality information to you each and every week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would mean so much to have your support on this passion project of mine.
