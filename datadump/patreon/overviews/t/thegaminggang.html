The past couple of years has even seen our coverage expand to include comics, movies, television, and more as well. If it\u0027s of interest to fans of geek culture we\u0027re probably covering it but we will always be, first and foremost, focused on gaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet as our audience continues to grow the costs associated with operating The Gaming Gang have increased too. We\u0027re not only taking about the expense of web hosting, bandwidth, convention and travel costs but also the investment into more and more professional audio and video equipment needed to produce professional content aimed to inform and entertain.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of your patronage, TGG will continue to do what we\u0027ve always done and 2018 will see plenty more of what our visitors love: timely news, honest and informative reviews, and coverage of some of your favorite conventions. We even have a lot of new segments and features slated for this year.. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe certainly can\u0027t tackle everything we\u0027re chomping at the bit to without a little help. If you continue to find The Gaming Gang to be a valuable resource why not pledge your support?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll for less than the cost of a couple of candy bars each month!"
