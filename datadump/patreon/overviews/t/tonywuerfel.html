    "summary": "Thanks for visiting my Patreon page! I set this up after a number of friends asked how they could support my endeavor to help people grow and move into a new kind of faith journey.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA friend of mine made this metaphor. He told me this. \u201cYou\u2019re a plane and you\u2019ve been taxiing around the runway. You\u2019ve gone in circles around the concrete roads, you\u2019ve attempted to make it work but the problem is planes weren\u2019t meant to simply taxi \u2014 they were meant to fly. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u2019ve experienced an awareness that the world is far bigger than you first understood. You\u2019ve studied, you\u2019ve questioned, and the box your tribe gave you simply doesn\u2019t fit anymore.\u00a0If this is you then welcome \u2014 welcome to a conversation.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy aim is to create conversation, holy space, materials that help people graduate into a new walk that doesn\u0027t ask them to ignore the messiness of life or offer more formulaic religion but learn to embrace it fully and grow with each new lesson learned. The content you help support to create will help others begin doing this!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFaith Undone and other materials available here by Tony Wuerfel are being supported through Reveal Him, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. That means your donations are tax-deductible. Thank you for your ongoing support."
