    "summary": "THANK YOU for following your morbid curiosity to this link!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is a lifelong dream of mine to be a published author. Storytelling is the lifeblood upon which I thrive, and I want to share all of the stories in me with all of you, tangibly. But we all have to start somewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a single mom, my time is mainly dictated by two factors -- my kids, and finances. In order to keep our ship on smooth tides (and keep my sanity) I have to forego activities like \"writing for myself\" in favor of laundry, practices, meetings, and sleep.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really need sleep, guys. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the wake of my recent return to grad school and career shift, I toe a paper thin line of survival each and every day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this book, it is begging to get out of me and into the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tentative plan is this -- I will write the book (I\u0027m already up to \u003cdel\u003e21k\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0\u003cdel\u003e25k\u003c/del\u003e\u00a033k words!); I will self-publish the book (I already have an editor!); I will find ways to get the book into your hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I need help to get there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know what they say about raising kids, right? The village? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me birth a whole other kind of child. The other one I\u0027ve been waiting my whole life to see become real, and not just a figment of my imagination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is this book about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFair question. So far, it is a collection of essays and poems about the hardest three-ish years of my life. I\u0027ve been calling it a \"creative memoir\" in the back of my brain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy would I want to read that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAlso a fair question. Have you ever found yourself in unfathomable situations? Have you ever made questionable choices or been faced with heartbreaking decisions? Have you ever had to crawl out of seemingly impossible depths and struggles? Have you ever lived a fairy tale to watch it unfold into a nightmare?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe by sharing our stories of struggle and being honest about our experiences, we, as humans, become closer by connecting and developing compassion for the human existence. My hope is to reach people and let them know that no matter what they\u0027ve faced in their lives, their feelings are valid and they are not alone in experiencing them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr, you know, you could really just like watching a trainwreck make sense of her life as a form of entertainment. I don\u0027t judge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, but I\u0027ve never even heard of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s probably valid -- though over the last ten years I\u0027ve had three different names and gone by at least four different handles online, so it\u0027s believable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo wit, my writing has been featured on BlogHer, BonBon Break, Huff Po Love \u0026amp; Sex, Elephant Journal, and more. I\u0027ve won both local and national awards for my writing and previously had inquiries for a memoir that never came to fruition because life is a bitch and likes to ruin things, sometimes. If you want a sample,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.elephantjournal.com/2017/07/eulogy-for-the-second-wedding-i-will-never-have/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u0027s my piece on EJ\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave any more questions? Feel free to get at me and we\u0027ll chat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for reading all of this, and I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting me!\u003cbr\u003e"
