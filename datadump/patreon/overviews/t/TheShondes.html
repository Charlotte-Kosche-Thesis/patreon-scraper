We love what we do, and we\u2019ve been dreaming of finding a way to make our work more sustainable financially. Patreon is the first thing we\u2019ve seen that makes sense. It\u2019s not Kickstarter, where you give one time for a specific project; it\u2019s reliable, monthly support (patronage!) that will help us keep making music. That kind of stability we can count on is a total gamechanger. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years, we\u2019ve been writing sing-along, fist-pumping anthems that make us feel alive and full of hope. We\u2019ve been continually awed and honored by those of you who have told us our music makes you feel that way too. So come try this new thing with us. We\u2019ll get the chance to share more of our creative process with you, which we think is pretty cool. And you\u2019ll be helping us try to find a new model for making art that might actually work, and sustaining us so we can keep making music for you."
