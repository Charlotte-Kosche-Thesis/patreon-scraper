I am the homeschooled son of a pentecostal pastor and former evangelical minister turned Agnostic Freelance Religious Scholar and Nomadic Secular Humanist Monk.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am traveling the country in my beat up Subaru with 300,000 miles on it, living in any guest room or spare bit of floor that opens up to me. I am doing this for a few reasons:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e1. I am on a personal spiritual quest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eWhen I lost my faith, I lost more than just my belief in God. I experienced a seismic shift in how I thought about \u003cem\u003eeverything. \u003c/em\u003eMy politics, sexuality, and core beliefs about humanity and the very nature of reality all came tumbling down around me. And while that was a traumatic and painful experience, I have come to recognize that it is also a wonderful opportunity to really explore what Truth actually is.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am traveling the country as a way to deconstruct and explore my own religious upbringing as well as to hear the stories of people from every position on the spectrum of faith. I want to spend time with Baptists, Mormons, Pagans, Satanists, Atheists, Mystics, and Jedi. I believe the more diverse perspectives I can listen to, the more expansive my understanding will be and hopefully I will be able to learn a thing or two about what it means to be human.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write weekly contemplations about all of this at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theholyapostate.com/\"\u003etheholyapostate.com\u003c/a\u003e.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of spirituality, religion, and culture. I want to explore how these things interact and shape each other. But I want to do more than just study these things, I want to experience them first hand. I want to live and worship with people from every position on the spectrum of faith. I want to go beyond the ideas and beliefs that make up a particular sect or worldview to see how a particular faith (or lack of it) impacts one\u0027s daily existence. I plan to write a book on what I discover. Your support gives me the freedom to do research, interviews, writing, and to travel to see the most iconic places of the American religious landscape.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe these things matter. I believe it is essential that we discuss these things openly and honestly. Your financial contribution to this project is essential. The more money I raise here, the less I have to try to find odd jobs while on the road and the more I am able to write and engage with you about the things that matter most. Plus, there are all kinds of fun exclusive content only available to supporters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you want to help out in some non-monetary ways, here\u0027s a few things that I need (I am happy with used stuff and also willing to barter and etc):\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ecoffee and conversation\u003cbr\u003eprepaid gas card\u003cbr\u003eE-books, audio books, or Amazon gift cards to buy them.\u003cbr\u003eextra food\u003cbr\u003eTelescope\u003cbr\u003ehelp with website design\u003cbr\u003evolunteer editors\u003cbr\u003ea tent, a travel pack, and/or any portable camping stuff \u003cstrong\u003e{Thanks to Hillary Pewalka and Brent and Courtney Connell for hooking me up with this stuff!}\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehiking shoes \u003cstrong\u003e{Thank you Joey Riedel for these!}\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003edigital camera \u003cstrong\u003e{Thanks to Kel Zee for providing me with a great camera!}\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ea telescope\u003cbr\u003eCamper van (because hey, can\u0027t hurt to ask, right?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd most importantly, a place to crash for a night or a month or anywhere in between.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am eternally grateful for those of you partnering with me on this journey.
