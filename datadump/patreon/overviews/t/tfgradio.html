    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo why run a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs you know, we try to provide content through both the podcast and blog that is relevant, informative, and more importantly, entertaining.What we want is to provide even more content for you. Unfortunately, that would incur costs that we cannot afford at this moment. As a result, we came to the decision to run a patreon in order to help raise the funds to improve the podcast and blog.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what will your support do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne of the first things we plan on doing is to upgrade some of the recording equipment for better sound quality (better sound board, ability to adjust individual levels, capture the Producer\u0027s rage without popping eardrums). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next is to invest in video equipment and space, so we can start providing various types of video content. This would include battle reports, short-form codex reviews, Meta analysis, and other projects that that would mainly involve 40K but will also include other game systems. Want to see Travis, Adam, or the Producer demo you a game without having to come to Sunny SoCal? We can make that happen!  \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eTo help with this, we will also use the funds to acquire the products that we will be using for these videos. We will be giving back to the listeners by offering some of these products as prizes for our various contests. That\u0027s right: we also want to be able to offer up more prizes and more contests for our listeners. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, we also want to travel to more events outside of Southern California. That way we can go to events like Adepticon, NOVA and maybe (one day) even an international event or two to provide in-depth reviews, man-on-the-street reporting, and our usual brand of insight and wackiness.  Of course, we\u0027d only go where you want us to go. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo there you have it. We would be very appreciative if you can help us in making this a reality. Any little bit helps and we look forward to making our podcast grow into something you can enjoy on many levels!  \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
