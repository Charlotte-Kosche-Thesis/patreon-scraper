Ithoughtiwascrazy, Pin-eye, Rachel Beaumont, I have too many names so just \u003cstrong\u003ecall me Crazy\u003c/strong\u003e!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCollege Info:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWelp, guess I should start at the beginning then. So I attended, and \u003cstrong\u003egraduated\u003c/strong\u003e, from the\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eHussian College School of Art\u003c/strong\u003e with an \u003cstrong\u003eAssociate in Specialized Technology Degree in Art\u003c/strong\u003e. The College is located in the \u003cem\u003eBourse Building, Philadelphia, PA\u003c/em\u003e. I didn\u0027t have any internships, but I worked with many amazing and professional teachers at Hussian. I\u0027ve worked with and was a student of\u00a0\u003cem\u003eChuck Dillon\u003c/em\u003e my Freshman Year. He is an\u00a0\u003cem\u003eillustrator for Highlights Magazine\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eScott Kirschner\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0was also one of the many awesome teachers I had. He was in my\u00a0sophomore, junior and senior and taught Illustration. He used to be one of the founding artist of \u003cem\u003eThe Magic The Gathering trading card series.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals/Dreams:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently my dream goal is to be a\u00a0freelance artist. If I cannot do that, then I wish to work for a company that does character design, kids illustration, comics, storyboarding, or make plushies. With my time at Hussian, I have acquired the title \u003cstrong\u003eStudent of the Month\u003c/strong\u003e, and have been on the \u003cstrong\u003eDean\u2019s List\u003c/strong\u003e multiple times throughout my years here. My other big goal is to have my own comic book; \u003cstrong\u003eThe Amazing Turtlecat\u003c/strong\u003e, published and known worldwide.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is not my hobby, it\u0027s my career. It\u0027s something I committed my time and busted my buns at. It\u0027s something I do with my heart and soul.\u00a0I feel like doing this will help me keep drawing and focused on what I love to do. It will help me get better, and also support me and my art. It will allow me to share and \u003cem\u003econnect with you guys even more\u003c/em\u003e. To listen to you guys, and hear what you want to see from me. Give you the chance to talk to me, and even receive stuff from me. I mean things like buttons, shirts, stickers and even signed original work to you guys! I\u0027ve already talked about it earlier above, but I even want to start making and working on my own published comic, \u003cstrong\u003e\"The Amazing Turtlecat\"\u003c/strong\u003e! Creating that and publishing it is one of my dreams, but I don\u0027t want to dream anymore. I want to make Turtlecat a reality, and if I could make \u003cem\u003ePatreon\u00a0something I can be able to depend on\u003c/em\u003e then I think it might be a possibility.\u003cbr\u003e"
