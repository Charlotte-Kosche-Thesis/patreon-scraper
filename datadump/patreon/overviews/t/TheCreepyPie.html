The first production of this program was LEON and LOLA, only to create Miriam, Kaito and Meiko, only for Vocaloid2 to come out, to be extremely popularized, due to the digital diva, Hatsune Miku.\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003eSince then, more languages have been created for the program, including Spanish, Korean, and Chinese! Vocaloid is quite convenient, because you have the singer in your hands, compared to needing studio time, or even just asking the person to record something.\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"\"\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003eAs stated before, I have a lot of works in progresses that have never really seen the day of light.

And I would love for you all to get a glimpse into my world, and see what I\u0027ve been working on. Plus, everyday I come up with new ideas, and I want to share those ideas with people and (hopefully) get an unbiased opinion!\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"\"\u003eTHANK YOU.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003eThank you so much for reading, and please consider being my Patreon!
