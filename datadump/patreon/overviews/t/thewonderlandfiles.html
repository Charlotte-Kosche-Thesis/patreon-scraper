The world would split open.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e ~ Muriel Rukeyser\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fallintowonderland.com/\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Wonderland Files\u003c/a\u003e started as a bit of a lark, nine summers ago. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt took me a while to begin. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wrote a few posts and then got lost in my teaching work. In order to bind up my then broken heart, I silenced myself for a long time, uncertain anyone was reading what I\u0027d written, or if it mattered if they did. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI finally started writing regular posts in 2012. I wanted to create a \u0027writing practice\u0027 and discipline myself to write and publish things quickly, rather than obsess about making something perfect, editing the life out of the words. It was a labor of love then, and it still is. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting for me is something akin to breathing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI turn blue without it. I curl up into a ball and I fade. I become a wallpaper girl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, when I began writing in earnest, my life flourished. As I started to let myself speak, if only on paper, I bloomed. And I found many kindred souls in the process of sharing my unvarnished truth. Thousands read posts that I published. Thousands more read them when I submitted them to other sites, online magazines, literary journals, and anthologies. My piece, \u003cem\u003eBreadcrumbs in Dark Times\u003c/em\u003e, has been read over 100,000 times on \u003cstrong\u003eRebelle Society\u003c/strong\u003e and on The Good Men Project. The first piece I submitted anywhere from my blog was a piece called \u003cem\u003eA Beginner\u0027s Guide to Change. Live the Questions. Don\u0027t Be Afraid.\u003c/em\u003e It was published on \u003cstrong\u003eRebelle Society\u003c/strong\u003e and later included in their anthology, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Best of Rebelle Society, Volume 1. \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI wrote that piece in a frenzy in ten minutes. My heart pounded furiously in my chest when I sent it off to be considered for publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve written nearly 300 blog posts over the past five years, sometimes several per week, but although I\u0027ve deeply loved writing these posts, I would love it more if I could turn what I have created into something even bigger that can affect even more readers. I have book projects, a line of greeting cards, stationery and tee-shirts, as well as destination and online writing workshops \u0026amp; retreats all in the early planning stages. However, I need funding to seed these projects.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to pour light into the world but I also need to eat, keep the lights on, and pay for things like the internet, blog and website hosting, Canva and my water bill. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCreating a space where I can not only find new readers, but also gain support from current readers, makes Patreon seem like a great place to set up my writing desk,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eopen my door, and ask you all in to sit a spell\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a creative platform that will allow me to share what I know is true.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Write\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eI love words. I love stories. I love swimming in the tides of language and diving deep only to surface with some insight or idea that is completely unexpected, new. I find out what I know, what I am pondering, what makes me curious, what helps me tick, by coughing up words and watching them take shape. (\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://fallintowonderland.com/2014/01/25/everything-starts-with-the-word/\"\u003eEverything Starts with the Word\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI write to find my own sense of truth. I write because spirit tells me to do so. I write to find out what I know. I write because I can\u0027t stop myself. I write because my medicine is words. My purpose in life is to unspool the truth as I see it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy I Teach\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI teach because I have a natural affinity for it. It is my second nature. I am able to help writers find the roots of their creativity and nurture them to a point that they grow and flower. My spiritual sense of writing as a practice helps me connect with students, assisting them in deepening and broadening their work. I have a talent for teaching and a talent for helping my students strike gold. We search for the diamonds in the coal chute. We are certain where there\u0027s poo, a pony cannot be far away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI teach to affect the future. I teach to stretch my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon seems like a good place for all of this. For me to find my tribe and for my tribe to find me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to seeing what pops up. Surprise me. Astonish me. Let me know I am not alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eoxox\u003cbr\u003eS\u003cbr\u003ewww.thewonderlandfiles.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
