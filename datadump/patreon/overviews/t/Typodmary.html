I can\u0027t help it, I like drawing them!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also write \n\u003cstrong\u003eshort stories,\u003c/strong\u003e and am embarking on cleaning up the 90k word mess that is \"my novel.\" (You can probably guess at the kind of novel it is: filled with good intentions, explosions, a few zombies, some fish-monster-people, and a ton of terrible prose and typos.) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also have at least \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003efour other comic series\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027d like to write and/or draw, but I don\u0027t have the time to devote to them!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLike most artists and writers, I spend most of my time split between doing what I love, and taking freelance jobs to make money. I would like to use Patreon for two things: \n\u003cem\u003eto become really accountable\u003c/em\u003e for creating quality content, and to prove to myself that\u003cem\u003e I can make money doing it. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve resisted Patreon for a long time, mostly because I\u0027m convinced no one is really interested in my work and I don\u0027t want to make the sad face when I realize no one will pledged anything. But then I realized I can do this for \n\u003cem\u003eme,\u003c/em\u003e and for accountability, and even if only one or two people join me on my quest, heck, sometimes that\u0027s all the encouragement you need, right? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://typodmary.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/patreon-goals.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
