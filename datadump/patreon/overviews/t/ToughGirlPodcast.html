    "summary": "The Tough Girl Podcast is all about motivating and inspiring women and girls. I interview women who\u2019ve overcome physical or mental challenges that have pushed them to their limits. They share their journey and what they\u2019ve learnt. They talk about their failures and their successes, they give advice, tips and encouragement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m incredibly lucky to interview a real mixture of women, from elite athletes who are training for the next Olympics, to Arctic explorers, cross channel swimmers, ultra endurance athletes and normal women who\u2019ve done extra ordinary challenges. It\u2019s about sharing stories, which will inspire and motivate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, Ali Young, an awesome woman who loves all types of running from 80m sprints to 24-hour endurance races. She shares her top tips for getting into running, what your body goes through and why she\u2019s so passionate about the sport. I\u2019d be very shocked if you listened to the episode and didn\u2019t want to go for a run afterwards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve interviewed Antarctic explorer Felicity Aston, ultra running and Guinness Word Record holder Mimi Anderson, double Olympian Liz Yelling and ocean rower Sally Kettle to name a few!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast went live on Tuesday August 4th 2015,(#ToughGirlTuesday). I\u0027ve now interviewed over 150 women and have expanded the show \u00a0to include Tough Girl EXTRA, 7 women - 7 challenges in 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Tough Girl Podcast has had over 100, five star reviews in iTunes and got to number one in New and Noteworthy in Personal Journals and Sports and Hobbies. I would definitely encourage you to go and check it out! New episodes are out every Tuesday at 7am UK time, you can listen on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/tough-girl-podcast/id1024977070 \u00a0\u00a0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/tough-girl-podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eStitcher\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/toughgirlchallenges/tracks\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease pledge to me so I can continue to publish this amazing content and to share these stories of inspirational women.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
