    "summary": "In April 2016 I bought a 1954 vintage travel, with the intention of turning it into a tiny house, a long held dream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been interested in the tiny house movement for over 20 years, and never thought that someday, I\u0027d actually get to live it. I have the home, it has the potential, but now I need the help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work on Minty in the Spring, the Summer, and the Fall here in Upstate NY, in Winter, like everyone else, I hibernate, and in my case, I create, but to create more, to create better, I need a safe, comfortable home to do that in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil Minty and I found each other, life was pretty miserable. But now we\u0027re together, and she deserves to be worked on, for saving my life, very literally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_1-antitrypsin_deficiency\"\u003eAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency\u003c/a\u003e a genetic issue that in my case, has resulted in incredibly fragile lungs, I spend a lot of time, in and out of hospital with lung problems. But since Minty and I got together, those times are much less, as I no longer have things like black mould in my life. But I need to keep going, I need to make sure that I\u0027ll never have to deal with that again, and Minty is my \"bubble\" in many ways. She helps to protect me from allergic reactions, and for my mental health, she helps lessen the stress of bad living conditions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven during my worst swings of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.nami.org/learn-more/mental-health-conditions/bipolar-disorder\"\u003eBipolar Disorder\u003c/a\u003e, the last 2 years, she has really been there for me. She has kept me alive, on so many levels. She deserves to be the most amazing vintage travel trailer turned tiny house on the planet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have many dreams for Minty and I, but right now, they are pretty basic. Some new tires, and some cosmetic things, and some minor structural repairs. As I progress, her goals will get bigger, but my world will also get bigger.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I\u0027m just your average chick with bipolar disorder who happens to love creating, and is working on a tiny house so that I can work on having a life with fewer stresses, and make a smaller impact on the planet that I\u0027m pretty fond of.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make a difference. I want to show people who are kinda like me, that there is a way to change things. And that sometimes the best way to change, is to ask for help, even if it means reaching out to people you don\u0027t even know. I\u0027m not interested in a free ride, I\u0027m interested in becoming self sufficient. But to do that, first I need to have help. Because when you\u0027re disabled, and poor, your life is about insufficient, self sufficiency can be a luxury when you have nothing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy future tiny house isn\u0027t going to solve my mental health problems, but perhaps, when I have less outside stresses, and can concentrate more on myself, instead of basic survival, and the willingness to even wake up in the morning, then perhaps I can have an impact on the world, to show them that there is a way for all of us if we find the right path to walk. I feel like working on Minty is my path right now. And I need help for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in helping out, funds will go on things like new tires, cosmetic repairs, art supplies and equipment to help with money making efforts to eventually have the Minty Turd fully repaired and modernized, and to eventually find a place to park and live a lifestyle more compatible with my personality and dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven $5 a month can help towards those dreams, so if you can, please consider helping out, and know that you\u0027re helping someone out there, who simply wants to have a life worth living. You will be repaid in joy, a sense of fun, and a rather interesting outlook on life that will cause you to think outside of the box, while living in a box.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMinty and all I do inside of her is how I cope in life and she keeps me alive in many different ways. So have a hand in making her the most amazing rolling box ever!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to see the kind of creating I do, please visit my pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/themintyturd/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsoftheturd\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/groups/friendsoftheturd\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HRHThePaperPrincess/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/HRHThePaperPrincess/\u003c/a\u003e",
