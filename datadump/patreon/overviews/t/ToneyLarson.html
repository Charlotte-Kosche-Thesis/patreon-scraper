    "summary": "Right up front, donations are made based on when I write 20k words. On a good month (one where all the stars align and my kids are somehow ok with me not giving them all my attention) I might write 80k, but most likely, I will get 20-40k a month. You can put a cap on how much is donated, so do not worry about being over charged if I write like a maniac one month. You are totally in control of your patronage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow about me! My name is Toney Larson. I am a published author with three books out - two YA novels and a short picture book of my senior art show. Over the last few years, our family has grown as well as my desire to complete my fairytale series and write another super awesome series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to give you an insight to who I am, I have a husband and four kids. Incredible as it may sound, I homeschool all those kids and write fiction. Impossible? Not so, my friend! Hard? Oh, yes. Some days are better than others. Writing is my non-child or school related job and also my emotional and self-fulfilling outlet. I need to do it more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy current books are a series of retold fairytales that take it to a deeper level. My first published novel \u201cGrowing Amaranth\u201d is based on Rapunzel and tells the story of a little girl who grows up with a controlling mother. It is a fantasy setting, but the emotional abuse aspect is very real. I\u2019ve had multiple readers thank me for telling their story -\u00a0 their emotional journey - and that is the purpose of my writing. I hope to help those that feel alone understand that they are not and that there is hope, no fairy god mother needed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy second story \u201cUnmasking Cassandra\u201d is a Cinderella retelling. It tells the story of a Princess with red hair who grows up in a country that believes redheads are evil and shouldn\u2019t exist. For those of us who are different, through no fault of our own, this is a story for them. Life isn\u2019t always fair and even though an individual may do everything right, the world may still be against them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThere are at least ten more stories waiting to be written. I do all my own work - from writing to book covers and layouts to the final publish. The only thing I don\u2019t do is my own editing, because I believe that my work should be top quality and I go through just as many edits as a top publishing house.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I keep production costs low, I have managed to progress fairly well to this point, but I know that some of my fans have been eager to give and get more, so I joined Patreon to give them that opportunity. Along with my novels, my patrons have the chance to receive some pretty cool and exclusive things from chapter sneak peaks, to early copies, to signed copies, to getting their names in my books. All of these fun things could be yours! Check out the nifty tier system and see what makes you comfy! Thanks for all you do!"
