    "summary": "The Amp Hour podcast is hosted and created by Chris Gammell and Dave Jones. It is the world\u0027s biggest electronics and engineering related podcast show.\u00a0Now in its 6th year, with well over 250 episodes, the show continues to deliver content for electronics enthusiasts of all types.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Amp Hour formerly took\u00a0sponsors, but the interruption and the small amount of money did not make it worth it. For listeners, the show has always been and always will be\u00a0free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to help pay for it all we are now offering a way for listeners who want to, to donate to the show. \u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve accepted PayPal donations before, but Patreon is a much better platform for this. The donations pay for\u00a0streaming server space, proper microphones to send the guests and (as we grow) our time to keep this whole thing going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT THIS IS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt\u0027s\nan avenue to provide a regular donation because you like the \nshow and want to encourage us to keep producing more content.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt\u0027s a way for listeners to ask us stuff and get\nour ear, without being drowned out by the countless thousands of other \nmessages and comments we get weekly.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT THIS ISN\u0027T\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt\n is not a promise of access to any special content, offers, or anything else. Something might pop up occasionally, but consider it a bonus, see \nbelow.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt is not a right to dictate what content we produce, what topics we chose, what we say, or how we say it. You get no \nextra say than those who listen for free.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon\n is better than PayPal because it allows us to easily know who is \nsupporting us and gives us the tools to interact and share things with \nthose supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have absolutely no plans \nto provide special content for paid supporters, so consider anything on \nhere a bonus. But we do value my financial supporters, so you might get \nsome outtakes or other content occasionally.\u003cbr\u003eBut the problem we want to avoid is \none of expectations. Our priority must and will remain producing content \nand maintaining and running the show as we currently do, so \nthat\u0027s why we can\u0027t and won\u0027t promise anything to supporters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eARE YOU CHANGING TO PAID CONTENT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, absolutely not! Nothing is changing. Think of this as just yet another way to donate to to the show.\u003cbr\u003eWe do not have the time nor the inclination to produce exclusive content \nfor paid supporters. That would be a really dumb move on our part.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IF I DON\u0027T WANT TO PAY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s\n cool, your listernership is more than enough, thanks! This Patreon thing \nis just another way for those who do want to support us financially, to \ndo so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY DO PER-EPISODE AND NOT MONTHLY?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows either Monthly donations, or a donation every time we release an episode.\u003cbr\u003eFor regular but not too frequent content, per -episode is the best option. As it means if we can\u0027t do an episode for a few weeks or a month for whatever reason, then you aren\u0027t charged for it.\u003cbr\u003eAnd listeners typically listen to every episode, as they are very formulaic. So per episode makes more sense than monthly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo\n thanks to all our supporters, whether or not you are just a regular \nlistener, or you choose to support us financially through \nPatreon or some other means, whatever the amount. It is much \nappreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegards\u003cbr\u003eDave \u0026amp; Chris.\u003cbr\u003e"
