My name is Donovan, and I am The Beardless Man.\n I\u2019m a maker that does geeky dad DIY videos on YouTube. I like making \nprojects that are fun and functional to satisfy my dad side, but that \nalso have geeky elements to them that can satisfy\n my geeky side. My goal is to inspire people to create something for \nthemselves or for their kids that will be memorable - and something that\n they can look at and say \u201cI built that.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI started getting into making in January 2017, and \nhave been amazed by the community and talent that I am exposed to \neveryday! My first project came out on April 4th, and I have \nbeen releasing new and geeky projects ever since. I would like to be able to release more than 1\n video a month, and if you would like to help me do that I hope you\u2019ll \njoin!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support will help me make bigger projects by \nbeing able to get more materials,\nget better tools (or access to them), and have the ability to put them \nout more frequently. I also love community building,\n and enjoy getting to know other makers and creators and see all of the \nimmense talent that there is out there in the world! It will be a great \nopportunity to get to know the community of people that enjoy my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAside from being incredibly grateful for your support and a big THANK YOU, I want to express my thanks with some rewards I hope you will enjoy!"
