I started streaming in July 2015 and after just over 6 months of blood, sweat and tears (it gets emotional sometimes!) I managed to get partnership. After my last job fell to bits I have just about managed to keep head above water; and with the awesome support of my friends, gaming community and twitch viewers, I am now working as a full-time streamer, and occasional youtuber!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAND?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI play a variety of games although I do mainly play PUBG. I also started a stream team on twitch when I became partnered and try to help out other streamers as much as possible!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eANYTHING ELSE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI also produce music and make parody songs. Mainly based on Elite: Dangerous but also about other things as well. Here is an example of the kind of thing I am talking about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TV0HWzCwwjI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also make video-game remixes from time to time such as this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H-peFbC0G3g\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO WHY AM I GIVING YOU MONEY??\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny support I get here on patreon will go towards paying the bills, rent and all manner of expected and unexpected expenses, and is greatly appreciated. This is obviously in addition to any income I get through twitch, but I can offer a few extra perks for being a Patron, including creative commissions and other things! Every Dollar and Pound helps me out immensely and allows me to continue creating and broadcasting!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
