You are in no way obligated to make any donation, but a like, comment, or share goes a long way to keeping my spirits up and helps me create more and \u00a0better stuff for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you happen to feel like donating, you will receive some great rewards in return. For a single dollar, you will get early access to any pages that I produce, and a single dollar will show your support for my art and comics right on my page. If you donate $5 you get a named credit in my comics, to be printed and shown off forever to whoever gets one. If you donate $15 you will receive a digital copy of my comic whenever an issue is produced, and one free commission per month, at your request. If you donate $25, you can receive a physical copy of my comic, plus a holiday card for every major holiday as it comes about. For every level of donation, you also gain the benefits from the tiers below the one for the amount you donate! You\u0027re not limited to these amounts for donation ($1 minimum), but anything that you do donate monthly, will be rewarded accordingly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to look around, like, comment, and share with your friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSPECIAL THANKS TO: all my fans, regardless of donation or status.
