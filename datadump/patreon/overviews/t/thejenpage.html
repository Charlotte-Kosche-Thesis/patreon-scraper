I won\u0027t waste it. I will be fearless. Patreon gives me the amazing opportunity to live out my dreams. I will run with that until I fly. :) Thank you for supporting my work. I love what I do and the passion in my heart is endless. I will show you incredible things.\u003cbr\u003e---\u003cbr\u003eIn a lush garden, the evening\u0027s mid-summer breeze whispers to you and you turn to see a path you swear hadn\u0027t been there moments ago. You wander and are guided by fireflies to an ornate door, glimmering in the darkness. You have never seen this door before, but your dreams have long told you where it leads. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn dusk\u0027s shadow another realm crosses our own. A place of enchantment, where mythical creatures dwell in impossible landscapes. A world that I long to show you. I\u0027ll weave luminous enchantments and warn of dark curses. Wrapped in moonlight, I\u0027ll whisper to you fantastic stories of lost love and found hope. I only wait for you to open the door. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cimg src=\"https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/eyJ3Ijo2MjB9/patreon-posts/Oy-O1uc39pUDhuWAvueUMRT5p3El474UmIfmPS9s2OnrQzuRZFvnjPl4pu0jR_Ft.jpeg?token-time=2145916800\u0026amp;token-hash=q47PtThC4KoyQjQopWNKYF369bVJeEpgLzWEYKfEKbA%3D\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor my whole life, I\u0027ve been compelled to combine my skills as artist, actress, and storyteller to create fantasy worlds in imagery and film. In my photography projects, almost all that you see is created by me: I design my own concepts, mermaid tails, dragons, fairy wings, jewelry, costuming, hair, and make up effects. I am my own editor and art director. I love every blessed moment of each project, although as you can imagine, the process is slow and the costs are non-trivial. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs my patron, you will allow me to pursue new, exciting photography projects on a grander scale. This is what I love and live for. I can\u0027t do it alone and honestly it is pretty terrifying to consider letting go of dreams and passions. So, I am here. I want to create worlds with you and live in poetry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy creative plan is encompass the light and dark of fantasy art. Being a part of my community, you will see sneak peeks, works in progress, cosplay, the occasional tutorial, giveaways and a variety of fantasy works that range from grand scale to quiet and intimate. I love to use this space for exclusive images and even series. If you support my work here and it will feel like a private venue. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/eyJ3Ijo2MjB9/patreon-posts/WGveVyIQWlJdpT0VyI0BqNoDsZJrEhbyiMTMALzEJSrdXa6yDFdIXTnyUBqaY6Mf.jpg?token-time=2145916800\u0026amp;token-hash=wknL18PwgIAoVJ86J5YvzyMw_f_8LdnEtkYpYv5fZ2M%3D\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt is truly my fantasy come true to have the active support and encouragement of others to help bring my new visions to life.
