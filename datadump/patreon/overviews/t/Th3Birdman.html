I\u0027ve always had ideas, but until YouTube, I had no idea where to exert my energy.\u00a0 I\u0027ve always been told I had a great voice,\u00a0 so I bought into my own hype and became a voiceover artist. I\u0027ve done a few cartoons and video games, and I\u0027m actually pretty good (if I do say so myself haha)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy only problem was finding the outlet to express my creativity and my gift; here\u0027s where YouTube comes in. YouTube gives me a platform to express my creativity, work on my mic skills and let people hear my voice, raw and unedited. My ultimate goal is to become the best voice actor that I can be, and have people that love my work, as much as I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s all I want in this life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
