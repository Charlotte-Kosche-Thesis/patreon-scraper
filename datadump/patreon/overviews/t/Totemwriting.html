    "summary": "Hi!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by. I know what my page headline says, trust me (I fussed over what to put for a few days). However, it is exactly what it sounds like. You patrons are going to get a few different things. Whether they be short stories and poems I create or updates on my D\u0026amp;D campaign, who knows. Regardless, you\u0027re going to get something that is worth your time and money, trust me. I\u0027m still new to this, so things may be a little shaky and change from time to time. Once I find my groove, though, then everything will be settled in and concrete. I\u0027m not a published writer, nor do I aspire to be one, a Game Designer, actually, so I won\u0027t be publishing my works; they will be here and here only.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore about me:\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m fresh out of High School from Frederick, MD. Native to Michigan, I have a deep love for ranch that many mid-western natives can agree with. Whether it be sneaking past someone to grab it at a party or having it in a big dish with vegetables, that might be just my family, I love the stuff. I currently still live with my parents because money and college life and I love them; they\u0027re great. I\u0027m a huge fan of Critical Role and began my D\u0026amp;D adventures because of that, so expect some stuff in here regarding that topic. I have a dog who is an ass and has no friends because, she\u0027s well, a douche, quite frankly. I\u0027m starting college in the fall and am looking to move down to Florida after I get my associates here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy I\u0027m here:\u003cbr\u003eFinally! The thing we\u0027ve all been waiting for! I\u0027m here because I enjoy creating things and have always lacked an audience to share with, and I\u0027ve always wanted to. I\u0027m also a soon-to-be drowning college student, so a little extra cash isn\u0027t a bad thing. I\u0027m not going to hide anything from the people who are, hopefully, giving me their money, because that would be counterproductive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you\u0027re going to get:\u003cbr\u003ePosts will come at about once-twice a week, depending on how busy my weeks are. You\u0027re going to get a few different things. Whether those be things that I code, eventually, write, homebrew or post about my daily life, you\u0027re going to get something that is, hopefully, to your liking. You\u0027re also going to get to know me on a pretty personal level.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
