After fights broke out between kingdoms over the resources of the world, one of the gods, the original creator of the human race, decided that his creation had to be eradicated if the earth was to be protected from destruction. He fashioned a monster out of pure malice to purge humanity and return the world to its natural state, but this action angered the other gods who were blind to the human\u0027s desolation of their creation, only relishing in the benefits that mankind provided them. They banished The One, as he was called, to the Depths, but called on him once more when they discovered that his purifier could not be killed by them. He agreed that if a boy could destroy his monster, then he would leave humanity to prosper on their own, as long as the boy could also unite them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eMore Information\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe section above is a small summary of the more religious part of the story, being the base for the main story line that the boy will follow throughout the novel. Alongside him, there will be a multitude of story lines with their own lead characters, though all of them interact with each other at points and all live in the same world. It is a book full of moral dilemmas, intertwining stories, characters with evil sides and good sides and heroes who commit acts of villainy. Filled with action, tension and quite a bit of violence, though underneath the seriousness, there are aspects of innocence and love for family that triumph over the evil that threatens to destroy humanity. But is the real threat something greater than a dark lord and an angry god? Is mankind threatened by a malicious, outside force, or does the real danger lie within?\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Support This Project?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIf you are one who finds this story fascinating, then pledging money towards it will definitely benefit you, but if you are not convinced, let me sell my idea to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI am fifteen years old now, fourteen when I began writing, and I love High Fantasy stories more than any other type of genre. After reading books like the Lord of the Rings, the Wheel of Time and Game of Thrones, I decided to try my hand at writing my own story. \u003cbr\u003e\n\tI am also pursuing a career in film, so my first draft of the story was a script for a television series. My father then suggested that I write a novel instead, because the series would take too large of a budget, too many actors, and too much work for a fourteen year old to make anything good out of it. With no previous novel writing experience, I set to work on the first chapter, slowly beginning to enjoy the ability to go deeper into my character\u0027s thoughts and develop them more than I could have with a screenplay.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eIs This Another Generic Fantasy Story?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWell, of course I would say no, but let me explain. The idea of Joseph Campbell\u0027s Hero\u0027s Journey format is prevalent in the novel, but is twisted on its head. Instead of having an unlikely hero battle a dark lord, I chose to try something different. I won\u0027t reveal the ending, but I will say that it is definitely not something you would necessarily expect, having connections to real world society and the development of human kind. That all probably sounds very confusing, but will make sense once you read it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome Extra Information\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI would personally recommend this book for teenagers and adults, but not for younger children. There are multiple scenes with violence and a few light curse words, but nothing more extreme than that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI will be putting samples up onto my page, some being locked unless you pledge a certain amount of money, but that depends on what the sample is and how much of it I put up.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAll physical prizes will be delivered after the completion of the book and may require extra shipping costs, depending on where you live.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI don\u0027t know when the book will be completed, but I plan on taking my time with it, trying my best to make it the best that it can be once finished. I do guarantee, however, that it will eventually be completed and available for purchase either as an e-book or a physical copy, depending on what options are available once the time comes.\u003cbr\u003eThe book will hopefully have 500-700 pages, but that number may change before the novel is done.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAs a final note, I would like to thank you for viewing the page and thank you even more if you decided to become a patron. I am very excited for the book to be finished and I hope you are too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t- Tony Del Degan\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
