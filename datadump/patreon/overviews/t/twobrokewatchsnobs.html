If you DM us on Instagram at 3 AM wondering if a Poljot 3133 you see on eBay is real you\u0027re going to basically hear back from us immediately. We answer every email; we respond to every DM; we make sure to acknowledge every shot we\u0027re tagged in on Instagram - we are always looking to make sure you (our listeners!) are valued. So it\u0027s with great pride and pleasure that we offer our time to you directly and to the production of the show and the site.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSo in order to ensure we\u0027re always in a place to be offering our time towards the show and to our listeners we\u0027re factoring in our time as an operating cost.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cu\u003e2.

At first we were happy to conduct ourselves in a vacuum, but then people started listening. They started writing in, sharing their stories, asking for recommendations, lamenting about the current state of horology. Basically, you all became a normal fixture in our everyday life - and that\u0027s incredible! Now when we jump on a phone call to figure out how to grow TBWS, we only ever think about how our next moves will benefit you guys - the listeners.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing in this close contact with our audience has also shown us something else - we\u0027re not alone out there in our horology disillusionment. We weren\u0027t the only ones who felt like they were on the outside looking in when the rest of the watch collecting world was talking about $35,000 watches like it was totally normal. We weren\u0027t alone in feeling like the more well-known and larger watch blogs were only catering to the 1% of watch collectors. You guys felt that too!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s why we feel like with your support we\u0027re in a position to offer people a watch podcast and blog that covers accessible watches and encourages thoughtful watch collecting instead of luxury dong-measuring. We want TBWS to be a community where a Seiko SNK will give you all the enjoyment you could possibly need, because that\u0027s how you\u0027ve individually chosen to practice your horology passion.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour contribution will act as your vote and your voice in taking a stance on making horology fun and personal again!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have any additional questions about contributions or if you just want to hit us up, totally feel free to email us directly at\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"mailto:tbws.contact@gmail.com\"\u003eTBWS.Contact@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks, guys!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n-Mike \u0026amp; Kaz\u003c/strong\u003e"
