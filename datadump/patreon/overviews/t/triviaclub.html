    "summary": "Trivia Club is a live game show currently taking place across Toronto, Canada, as well as a podcast network, which\nincludes the weekly game show podcast Pause + Play. \u003cstrong\u003eRemember it\u0027s not what\nyou know, it\u0027s what you learn along the way!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KHS0wADUVw4/WXywl-uXzVI/AAAAAAAADRc/IV5vkPdWrJ0fbTK5ZRIQVukIi6gk6tSyQCLcBGAs/s1600/whoareyou.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHello, ladies and gentleman, my name is \u003cstrong\u003eRussel\nHarder\u003c/strong\u003e. The man with the bow-tie. I grew up in a small town in\nSaskatchewan where I fell in love with most all things pop culture at a very\nyoung age. I\u0027ve been producing and hosting live Trivia Club game shows since\n2012. Having studied theatre for three years at the Atlantic Theatre Company\nActing School in New York City, I moved to Toronto to establish a more\npermanent home base for myself in Canada. Though theatre, short films, and\nmusic videos kept me busy I really wanted to make my own work. The child of\nTrivial Pursuit playing parents and an avid reader of Disney Adventure magazine\nas a kid, I had always loved trivia. One night of competition at pub trivia was\nall the inspiration I needed and soon after I began producing and\nhosting Trivia Club monthly, then bi-weekly, and then weekly at multiple\nlocations throughout Toronto.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-M--saaWRjh8/WXywkJtEiWI/AAAAAAAADRY/5Ex5NL64ZXMRzIEd-x-cMvyD5XLONznEACLcBGAs/s1600/whatIStriviaclub.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Greatest Game Show in Toronto! Hyperbole\naside though, Trivia Club is three rounds of trivia. The night\u0027s champions walk away with a Golden VHS! With Trivia Club,\nI\u0027ve looked to engender a friendly, competitive atmosphere but also build a community of like-minded folks. The motto of Trivia Club is also its organizing philosophy...\"it\u0027s\nnot what you know, it\u0027s what you learn along the way\", which to me means though confidence is key, communication with your teammates and an\nappreciation for the gamesmanship of it all is just as important. It allows\nthose who take part in Trivia Club to live in the moment and leave on any\ngiven night with lasting memories. Myself included.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is why I\u0027ve pushed to\nbuild Trivia Club into a podcast network, which includes podcasts about comic\nbooks, Saturday Night Live, and \u003cstrong\u003ea portable version of the live game show\nexperience\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0in the Pause + Play podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSpeaking of Saturday Night\nLive, Trivia Club also runs what we call Extra Curricular games, which\naside from an annual Oscar Pool and the Summer Movie Wager, includes the\nSaturday Night Live Fantasy League, a full sabermetrics-style run down of every\nepisode of Saturday Night Live. It\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003eFantasy Sports for the comedy nerd\u003c/strong\u003e.\nThis is something I have run since September of 2013 in a Fantasy Football-style\nleague that now includes upwards of forty competitors.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1xQNjRjgX6s/WXywikzXfRI/AAAAAAAADRQ/mClWR2c3X9MlurN1OQ6pavoeEj5xbRDGgCLcBGAs/s1600/howoften.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI post 1 episode of Pause +\nPlay every week, so\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eat least 4 podcast episodes a month\u003c/strong\u003e, or at least 50\nepisodes for the year. In terms of live events, we\u0027ve averaged 120 live events\n(two to three times a week) over the last three years. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JiHuRkFhAMs/WXywiosUMjI/AAAAAAAADRU/f_hG9IqkAD0PAz5EVJgRu7M_hOm0ri2jQCLcBGAs/s1600/money.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTrivia Club is written, produced, and hosted by\nme alone. One form of income is from our live Trivia Club events. However this doesn\u0027t account for the hours of work put into research and development for those live events, not to mention Extra Curricular games like Saturday Night Live Fantasy League, and our growing podcast network. But their is a way to make these sustainable in the\nlong term: \u003cstrong\u003eyour Patreon pledges\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LO2kW0Fz-QQ/WXywfyKzu1I/AAAAAAAADRM/XWXmadRQUMsZF3HHrezb3BrNdZqyg3DyQCLcBGAs/s1600/anythingelse.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e Trivia Club would not be possible, it could not be a club, without the participants.\u00a0I\u2019ve been thinking of putting together a Patreon for a while. What started as a fun side project has turned into a full-time job with no shortage of work (that I\u2019ve given myself). The podcasts are the most recent part of it. Pause + Play and The Panel, with hopefully more to come. Patreon will help what started as a side project continue to grow into a community, while giving you an extra something as a thank you (see the Rewards, on the left).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you you\u0027re thinking, \"But I already attend live events and donate money there! Why should I pay more?\"\u003cstrong\u003e Thank for all of your support!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eYou are in no way obligated! If you\u2019ve always enjoyed the live events but aren\u0027t able to donate to Patreon at this time, that is totally cool. Your investment in Trivia Club does not need to go any further then your favourite bar. I\u2019m just happy to have you out at Trivia Club, thanks for learning along the way with me!\u003cbr\u003e"
