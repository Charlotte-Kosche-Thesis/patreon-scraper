I create content on my various pages on Facebook as well as my website, www.themodernmaker.net which is put out for free. All my knowledge, and processes are there for the taking. I have helped many people elevate their work in historical clothing as well as modern fashion with my posts and videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney that is given here will be put towards creating videos, and books and developing products that will eventually grow into retail items such as courses, DVDs, and books. The difficult part of doing what I do is that I must also work part time in various jobs to be able to pay the bills, while keeping a few days per week that stay devoted to the creation of books and videos and research. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month, I will release new content aimed at helping the historical, or modern tailor create well-crafted and beautiful clothes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you for your pledge and I hope that my work helps you further your own creative clothing design!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
