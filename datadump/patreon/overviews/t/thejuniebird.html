    "summary": "Hey folks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Rachel, I go by theJunieBird on YouTube and elsewhere on the internet. Right now I make YouTube videos observing life around me, talking about everything from fledgling adulthood to TV and new media to my relationships with faith and sexuality. My channel is a place where I\u0027ve talked to my community about my journey of finding (or not finding) work in Los Angeles, becoming a vegetarian, and learning new ways to express myself. I love the content I\u0027ve created and the community that I\u0027ve become a part of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I consider my YouTube channel to be a space to have discussions with my friends as well as to practice making things in new ways. I use it to get better at communicating through video and to build a community on the internet. My channel is a collection of things that I love and through it I am constantly encouraging people to do something that they love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince you\u0027re here, I\u0027d love for you to join my community by subscribing on YouTube or by supporting me here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re new to Patreon, here\u0027s how it works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI make videos\u003c/strong\u003e. The videos that I make on YouTube will continue to be free. Nothing about that changes. I love making things and getting your response. That will continue to be true.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou watch my videos\u003c/strong\u003e. I mean. Probably. I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s how you got here, but I could be wrong. If you\u0027re not already subscribed to my channel or watching my videos the link is up above, and I\u0027d encourage you to check it out.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you are wanting to and able to, support me with a monthly donation\u003c/strong\u003e. I totally get that this is not financially feasible for everyone. It\u0027s not financially sustainable for me to support the people that I want to support right now, so I get it if this isn\u0027t for you. If you\u0027re willing to and able to though, there are some perks available to you in the sidebar. Check it out! Donations will be taken out of your account on a monthly basis, so keep that in mind when you\u0027re deciding to support me or anyone on this platform. If you\u0027d rather make a one-time donation that can be arranged through PayPal, get in touch with me and we\u0027ll make it happen.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI continue to make videos!\u003c/strong\u003e With financial support from my community I\u0027ll be able to make videos with more room to try new things and less stress about how I\u0027m going to pay for things like bills and groceries.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eThat\u0027s it!\u00a0I know that sounds boring and simple to be so focused on things like bills and groceries, but it makes a HUGE difference in the kind of content I\u0027m able to make. I love making YouTube videos, but it doesn\u0027t make me any money whatsoever at the moment, so sometimes I get distracted by the logistics of finances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will continue to make YouTube videos regardless of what kind of support I get here on Patreon because I love it. But it would be really cool if YouTube could be a money-making side hustle for me and Patreon is the next step to getting there.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for checking out my page and if you\u0027re interested in supporting me, there are perks avalible right over there. ------\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003eAND, be sure to check out some of my longer term goals over on the left. Some of those are a long ways away, but with your help they\u0027re absolutely possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

This would be fantastic, as I have a lot of ideas that are way out of my reach right now, but if I had a huge network like the ICG at my disposal, those might become more feasible. If we reach this goal I\u0027ll do a livestream show to celebrate with all my Patreon supporters!",

This would allow me to focus solely on YouTube and online projects, coordinating collaborations and building the community surrounding my own channel as well as boosting other creators who\u0027s work I believe in and want to support in every way possible. This goal is probably very far away, so I\u0027m not even sure what I would want to do if we reach this, but there would absolutely be lots of celebration involved. Maybe by this point I\u0027ll have enough original songs written to start pursuing creating an EP. Maybe I\u0027ll throw a big party and invite everyone.
