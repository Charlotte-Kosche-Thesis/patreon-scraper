They\nrealized the struggles of finding time to get a group of PT\u2019s together to\nparticipate in a journal club so they developed the Journal Junction to ease\nthe burden and allow therapists to participate at times convenient for them.  Our mission is to extend the reach, impact,\nand exchange of scholarly ideas through innovative technology, exceptional\nservice, and community engagement\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe healthcare community is changing rapidly, practitioners\nare being pressured to achieve improved outcomes in less time, and this in turn\nsaves precious healthcare dollars and limited resources.  By engaging therapists in active discussions\nabout relevant research the therapy community will be better able to make\nevaluation and treatment decisions based on evidence.  The therapy community needs to be engaged in\nconversations about how our profession is advancing and changing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your participation in this online forum and\nhelping to advance the profession.\u003cbr\u003eClancy Brown, PT, DPT and Joe Schroeder, PT DPT\u003cbr\u003eFounders of The Journal Junction\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Our goal is to allow PT\u2019s to participate in a journal club setting, without the headache of managing the club itself. Our site allows therapists to review new and relevant research, and instantly connect with other PT\u2019s who want to discuss each article. Most importantly, our site allows therapists the freedom to participate on their own time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Journal Junction is a site created for physical therapists, by physical therapists. As practicing PT\u2019s ourselves, we are aware of the struggles that PT\u2019s face and are dedicated to providing the most effective ways for therapists to be more involved in evidence based practice. We feel that the best way for our profession to continue to advance is through knowledge of the latest research in our field. In addition we believe that collaboration with other professionals in the field can drive that advancement even farther",
