    "summary": "Kia ora! Hello and welcome to my Patreon! I\u0027m super excited you are here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been creating free resources through\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sacraparental.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSacraparental\u003c/a\u003e and elsewhere for six years now, helping parents raise world-changing children.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do love it! I come from a church background, where we all share our gifts with each other, and I\u0027m proud of all the good, \u003cem\u003efree\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0stuff I\u0027ve put into the world over the last few years, from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sacraparental.com/2016/10/12/13-fabulous-kids-tv-shows-that-pass-the-maisy-test-and-wont-drive-you-crazy/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Maisy Test\u003c/a\u003e for sexism in children\u0027s media, to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sacraparental.com/2016/01/08/lent-with-kids-how-to-create-a-household-lent-plan/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLent with Kids\u003c/a\u003e plan that families around the globe use in the run-up to Easter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut a girl\u0027s gotta eat! I\u0027m now a freelance writer, supporting my family of four, and I need to channel a lot of my writing time into paid articles for websites like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/author/thalia-kehoerowden/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Spinoff\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thesapling.co.nz/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Sapling\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://blog.storypark.com/?s=Thalia+\u0026amp;category_name=\u0026amp;submit=Search\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStorypark\u003c/a\u003e, and other contract writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron, you can give me room to write important things that don\u0027t fit elsewhere. I want to advocate for children\u0027s rights and help parents go against the flow. I want to equip families to make the world a better place, together. I want to be free to say what I think, be my own editor, and keep Sacraparental free from advertising or sponsorship.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also love to be able to provide workshops to churches and community groups, even if they can\u0027t cover my costs themselves. Help me bring messages of justice, inclusion, kindness and non-conformity to anyone who wants to hear them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a Patron you will also help me devote more time to building life-changing, positive online communities, like the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://brilliantandamazing.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBRILLIANT+AMAZING+WRITERS+MOTHERS\u003c/a\u003e network that has become the kindest, deepest-connecting place on the internet. Guiding that community, and several others I\u0027m part of online, takes time and thought, and I\u0027d love to have more headspace for such things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, one of the ways Patreon users normally tempt Patrons in is to give you access to stuff you can\u0027t get without paying. This presents a dilemma for me, since I\u0027m committed to providing free resources to everyone! I answer anyone\u0027s questions, through my website and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sacraparental/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e, and I listen to anyone who wants to suggest future blog posts or has something to share. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what you\u0027ll get from me if you click BECOME A PATRON is a bit different.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSolidarity: A sense of being part of a team with me, working to make the world a better place\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSneak peeks: You\u0027ll see everything first, before it goes up elsewhere online\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSuggestions: What do you want me to write about? I\u0027d love to know, and I\u0027ll make it easy for you to tell me. That goes for rewards, too - tell me your ideas.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how about it? Do you appreciate what I contribute to the world? Do you have a spare few bucks a month to help make it possible? I\u0027d \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0you to join the team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exxx\u003cbr\u003eThalia"
