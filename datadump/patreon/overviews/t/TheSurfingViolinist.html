I will write a companion book to go into more depth about the topics discussed in the film.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach Friday I will make one video also called Building a Better Me: a step-by-step \"vlogcast\" about personal growth in difficult times. The weekly talk show will serve as the backbone of this weekly video, but vlog segments chronicling my path to build a better me will be included as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis weekly video will be the uncut uncovering of the skeletal structure of the feature film Building a Better Me. It\u0027s meant to be more than health and wellness. It\u0027s an attempt at a comprehensive reevaluation of life, occupation, and ideals in a fast-changing world in which traditional institutions are failing to address all the problems we face with discernment and compassion. Building a Better Me is meant for people who battle depression, facing poor health situations, or find themselves stuck in creative, ideological, or occupational ruts. This is not a tutorial by a mentor who has found the answers, but by an embedded reporter of sorts who is trying to find his own way. Building a Better Me is a memoir in action, and hopefully you can learn from my mistakes and translate the lessons I learn to your own unique situations. Conversations, suggestions and feedback will primarily take place on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BABM/\"\u003eBuilding a Better Me\u003c/a\u003e Subreddit and here on the Patreon Page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you support this page with a monthly pledge you help us to not only keep making these live shows, podcasts and videos, but also to make these videos better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope that that the content on this channel will be worthy of TV one day, but to get it at that level of production value it will need much more time and money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the mean time we hope that you find solace and encouragement in our journey of making the internet a more creative, cross cultural and constructive place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHandy Links: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/thesurfingviolinist\"\u003eWeekly Live Stream on Twitch\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ccsub/\"\u003eCreator\u0027s Corner Subreddit\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/theindiaconnection/\"\u003eThe India Connection Subreddit\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BABM/\"\u003eBuilding a Better Me Subreddit\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.tsvbabm.com/\"\u003eThe Surfing Violinist\u0027s Building a Better Me Website - Under Construction\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
