With the support of readers and a few advertisers, we\u0027ve quickly become a key voice in arts journalism in Madison. We often beat bigger, more established outlets to stories and cover events and artists that might otherwise go ignored in the local press, or at least not covered with the same depth and attention to detail. We also take pride in paying the freelance journalists who contribute to the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to our journalism, we host\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tonemsn/events\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecurated concerts and events\u003c/a\u003e, mostly concerts by\u00a0compelling touring and local musicians, and the occasional panel discussion. These events include the sporadic GateSound series, which takes place at the historic Gates of Heaven synagogue in downtown Madison.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTone Madison is supported by a little bit of advertising, funds from our own pockets, and donations from you. Everything we publish is free to everyone. But it does cost money to produce our coverage and events, and with just a few bucks a month you can help us make it better and better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you appreciate what we do and want to support independent arts journalism driven by a passion for the work and dedication to the Madison community, we welcome your financial contribution. Your donation helps us maintain the website, put on events, and compensate our contributors. We are not a non-profit and thus your donation is not tax-deductible, but all donors receive some free Tone Madison swag, discounted access to our events, and also the satisfaction of being awesome."
