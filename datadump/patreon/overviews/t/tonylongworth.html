Combining traditional instruments and new technology, Tony is not afraid to experiment, continually striving to create something different within his work. There is a dark edge to his music, but there\u2019s also warmth and feeling in there too. Tony is not your normal run-of-the-mill film composer, he is all about defining genres and his film scores certainly do just that.",
