Showing a somewhat darker tale as the lust of a loyal coyote\u00a0for the commander of his group comes to a boil, long denial having made him consider alternate methods. But can Antoine D\u0027Coolette\u0027s better nature persuade him to abandon this risky venture before it\u0027s too late? Will he throw aside honor for passion?

Our art and comics are what our Patrons are supporting us for. Development is being funded by our earnings in patreon and by our own pockets, however we are not making money from it in any way. We offer sneak peaks to the game, our own original concept art, music, and screenshots as incentive to support us, but the game itself is 100% free to play and not offered as a reward to pay us. Our NPC Tiers/ and Master Quest tiers offer art, music, and special privilages as incentive to pay more, however they are still not directly buying the game in any way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you become a supporter of this Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBesides helping us make a living off our work, you\u0027ll be getting access to high quality 18+ material months before anyone else, as well as ensuring your copy of each page of the comics as they release(They will not be released to the public for awhile).

Starting Jan 2017 we will post all the content for your tier to the feed so you may access all of it any time! However, only Sonic and Emerald tiers have instant access to ALL previously released content(Pre-2017)! :) Just shoot us a PM requesting all the old stuff or click \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/nov-emerald-tier-7684680\"\u003eNov Emerald/Sonic Tier Content Drop (NEW PATRONS)\u003c/a\u003e\"!

As soon as you switch you\u0027ll be given all the new and old content right away. You can even switch back to a previous tier after getting all the old stuff from the higher tiers, but just be aware you will only be given access to stuff you paid for first. i.e. if you switch to the $20 Emerald Tier, you must first pay a month in that tier to get all the stuff before switching back to a lower Tier. To summarize, you\u0027ll get all the content for the tier you pay for at the beginning of each month.\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eHow long will it take to finish these comics?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: We generally try to get out at least one page a month finished wise, and when this patreon grows and we can afford it we\u0027ll put out at least one or more a month! Besides comic pages, you guys\u0027ll be getting plenty of other goodies as this patreon isn\u0027t only about comics. \u003cdel\u003eWe hope to have Taking Sally\u0027s Pie finished by Q4 of 2017\u003c/del\u003e(This comic is going to be big, around 15-20 pages at least! not counting extras). As far as Sub-Routines, SlashySmiley is on hiatus due to a personal physical injury. We\u0027ll let you know when the comic is going to continue.\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eAm I really helping develop these comics and pinups by supporting you? Or are you just saying that? \u0026gt;:(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: Of course you\u0027re helping! You make a huge difference by supporting us each month. Besides the obvious financial help allowing us to spend more time working on these comics and pinups, you give us a ton of confidence and motivation to work on them! It feels extremely awesome to have people willing to pay to get our content and help up make more. We love and appreciate all of you for it. :) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOff-Topic Q\u0026amp;A\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nQ: Wait wait... Who exactly is working on these comics? Who are Team Acorn?\u003cbr\u003e\nA: As stated above in the introduction, Blazeymix and Sallyhot are the founder and leaders of the group known as Team Acorn, which was created at the end of 2012. While there are more members of TA than just us, this Patreon focuses on our own projects and work. Perhaps someday we can make a site for all of the amazing artists at TA(Psst.. visit teamacorn.net ... it hasn\u0027t been updated in awhile). \u003cbr\u003e\nQ: Okay so if there\u0027s two of you, which one of you wrote all this? O.o\u003cbr\u003e\nA: Why, Blazeymix of course! ;) Sallyhot is an amazing artist, but he prefers to keep things simple and do his work. I on the other hand don\u0027t mind managing the patreon and communicating with our patrons more. \u003cbr\u003e\nQ: Is Sallyhot a girl? \u003cbr\u003e\nA: Nope. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAny questions, or need help?
