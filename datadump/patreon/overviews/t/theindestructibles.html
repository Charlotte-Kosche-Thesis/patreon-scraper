    "summary": "I\u0027m the author of the Indestructibles series, in which a gang of young superheroes--a solar powered girl, a ballerina vigilante, a kid with an alien living in his brain, a werewolf with confidence issues, and a Whovian with a black hole where her heart should be--learn how to save the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe series is very comic book-like, with fast-paced chapters, a lot of pop culture winks and nods, and a quick publishing schedule (we\u0027ve produced three books in less than a year and a half). A Patreon page seems like a good way to help keep up that pace (I write and edit for a living, but the books themselves are only a small part of what it takes to get by). There is a fourth book in the series in the works as well as a spin-off and prequel series, and while I barely sleep and write quickly, something like Patreon can help me keep that pace up long term and keep putting out quality Indestructibles stories at a fast rate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo many stories to tell\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe nice thing about the world of the Indestructibles is that there are a lot of corners of the world I haven\u0027t had time to explore in the main novels--solo adventures for the heroes, prequel stories about the previous generation of superheroes, darker tales from the villains\u0027 perspectives, even alternate reality and timeline stories. So what I\u0027m offering to do is to provide Patreon backers exclusive access to original Indestructibles short stories before they see print anywhere else. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s only so much time in the main series novels to explore the far corners of this setting, and I can already see tales I want to tell I may never be able to touch upon in the novels. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve previously produced two Indestructibles \"one-shots,\" short, self-contained stories which were made available on Kindle. Kindle is limiting, though, and I\u0027d rather be able to interact with Indestructibles readers directly--what stories you want to hear about, who deserves a solo adventure, which villain backstory we haven\u0027t heard enough about. Patreon backers will receive access to quarterly stories at first, and potentially monthly (just like a traditional comic!) if things go well here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRead more about the book series at \u003ca href=\"http://www.theindestructiblesbook.com.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.theindestructiblesbook.com.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
