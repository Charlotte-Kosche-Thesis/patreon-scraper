When The Living Trees hit $1300 per month, we will buy key equipment to build the best videos to offer online programs so that our organization becomes more efficient and sustainable. We want to keep teaching the Flow Arts to at-risk youth, we want to keep having events with music that raise funds for river clean up, and planting trees in rural communities! With $1300 a month we could get the equipment we need to take it to the next level. We could devote more time to our projects and expand to include artist from around the world with our online presence upgrades!\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "If we were creating a coffee shop or local retail store, we could have this up in no time. Instead we are creating something that hasn\u0027t been done. You may be thinking, why should I support? Someone else will. If that were true we would be so much further along bringing this vision to fruition than we are right now! We created this goal because we want to get merchandise that will be sold in small local businesses to support local communities. We need to hire people so we can take this organization to the next level. We need attorneys, office space, paper, pens, and so much more. I believe that soon you will see we are expanding beyond the arts to include sustainablity, wisdom from the elders, and survival skills to promote self reliance, sustainability, wisdom, and the arts. We believe by balancing these we can build a world with the people, for the people. We have worked hard over the past few years connecting with other organizations for partnership opportunities but we can\u0027t do this without you!",
