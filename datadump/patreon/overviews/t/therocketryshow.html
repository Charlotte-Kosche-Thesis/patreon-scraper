They bring their passion for hobby\nrocketry to the table, and present what we hope are thoughtful but lively\ndiscussions about the Model \u0026amp; High Power rocketry scene, along with great\nguests \u0026amp; experts to speak on the many subjects surrounding the hobby.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA short history\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nConstruction of the show began in 2010 when CG\nbecame a \u201cBorn Again Rocketeer\u201d (BAR). Being a longtime Broadcast Technician,\nand an avid fan of Talk Radio, he wondered if there was a podcast on the hobby\nhe could listen to. A quick check showed that there was none. He thought:\u201d\nHmm\u2026I can do this\u201d, and the idea was born. The domain and website were set up\nshortly after, and CG set out figuring out what would be on this program once\nhe moved forward.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the summer of 2014, he met Jim Seibyl, who is\nalso known by his nick name \u201cGheem\u201d. The two got along, and before too long, CG\noffered Gheem the co-host spot on this experimental venture, to which Jim\nenthusiastically agreed to hop on board.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn October 2014, the first show launched \u2013 though\nit wasn\u2019t meant to be more than a technology test. The chemistry was obviously\nthere, and CG felt it was good enough to go ahead to post as the pilot episode.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom there, the show was quickly accepted by the\n\u201cnet savvy\u201d of the rocketry hobbyists, and CG had a runaway success happening.\nSince the start, we\u2019ve tried many things, and a major part of it is being able\nto cover major (National and some regional) rocketry events for listeners who\nare unable to go to these, and to try to bring the experience back to each of\ntheir workshops to listen to while they build and / or prep their own rockets\nfor flights near them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOur goal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that last paragraph sums up what we are trying\nto do with the show. To provide you a fun and upbeat companion to the hobby.\nOne you can count on to pass the time away while you work on mundane tasks in\nthe workshop!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have done coverage of LDRS 34, and with the\ngenerous help of a couple of our sponsors, provided coverage of NARCON 2016.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe would like to do more of this kind of coverage,\nas well as being able to grow the show, and add more social media tools to\nallow listener interactions with us during the show. To this end, we will be\nexperimenting with live shows, where Patrons will have advanced notice of said\nprograms.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour pledges will also help to grow the program,\nand (our wish) allow us to afford to get out and cover more National and\nRegional events. Your help, along with the support of vendors who believe in\nthe program enough to donate funds along with you will help to get us there.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the moment, there is only one level of support, and at this level, we suggest a donation of as little as a dollar or two per show, or as much as\nyou feel the program is worth to you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere will be other levels of support emerging in\nthe months to come, where we will offer different \u201cperks\u201d for donations above\n$15.00 or so per show each month. If you are a member who is already\ncontributing at that level, you will be \u201cgrandfathered in\u201d, and receive the\nappropriate reward for your amount when we start up the rewards program as a\nspecial \u201cthanks!\u201d\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for the patrons who have contributed to\ndate, and here is looking to a great future of great hobby rocketry programs!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
