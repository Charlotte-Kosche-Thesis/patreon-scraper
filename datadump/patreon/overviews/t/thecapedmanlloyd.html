    "summary": "Hello everyone, I\u0027m Lloyd but I go by the name \"Thecapedmanlloyd\" in online art galleries and I create drawings and animations involving Pokemon. I also from time to time create art of Digimon and other cute characters. I create adult art for some online galleries such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/user/thecapedmanlloyd/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFurAffinity\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://inkbunny.net/thecapedmanlloyd\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInkBunny\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=3330271\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePixiv\u003c/a\u003e. I love creating messy artwork around scat and fart stuff so you\u0027ll be seeing that mainly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*DISCLAIMER*\u003cbr\u003eBy Pledging to my Patreon page, you\u0027re agreeing that you\u0027re at least of legal age (18 in America) to view adult content in the country in which you live.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been drawing adult artwork for many years and now with life and other projects I\u0027m working on, I don\u0027t have as much time to draw it as much. Patreon allows those who enjoy my work to support me so I can make it. I\u0027m seeking to do this full time so I can continue to work on project, like building games and working on other animations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you support me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think people should support their favorite artist in any way they can. For me personally, I\u0027m pretty much the only artist who draws this kind of stuff exclusively while maintaining a cute art style that others aren\u0027t willing to do. By supporting me, you\u0027re making sure I continue to make those messy drawing and animations you all love. The best thing is the more successful this becomes, the more things I can do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to cut out commissions completely and let Patreon become the main source of income so I can work on my personal projects and develop and maintain a schedule of work and know when and what needs to get done. I really want to get my game made but I\u0027m having issues finding the time to work on it because of how I have to hunt for commissions to make up what I need for monthly bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the money you get do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, Patreon takes their cut, which I found out floats around 10%. The rest goes to paying bills so I can have a place to say. My part of bills are about 350 bucks to keep my room but I need to be making about twice that to do anything meaningful since the money I get goes right back out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m pretty much a starving artist here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of stuff do you make?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI create digital artworks, including digital painting, animations and comic books. The content I focus on is scat and farting stuff with anime characters, such as Pokemon, Digimon or other things I find cute. I don\u0027t do sex content or anything sexual in nature, as I have no interest in that. This is something I can do but I find it boring so I tend to do things involving the anus. Since my fans also like watersports, I will also be doing that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe things I tend to do are considered very kinky by the furry community and as such, most artist won\u0027t even touch it so I\u0027m one of the few remaining who do draw this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me if I do this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, you get artwork and other monthly things, such as animations and artwork. I want to keep things simple so it easy for us both. If you look on the side for the pledge tiers, you\u0027ll see the things you\u0027ll get for your monthly pledge. You can always move into a higher tier if you wish to get more. You\u0027ll also get more vote power for things I\u0027ll make when I make a poll. Good times!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you only making your stuff available here on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t like the idea of paywalls but I don\u0027t think I can avoid this. The simple thing is making artwork takes time and animations take a lot of time so if I want to make any kind of money, I need to make at least 1,280 USD each month from Patreon, which is minimum wage in Arizona, where I live. I don\u0027t expect to make anything close to that here but the simple fact of life for me here is I need to make money if I want to continue to do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will posts things to my FA account when I get around to making them and may post some things from Patreon there but my main focus is to make something stable enough so I can do that. I don\u0027t want to make my work exclusive to Patreon so be sure to keep up with what I do on FA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You All!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do decide to support me, just know you\u0027re doing me a huge favor as you get me closer to my goal. It proves to me that you care about what I do and want to see me be successful. You all have already done a lot for me. I do want to do this full time so spread the word and make sure this can happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I love meeting new people because that means I can make new friends, which I can always use more of. The more friends I get, the more people I can play Smash Bros with.
