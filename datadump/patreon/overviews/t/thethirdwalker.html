My name is Trey and I love stories. More specifically, I love creating, writing, and telling stories. All of these stories I want to share with you - so I will. Currently \u003cem\u003eLast Stop\u003c/em\u003e (a webcomic written by yours truly and drawn by the talented Hoyt Silva) is being released weekly every Friday over at Just Comics Group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck it out here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.justcomicsgroup.com/laststop\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLast Stop featured at Just Comics Group\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also write a couple of short stories a month - typically, they\u0027re all written in a single day and based off a single word prompt. It\u0027s a way to exorcise the ideas that generally haunt my head. I try to post at least two of those every month for your reading pleasure...or horror.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what you see, and feel so inclined, you can chip in as little as $1.00 a month to help me on my journey to becoming a full-time storyteller. All my webcomics, podcasts, and online dealings will be FREE.\u00a0Basically, I\u0027m a virtual street performer. I\u0027m doing all this for whoever wants to stop and take a look, be it a single person or a huge crowd, I\u0027m gonna be performing my heart out. Want to toss a buck into my virtual tip jar? I tip my virtual (and actual) hat to you! Every little bit given through your kindness goes to making my dreams a reality and allows me to spend more time writing and creating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m only just getting started, but I\u0027ve got a veritable laundry list of ideas and concepts just waiting to be created. Comics, short stories, podcasts, spec scripts - I plan on doing it all, and you (as a patron) will have a front row, behind the scenes seat.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
