They require a membership agreement prior to privileging you access into anything gaming relevant. Themmobros.com aims to change that by giving gamers a public archive for information, reviews, and guides, inviting all current and future gaming communities and guilds, who are unencumbered by the archaic notion of \u201cus against them\u201d, to come together and create something both constructive and sensible.\u003cbr\u003eThrough open communication we can develop stronger bonds, work tirelessly to better assist game developers with valued information in order to produce a greater finished product, and to aid both fellow gamers in honing their capabilities and content creators in gaining needed recognition. Engaging in theory crafting, strategic brainstorming, and to develop an enduring camaraderie by creating a singular, solidary, gaming entity for all, is what we envision.\u003cbr\u003eAll information collected, will be received on a voluntary basis and we will never insist on you providing us with anything that you do not wish to be conferred publicly. However, in keeping with our vision, we would hope that any and all collective efforts would not remain confined to any set individual, be it person or organization, as that would not be in the interest of THIS community.\u003cbr\u003eThemmobros.com is offering a site for accumulation, theorization, and the application of ideas and information (potential tongue twister.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eAccumulation\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u2013 the gathering and archiving of all information relative to the gaming intercommunity needs.
