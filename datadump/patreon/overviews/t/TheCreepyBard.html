    "summary": "Good day to you Lords and Ladies, I am David Anthony, The Creepy Bard.\u003cbr\u003eI am a wandering minstrel who is best known for singing songs of drunkenness, debauchery, and full frontal nudity. That being said I have a very wide range of family friendly songs including traditional Irish folk, medieval and renaissance music, and songs in languages I don\u0027t know. In addition, I also have a number of other people in my head who sing Appalachian folk, Yiddish folk, Hebrew liturgy, and Sea Shanties.\u003cbr\u003eEvery week (more or less) I post a video via YouTube in which I sing whatever song happens to suit my fancy that week, though sometimes the other people in my head will hijack the channel and other times I will play a game of \"Pick a Language\". \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI also travel the Northeastern United States performing at Renaissance Faires, Pirate Festivals, and other similar events. I also perform at my fair share of Irish pubs and bars. On rare occasions I will even venture beyond my usual territory and travel to some place foreign and exotic (like Florida).\u003cbr\u003eBy donating money to my cause, you will first and foremost be helping me justify my lifestyle choices to my mother (this IS a real job!). The money you donate will help me pay bills and rent so that I can afford to devote more time to producing content. Donations will also go toward improving my content by purchasing better quality instruments, cameras, microphones, editing software, and trampolines (trust me, they are vital). Of course, in the interest of full disclosure, I will admit that a portion of all donations will go to the Whiskey Apreciation Fund. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
