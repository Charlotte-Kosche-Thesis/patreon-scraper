(This is set in a fantasy setting)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea for \u0027Theris \u0026amp; Levana\u0027 was originally started 3 years ago. The first draft was meant to be in a webcomic format. Time went by and co-creators Hana Singer and Mo Woolf felt that a webcomic wasn\u0027t the way to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter exploring podcasts, illustrated comics, and again webcomics, it was decided that a Visual Novel was the way to go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch like a physical comic, each episode will be drawn by a different artist in their style in a rotation of these artists. Along with featuring editing work from Neil Singer and Music from DJ Ghuji\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging to this project will help support each artist, editor, writer, and person involved. We all have high aspirations for this comic, and we hope that you do too!\u003cbr\u003e"
