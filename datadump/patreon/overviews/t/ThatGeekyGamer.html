    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m That Geeky Gamer and welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you may have guessed from my name, I am a huge gamer. I\u0027m also a fairly big fan of films, TV and various other elements of so-called geek-culture, which is why I started this show. You see, if there\u0027s anything I love more than games and films, it\u0027s talking about games and films and that\u0027s pretty much what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my show you\u0027ll find game reviews, film reviews, top 10 lists, various unscripted ramblings and a few other bits and pieces. I discuss old stuff, new stuff, good stuff and bad stuff, pretty much whatever I feel like. I also do a bit of Let\u0027s Playing once in a while as well as the occasional Live Stream and I\u0027m always open to suggestions for more features or other things to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThing is though that while I don\u0027t think I will ever stop making these videos unless I absolutely have to, they don\u0027t necessarily bring in a very big income. Don\u0027t get me wrong, every view, sub, like and share helps me out and every single one of them is more appreciated than I could ever express properly, but a little extra funding certainly wouldn\u0027t hurt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, I will continue to make my videos no matter what and I have no intention of blocking off any significant content, but should you decide that my efforts are worth your time and/or support, any and all amounts you may be willing to pledge to this campaign will come in very, very handy indeed! Honestly, you have no idea how much it will mean!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I said though, this is in no way something you should feel obligated to do and all my videos will still be available for everyone to watch free of charge, but those who do decide to pledge to this campaign, will receive a few minor bonuses. None of these things are anything all that significant, but hopefully they may at least help show my appreciation and gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I certainly don\u0027t have any right to expect anything at all to come out of this campaign, I will still hope for the best and list a few milestone goals as well. None of these are necessarily set in stone though, meaning they are things that could happen before the estimated goal is reached or they may never actually happen at all. I\u0027m also more than open to any and all suggestions for what these goals could and/or should be so don\u0027t be afraid to share your opinions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, I only hope that you\u0027ll be able to enjoy my content and that if you do so to a reasonable degree, that you may consider throwing a dollar or two my way. I really can\u0027t stress enough how helpful any and all pledges made here truly will be, but trust me, one dollar is more than enough to have a significant impact. At the very least, it\u0027ll give me a big shot of motivation allowing me to try even harder to make more and better content for you to (hopefully) enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for checking out this page and for any and all potential support!\u003cbr\u003e"
