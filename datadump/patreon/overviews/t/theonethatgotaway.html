    "summary": "After the creation of emotions, two gods forever sealed away are \nmistakenly released from their confinement to be reincarnated into their\n descendants. Reenacting the epic struggle between life, death, \nknowledge and spirit in hopes of finally discovering the true meaning of\n life, the key to restoring the balance and saving the Multiverse from \ntotal destruction. Valion, a genetically created supergod and the \nreincarnation of the life god, gathers fragments of his past as he \ntravels the Multiverse gaining friends and abilities in search of a way \nto unlock the powers of life, death, knowledge and spirit he is destined\n to master. Valion wages his battle to stop Tyron, the reincarnation of \nthe death god, from destroying everything in existence no matter the \ncost and to restore balance in the Multiverse using the power of Love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n dream of a better world for the next generation to grow up and for all \nof us to live in. I would love to help make it a reality using my story.\n I believe it has the potential to open minds and help people understand\n what the true meaning of life is by instilling in people good morals \nand values. Live is a story about Living and everything else in the \nMultiverse. It is the epic saga about how conflicting emotions came to \nbe in existence and explains in detail how we deal with these emotions\n to possibly overcome anything we put our minds to. Live is an epic \nmartial arts action packed story, full of emotions that go deep into \ndiscovering what the meaning of life is like no other story ever before.\n It is the ultimate struggle between the gods of life, death, spirit and\n knowledge to save and maintain the eternal balance that controls the Multiverse and everything in existence from unnecessary chaotic emotions\n and total destruction. Throughout all the tragedy in the story, it \nmanages to stay light with a little comedic aspect brought on by our \nheroes general stubbornness, dumbness, arrogance, hunger and lack of \norientation. With limitless possibilities, the story is set throughout \nthe Multiverse and expands into multiple universes with different \nphysics to our known universe. Ever changing and evolving the characters\n will not always be wearing the same costumes, giving this story the \nflexibility and freedom to explore new looks, abilities and any story \nimaginable.With the possibility of unlimited crossover events into other universes. Death and resurrection play an integral part of the series \nand will be a returning factor making the story intriguing, spontaneous \nand unpredictable. Instilling in people the foundation of good morals as\n our characters learn from their mistakes, protect their loved ones and \nultimately save the Multiverse using the power of love. The series has \nthe possibility of ongoing but is separated into 4 chapters life, \nknowledge, spirit and eventually death. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will use the funds to \npurchase materials and fully produce and print all 24 pages of issue 1 +\n 2 pages of art. The first issue in an ongoing ground breaking comic \nbook series. As well as release a 60 second trailer of the Live \nanimation. I am dedicating this to everybody that has helped or will \nhelp me to achieve my goals, to my very ill mother and to all the \nmothers of the world. I would love to see it come to fruition so I may \nmake her proud and show her my story can change our multiverse for the \nbetter. Thank you for your time and thank you for your support I will use it wisely to try and share my story with anyone willing to listen and help the world become a better place one person at a time. I will use funds to purchase art supplies and take the time to release constant content. Hopefully one day reaching a goal of making a full 26 page comic and a 60 second animation to be able to distribute worldwide. To all my patrons for every pledge you will receive a free digital commission with a personal message from me and to my top patrons you will receive a free digital copy of the comic and a copy of the animation as well as many other periodic rewards like the possibility of having your own personalized comic or your own character designed. I will also take on any special requests for commissions in any context and I am always willing to work with exciting new people on wonderful projects, so don\u0027t be shy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
