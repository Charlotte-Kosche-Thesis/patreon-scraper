    "summary": "My career started in 1978 when I co-authored Trilaterals Over Washington with respected scholar Antony C. Sutton. Our book was the definitive analysis of the elitist Trilateral Commission and remains so today. The goal of the Trilateral Commission was to foster a \u003cem\u003eNew International Economic Order.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until several years ago that I discovered that the New International Economic Order was, in fact, warmed-over Technocracy from the 1930s. In fact, Technocracy is the only completely different economic model ever devised in the history of the world. If fully implemented, it will become a Scientific Dictatorship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, Technocracy is a resource-based economic system that uses energy as its currency. Since it was devised by scientists, engineers and technicians, it will be operated by them as well. Technocrats despise politicians of all stripes, and would summarily dismiss them all, if they could.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe United Nations bought into Technocracy when it devised Sustainable Development, or Green Economy. Today, Sustainable Development has been spread to all corners of the globe and has taken deep root. By 2020, I forecast that over 30% of the world\u0027s population will be living under Technocracy, and will be unable to escape it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015, after I published my definitive book\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Technocracy-Rising-Trojan-Global-Transformation/dp/0986373907/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top\"\u003eTechnocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation,\u003c/a\u003e I launched the web site Technocracy.News to chronicle the rise of Technocracy and to warn against its encroachment. In the last 12 months, there have been over 1 million unique visitors to Technocracy.News. While this is encouraging, it is still far short of the numbers needed to effectively push back against Technocracy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelieve it or not, Technocracy.News is the ONLY web site on the Internet that is dedicated exclusively to monitoring and reporting on Technocracy. This makes our mission even more urgent, which is precisely why we need your support and partnership to continue and to expand.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout patrons and readers like you, Technocracy.News will eventually fizzle and die. Perhaps someone else will take our place, but perhaps not.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
