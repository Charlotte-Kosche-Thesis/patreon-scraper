Your feedback is incredible valuable to me. Most of what we do here is decided by regular polls. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eGet my paid content\u003c/h3\u003e\nThis is my \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.cgtrader.com/gunslingerstudio\"\u003eshop\u003c/a\u003e. But once your lifetime pledge here on patreon fills up to $25, you can contact me to have half of it (sci-fi or fantasy stuff). At $50 you can get the other half. This will be a manual process for me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLicense to print and sell my models\u003c/h3\u003eThere are two ways you can print and sell my models. My patrons (no matter the level) are always welcome to print and sell. Non patrons can print and sell if they pay me 10% of the sales price.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMy history\u003c/h3\u003e\nI have been a hobby creator of 3D graphics for a long time, and a gamer for a bit longer than that. Now have come the time to take these interests into the world of home 3D printing. Terrain4Print has been creating 3D models to be printed on home 3D printers since mid 2016. The first thing published was a \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1644469\"\u003elow stone wall\u003c/a\u003e. It was published on thingiverse as a free download. I have since then continued to make terrain. Some of it get published on thingiverse and the rest goes to my shop. I would like to change that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAs I start with Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e I will focus more and more on releasing my models for free download. Ultimately, I want to release all my work free and wide. Also, I want to do this together with you, my patrons. Future projects will be decided by polls and on higher reward levels, you can even submit project ideas for the next poll.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHelp me create a vast library of free terrain models. Become my patron and I will forever be in your debt. I assure you my creativity and modeling skills will be put to good use, \n\u003cstrong\u003efilling your game board with terrain!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
