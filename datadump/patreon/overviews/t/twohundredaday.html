We are exploring the intensely weird and interesting world of the 70s TV detective show \u003cem\u003eThe Rockford Files\u003c/em\u003e. We review episodes of the show, then analyze how and why they work as great pieces of narrative and character-building.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaven\u0027t heard us yet?\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twohundredaday.fireside.fm/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCheck out the podcast here\u003c/a\u003e, and find a guide to the episodes we\u0027ve released so far at the bottom of the page.

In each episode of \u003cstrong\u003eTwo Hundred a Day\u003c/strong\u003e, we watch an episode, recap and review it as fans of the show, and then tease out specific elements from that episode that hold lessons for writers, gamers and anyone else interested in making better narratives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis takes time and energy! We\u0027re doing it because we want to, but as independent creators we also need to support ourselves with what we put out into the world. Your support here on Patreon translates directly into making the podcast better (through investing in equipment and taking critique directly from our audience), and more frequent (the more support we get, the more time we can devote to recording and releasing episodes!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the rewards listed to the right, all Patrons will get updates in-between Episodes to share what we\u0027re talking about next and any other news about the podcast. You get it first!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEpisode Guide\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe cherry-pick episodes and jump around in the series for our selections.
