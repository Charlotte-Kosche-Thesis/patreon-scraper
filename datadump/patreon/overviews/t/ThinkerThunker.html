    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey, I\u0027m ThinkerThunker!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor four, amazing years I was ThinkerThunker on Youtube, full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese were four of the best years of my life. I felt passionately about the research I was doing and the contributions I was making. As well as the connection I made with all of you through the comments. I tried my best to reply to all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I\u0027m not rich. And as cliche as it sounds, time is money. And four years is a LOT OF TIME to spend on a project. Especially when you\u0027re all but donating your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would guess that as ThinkerThunker I was paid on average about .10 to .20 cents per hour for all those hours worked on almost fifty videos made over a four year period. For this I was considered a sell-out by skeptics. Luckily none of it was done for them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do this research for myself, and for anyone else who burns to know the truth. And would gladly do it all again. But then at a certain point we all have to earn a living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy wife (Mrs Thunker) was right there with me through it all. We both felt the sacrifice was worth it. We both still feel that working on Society\u0027s oldest question: \"Are we alone?\" is as worthy as any endeavor man could tackle. And luckily we were able to afford to make the sacrifice, thinking that one day my Youtube channel would pay off and at least allow me to eek out a decent living while continuing my research. We were wrong about that one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo even after reaching my performance goals, with over 8 million views and 38,000+ Subscribers I had to walk away from doing this thing that I loved - from being ThinkerThunker to pursue other interests.\u00a0That was well over a year ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut some of you wouldn\u2019t have it, you reached out to me online or wherever you could find me and urged me to try again, but this time at Patreon.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, after about a year of kicking the Patreon idea around, I said OK. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am, willing to give this a try. If you think the research I\u2019m doing is valuable or even entertaining (I try to make them both) you can show your support for $1 a month. ($12 a year) That\u0027s all I\u0027m asking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help ensure that as new videos pop up that are worthy of all of our attention, or as new ideas occur to me, I\u2019ll be on them and sharing my findings with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos take me anywhere from two weeks to six months or longer to conceive, test, edit and put together. Your support will afford me this time. Without it ... there is no more ThinkerThunker.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all,\u003cbr\u003eTT\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Some might find it interesting that my Degree was in Computer Science. I\u0027m very left-brained when it comes to problem solving, approaching everything in a very logical, methodical way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then I\u0027ve been painting portraits and studying art, the human face and form, plus photography, since I was a child. So I\u0027m also very creative as well. And know when I\u0027m seeing a human, and when I\u0027m not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll that plus a good, working knowledge of\u00a0CGI, special effects and animation software gives me a very unique skill-set. Chances are if footage has been hoaxed or tampered with, I\u0027ll know how they did it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCombine all that with tons of patience, dogged determination an my own obsession with this research that stems from my own encounters, these are the tools necassary to help me find those little details or discover those little insights that for some reason have gone overlooked. And then my favorite part is sharing my findings with you.\u003cbr\u003e"
