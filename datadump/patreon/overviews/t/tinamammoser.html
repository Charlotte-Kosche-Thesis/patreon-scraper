You see, I\u0027m a bit of a geek. As well as being a working artist for nearly 20 years now (my full portfolio is \u003ca href=\"http://www.tina-m.com/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e), I also have degrees in physics and geology and am currently working on my MSc in space science and technology. Just for fun. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust to keep me completely busy and out of trouble, I have done talks on art \u0026amp; geology and art \u0026amp; astronomy for local societies, school groups, museums and charities. I\u0027ve spoken at the Hubble 25th Anniversary event at Essex Wildlife Trust, with a presentation colour in art and stars; at other astronomy events about the history of drawing in astronomy; and at the Scarborough Art Gallery museum about the connection of art and local geology. For two years I also ran an art and science gallery, Grejczik Gallery, in Scarborough.",
