    "summary": "Since 2007, \u003cem\u003eT.O.F.U. Magazine\u003c/em\u003e has been publishing vegan content from people around the world in an effort to showcase that there is an alternative. From interviews with activists such as Jo-Anne McArthur of\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/weanimals?ty=h\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWe Animals\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e and Dr. A. Breeze Harper of the\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sistahvegan.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSistah Vegan Project\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e to critical pieces on the need to eliminate the fat shaming, sexism, racism, and more that is prevalent in vegan messaging and organizations, T.O.F.U. continues to push buttons both within the vegan community and outside of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOriginally, the magazine was printed and sold mainly within Canada, but the move was made to a solely digital publication prior to the release of issue four. This change in format provided a number of benefits, and one of the biggest ones was a decrease in the production cost of each issue. Thanks to this, the digital version of the magazine has always been offered in a \n\u003ca href=\"http://tofu.limitedrun.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epay-what-you-can format\u003c/a\u003e to ensure accessibility to its message without many financial constraints. Not only that, a portion of the proceeds from advertising within each issue has also been provided to a number of recipients over the years through the \u003ca href=\"http://www.ilovetofu.ca/tag/t-o-f-u-grant/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eT.O.F.U. grant program\u003c/a\u003e. Along with this, the magazine has sponsored numerous veg festivals and events and continues to promote\u00a0the community around it whenever possible.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLuckily, the vegan community has been supportive of the magazine as well. Most recently, a \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2060548373/the-book-of-tofu\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKickstarter campaign\u003c/a\u003e was successfully funded to print an anthology of the magazine. Known as The Book of T.O.F.U., the publication was printed in Vancouver (British Columbia, Canada) on 100% post-consumer waste recycled paper in a carbon neutral, FSC certified facility and shipped to readers in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, with the eleventh issue nearly complete, the decision has been made to create a Patreon profile in the hopes of bringing it (and subsequent issues) to print*. Through Patreon, you\u0027ll be able to effectively subscribe to the magazine to ensure you never miss an issue, and your subscription will be directly supporting the continuation of the work T.O.F.U. does. Along with these benefits, using the Patreon platform ensures that you will only be charged when I print an issue, which should happen roughly 3-4 times a year.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePricing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough the digital version will remain available through the pay-what-you-can platform, the success of The Book of T.O.F.U., as well as the increase in other vegan publications, has shown that there is a demand for a tangible magazine, but the costs associated with such a thing are too large for me to risk personally.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLike any publishing project, small runs prove more costly than bigger ones. Along with this consideration, things such as shipping (I spent over $1,000 on shipping The Book of T.O.F.U. to backers) and the percentage taken by both Patreon (5%) and Paypal (2.9%) have been taken into account to determine a reasonable price per pledge level. That being said, I hope to be able to lower the basic subscription options in the future as the print run increases and things such as shipping are more predictable. With that in mind, as a patron, you\u0027ll be able to change your pledge at any point, and any changes I make to the levels will be noted on posts before they happen.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs always, my aim is to be open and honest with all of this, and I do that partially because I\u0027m once again looking for your help to take the next step with the magazine. Personally, I feel passionate that this magazine has a role within the vegan community (and even outside of it), and I want you to feel the same. Through your support, I know T.O.F.U. can be bigger and better than ever, and I look forward to seeing just how far we can go together.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you,\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRyan Patey\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEditor/Co-Founder\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*If the initial goal is not reached before the publication date of the next issue, then that issue will be released solely in a digital format and subscribers will not be charged."
