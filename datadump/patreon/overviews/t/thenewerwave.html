    "summary": "My name is \u003cstrong\u003eMichael Morrise\u003c/strong\u003e [like Crazy Old Maurice, but funny spelling]. Weird surname aside, I am a commercial music\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003estudent\u003c/strong\u003e, studio \u003cstrong\u003erecording technician\u003c/strong\u003e, improv comedy \u003cstrong\u003ekeyboardist\u003c/strong\u003e, casual open mic and studio\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003esinger\u003c/strong\u003e, and maverick\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003esongwriter\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy mission is as follows: I enjoy making people happy by creating \u003cstrong\u003eengaging, creative, high-quality musical content\u003c/strong\u003e, the vast majority of which is totally \u003cem\u003epro bono\u003c/em\u003e, because art humanizes communities and brings us together, et cetera.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne member of a forum to which I subscribe asked about profiting from music in the age of the Internet and free stuff\u2014and with good reason. The current artist-label model of the music industry is on its last legs. Someone else in the forum gave the rather snarky reply that he should \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eask Mozart how he did it\u003c/strong\u003e.\u201d But I think there is wisdom in the business model practiced by Classical and Romantic composers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComposers were sponsored by \u003cstrong\u003epatrons\u003c/strong\u003e - royalty, nobility, or clergy who liked their music and wanted more. Often it was \u003cstrong\u003esalary\u003c/strong\u003e and/or housing in exchange for \u003cstrong\u003eregular output\u003c/strong\u003e, as was the case with Haydn and the Esterh\u00e1zy dynasty. Sometimes it was \u003cstrong\u003ecommission\u003c/strong\u003e for a \u003cstrong\u003especific work\u003c/strong\u003e, as when the Philharmonic Society of London funded Beethoven\u02bcs \u003cem\u003eSymphony \u2116 9.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eFor all the beauty and passion of the great composers\u02bc art, for all the inspiration we feel when we hear H\u00e4ndel\u02bcs\u00a0\u003cem\u003eMessiah\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0Mozart\u02bcs\u00a0\u003cem\u003eRequiem\u003c/em\u003e, or Berlioz\u02bcs\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSymphonie fantastique\u003c/em\u003e, these composers were getting paid specifically to make music. Now that we\u0027re not all penniless peasants, everyone can become a patron, and thanks to the Internet, it\u0027s way easier to commission artists to make cool stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, know that I don\u02bct consider myself to be on par with The Greats, not by any stretch of the imagination. But I can certainly offer content that people will enjoy and even fund. Instead of taking out a mortgage-sized loan to travel to LA or NYC and record an album, I will start with you, my small and (hopefully) devoted fanbase, and grow my craft as the demand and resources appear. \u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s make music together!\u003c/strong\u003e"
