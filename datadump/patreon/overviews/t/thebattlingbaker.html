    "summary": "Well this is a crazy idea, but I\u0027m hoping it will be inspirational for all of us. By all, I mean for you lovely guys \u0026amp; gals to inspire you to head for your kitchen and get baking up a storm by trying out some of the recipes \u0026amp; videos I share with you, and for me to drive me on in pursuing my passion for baking but, more importantly, to engage in some much needed recovery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have just stumbled upon this page or you may have come over from my site, \u003ca href=\"http://www.thebattlingbaker.com\"\u003ewww.thebattlingbaker.com.\u003c/a\u003e On there I share recipes I have come up with myself, and there\u0027s a story behind the whole reason of the concept of the site. What is that story?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the twist. I have anorexia. Yes, takes some getting your head around doesn\u0027t it? I\u0027m not sure I fully understand it myself yet but the conclusion I\u0027ve drawn is that I got into baking initially through a desire to create. Next was a desire to at least come into contact with the thing that dominates my life; thinking about food, albeit in a negative way. Thirdly I believe I started to vicariously live out my desires by creating wonderful recipes and baking them up, passing them onto friends and family and watching them enjoy what I had created. Occasionally I get to try just the smallest amount of what I come up with and revel in success, especially if something on paper shouldn\u0027t work and does! If I fail it doesn\u0027t matter, I simply forget about it and think up something new - failures should never be a reason to give up in the kitchen, just something to learn from and take inspiration to improve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll those recipes, the ones that I come up with, can be found freely on the previously mentioned site. Here on my Patreon page I am starting something new!! A good friend suggested that, as I\u0027m not in a good place to be able to work, I take the time to start something that gives me focus and a chance to build a life again. He came up with the idea of exploring the baking culture of different countries of the world and to try baking some of their favourite cakes, pies and other baked produce and then sharing it with the rest of the world. He also suggested starting my own YouTube channel and tying it into the project - this is uncharted territory for me! I LOVED his suggestion and got to work, and so here we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is my \"Around The World\" project. I will use what resources I have to unearth the baking favourites from the countries of this planet of ours, then recreate them at home, and share them with you. I\u0027ll make videos explaining the processes and make them as fun as I can, and they\u0027ll all be available ONLY via my Patreon page. All I ask is for you to make a small $1 pledge per month. I\u0027ll make sure that at VERY LEAST I upload twice a month, however knowing my passion it\u0027s likely to be 3-4 times. Seriously, I\u0027m almost a baking addict!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really hope you\u0027ll enjoy what\u0027s to come - and I hope you\u0027ll all get baking along with me.\u003cbr\u003e"
