(We also previously dabbled in sketch comedy under the name Proper Villains.) We\u0027re currently tickled rosy to have maintained an unbroken update schedule of our show from May 2015 to Boxing Day 2016- but after a sixth month stretch of no opportunities to meet for a recording session (and being dissatisfied with the results of our experimental remote recordings), we finally had to break with our update schedule until we got another chance to collaborate in person.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFortunately, we\u2019ve had the chance to sneak in another marathon recording session to last us a ways into 2017. However, as anyone reading this is no doubt aware, the difficulty of organizing three or more adults for so much as a card game from within the same town is monumental. And so, assembling from ten states away for the brief opportunity to sneak in a recording session between work or travel is shaping up to become a source of what financial guru Aleister Crowley might have termed \u0027untenable financial duress.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, we have a lot of fun making this fell nonsense and would like to continue doing so-- and while MCIHAD itself is a fun project which we\u0027d like to see update weekly for years to come, we have several aspirations beyond Let\u0027s Plays alone! We have scripts for skits, LP-related wraparounds (like our Antarctica banishment arc but better organized), in-depth analysis of games, and even a comic or two! We\u0027d like to start producing this stuff under the Trouble Planet banner. But, obviously, cash ducats are the essential ingredient necessary to keep the funny flowing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks a lot for your support over the years, people! Hopefully we can Make a Thing happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--Trouble Planet"
