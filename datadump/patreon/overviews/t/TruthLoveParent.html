But it wasn\u0027t always that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.truthloveparent.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTruth.Love.Parent.\u003c/a\u003e in September of 2016 with absolutely no fan base, but early on -- even though I knew it was desperately necessary to publish a podcast dedicated to Christians who wanted to become intentional, premeditated, diciple-making parents -- I considered stopping the project due to lack of funding. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the Lord intervened and not only answered the gargantuan need of a consistent podcast hosting site (see\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/truthloveparent/episodes/2017-03-04T14_08_42-08_00\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTLP Snippet #4\u003c/a\u003e for the miraculous story!), but He also used our growing TLP Family of premeditated parents to confirm that we needed to continue our work . . . and take it to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we developed a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.truthloveparent.com/christian-parenting-social-media.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esocial media presence\u003c/a\u003e and started a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.truthloveparent.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e which we\u00a0hope will one day be\u00a0the premier hub for all that is parenting.

We also publish the occasional 5-minute TLP Snippet (\"\u003cem\u003eparenting wisdom in 5 minutes or less\u003c/em\u003e\"). But we\u0027d love to do more!\u00a0God\u0027s Word has everything we need for life and godliness, but Paul asks how will people hear without a preacher?\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.truthloveparent.com\"\u003eTruth.Love.Parent.\u003c/a\u003e is the tool we use to apply God\u0027s Word to a broader sphere of parents.

Our growing online family is so precious, but there\u0027s nothing more rewarding than connecting with you in real life. Workshops, messages, and family conferences are so valuable . . . there\u0027s really no substitute. Though churches are often able to give special offerings, your patronage will help me cover the costs that so often go uncovered: travel, lodging, and curriculum development. Team TLP would love to be able to blanket this glorious world with God\u0027s redemptive plan for our families!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.truthloveparent.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTruth.Love.Parent.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the beginning we set out to do-nothing more than publish for an audience of One . . . and if other people could grow and learn from TLP, so much the better. But God is pleased to introduce us to a truly international audience (\u003cem\u003ewe have listeners in over 70 countries\u003c/em\u003e - many of which are closed to the Gospel), so, when you invest in TLP, \u003cem\u003eyou\u0027re investing in the family\u00a0health of Christians across the globe\u003c/em\u003e!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m super excited about the future of TLP, and can\u0027t wait for you to be a part of it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for loving God and trusting us to be faithful messengers of His Truth,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAMBrewster \u0026amp; TeamTLP\u003cbr\u003e"
