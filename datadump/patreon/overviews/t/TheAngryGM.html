    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m the Angry Game Master! I give RPG Advice with Attitude!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery week at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://theangrygm.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTheAngryGM.com\u003c/a\u003e, I deliver tons of quality gaming content that people absolutely love because I\u0027m the best damned GM to ever walk this green Earth. Seriously. But I can\u0027t do it alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past few years, The Angry GM site has grown into a massive undertaking. I provide, detailed, in-depth analysis of various topics for Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons and other table-top RPG game masters. From a detailed description of the most basic of GMing skills to advanced analysis of the rules and how to change them to suit your needs. If you\u0027re still learning the ropes, you\u0027ll find articles about running games, building adventures, starting campaigns, and designing your own worlds. If you like to rip apart the game and make it your own, you\u0027ll find wodges of custom rules and design insights. It isn\u0027t hyperbole to say that TheAngryGM.com is literally the most important site about table-top role-playing games ever! It\u0027s the reason Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax invented Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge of support ensures regular, weekly releases of full-length feature articles covering a broad range of gaming topics. One week, you\u0027ll learn How to F$\u0026amp;%ing Run a Game. Next week, you\u0027ll learn how to Hack Your F$\u0026amp;%ing Game or you might find a diatribe on a random gaming topic; basically a bunch of Random Bulls$\u0026amp;%. Beyond that, your support helps ensure other content like the Ask Angry advice column, the Let\u0027s Build a Megadungeon project, and the weekly podcast collaboration project Digressions \u0026amp; Dragons keep happening. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can you make all of that happen? Easy. Decide what those feature-length articles are worth and pledge that. Are they worth $1? $3? $5? $50? At the end of the month, you\u0027ll be charged for each article released that month, TO A MAXIMUM OF FOUR. You will never be charged for more than four articles each month, even if I crank out extra content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, what if you want to pledge less than $1 an article? What if your money is tight and you just want to drop a small monthly pledge like a dollar a month? You can do that by setting a maximum when you make your pledge. That\u0027s up to you. The reason I\u0027m not charging you on a monthly basis is simple: I don\u0027t want to be paid unless I\u0027m doing the work. If I don\u0027t put out articles, I don\u0027t get paid. Fair is fair. I don\u0027t believe in taking money just to keep a site alive if it never updates. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that will never change. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, if you do pledge a certain amount per article for four articles a month, I want to offer you a special thank you. So check out the various pledge-level rewards when you decide how much my content is worth. Those are just little things, though. Because I figure the best thing I can do to say thank you is to keep cranking out quality content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading all of this s$\u0026amp;% and thanks for your support.\u003c/div\u003e"
