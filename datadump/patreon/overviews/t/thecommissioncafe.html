    "summary": "The Commission Cafe, or just Commission \nCafe, is a new take on art sites. Instead of just showcasing ones own \nart, we celebrate the creation of this art, specifically in the form of \ncommissions. Commissions allow people with ideas to materialize and \nrealize those ideas when they might not have the means to do so. The \nCommission Cafe sets those people up with artists that will take on \ntheir commission, and the artist will be promptly paid. So, it could be \nsaid that The Commission Cafe is for two groups of people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst\n and foremost, The Commission Cafe is for commission artists. Other \nsites might allow for users to sell their art, but none, including art \nsites, focus on the commission experience. The Commission Cafe lets \nartists display previous work as a portfolio, as well as their preferred\n styles, mediums, will\u0027s and won\u0027ts, pricing, and all sorts of other \nuseful aspects a seller might want to portray. That user can collect \nmetrics on how their commissions are doing, how many visitors are coming\n to their studio, how much revenue they\u0027re actually making, and more. \nUsers can manage orders just like they could an online store such as \nEtsy or Ebay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Commission Cafe is also for those \nlooking to hire an artist to perform a commission. Users can browse \nthrough the portfolios of artists who had previously done commissions, \nview by price, style, or any other metric that can be objectified. They \ncan make the best choice for them in an easy to use format that makes \nthe consumption of media quick and to the point. We\u0027re not deviant art \nwhere the purpose is to collect as much art as you can. We\u0027re not Etsy, \nwhere the sole purpose is to sell. We\u0027re a connecting entity, and users \nform that connection. Users form the connection from idea to artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow do we stand out?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe do not take a cut from what an artist sells as a commission. Our monetization strategy doesn\u0027t need it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMuch of the value in our platform comes from the way we do make money, value added services. These are optional bells and whistles you can add to your account to make selling easier. You are running your own business, and we want that to succeed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArt is art, there\u0027s no need to try and convince us of what that means. So long as it follows community guidelines and local laws, we will do our best to support you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe will provide as many services as we possibly can to artists to streamline the experience. Over the past few months we\u0027ve collected a large amount of feedback from the arts community regarding what they like and don\u0027t like about selling art online, and that forms the core of our mission, and our platform.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eOther info:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe are registered as a LLC in the state of Texas, USA. Our ID number is 32060872085\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe have no employees. The Director of Engineering does all work in regards to programming, business, and financials. Two additional partners help with marketing and design work and own stakes in the company.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe currently have 0 revenue and no funding. This is a first time venture for us, and we hit the ground running, so not all the ins and outs of startups are being followed, but there is no true rule for that anyway. All expenses are paid out of pocket.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll works that you see as company assets are paid for by the company and we own the intellectual property rights. Art theft is something we take very seriously, and will make every effort to correct.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
