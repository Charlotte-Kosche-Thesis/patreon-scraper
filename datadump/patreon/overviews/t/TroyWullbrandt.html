    "summary": "I\u0027m Troy Wullbrandt, a college student from California making YouTube videos about movies on my channel Rise Of The Kumquat (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/RiseOfTheKumquat67)\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/c/RiseOfTheKumquat67\u003c/a\u003e ) \u003cbr\u003eThe the channel was created initially with the mindset of wanting to talk positively about film, simply because I noticed how all these popular channels seemed to do nothing but bash whatever was out at the time. Of course some movies deserve the thrashing that they take, and I\u0027ve come to realize over my first year of making content was that the last thing Hollywood needs is another cheerleader, but the ultimate goal of this channel is to show people \u003cem\u003ewhy\u003c/em\u003e something is great or terrible rather than \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e \u003c/i\u003esomething is great or terrible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt seems like every other week a new series evolves on the channel, but here\u0027s a brief taste of what you can expect:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Don\u0027t You LOVE _____?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiQCcdKJSXI\u0026amp;t=3s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiQCcdKJSXI\u0026amp;t=3s\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe original series that I wanted to get going on this channel. There are so many movies/TV shows/short films out there that are either under appreciated or receive outright hatred that is completely unjustified. This is the series where I talk about why I love (or at least kinda like) these films/TV shows/shorts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShort Film Reviews\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqzeoOiesK8\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqzeoOiesK8\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know what everyone is this genre is doing? \u003cbr\u003eLong form film reviews. \u003cbr\u003eYou know what almost nobody is doing?\u003cbr\u003eLong form \u003cem\u003eshort film\u003c/em\u003e reviews.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a fan of the videos that The Nostalgia Critic, JonTron, and Say Goodnight Kevin put out and I\u0027m also a fan of the skits and short films that used to flood YouTube but have now largely been replaced with let\u0027s plays and reaction/commentary videos. So this series is calling attention to those who are actively trying to become filmmakers as well as pointing out what works and doesn\u0027t work in their projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s Fix/Let\u0027s Make\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq2FM65Vrk0\u0026amp;t=169s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq2FM65Vrk0\u0026amp;t=169s\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes a movie comes out and it\u0027s not really good, but it could have been fantastic. Other times, a movie is announced and I have a really clear vision for what I want it to look like when it comes out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis series was largely inspired by Belated Media\u0027s Star Wars prequels videos and 75% of the videos that Bandit Incorporated puts out. I think I\u0027m a pretty good storyteller, so in these videos, I set out to show how exactly these projects could have been/could be great films.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFilm Lab\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIO1yCYnwIE\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIO1yCYnwIE\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRather than outright review films, I often like to talk about what aspects of the film made them great. Typically people format these sorts of videos into video essays, but this isn\u0027t a typical channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMovie/Trailer Reviews\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT9iDG0Op98\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT9iDG0Op98\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though I pride myself on keeping the channel unique, I will occasionally review movies and trailers in a more traditional format.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChristian Videos\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QPEWCHKnPA\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QPEWCHKnPA\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy faith is a huge part of my life and occasionally I get the chance to talk about Christianity in film. Like when Hume Lake releases a trailer for their newest summer film, I find Christian themes in Doctor Strange, or when a Christian film does something unfathomably stupid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFun With Editing\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5V7Lxz9Ykk\u0026amp;t=69s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5V7Lxz9Ykk\u0026amp;t=69s\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eEditing is a tedious chore. Except for when I\u0027m editing something stupid and often Star Wars-related, then it\u0027s fun. These are videos that I make when I\u0027m bored that have absolutely no intellectual value, but people tend to think they\u0027re funny.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Donate To This Campaign?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI would like to improve my content (a lot of these videos don\u0027t have great visual or audio quality), but most of the income from my regular job is paying for school, gas, food, etc. I recently bought a better microphone, so everything from this campaign will go directly towards getting a new camera, lighting equipment, better software, etc.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not a full-time YouTuber, the channel is mostly a hobby at this point, but I try to get a video out every week. While this Patreon account isn\u0027t my primary source of income, anything that you can donate will go a long way towards helping me produce better content for the channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis campaign is more of an investment in what this channel could be rather than a tip jar for previous content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions, feel free to ask and thank you for all of your support (even if all you can give is a few minutes of your time).\u003cbr\u003e"
