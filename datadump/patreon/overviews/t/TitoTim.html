I moved over here on Valentine\u2019s Day 2013. I am \nchronicling my move and immersion into the Filipino lifestyle. I am a disabled\nNavy veteran just enjoying my life in Iloilo, Philippines.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy wife and I would love for you to join us on our adventures around the\nPhilippines.  If you enjoy our videos you can be a monthly donor. Give as\nmuch or little as you want, and for as many months as you wish.  The more\nsupporters I get the more we can show you of this amazing nation of over 7,000\nislands! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank for viewing. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy YouTube channel: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/TitoTimVideos\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/c/TitoTimVideos\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I Using Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e3 Main Reasons\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy main goal is to do more\n     charity work and, quite frankly, that takes funding. Monthly sponsorship will allow me\n     set up regular charity events. Travel,\n     video equipment, and editing time also add up a lot. So show some support\n     and get more content.  Even a small contribution would be a big boost\n     to my morale - and encourage me to create more videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMany of you guys have asked if\n     there was a way to support me and be more involved. As an option for some\n     of my biggest fans Patreon allows us to work together to help the kids\n     here, as well as keep us connected. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYouTube protection\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Lately YouTube has been doing some strange things\n     such as failing to notify people \u0026amp; unsubscribing fans without their\n     knowledge. There is almost no creator support or way to contact YouTube if\n     there is a problem. Patreon allows me to have an exclusive platform to\n     stay in contact with my greatest fans like you. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow Much Should I Support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou decide how much you want to\nsupport, as low as $1 a month. It is setup up as a monthly subscription and you\ncan easily cancel at any time.\u00a0 On my newer videos there is also a link to a single gift via Paypal. In case monthly sponsorship is not the option you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eCan I Still Watch Your Videos Free?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYes, all the videos I put up on\nYouTube will always be free In fact Patreon will allow me to improve the\nquality, consistency and variety of videos I upload to YouTube. Sponsorship is\ntotally voluntary, but will help me provide a lot more, and better, content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eCan I Stop My Subscription?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYes, if you decide it\u0027s not for you\nanymore, or money is tight, please feel free to opt out. You can always come\nback later if you want. Or don\u0027t, it is completely up to you. I don\u0027t hold a\ngrudge - we can still be friends ha ha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Do You Make Videos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nam making videos for fun and entertainment. I have been told by many\nsubscribers that they appreciate my positive outlook. I try to be honest about\nthe Philippines - not overly negative, but no rose tinted glasses either. By\nsponsoring me not only will you give a huge boost to my morale, but allow me to\ndo more charity work, get better gear, and do more traveling. Thus creating\nmuch more content!\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/TitoTimVideos\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
