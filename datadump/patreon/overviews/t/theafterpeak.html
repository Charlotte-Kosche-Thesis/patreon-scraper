Recently, I just started my own professional page on Instagram and Facebook to promote products and services for the hiking and outdoor enthusiast. I wanted to be an inspiration to those who want to start traveling, giving people useful tips on where to go and what to do. Through my posts and blogs I hope to be a guide or inspire those who are willing to take a chance and get out of their comfort zone. I want people to be able to see what I see as I explore these uncharted territories for the very first time through my adventures. With your support I know I can accomplish this and make this dream a reality."
