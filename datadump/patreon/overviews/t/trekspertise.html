    "summary": "In the same way that the Odyssey defines ancient Greece and chivalric romances define Medieval Europe, science fiction defines our modern society. It is one of the few forms of storytelling that is acutely aware of the changes that occur through the passage of time and, as a result, has become one of the most popular, most interesting ways for our society to examine itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of its massive popularity, Star Trek is uniquely positioned to serve as a lens through which to understand the larger world of science fiction, and, through science fiction, our own contemporary society. The goal of Trekspertise is to explore science fiction. As a part of that exploration, we will consider many topics, both connected to the Star Trek multiverse and points beyond. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that relying on advertising to support Trekspertise will damage the conversation - and will likely annoy you, the viewers. Consider supporting the series and help Trekspertise stick to its original educational, ad-free mission. The internet will thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdate: we are now the proud recipients of the Europa Award from the Miami International Science Fiction Film Festival. Additionally, Katie and Kyle came home with SciFi Citizen Awards! Quite an honor =)"
