Just share it with everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003ePODCASTS -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/ThoseGuysontheRadio\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/c/ThoseGuysontheRadio\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose Guys on the Radio have been podcasting for over 4 years now, and have logged over 600 hours discussing a variety of topics! They have podcasted on Professional Wrestling, Comic Books, Anime, Manga, Video Games, Movies, and Television Shows. Their love of such a large amount of things results in passionate discussions, whether they liked it or not!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of their newest weekly shows is Keikaku Korner, where they discuss the newest anime news!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eLET\u0027S PLAYS/GAMING CONTENT -\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7JrTLwgtra9kaapOY7YEcA\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose Guys Play have been playing video games their entire lives, but they have been doing it on camera for nearly 3 years, and they have played a variety of games! They have a love for both retro and current games! Their expertise, or lack their of (Matt is terrible), make for some interesting gameplay.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on what tier you support, you can get in on the action too! You could suggest what game Those Guys play, although we cannot guarantee which hosts would be playing, we can almost guarantee that we will play said game. We cannot guarantee beating the game in one episode, but we can negotiate certain aspects of the video if you email us at thoseguysontheradio@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother thing we could do is give you a shout out on the show! Depending on what tier you choose, you can become a sponsor for Those Guys Play, and we will say your name on the show in one episode a week for an entire month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eTG PRODUCTIONS -\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBGXBrSjVhA8KQ5olK1rLBQ\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTG Productions is a relatively newer channel that allows fans of Those Guys on the Radio and Those Guys Play to take a look behind the scenes and see the making of some of their favorite episodes, but that\u0027s not all you\u0027ll get here! On this channel, you can see Matt do video reviews of different films, anime, and even Tokusatsu! You can also catch Toku Trivia and other oddball skits on here as well!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eF.A.Q.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGeneral Questions\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What if I don\u0027t want something associated with that tier, and I am just giving you money out of the goodness of my heart(s)?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Then just tell us when you pay for that tier, or through our email! When we get in contact with you, you can easily tell us if you don\u0027t want something in said tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Hey, it says I have to pay every month! What gives?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Please cancel your monthly subscription right away after paying for an item/service, unless you really DO want to support us every month! Patreon assumes that you want to subscribe no matter what, but we understand if some of you just want us to make a certain video or podcast only.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePodcast/Gaming Content\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Does this mean that you aren\u0027t going to do free Podcasts/Gaming Content anymore?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: It doesn\u0027t mean that at all! We\u0027re just letting you guys decide what we talk about/play! While some restrictions may apply (we\u0027ll get to that if it becomes a problem), we can talk about/play anything! The only thing we ask when it concerns long-running shows (Steven Universe, Naruto, Bleach) is that you tell us if you want us to do a certain season or movie or something like that. And when it comes to games, we cannot play the entire game in one video. We\u0027ll talk more about it if we get to it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: When I choose something for Those Guys to Podcast on/Let\u0027s Play, do I get to choose the hosts?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Sadly, we cannot guarantee requests on who is podcasting/playing the game, because not all of us live as close to each other as we would like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Do you accept game donations? Can I buy you a game/system?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Yes we do! Email us at thoseguysontheradio@gmail.com and we will sort something out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Do you guys need video editors?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Yes we do! If you want to help out, send us a message at thoseguysontheradio@gmail.com. The reason why certain videos take so long to come out (be they Podcast videos on our Those Guys on the Radio Channel, Let\u0027s Plays, or other reviews) is because it takes so long to edit the footage, and the only person editing those is the same one writing this post! So your help will definitely be appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote from Matt: Hi, I want to thank all of you for visiting the page. Even if you can\u0027t donate, just share the page wherever you can!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
