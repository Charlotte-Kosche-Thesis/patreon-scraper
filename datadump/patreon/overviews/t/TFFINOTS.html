    "summary": "A podcast for the true, die-hard Michigan State Basketball fan. Sam \u0026amp; Rod provide in-depth analysis and commentary on MSU (and B1G) hoops and recruiting with a level of detail that you will not find elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe publish post-game shows after every game, as well as weekly preview episodes for the matchups to come. Our show focuses mostly on Spartan basketball and recruiting, but we also go around the B1G conference and country to look at the opposition. Rod will, on occasion, provide scouting of Michigan high school and Midwest AAU players.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we love doing this show, we do it in our spare time and pay production and research costs out-of pocket. Between doing prep, recording, editing, and producing, this show can take five to eight hours per week during the season, and both of us work full-time. Add to that the costs of equipment, software, subscriptions to advanced statistics services (KenPom and Synergy) and hosting, and you can understand that this project is a part-time job for us. Your subscription will help make this whole process sustainable for the long-term.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur post-game shows will remain free. What we\u0027re offering for those who choose to subscribe for $2 per month is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn-depth game previews for almost every MSU basketball game.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStand-alone recruiting episodes (5-6 per year).
