    "summary": "I\u0027m \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/desdeotromar\"\u003eJamie Berrout\u003c/a\u003e, author of a handful of books and co-editor/designer of \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://a.co/5WhBr6H \"\u003eNameless Woman: An Anthology of Fiction by Trans Women of Color\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. In the past, I\u0027ve written about the lack of publishing opportunities for trans women and how this parallels the general lack of opportunities available to us in life; and I\u0027ve done some work, like with the anthology, to help change things so that trans women get to write, find support through writing, make some money at it, and have a better chance of surviving this world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this Patreon to fund a booklet series that is a continuation of those efforts. As part of this series, published under the imprint of the \u003ca href=\"http://transwomenwriters.org/\"\u003eTrans Women Writers Collective\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0027ll be publishing a new booklet of writing by a different trans woman each month. By becoming a patron, you\u0027ll be subscribed to the series and each month you\u0027ll receive a new booklet in the mail. Each month will bring something different, so one month you might get thirty pages of speculative short fiction, the next month a chapbook of experimental poetry, and then perhaps a piece of long-form journalism or even an erotic novella that doubles as a meditation on depression and anxiety. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn more concrete terms, each month you\u0027ll be billed and I\u0027ll divide those funds three ways: one part to cover the costs of printing and shipping the booklets (about $150); a second part to cover the payment owed to that month\u0027s contributing writer, which starts at $200; and, the third, an equal payment of $200 to me for editing, designing, printing, binding, shipping, etc. If this Patreon ever starts to make more than that amount, the $550 that would be required just to recover the booklet series\u0027 costs each month, I\u0027ll be able to (1) increase the amount I pay future contributing writers, (2) pay advances (cash grants paid up front with no strings attached) to writers who wouldn\u0027t be able to create work otherwise, (3) pay trans women artists to use their art for the booklet covers, (4) try out different, more innovative ways of printing and assembling the booklets, or (5) maybe pay myself enough to account for the truly vast time commitment each month\u0027s booklet will require. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore details on this soon, but here\u0027s a preview of the series\u0027 early publishing schedule: First up, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCollected Stories \u003c/em\u003eby Catherine Kim\u003c/strong\u003e, which ships May 1st.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5790fe562994cad334831ba7/t/5ac281a06d2a734593e15477/1522696630100/booklet0%2C+digital+cover.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso in the works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eShort Speculative Fiction by \u003ca href=\"http://gillian-ybabez.com/\"\u003eGillian Ybabez\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePoems by \u003ca href=\"https://gumroad.com/teddywasnthere\"\u003eKierra\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwo Stories by \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esdras_Parra\"\u003eEsdras Parra\u003c/a\u003e (trans.
