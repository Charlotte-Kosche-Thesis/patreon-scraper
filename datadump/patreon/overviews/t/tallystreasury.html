    "summary": "Hi everyone! I\u0027m Tally, and I make things. Lots of things. I\u0027m always in the middle of at least half a dozen projects, with a head stuffed with more craft ideas yet to be realized.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating things makes my world go round - it brings me joy and satisfaction, and I want to share that with you. Maybe you\u0027re:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- a\u00a0beginner crafter who doesn\u0027t know quite where to start or what kind of glue/scissors/paper to use\u003cbr\u003e- a\u00a0competent crafter looking for new ideas\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0a genius crafter in one particular area, who wants to learn a new skill like sewing or jewelry making\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0absolutely never going to DIY anything ever again after that horrible incident with the superglue in 5th grade (and also last week), but you love looking at other people\u0027s projects\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhichever category you fit into, there will be something for you here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI post new tutorials once to twice a month - those are what I\u0027m asking for donations for. Between tutorials I sometimes post about other craft ideas and inspiration, recent non-tutorial projects I\u0027ve done, or about why glitter is among the greatest evils known to humankind - those are freebies!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTutorials take a lot of time \u0026amp; materials to create. I once tried to make my way in the world as a professional crafter, now I simply try to squeeze it in between day-jobbing and chores and other being-an-adult things. Free time is increasingly eaten up by commission work - I love those projects and I\u0027m grateful for them, but I do want to be able to keep creating tutorials.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money you donate will help me afford (quite literally, haha) the time to keep making tutorials, which will keep my skills sharp and growing and, I hope, help me to gradually pursue my dreams of being creative professionally and full time. It will also help me purchase the necessary craft supplies, and perhaps invest in some new tools and materials to delve into even more types of crafting. And let\u0027s be honest, it\u0027ll also help me buy wine for those days when the sewing machine is being a %*$@# and the glue spilled everywhere and every project I touch is just going straight to hell. It happens to everyone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
