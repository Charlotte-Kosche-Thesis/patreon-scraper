Thanks for checking out my Patreon page. This is where you can come to support the reincarnation of The Inside Track by Jeremiah Davis and coverage of dirt and asphalt racing (primarily) in Eastern Iowa and surrounding areas by becoming a patron through small monetary contributions on a monthly basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s important to note that your contributions aren\u0027t required, but will help in sustaining the new website and helping with logistical costs. Basically, with your help, I\u0027ll be able to get back to the racetrack and covering the weekend warriors who support weekly racing and traveling series in Iowa and other tracks in neighboring states.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy racing coverage will not be subscription-based or behind a paywall. You\u0027ll be able to access the website at any time. The Patreon page is just a way for you to help keep the coverage alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love racing, I love the Eastern Iowa racing community and I can\u0027t wait to get back to the track and continue the Driver Rankings, following IMCA, USRA, USMTS, Big 8 Series and NASCAR racing as it rolls through Iowa. Thanks for checking out the page, making a contribution - and I look forward to seeing you at the races!"
