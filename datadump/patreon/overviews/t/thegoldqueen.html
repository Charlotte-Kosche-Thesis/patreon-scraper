I had already finished the raiding and PVP content\navailable at that time, on main and alt characters, and was looking\nfor more.   I soon became famous in my guild, and then on my small\nserver for being rich, people always asking me how, and I shared\ntips, and that\u0027s how I started writing it down at a blog.   That was\n2010.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, back in about 2007, I bought my\nfirst and only world of warcraft gold guide.  I was curious.  Did\nthis guy really know stuff that I didn\u0027t?  The answer was sort of\nyes, sort of no.  I already knew the basics, I just didn\u0027t know the\nnames for them, or the best way to use them, or how to choose one\ntype of gold making over another type.\u00a0I was already making thousands of gold,\nbut he was promising much more.  He helped me organise myself and\nchange my focus from raiding to gold making. Since then, I\u0027ve been\nlearning constantly. I\u0027ve watched prices rise and fall, I\u0027ve seen\ngold bloggers come and go, youtubers come and go, the rise of\nlivestreaming.  I\u0027ve seen the number of professional gold guides\nalmost obliterated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make a members-only\nvideo-and-pdf warcraft gold guide.  No, scrub that. \u003cstrong\u003eI want to make\nthe best ever warcraft gold guide.\u003c/strong\u003e  I\u0027ll bring together the farming\ninformation, with my business degree expertise, and my ten years of\nexperience.  \u003cstrong\u003eTo do that, I got to dream big.\u003c/strong\u003e  I got to take ten years\nof knowledge and blogging and make it all into one beautiful monster.\n I want to get this released before Legion comes out, so that people\ncan prep for the new Warcraft expansion and get into Legion with at\nleast a million gold each.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have to learn affiliate software,\nmembership software, video creation, wordpress, email, cloud file\nhosting, lots of things behind the scenes.\u00a0In short, I\u0027m gonna need some help and\nsome support.  I think I can just about do this on my own.  But with\nyour help, I\u0027m much more likely to succeed. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this affect my current work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not charging for The Gold Queen,\neverything will still be free. I\u0027m just asking for help.  Because I\nwant to move above and over what I\u0027m doing. Once I\u0027ve finished making\nLegion Gold, then I\u0027ll be able to dedicate more time to regular free\nstuff.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will your patronage do to help me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: initial;\"\u003eI could afford childcare.
