    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eYour Fate Awaits...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI offer intuitive tarot card readings, tea leaf readings, rune castings,\n dream interpretation, charm making, and spellcasting services in \nperson, via phone, email, and Facebook messenger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strive to enlighten, enrich, and inspire my clients to go out and live\n a confident, joyful life. My hope is that my clients will take the \nresults of their reading to heart as \ngentle suggestions for how to live their best life. I fully believe in \nfree will and that fate is not set in stone. I hope that my clients will\n take their readings and use them to create the future they desire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy tarot journey began as a teenager. I was curious, a tad rebellious, and more than a little bit skeptical. But I wanted to believe. So I bought my first deck and started doing readings for myself, then my friends and family. Eventually I had casual acquaintances and strangers asking me for readings and laying their hearts out over the cards. I realized then that I could use this tool as a way to help people and as a form of service to others. I don\u0027t call myself a psychic, but I do trust my intuition and the messages that the cards bring to the table. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing curious, I didn\u0027t stop with learning tarot. I learned about all sorts of divination from reading tea leaves (remarkably accurate and fun) to the i-ching (which I quickly gave up since it made me want to pull my hair out). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently decided to join the 21st century and start offering my services online, which has worked out far better than I could have dreamed. And here we are. \u003cbr\u003e"
