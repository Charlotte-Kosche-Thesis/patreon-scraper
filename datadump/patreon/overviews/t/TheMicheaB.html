While I write about multiple topics, my main focuses are on transgender issues, debunking incorrect information regarding transgender peoples, and bringing to light the societal issues often overlooked due to the pervasiveness of hyper and toxic masculinity in society. I speak from the position of both a woman (having lived as one for over 30 years) and as a man (came out in 2014) in the hopes of showing what I\u0027ve been able to see by standing on both sides of the divide. Using stories to convey my messages, I work to incorporate information while drawing my reader in with the character\u0027s emotions and sensations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also enjoy writing fiction, both original and fan creations, many of which can either be found on this site, or through the link under my picture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently going to college at Portland State for my English degree, after having received my Associate of the Arts with a focus in psychology from Rogue Community College in 2015.\u003cbr\u003e",
