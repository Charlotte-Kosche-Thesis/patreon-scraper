My name is Scott Butner, but some people know me as the Picture Fairy because I tend to show up and capture professional quality images for people and organizations who can\u0027t afford to hire a professional photographer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I retired from a 29 year career as an environmental research scientist in 2013, I looked forward to resuming my FIRST career -- as a professional photographer. \u00a0 I had spent a few years working as the team photographer for the Seattle Seahawks and the Seattle Sounders back in the late 70\u0027s so figured I could build upon that resume.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I leased a studio, and hung out my shingle as a portrait and family photographer -- but the truth is, what I do best is telling stories with my photos, and sharing those stories with my friends on social media.\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut telling stories doesn\u0027t pay the rent or buy groceries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo along comes Patreon, and provides a way.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re reading this far, you already have a pretty good idea of how this works:\u00a0\u00a0 Do you enjoy my photos?\u00a0 Want to see more posts from interesting places and behind the scenes looks at interesting people?\u00a0\u00a0 Please consider contributing to the cause -- every contribution helps keep the Picture Fairy out on the road, capturing moments that we all can share in.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
