    "summary": "I\u0027ve been leading a team of volunteers to make Christian games since 2003. Our flagship project is Visions, a Christian MMORPG. Players can access the Visions alpha right now, and play the game as we develop it. We were greenlit for Steam in 2016 but have run into some roadblocks that have prevented us from getting Visions launched on Steam, primarily related to our programmers having to focus on paying bills and not being able to work on Visions like they were before. So I\u0027m coming to you, the player community, to ask you to support our team so we can make this game for you. We have the team and the skills, but not the time or the funds to work on this in the dedicated manner that it requires to do a good job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s what we want, we want to do a good job. We want Visions to be a fun place where people can gather and interact and play together. We want to make a game that makes the world a better place. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe the world needs more games like Visions because games teach people things. Games teach morals - or immorality. Games create an environment for friendships to grow - or be broken. Games teach life skills - or nonsense. Games provide an escape from the stresses of life - or they create stress. In Visions we want to teach people morals, strengthen friendships, teach life skills (like cooking), and provide a safe place online for people to escape the stress of life and seek spiritual refuge. Games like Visions can make the better place because they can improve people\u0027s lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisions isn\u0027t the only game we are working on. We have a couple of VR games, a phone application, and some other smaller Unity3D projects on the sideline as well. Mostly we work on these side projects when we can\u0027t work on Visions. Part of the motivation for working on the smaller projects is that they might bring in some revenue for the company to work with so we can pay our developers to work full time on Visions. Without revenue, we have to seek jobs with other companies in order to pay the bills and expenses. We\u0027d like for game development to become our full time job instead. Will you help us?\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Heaven\u0027s Blessings Tiny Zoo, LLC. is the creator of family friendly games with a Christian theme. Some of our games are overtly Christian, some only with subtle hints, and some aren\u0027t games at all but are more educational or edifying in nature. Our flagship project is the Christian MMORPG Visions that is the focal point of this Patreon campaign. Visions is an historical game with heavy focus on tradeskills, quests, and exploration. We have used the actual satellite data of the Mediterranean basin to create the terrain at approximately 1/18th scale. We have researched the historical locations of the cities represented, and used archeological maps of ruins to recreate the landmarks and approximate layout of the cities as space permits in the reduced scale map. Even at a reduced scale, each \"space\" or \"zone\" is 6 square kilometers (this number was chosen because at the time we started making the game this was the largest size terrain Laurene\u0027s computer could generate without locking up, and for no other reason) which is quite a large distance in game. We are using the Bigworld game engine which allows us to create a seamless terrain using the real world data. No other engine has been able to allow us to do this. We currently have the terrain completed for the island of Cyprus, which spans six zones. That\u0027s 12 km across, and 18 km long. This is enough terrain for us to launch the Beta. Once we have sufficient funding coming in to be able to hire a full time team, our plan is to expand to the mainland and allow players to go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, or to travel the routes that the Apostles traveled in their ministries. We have all the data for the entire Mediterranean basin, we just need the team to build the area. Meanwhile, we still have more work to do on the island of Cyprus, and to build out the core functionality of the game such as the skills database, the quest tools, and player housing. We have some bugs we still need to fix, like making the horses ride like horses instead of hoverbikes, and implementing custom clothing that is relevant to the Roman time period for the avatars. We still need to debug the melee combat system, and get bows and arrows working so we can eliminate the Bigworld Staves that came with the engine. We have nearly 300 pages of design documents written that we hope to implement over time, we just need funding and developers to be able to accomplish these goals. Your support helps tremendously! Thank you for joining our efforts to create the world\u0027s first Christian MMORPG as one of our Patreon patrons!\u003cbr\u003e",
