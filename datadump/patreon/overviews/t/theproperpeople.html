Our goal is to capture these places in a video that makes our viewers feel like they are right there with us on our adventures. For certain locations we also produce cinematic videos with the goal of capturing the beauty of a location.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why do we need your help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Cost of Travel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating our videos is no easy task. First, massive amounts of time go into researching possible sites for a future video. Once we believe a location would make for a good adventure, we have to travel there, often driving for several hours or more. Many times when we finally reach our destination, we find that the location we planned to make a video on has been demolished, or is not accessible. Therefore, the money for gas alone makes up a considerable portion of the cost of producing our videos. This expense will only continue to grow in the future, as we are forced to travel farther and farther to find new places to produce videos on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImproving Our Gear\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs we grow as a channel, we would like to continue upgrading our filming equipment so that the quality of our videos can match our growth. We\u0027ve already made some purchases towards this, including a slider for our cinematic videos and a wide-angle lens for our explorations, but these investments are costly. Because of this, it is not financially viable for us to keep buying the gear necessary to improve the quality of our videos without help from our audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve put a lot of thought into creating goals and rewards that we believe you and the rest of our audience would find enjoyable. Your support means so much to us, and you\u0027d be helping us to continue delivering exciting video adventures to your subscription feed!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to make a one-time contribution, you can do so via\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/theproperpeople\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePayPal\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe will only charge you for our Exploration Videos, which are posted 3-4 times a month. The Vlogs and any other bonus content are free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, we send out rewards during the first week of each month for all patrons who were charged in the previous month. So for example if you pledged in August, you would be charged for the first time in the beginning of September and we would send out your rewards shortly thereafter. However, if you pledged in August, but it was after we already posted the last video for the month of August, you will have to wait until the next month to have your pledge go towards a video and then receive your reward. If you think the amount of time has passed in which you should have received your reward, and you didn\u0027t yet, please let us know! We don\u0027t put return addresses on, so if something gets lost in the mail or delivery fails, we won\u0027t know unless you tell us!\u003cbr\u003e"
