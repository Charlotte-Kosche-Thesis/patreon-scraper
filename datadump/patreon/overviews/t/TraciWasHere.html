    "summary": "I think everyone dreams about what they want to be when they grow up. Whether it\u2019s a doctor, a fireman, a teacher, or an astronaut, most Americans spend a lot of time in their formative years inserting an older version of themselves into a dream life where they are fulfilled and happy. In my young mind, there was no doubt that I would spend my adult life behind a microphone, wielding the responsibility of entertaining and uniting people all around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I grew, that dream burned brighter, but I constantly felt as if I didn\u2019t know where to start. Poetry was my way of dealing with every day life, a way I could make my feelings and my viewpoints king, but even though I grew up in the woodwind section of the band and in the choir, I had no clue how to effectively put a song together as a songwriter. That all changed when I picked up a guitar at age 17. Four chords are all you need to find the soaring freedom in a melody.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spent the next few years writing as much as possible, but with college came the harsh reality of adulthood and its coinciding responsibilities. I did the best I could do in that situation. I got my degree, and I got a job that I thought would pay my bills, but would still allow me to write and play like I had always dreamed. When that job resulted in a major, life-changing injury to my lower back, I was sure my dream was dead. I couldn\u2019t even see a future where I worked a part-time job like a normal person again, much less play music to entertain and unite others. My world felt like it was caving in, and all I could do was watch.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward six years to October 2015. My town in West Virginia opened up a new, modern coffee shop, and they made sure to include a stage where it was acceptable to sit while you performed. A friend of mine convinced me to attend an open mic, and while I was practicing some songs at home in preparation, I decided to broadcast just one song on the Periscope live streaming app as a way to prepare myself for playing in front of an audience again. That one broadcast began a  snowball effect that has connected me to people all over the world who find joy in my music, and are connecting with my original songs. Live streaming is a habit that I have found brings joy and meaning to my daily life, and has given me the courage to fight to be the person my six year old self always dreamed I could be again. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s where you come in. Patreon gives me the opportunity to allow fans of my original music and live streams to pledge a monthly amount of support that will help me begin to move in a direction where releasing my first album, booking my first tour, and making nationwide appearances would be a possibility. A small monthly contribution from all of my followers will change the course of my life, and give my dreams the possibility of coming true. Without support from my fans, I\u2019m dead in the water. Will you please consider helping me give this a shot?\u003cbr\u003e"
