    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.tapestryofages.com\"\u003eTapestry of Ages Games\u003c/a\u003e. Your host this and every evening is Adam, known in some circles as \"Goldenflame\", and it is a pleasure to see you.\u003cbr\u003eTapestry of Ages Games is working to bring to life retro computer RPGs combining a late 80s aesthetic with modern sensibilities and advances in game design.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the theory, anyway. I\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll let me know how I did once I\u0027m done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon, or- why am I here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason is fairly simple- games can be expensive. The Dark Unknown, my current project, has been in development for most of a decade, and in that time it has grown considerably in scope and potential from where it started. To make it the game I want it to be at this point, I will need to spend (and have been spending) money. Thus, this Patreon- because every little bit helps, and it helps The Dark Unknown and, dare I dream, perhaps even its sequels, be better games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut didn\u0027t you already do a Kickstarter?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAn excellent question. Yes, I did- to fund art for the game manuals and the box cover, not for in-game art. I did take in over my goal, and have earmarked the remainder primarily for physical considerations- commissioning the trinket, getting maps and posters printed, and of course mailing out backer rewards. I don\u0027t honestly know how much each remaining thing will cost, but the one thing I do know is it will be more than the Kickstarter brought in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs a game really that expensive to make?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, it doesn\u0027t have to be. But I\u0027d like to make a game that\u0027s better than what I could make without spending any money, and I\u0027m wagering that people will appreciate the difference in quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027d like to contribute towards your projects but don\u0027t want to use Patreon. Any alternatives?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst off, thank you. If it looks like there actually is interest in such a thing, I\u0027ll probably put a Paypal Donate button on the Tapestry of Ages Games website.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, in time there will be art, posters, a book, and eventually physical boxed copies of The Dark Unknown available for sale at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://relicsbyrild.com/\"\u003eRelics By Rild\u003c/a\u003e, known primarily now for its offerings of Shroud of the Avatar merchandise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGOALS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy first and primary goal is to commission a pixel tileset that will be unique to The Dark Unknown while keeping the general feel and look of the Ultima IV/V era graphics that I am currently making use of. I do not yet know what this will cost- that research continues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd finally- thank you! \u003c/strong\u003eTo everyone who is a patron here, was a backer to my Kickstarter, or just is interested in my game- thank you! Without all of you, it wouldn\u0027t be worth doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0- Adam\u003cbr\u003e"
