    "summary": "Hiyo! My name is Devon Oratz. I\u0027m a lifelong nerd-of-many stripes and hardcore gamer from Putnam County, New York (never heard of it? that sounds about right). In 2004, I was accepted to the Charles \u0026amp; Lily Lieb Port Creative Writing Program at SUNY Purchase, and I graduated four years later in 2008 with a \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0practical B.A. in Creative Writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the two most important things that happened to me in college was that I founded, created, and GM\u0027d the science fiction boffer combat/scheming and intrigue LARP \u003cem\u003eSystems Malfunction\u003c/em\u003e. Supported by a small but diehard core of fans, Systems Malfunction ran for six scholastic semesters and an additional seven years before finally coming to its final death in 2016. Its fan base was incredibly passionate and creative and I remain grateful for their support, even if we seldom had more than a dozen people at any given game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2011 my partner and I founded\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.endtransmissiongames.com/\"\u003eEnd Transmission Games\u003c/a\u003e LLC as an indie RPG publishing house to publish my RPGs. Over the next six years we published the gonzo dungeonpunk RPG \u003cem\u003eSPLINTER \u003c/em\u003e(plus sourcebooks)\u00a0\u003cem\u003eDicePunk System\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0RPGs \u003cem\u003ePhantasm(2010)\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \u003cem\u003ePsionics\u003c/em\u003e, the setting neutral science fiction RPG Toolkit \u003cem\u003eThe Singularity System \u003c/em\u003e(plus sourcebooks), and more. We were even nominated for two ENnie awards, one in 2013 for \u003cem\u003ePhantasm(2010), \u003c/em\u003enominated for Best Free RPG, and one for \u003cem\u003eEpic Space Battles\u003c/em\u003e, a free supplement for \u003cem\u003eThe Singularity System\u003c/em\u003e, in 2016.\u00a0Our last Kickstarter, still mired in mid-fulfillment as of this writing, was a standalone tabletop version of \u003cem\u003eSystems Malfunction\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0using\u00a0a heavily modified version of \u003cem\u003eThe Singularity System.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eEnd Transmission Games shuttered its doors in November of 2017 and since then I\u0027ve returned to the creator\u0027s life solo. Going forward, I\u0027m going to be focusing primarily on my fiction, although I\u0027ll also be creating random, nifty pieces of RPG content for not just the RPGs I\u0027ve created over the years, but for the RPGs that I\u0027ve played and loved over the years. Really generous supporters might even get to see my sad, fumbling efforts to learn to play the guitar ; ). Seriously, thanks to all past supporters and thanks in advance to any new followers for your generosity and support!"
