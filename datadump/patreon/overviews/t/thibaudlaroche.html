    "summary": "Hi, all! I\u0027m a University cinema student and I\u0027ve been creating short films (fictions, animations, stop motion, documentaries, musical clips...) since I was 12, and I\u0027ve had a wide range of experiences in the art and audiovisual world.\u00a0I specialized in cinema and video for collegial studies at Champlain College, then completed a documentary stage as director of photography afterwards and am presently enrolled at Concordia University in a Fine Arts major.\u00a0I participated in a couple professional projects,\u00a0such as helping on sets, participating heavily in setting up a film festival, capturing or editing events and interviews for various clients, giving editing seminars or live broadcasting for a sport web television, but my predilection domain has always been fiction, and a couple of my shorts were nominated in festivals, including one winning.\u00a0I try doing original stuff and give it a professional look no matter my budget and I love experiencing with new techniques and genres. I\u0027m trying to continue doing as many short 3-10 minutes films as I can, and once I reach a certain pledge, I\u0027ll be able to take on more adventurous and big projects like longer films or a web-series, so if you encourage me, I can guarantee a long supply of fun, thoughtful or inspiring videos!\u00a0For those who have some special demands, I can even try to tackle a challenge once in a while!\u003cbr\u003e"
