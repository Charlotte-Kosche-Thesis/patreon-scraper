I\u2019m a YouTube content creator and Twitch stream with a large passion for competitive championships tournaments. I got my start in competitive gaming and traveling the world through the Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card game. It was that game in which I first started my journey as a youtuber. During my time as a YouTuber, I created multiple channels and one of them was my K-pop channel which also led me to creating a media company named \u2018Seoulwave\u2019. After a few years of being apart of the K-pop online community with creating live events and traveling to South Korea, I\u2019ve found myself back at starting line in the thick of things with competitive gaming in the form of Hearthstone, various different fighting games such as Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite and the upcoming Dragon Ball Fighter Z. During my time creating videos about the K-pop industry, I ran into my fair share of medical illnesses such as Bells Palsy, Gout Arthritis and recently Diabetes type-2 that has limited a lot of what I\u2019ve wanted to accomplish. While I was struggling with my health these past years, I took hiatuses that took me out of creating content and I was at a very low and dark point in my life. However, I am back on the up swing and took time to fully collect myself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAt the helm of this all, I want to start one of my lifelong dreams in creating my own original graphic novel (webtoon/manga) which has become a major foundation of my new found conviction.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy current goals I wish to accomplish over the next few years:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eCreating content on YouTube/Twitch for a minimum of 5 Days a week under a full time schedule\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eProducing a chapter for my webtoon/manga on a monthly-weekly basis. Growing this into a franchise that will spurn multiple volumes and possibly be adapted into an animated series shown for the entire world.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will I Do With Your Money?:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs outlined in my current goals, I will be knee deep in creating content in various forms. While some are more tedious than others, I want to create multiple forms of content as I continue to show people my determination and competitive spirit. My goals with a camera don\u2019t stop at YouTube and Twitch, in the future I want to go even further in producing TV shows, movies and even develop video games. While those goals are far into the distance future, I believe in the quote \u2018Don\u2019t let your dreams stay dreams\u2019. This is a process I\u2019ve been working towards for years and I know in the future I\u2019ll need a team/meet individuals who want to work together to achieve the same or similar goals.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is more than an experiment and I want to make sure that I consistently hold up my end of the bargain with all of the creativity that flows through my brain. It\u2019s why my community will be called the \u2018VoidWalkers\u0027. With your support and advice, we\u2019ll continue to beat expectations and become overachievers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like\u00a0to thank all of you who took the time to read all of this and of course, all of those who have contributed towards this operation!\u003cbr\u003e"
