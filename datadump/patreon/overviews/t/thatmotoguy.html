    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eWhats up guys and gals!!! My name is Nick,\nwelcome to That Moto Guy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo\nhere we are, you\u2019ve made it to That Moto Guy. Here are a few questions, 1) Do you wish to see more of Arizona through the eyes of a motovlog? 2) Do you want to see bikes being built and/or fixed? 3) Do you want to learn how to perform basic tasks that could come up while servicing your bike? If you answered yes you any of these questions, then you are in the right place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat\nis That Moto Guy?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThat\nMoto Guy is my business venture to becoming my own boss. Here is a little about\nmyself. I joined the Marine Corps as a helicopter airframe mechanic in 2011 and\nserved a total of 5 years. During my service I deployed to Afghanistan in\nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom and Okinawa in support of the Unit\nDeployment Program. In 2016 I was honorably discharged from active duty. Using\nPatreon, I will be conducting part of my overall business plan for That Moto\nGuy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhy am I making videos?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSo the reason I\u0027m making motorcycle videos is to bring you all a perspective of Arizona many don\u0027t get to see. My videos will range from me about what I\u0027m doing that day, to reviewing different restaurants, and talking about current issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhy\nam I doing motorcycle builds?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nI\nget it, another \"build\" series. There are a few of them going on, you may ask,\nhow is this different? Well for one, I am a certified mechanic in Honda,\nKawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha. Two, I will be bringing a new perspective to the\nwhole build series concept. As a Marine mechanic you learn pretty quickly how\nto troubleshoot difficult problems and how to come up with creative solutions.\nEverything I do on my build series will incorporate the correct, safe way, but\nalso will include the \u201cMarine\u201d way of doing things. Believe me, it may look\nsketchy, ghetto rigged, or unsafe, but I promise safety is my may concern.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhy\nam I doing a How-To?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThe\nreason I\u2019m doing a How-to is because there are certain things you can\u2019t learn\nfrom just by watching a build series. Videos in this category will be in-depth\nlessons on how to perform these tasks. I show you how to do these in the proper\nway because you have to learn the right way before you can learn the easy or\nthe \u201cMarine\u201d way. With these I will include the tools needed to perform the\ntask. I will also show you what tools you can use if you don\u2019t have the proper\nones.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat\nwill happen with the bike?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThe\nbikes I build will be bought and sold through Facebook, OfferUp, and\nCraigslist. Until I reach certain goals, I will continue to build bikes\naccording to this plan. Once certain goals are achieved (updated later), then I\nwill sell the bike to one of \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e\nPatrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhen will\nI get charged for my support?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nSupport for That Moto Guy is works on a \u003cstrong\u003eset price\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0basis and is taken out \u003cstrong\u003eMonthly\u003c/strong\u003e.
