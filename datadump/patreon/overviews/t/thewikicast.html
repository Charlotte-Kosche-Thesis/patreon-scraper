(or Simon and Dan - \u003cem\u003eSimon\u003c/em\u003e) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re two mates who make a thoroughly unimportant, though immensely informative, podcast called the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWikicast\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e! Every week we click the \u0027random article\u0027 button on Wikipedia and chat about what we find. We also review what films and TV shows we\u0027ve recently watched, and read out correspondence from our listeners (readers, it\u0027s a long story - \u003cem\u003eSimon\u003c/em\u003e) including some incredible fan-fiction. The podcast is rapidly becoming something really special - we\u0027ve gone from being two friends messing about in our living room to a semi-professional success story (debatable - \u003cem\u003eSimon\u003c/em\u003e) listened to by thousands . . . we\u0027re as surprised as you are!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently the podcast has minimal overhead expenses - hosting, basically - which we pay for out of our pockets. The humble purpose of this Patreon is cover these costs, meaning that we\u0027re not running a loss to make the podcast. We turn to you, our dear readers, to help make this possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that is not all! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf people generously donate more money than is required to host the podcast, there are additional goals which we would like to achieve:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eOur podcast is dependent on Wikipedia (as are most university students - \u003cem\u003eSimon\u003c/em\u003e) and as such we would like to make a regular contribution to pay back some of what Wikipedia has given us.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAs we now live separately, making content together requires one of us to travel to the other. This, unfortunately, is rather expensive in our situation, and additional funds from the Patreon will go to a fund to pay for travel expenses. This will allow us to film much more content for our YouTube channel together.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe would love to make merch such as t-shirts and stickers and the like for the Wikicast, but to do so requires capital (*urge to unite with workers of the world rising* - \u003cem\u003eSimon\u003c/em\u003e) which as students we currently lack. If there is money left over from the above this can be used to fund expansion of the podcast through merch and better equipment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eOur readers truly mean a great deal to us, and if after reading this you to choose to support us in some way then we are immensely grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this page, and we hope you\u0027ll join us for another tumble down the wiki rabbit hole. We\u0027ll see you next time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDan and Simon, age 20 11/12 and 27 1/6"
