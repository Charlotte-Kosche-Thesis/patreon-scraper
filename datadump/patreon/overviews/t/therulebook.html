    "summary": "The law is supremely boring. Agreed. But... maybe it doesn\u0027t have to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all talk about how the rules we make effect us. How they sometimes make sense, and sometimes don\u0027t. How they sometimes work, and other times they\u0027re disastrous. Laws, rules regulations... We put people in charge of us, call them governments, police, councils, departments, and so on. But maybe we don\u0027t think hard enough about how that all works... What it all means.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a lawyer who started out in radio journalism school, I spent a long time wanting to try to translate stories of the law, of the rules societies operate under. Then I just... did it. The Rule Book was the culmination of all of the frustrating moments when clients looked at me confused. When I quoted latin in italics in letters to other lawyers, just because that\u0027s the system. When I spoke to Judges in court rooms in a language my clients could barely comprehend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStories of the rules we make, of the law... they\u0027re about us. They\u0027re about who we are, what we want, how we want to look after ourselves and each other. They go to the core of humanity. Truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is The Rule Book?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Rule Book is a podcast series about the rules we make, so we can later break. Each episode tells the story of laws being made, broken, left unspoken, tangled in knots and unravelled. The Rule Book tells stories in rich audio with subtle, considered sound design and unique, scored music (yes - a new musical score for each story).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show covers stories through the eyes of those effected by the rules and those who break them. Experts and everyday criminals standing side by side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Rule Book shot to the iTunes Store front page with the release of its first episode and has been growing in popularity ever since, with listeners sprouting up on every continent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving left a legal career to make this podcast great, i\u0027m constantly working to find new ways to be a real financial contributor at home while making beautiful, rich stories that I can deliver for free. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt takes time to research each episode properly, to arrange interviews, and to record and produce the audio at a level of quality that the stories deserve. That time spent researching, writing, recording, music composing, mixing, remixing and so on has become my full time job. With Patreon, there\u0027s a chance I might get closer to having just one full time job (this one), giving me a chance to focus way, way more than the phenomenal energy i\u0027m already dedicating to The Rule Book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are also costs in putting together work like this, including studio time, equipment, web hosting and heaps of other bizarre stuff I would never have (ie never had) anticipated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I monitored the podcast stats in the hours after uploading my first story, the first 2 or 3 listeners - even appearing just as statistics on a graph - blew me away. That people want to hear the stories i\u0027m telling is just... it\u0027s all I want. And I never thought i\u0027d say anything like that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs more and more people tell their friends, Tweet, share, whatever - help me to get the word out, this show becomes bigger, better and so much more exciting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
