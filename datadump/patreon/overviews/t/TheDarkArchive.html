    "summary": "My most cherished Archivists,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting \u003cstrong\u003eThe Dark Archive\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0on Patreon. Without the support you offer, whether it be financial or spiritual, our little slice of \u003cstrong\u003eWorld of Darkness\u003c/strong\u003e Lore would be impossible to create.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you new to \u003cstrong\u003eThe Dark Archive\u003c/strong\u003e, the project began with a problem to which you can probably relate. It is common knowledge among my group of friends that, while I can barely remember my own phone number, I have a nearly encyclopedic knowledge of the lore of \u003cstrong\u003eWhite Wolf\u0027s World of Darkness\u003c/strong\u003e line of role-playing games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne such friend, who was considering running a \u003cstrong\u003eVampire: the Masquerade\u003c/strong\u003e game set in LA during the Second Anarch Revolt, called and asked if he could drop by for a \"quick run-down\" of the events of that period in the Lore.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took my friend about 20 minutes to make the trek to my home.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what was waiting for him when he arrived.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i0.wp.com/darkarchivepod.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/26175861_10156170851171042_1416855104_n.jpg?ssl=1\u0026amp;w=450\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Hey, man.\" My friend said, eyeing the four-foot square white board and huge stack of books incredulously.\u00a0\"How long is this gonna take, because...\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Oh, man, no worries,\" I interjected excitedly, my mannerisms akin to those of a dangerously caffeinated 6 year old. \"I can do the whole thing in about 4 hours!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeedless to say, my friend wasn\u0027t as enthusiastic as I was. Bummed that I had made this awesome white board for nothing, I instead offered to show him where in each book he\u0027d need to look to find the thorough (if dry) information he sought.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t it be cool if you told the story to my players as if you were Smiling Jack?\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was a throwaway idea, not something he thought would actually land. It set my mind spinning, though.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat if there were a podcast about the history of the\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWorld of Darkness\u003c/strong\u003e, told from an In-Character perspective, that really delved into the granular points of the stories? What if it were told with a flair for the dramatic, with high quality vocal recordings and a particular, instantly recognizable voice? What if that were coupled with sound effects and music that were chosen to up the emotional ante, and really drive the stories home?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat if the stories of the \u003cstrong\u003eWorld of Darkness\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0were available in an easy to find, simply cataloged format, each episode crafted with palpable love for the property?\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Dark Archive\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is a project that, if I weren\u0027t the creator, I\u0027d be excited to listen to. And apparently, the rest of the Fan Community is pretty jazzed about it too. I set about initially to make a cool thing for a group of friends, and within the first ten episodes, my little labor of love is approaching 3,000 downloads a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach episode of the podcast takes around 10 hours to complete, from initial writing to recording to production. There are overhead costs and maintenance costs, and a slew of other minor details that impede the further expansion I\u0027d so love to offer right now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help though, Archivists, we can make \u003cstrong\u003eThe Dark Archive\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0into something so much more than it already is. We can purchase better equipment and software. We can set up an actual recording space, and thus cut down on tedious hours of production work. We can advertise more, and with better targeting. We can pay artists to make specific pieces to polish the professional appearance of our product.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can turn \u003cstrong\u003eThe Dark Archive\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0into the premier resource for \u003cstrong\u003eWorld of Darkness \u003c/strong\u003eLore.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for dropping by! Even if you decide that you can\u0027t spring for any donations right now, you\u0027re still an Archivist as far as I\u0027m concerned.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that means that those whispered voices you\u0027ve been hearing aren\u0027t just your imagination.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s something in here with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou should probably run.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-James Davey, Master Archivist\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find us at \u003ca href=\"http://www.darkarchivepod.com\"\u003ewww.darkarchivepod.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u03b2\u03c3\u03c1\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

My primary goal for this tier is to find and hire a musician to create an original score for the show. Right now, I\u0027m using a royalty free subscription service that\u0027s pretty great, but is relatively generic and free-game for use in other podcasts.
