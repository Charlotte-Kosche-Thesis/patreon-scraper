    "summary": "Since 2008, Ed Robertson has hosted and produced\nTV CONFIDENTIAL, a two-hour weekly radio talk show featuring lively, insightful\nconversations about all aspects, eras and genres of television programming. Every week Ed\nand his team of talented experts (all of whom have worked in television, media,\nand the performing arts industries in various capacities) take listeners behind\nthe scenes of their favorite shows and while also introducing them to their\nfavorite stars of TV past and present.\u00a0The show reaches about 200,000 listeners a week, with a primary demo of age 45 and up.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u2019ve listened to TV CONFIDENTIAL, and like what you\u2019ve heard, please consider\nsupporting our efforts for as little as $1 a month. (We produce four shows a\nmonth, so that\u2019s 25 cents a show.) For just a dollar a month, you will help us\noffset the costs of weekly production and continue to grow and improve the\nprogram. If you can donate more than a dollar a month, we will show our\nappreciation by offering you some cool rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is just one way to help. Listening to the show every week, emailing your\nthoughts and comments, or telling your friends (or favorite radio station)\nabout TV CONFIDENTIAL are also are ways in which you can show your support.\nBut, if you can, we hope you\u0027ll consider becoming a patron. Thanks for\nlistening and helping us make a great show."
