    "summary": "Bringing you The Prodigal Guide and its infamous series of video watch reviews, Talking Hands, doesn\u0027t come cheap. The Grey Goose and Sipsmith don\u0027t just buy themselves. Oh, and top-quality liquor aside, there\u0027s the not inconsequential cost of hosting and maintaining the site. And the lawyers, the damn lawyers...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, the point is we\u0027ve been losing money on The Prodigal Guide since the day we started it back in 2007. That\u0027s never bothered us \u003cem\u003eper se\u003c/em\u003e - it\u0027s always been a hobby, a labour of love - but it has started to rile our wives, family and accountants who increasingly ask: \"why do you continue pouring time and money into that infantile black hole?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know why: it\u0027s a passion project, pure and simple. We care deeply about The Prodigal Guide because we don\u0027t believe there is anything else out there quite like it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe created TPG to be the magazine that we desperately wanted to read but no one was producing: a digital and social media-savvy publication that reported with style and panache on the things we loved - mostly watches, cars and gadgets - with candid, informed opinions and a steadfast refusal to take itself - or its subject matter - too seriously. We lusted after a magazine in which the editors and their readers set the agenda, one that wasn\u0027t beholden to advertisers and the brands\u0027 gravy train or the army of alluring PRs they employ. We craved a magazine written by people who actually buy the products they\u0027re discussing, one that would speak its mind with humour and irreverence to spark the kinds of exciting discussions with its readers that we were used to having amongst ourselves. In short, we wanted a place for people like us to hang out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur hope now is that there are enough of you out there who share our passion, who want to hang out with us and might be willing to donate - even if it\u0027s just a buck per video or post - to see The Prodigal Guide thrive in 2015 and beyond.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo keep us honest, we\u0027re asking for donations on a per video/post basis, not a monthly donation. The thinking is simple: we know that what you want is more TPG content; it\u0027s only fair that you shouldn\u0027t pay unless we deliver.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll only be logging - and therefore you\u0027ll only be paying for - the more \u0027substantive\u0027 TPG posts or videos here on Patreon (e.g., the in-depth reviews, commentaries and, of course, new episodes of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theprodigalguide.com/tag/talking-hands/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTalking Hands\u003c/a\u003e.) That frees us up to post whatever else we want - including things like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theprodigalguide.com/category/friday-firehose/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eour Friday Firehose news recaps\u003c/a\u003e - on the main site as well without worrying about whether every post represents value for money to our patrons. By becoming a patron, you will only be paying for the truly original and significant posts or videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey, we\u0027re making this up as we go along so we\u0027ll happily evolve the model as needed and based on feedback from you. We\u0027d love to hear what you think.\u00a0In the meantime, we\u0027re off to pour ourselves another drink.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChin chin!"
