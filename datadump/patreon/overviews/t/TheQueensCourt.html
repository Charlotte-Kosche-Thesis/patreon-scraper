When I was younger writing short stories was always my favorite part of English class and often times I would find myself sitting at home with an idea in my head, but never writing it down- If I did write it down, I never finished it. It wasn\u0027t until summer 2016 when I truly discovered my passion for writing and the regency era aristocracy. After reading a few books by Julia Quinn I decided to work on a story I had started 3 years before. Now here I am, having completed my first draft of my first novel and currently writing my second. I really look forward to my future in writing!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cu\u003eBook One Synopsis:\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/u\u003e\"When his employer\u0027s youngest daughter Violet disappears during the night, Allaster Baston agrees to keep a watchful eye on Isabella Avery, the Duke of Crawley\u0027s tomboyish and very stubborn eldest daughter. Their journey unexpectedly leads to a dangerous carriage ambush and Allaster finds himself caring for the lady much more than he had ever thought possible. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIsabella Avery was more than a little annoyed when her father assigned his \u003cem\u003eman-of-affairs\u003c/em\u003e as her watch dog. Knowing how to handle daggers and pistols, she was more than capable of taking care of herself. But, when Isabella finds herself unable to resist Allaster\u2019s charms and they share their first kiss... guilt swells in her chest. How can she possibly give her heart to a man while her little sister is still missing, or perhaps may even be dead?\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://i441.photobucket.com/albums/qq140/jodimolinari/Meeting%20Mr.%20Baston%20Book%20Cover.jpg\" style=\"width: 214px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\n\n\u003c/div\u003e"
