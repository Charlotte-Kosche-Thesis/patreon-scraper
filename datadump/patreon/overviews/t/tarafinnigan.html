    "summary": "Thank you for supporting my page! I am an educator in small-town New Brunswick, and yet I have always wanted to expand my teaching of writing to the practice of writing. I have had books and stories piled up in my head since I was a kid, when I filled Hilroy notebooks by the dozens.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately, I have felt that now that my teaching career is steady and fulfilling, I need to sit down and write, everyday. this usually means battling the sleep-deprivation of new motherhood in the late night hours, but all those stories floating around in my head need a place to reside.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been slowly (and by slowly I mean glacially!) working on a novel that started as a fun short story project for a university class in 2001! I took a science fiction class and had the option to perform a dramatic reading of the works we were studying (nope!), or write an original short fiction piece inspired by the stories we were studying. I had never written science fiction before, but from the moment I sat down to write the character became a person for me. I had never experienced such a connection to my own writing and my own characters before. I wanted to give her world more, but since then I have only tweaked, and re-tweaked her story--until this summer when I sat down with her again and her world came together for me. I started writing more about Finn and now I have a few chapters thrown down in a fit of writing that I barely remember.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will use this platform to give myself some accountability and write a chapter a week. I love reading and teaching students how to write and communicate, how to sit down with a book and love it. I think now is the time I put my teaching to practice.\u00a0"
