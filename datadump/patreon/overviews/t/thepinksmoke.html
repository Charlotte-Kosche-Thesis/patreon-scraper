The site does all those genius visionary things you are tired of hearing about like exploring the vast horizons of internet-style arts criticism and obliterating the distinctions between high and low art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the site\u0027s inception, co-founders John Cribbs and Christopher Funderburg have been dedicated to publishing personal, colloquial writing from a diverse set of writers. The mission of the site is not to be a \"rate this movie\" consumer guide but to showcase criticism informed by a love of art and an appreciation for the intense impact it can have on our lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn avoiding the cliches of critical formats on the internet, The Pink Smoke brings readers work along a diverse set of topics; a breakdown of horror sequels set in space one week and an appreciation of the lesser-loved work of Robert Altman the next. Our goal is to invite readers in to appreciate the art we love, to show them \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e a book or film matters to us and can expand all our perspectives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
