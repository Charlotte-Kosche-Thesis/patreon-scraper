    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003eThe Crit Happens Podcast is a tabletop gaming podcast with a slight\n twist; for our second season we\u2019re playing the Cypher System instead of\n D\u0026amp;D, and our hosting fees are entirely paid for by our amazing patrons!\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eThe Crit Happens Podcast is a round-table style gaming podcast with Topknot, the DM, and a rotating collection of friends. Together, they battle their way through figuring out how to play various tabletop RPGs. Season 1 began in mid 2015, with a 4th Edition D\u0026amp;D campaign, Topknot\u0027s first ever attempt at running a formal game. It started with only three players, expanding later to as many as 6 besides the DM before wrapping up in early 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e In the second season, Topknot will be DM\u0027ing again, this time with the assistance of the first DM the gaming group had, Vox. They will be using the Cypher System, a tabletop RPG that\u0027s more conducive to original storytelling. As a result, Topknot will again be learning a whole new system as the game progresses. This choice was made in the interest of having the most room to tell a story that the players can interact with, without the limitations and ever-expanding rules that D\u0026amp;D games can have and benefiting from the help of someone much more experienced at running games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eTopknot started this Patreon just to cover hosting fees on PodBean, which costs $9.00USD a month. If listening to a group of friends try to figure out how to play D\u0026amp;D while their characters try to learn why a God came to them in their dreams only to send them into the middle of nowhere to wander around a seemingly dead land sounds like something you might like, then this is the Podcast for you. If we can get Season 1\u0027s hosting paid for each month then we will begin to upload Season 2 and continue to do so as new episodes are recorded, where the story continues on the open seas [and in the Cypher System] instead of through a blistering desert.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay tuned for more information and future content! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
