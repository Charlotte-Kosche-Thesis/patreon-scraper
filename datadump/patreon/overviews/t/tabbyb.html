I have finally found the correct audience for my art.\u00a0 :)\u00a0 Any support ANYONE could provide would make my life a little easier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe video above is from my most recent coloring book, Gemstones Medallions and Other Pretty Things, which was my 17th published book.\u00a0 You can view more video previews from most of my books here:\u00a0 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCojqJ23bUb6q6jSMBOHSErw\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Tabitha Barnett is a 36 year old wife and mother of 3. She lives \nin the Eastern Kentucky with her author husband Franklin Newberry.\u00a0 She \nhad a passion for art at an early age which she continued in through \nearly adulthood. After college, she became very career oriented and \ndrifted away from her artistic abilities. In March of 2015, she stumbled\n upon the Zentangle method of art and hasn\u0027t stopped putting pen to \npaper since. In September she first enjoyed success when she published \nher first coloring book for adults, Tangled Dreams.  In October of that \nsame year she published Doodle Dreams which has a more Zen-Doodle feel \nto it.  Keep your eye on this artist....I\u0027m sure there are many more \nfantastic hand drawn coloring books to come.",
