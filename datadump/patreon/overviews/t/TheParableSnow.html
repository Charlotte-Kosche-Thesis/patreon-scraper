    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to The Parable: Snow! We are a small team of indie video game developers whom decided to take up the job of creating professional grade morally high video games that are immersive, deep, challenging and fun. Each episode will be an entire game in itself, so do not worry on whether there will be enough play time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese game will have action, adventure, deep stories, and a lot of hours of game-play! The Parable series, the first episode of which is named \"Snow\", will challenging your thinking in many ways. We can\u0027t say too much more without giving spoilers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what about the story?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSet in a minor steampunk/anime universe where some islands float while some civilizations live on land and others underwater. You play as Ray, a gun wielding swordsman for hire whom fights just as many wars in his heart as on the battlefield. Not many know of Ray\u0027s past, but most assume it isn\u0027t good due to his quiet nature off the battlefield and his merciless nature on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings are\u00a0going seemingly normal with Ray\u0027s life, hunting giant beasts for profit and assisting military leaders if the coin is right; until a huge explosion occurs in a northern mountain followed by an\u00a0invasion of many strange creatures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat could this mean, and what adventure lies ahead?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eSide Activities\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThere is a lot you can do for as long as you wish to do it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Go on hunts in which you hunt down massive machines and\u00a0beasts on land, in the air, and under water to gain funds and crafting materials for better equipment. Need a big sword or a massive gun upgrade for a more challenging foe? Go hunt for the right supplies!\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e-An ever changing 50 floor dive into a mechanized cave system full of loot, enemies, and bosses for those wanting the deepest of challenges. The final floor will always hold the rarest loot, but the enemies also match your level + 10. You will be overpowered, so it is a true test of skill.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Fishing... yup... you can eat what you catch.\u00a0Careful, some fish are poisonous.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Cooking... kinda. You get the ingredients and bring them to a lodge. They will cook whatever you want if you have everything needed for it. Food can grant you temporary effects that can last anywhere from a minute to a few hours. Some effects\u00a0even stack!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-More that is not being released yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTools?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will see we use the Unreal Engine 4 to put the games together, 3D-Coat 4 and Maya for 3D art and animations, we have some in house musicians for all our sound needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill there be expansions?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEach episode will be a \"FULL\" game. The only expansions you may see are extra side quests which introduce more loot/enemies for various hunts and discovery missions. The size of the expansion will determine whether we even charge for it as we are considering making them all free. That said, if we supply another 100hrs of game play, that is the size of another full game and we will be near forced to charge due to the fact that yes, we need to eat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can a small team do all of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuite easily actually. With current software this day in age, we have algorithms that make creating full continents of landscape in minutes. What takes the longest is the 3D art, voice acting, and simply coding out the features systems, such as the physics based battle system (which is almost completed already), cut scenes, \u00a0or even the fishing system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll in all, we can do in a single year with a small team what a large team could do in 3 years just 5 years ago. So it took roughly 10 years on a 10 year old system to create some of the top games on the market with a large team? Well now with a small team and current technology, we can do that in about 3-4 years if not less. That said, we DO need support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does being a patron work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMonthly or single payments - Meaning whichever patron level you choose is considered a monthly form of support which charges at the beginning of each month unless you choose a single payment. This keeps the lights on. Note, the more that is raised in support, the quicker and better the results!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e~Fin\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeem like a lot of work? Well it is, but we believe in the experiences we are bringing to people and feel these experiences can have a great impact on people of all ages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the tools we have at our disposal, even a small team can build a massive world; and with your help and imagination, it will be amazing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh keep your eyes on the goals because when those goals are met, you get rewarded! \u003cbr\u003eAnd live streams... yes... there will be those too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Justin\u003cbr\u003eLead Dev | Owner"
