    "summary": "Hello!! Patreons and Patreonetts,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m J.J. Angel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am am author of Science fantasy stories, a poet, a digital artist and a creator of digital atmospheric soundscapes.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve technically been writing since the 5th grade and I lived in the library. National Geographic, R.L Stine, Where\u0027s Waldo, Guinness Book of World Records kind of kid. Even during recess, I was in the library. Books were my playtime. Hi an introvert and socially awkward kid, I came up with a story about four orphaned guys who ended up having to save the world. My creative efforts started off as stick figures and soon stories that filled several spiral notebooks.  When I was in grade school, I had a science teacher ask me what I wanted to be when I was older. I told them, a writer and artist of fatasy things, to which they replied that I was living a pipe dream.\u003cbr\u003eIt was a childhood dream that I dropped by the time I was in 9th grade. I started writing a little poetry here and there. My favorite one being \u003cstrong\u003ePrism Butterfly\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, it would be more than some 20 years or so later my childhood would confront me once again. One day, I was throwing away some  things and I stumbled upon an old box. I initially was about to toss it out with everything else but decided to look through it. That\u0027s when I found some of my old writings and stick men.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to four years of tweaking my original creation into a much different story. It was stressful, but I didn\u0027t care. This is what I loved to do and will always do! Originally conceptualized as being a solo entry, I made it into a trilogy called Legends of Potentia but I couldn\u0027t stop writing about it. After some careful refinements, it was changed to \u003cstrong\u003eTales of Potentia\u003c/strong\u003e and now is planned to have up to seven books with five near completion!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my first born, \u003cstrong\u003eTales of Potentia\u003c/strong\u003e is a Science fantasy series that gives mature readers some dashing thrills and scary chills. There\u0027s plenty of action, scifi, horror, fantasy and a few humourous moments to ease your appetite. Though Tales of Potentia is my first child, it is not my only child. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m\u00a0currently working on a short story titled \u003cstrong\u003eTravis\u003c/strong\u003e about a young boy who has a paranormal with a strange girl in a red cloak after wandering off by himself in a strange museum.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArabian\u00a0Rapshody\u003c/strong\u003e is a story that puts a young ethnic prince on a dangerous and adventurous fantastical adventure in an attempt to save his younger brother and a fiesty princess from an evil warlord. Will he be successful? There\u0027s plenty of monsters and action to go from there in this purely fantasy based story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFear, blood and limbs burst from the pages in \u003cstrong\u003eCrypto\u003c/strong\u003e when a group of college students take a club trip to a secluded area in hopes of discovering something mysterious, only to get much more than they bargained for. They won\u0027t be the only ones bitting off more than they can chew.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs\u00a0you know, writing takes a considerable amount of time and effort to complete. Especially if you plan to create an ongoing series. I have a full time job and I\u0027m up at 6 a.m., back at home. It\u0027s a very tiresome \u0026amp; formulaic affair. I do write but not as much as I would like to. In fact, I want to make it a full time career now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA patronage of\u003cstrong\u003e $2,000\u003c/strong\u003e would allow me to do that and make things much easier on my writing life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the patronage goes towards its goal, I will still supply steady content, (after all I do love doing this). Once I reach my goal of $2,000 there will be updates every single week (possibly multiple times a week) of all kinds of content from early drafts of new stories, artwork, concept music and much more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the rewards for more info.\u003cbr\u003e"
