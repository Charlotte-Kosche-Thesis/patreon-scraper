    "summary": "Running a website takes a lot of time. I\u0027ve never added all that time up but suffice it to say that it\u0027s been 40 hours per week on top of the day job and that\u0027s been since 2005. Unfortunately it takes financial resources as well and that\u0027s never been a huge issue until we now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eHumble beginnings\u003c/h1\u003eFrom our humble beginnings as street mimes in Tupelo Mississippi...no, that\u0027s Krusty the Clown. Actually, we started in the middle of America back in 2005 and back then, I was posting stuff to myself. Man was I genius back then! Posting and reading my own drivel. Not soon after posting my first story, a woman named Grace found the website and history was made. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eA Podcast was born\u003c/h1\u003eIn 2007 we launched our very own podcast aptly named Formula1blog.com Podcast...such ingenuity and marketing creativity the world has never known, no wonder Val Rad in Kansas City never hired me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve grown over the years with a 100% white-hat strategy. We\u0027ve never link-baited, posted paid content, engaged in SEO shenanigans of any sort whatsoever. We\u0027ve never done the slightest bit of shameless self promotion or used anyone for any marketing efforts nor have we engaged the myriad of \"social media\" experts. We\u0027ve done nothing but offer content and conversations with Formula 1 opinion for fans, as fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eThe name change\u003c/h1\u003eIn the last several years, our hard work has started to gain more ears and eyes and we\u0027re grateful for that as well. We\u0027ve become one of, if not the, highest and most rated F1 podcasts on iTunes and we have served over 3.5 million downloads of our podcast show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, we engaged in a deal with Formula One Management and now that the series was sold, the new owners have chosen not to renew that deal. This means we had to change everything...I mean everything.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur domain URL change means a lot of work and we could really use your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eHELP!\u003c/h1\u003eAs we\u0027ve grown, we need your help to maintain our current level of content as well as support our march to a bigger, better TPF. We have lots of ideas and plans that can\u0027t launch without your support. Video content on a regular basis, more guests, more content from more locations, features, interviews and more listener engagement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe short, simple, truth of the matter is, we can\u0027t afford the current rate of growth and future desired growth. That\u0027s as honest as I can be about the situation and we\u0027ve never been in for pretense and braggadocios ways. We\u0027re fans like you who want to engage you and unpack the sport with you. We have never pretended to be professional F1 journalists, they are great folks doing great work, but we\u0027ve always said that we are the fans voice because we\u0027re fans with a voice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eTwo friends having a beer\u003c/h1\u003eOur milieu has always been two friends, having a beer discussing F1. We said that back in 2005 and while many newer websites now claim the same mantra, we\u0027ve never said anything different.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eFirst round was on us...\u003c/h1\u003eAs two fans having a beer, we\u0027ve bought the first round and now we\u0027re asking if you can buy the second round. Is that fair? We hope so and we hope you can help buy the next beer so our wonderful conversation can continue until the last call.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
