    "summary": "Dear EVERYONE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for taking the time out to visit our Patreon Page! My name is Ron Celestine and I\u0027m head of Tokyo Tuner, an online media website based out of Japan. The goal of Tokyo Tuner (\u6771\u4eac\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc) is to take everyone on a journey through Japan\u0027s car culture in the form of videos and articles. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrently, we are able to produce a video once a month or every other month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. Japan car culture is considered mecca to an automotive enthusiast, and just like the rest of Japan, this culture is shrouded in mysteries. It was these mysteries that caused me to quit my job in the States, sell everything I owned, and come to Japan to try and discovery these mysteries while following my passion as an automotive journalist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i0.wp.com/tokyotuner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TOKYO_TUNER_FUN2DRIVE_11.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat makes us different from other media sites besides the fact we purely focus on Japan, is we don\u0027t want to focus only on the cars. I love cars myself but reading or watching a parts list is rather boring. What I\u0027m more interested in, and probably thanks to my engineering background, is the \u003cem\u003ewhy\u003c/em\u003e! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1.wp.com/tokyotuner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC00952.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to dive into the psychology behind \u003cem\u003ewhy\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0the owners did what they did. \u003cem\u003eWhy\u003c/em\u003e is the owner obsessed with lap times around Tsukuba? \u003cem\u003eWhy\u003c/em\u003e did you create a shop specializing in one off creations? \u003cem\u003eWhy\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0did buy a Ferrari 348 and slam it to the ground to the point its can barely drive? It\u0027s these \u003cem\u003ewhys \u003c/em\u003ethat help solve pieces of the mysteries! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i1.wp.com/tokyotuner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/TOKYO_TUNER_DAIKOKUFUTO_HONDA_ACURA_NSX_1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn the never ending quest to solve these mysteries, everything that Tokyo Tuner has done so far has been out of pocket. The biggest cost factor besides equipment are vehicle rentals, shinkansen fares (bullet trains), and the express tolls. Japan is much bigger than Tokyo and truth be told, a lot of these great events and owners live far outside Tokyo which requires us to spend a great deal of money to get there. For example - A round trip to Fuji Speedway for an event can cost us over 50 USD in \u003cem\u003ejust tolls!\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 We would love to be able to travel to all parts of Japan to meet with these owners but due to these expenses, our current reach is limited to how far we can travel. HOWEVER, with your wonderful contributions, we will be able to travel throughout Japan to meet with these owners, travel to events, and create content which helps us solve these hidden mysteries of Japan\u0027s car world!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i1.wp.com/tokyotuner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TOKYO_TUNER_HAKONE_HONDA_NSX_ACURA_14.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor me, going out to these events, meeting the owners, and trying to solve the mystery is a life long quest. Since starting this adventure two years ago, I\u0027ve received countless emails from people all over the world thanking me for creating Tokyo Tuner and providing original content. These emails constantly motivate me to push myself beyond whatever limits I thought I had, and to find ways on how I can keep expanding Tokyo Tuner by bring liked minded adventures in Japan on board the Tokyo Tuner team, and provide content to solve these mystery all while bring other people along for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i2.wp.com/tokyotuner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TOKYO_TUNER_ALL_THAT_LOW_502_FACTORY_TOYOTA_JZX_CRESSIDA.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m going to keep Tokyo Tuner \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e for the world and continue to write articles and create videos. This would mean still uploading articles to the website and releasing videos on YouTube. For Patrons however, I would give first access to the videos one week before the videos go live on YouTube along with other rewards! You will be directly involved with helping me expand Tokyo Tuner and help us to continue to bring amazing content from the land of the rising sun!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have read all the way to this point, thank you so much for taking the time to read about my passion. I hope you find all this rather interesting and will join me as I try to solve these hidden mysteries of Japan\u0027s car world. No matter what amount you can pledge, I\u0027m sincerely grateful m(-_-)m. Even if you not in the situation to financially support Tokyo Tuner, that is perfectly fine!

     "description": "The goal is to increase the amount of video content from 1 video every month or every other month to a consistent 2 videos a month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cost involved with renting equipment, that we don\u0027t currently own, Shinkansens (bullet trains), rental cars, paying for tolls..Basically traveling around outside of Tokyo is rather expensive. Since this is so expensive and everything has been coming out of my pocket, I have to set time aside to earn extra money to pay for these productions which means slower post processing time for the videos which translate to very limited video releases. With your help, I\u0027ll be able to focus more of my time to on processing the videos, and going out to more to increase the flow of content. Also, I could start looking into owning some of the equipment that we currently have to rent!",
