    "summary": "In 2003 I awakened to a call... It was subtle at first. The feeling that I and my family were supposed to move to Italy. There was nothing pragmatic or a rational about this, we lived a very fulfilling urban and material life in Los Angeles. The call became louder and bolder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI listened.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2009, my husband, seven-year-old daughter and I moved halfway across the world. We became the first American family to immigrate and live full time in a magical reality in the foothills of the Italian Alps. A place called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.damanhur.org/\"\u003e Damanhur.\u003c/a\u003e I often describe Damanhur as \"Hogwarts for adults.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a community of more than 600 \"magicians.\" The magician is defined in this context as a person who dedicates themselves to a profound study of how the universe is constructed so that he or she can use this knowledge to assist in the enlightened evolution of humanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy role here is that of the \"Story Teller.\" I found here the most compelling story I have heard in this, perhaps in many, lifetimes.\u00a0 I\u0027ve had privileged access to a previously reserved esoteric archive, which was founded by a very particular spiritual\u003ca href=\"http://www.damanhur.org/en/spiritual-vision/falco-tarassaco\"\u003e master\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0who was unlike any human being, I have ever known. Within this archive, I discovered the most cohesive and comprehensive history of humanity that I have seen reflected in the Western World. A story that was not linear and leaked far outside of the history\u00a0book pages that fill our academic reservoirs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI built a StoryRoom within a ruin in the tiny Italian village where I live, and I pieced this story together, one story point at a time, on index cards with color-coded thumbtacks. It starts at the beginning of this universe of form, looks beyond this planet into a galactic prehistory, and stretches forward to 3,000 years in the future, where our research indicates there is a \"time island\" where a segment of humanity still exists. It takes four hours to go through this room. Some of the greatest story minds of our time have joined me on this StoryRoom journey:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jeanhouston.com/\"\u003e Jean Houston\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://charleseisenstein.net/short-reflection-essays/reflections-on-damanhur-part-1/\"\u003e Charles Eisenstein\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kathleenmcgowan.com/\"\u003e Kathleen McGowan\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://funologist.org/2017/12/01/damanhur-stories/\"\u003e Paxus Calta\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.starlightrunner.com/about\"\u003e Jeff Gomez\u003c/a\u003e, and many others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2018 I will be visited by some of the world\u0027s most prodigious\u00a0experts into the megalithic ruins, and antediluvian\u00a0underground structures which are scattered across this planet. Ruins which support with physical evidence the existence of a highly technologically\u00a0developed society on Earth, in prehistory. Information which is consistent\u00a0with the knowledge represented on the StoryWalls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to support this epic story, which brings a deep sense to who we really are as humans, and where we have come from, with solid evidence from a global community of researchers; to continue to record this journey and to share it with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago, the Universe supported the start of this work with an unexpected inheritance from a distant relative. From this, I was able to fund the initial stages of this work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis financial resource has been expended now, and my creative partners and I turn to you, the Patreon community. Would you be willing to share this journey with us, in return for a monthly contribution which feels comfortable for you? Our gratitude for your help is immense. Our appreciation of your interest in sharing this journey is even greater. Thank you!\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0"
