    "summary": "Hi there. I\u0027m Tobias the Adequate. A magician by trade. A Prestidigitator - a Mountebank - a Charlatan ... a guy who went to college for a really long time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been performing my goofy little comedy and magic show at fairs and festivals all over the US for going on 13 years now. \u00a0I want to keep doing it, and I want to make use of the INTERNETS to get my stuff out to as many people as possible - some of whom might even want to SEE this stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Well that\u0027s all well and good, Tobias, but why should I support this sort of behavior?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHERE\u0027S THE DEAL:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m going to post one video per month. \u003cem\u003eOne\u003c/em\u003e. \u00a0I\u0027m not trying to gouge anyone out of their life savings here. \u00a0If you look over the stuff I\u0027ve posted so far and feel it\u0027s worth encouraging, pledge to drop a buck or two in my hat via Patreon. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach video will feature a live performance in front of a live crowd, in live circumstances. \u00a0 No, I\u0027m not really certain what\u0027s going to happen next.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m performing, I\u0027m often doing it partially (or entirely) \"pass the hat\" - that is, I\u0027m performing and then the folks who see me perform decide how much they\u0027re willing to give me by way of compensation. It\u0027s an insane business model. \u00a0Through Patreon, I want to take what I do and do it for lots and lots of people, and encourage \u003cem\u003ethem\u003c/em\u003e to encourage \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e to keep doing what I do (and recording same) by pledging to drop a buck or two in my hat for each new, original video I create and produce.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of these will be \"Live\" shoots during a show. Right now I have one (1) camera and one (1) fairly patient camera operator who knew the job was dangerous when she married me. Your support can help me keep doing what I\u0027m doing, and possibly be able to move out of the 300 mile radius of effect currently in place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also be adding in short, weird videos as bonus (that\u0027s \"Free\") content for Patreons... and when I complete the upcoming \"STILL ADEQUATE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS\" 15th Anniversary Show video, y\u0027all get a free downloadable copy of that. \u00a0Because.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
