From embellishments to straight out lies, from mainstream media to the social media, it seems that everybody is stretching to produce the most breaking and click-worthy story.\u003cbr\u003eThe impact of this large-scale misinformation can be insidious but damaging. People often end up taking bad medical advice based off a misreported journal article, or just after a while decide that science has no idea what it\u2019s talking about and stop listening all together. Innocent people can be targeted for something that they had no part in, or at least their actions are not as bad as are made out. Or perhaps there is more to a story. There are many motivations but the end result is the same, everybody is tired of the so-called \u201cFake News\u201d\u003cbr\u003eThe Bunk aims to take a close look at stories, reporting only on the known facts and pointing out the gaps in our knowledge and acknowledging them as just that, gaps. We don\u2019t always know everything, and it\u2019s up to the audience to make up their minds based on the facts, not told what the facts are. The information will be presented with enough humour and candidness to be interesting, but stick to what is real. All the information will be cited, any information that cannot be backed up by factual research will either be completely left out, or declared as merely conjecture.\u003cbr\u003e",
