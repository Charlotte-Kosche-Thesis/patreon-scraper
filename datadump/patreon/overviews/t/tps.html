    "summary": "Hi everybody, my name\u0027s Jett, and I\u0027m from SoCal. Some might know me as T1S in the Smash community. I\u0027m just a dude that likes making movies and playing video games. I went to school to learn how to make films, got a film degree, and now, I\u0027m currently working as a freelance videographer and editor. At school, I also helped run the fighting game division of the campus\u0027 eSports org where I organized and streamed tournaments. Shoutouts to CSULB :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring school, I took a class where I was assigned to make a short documentary. I decided to make my film about the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMANjCU4E58\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003escrubs\u003c/a\u003e of the Smash community at Super Arcade. It was then when I discovered that I really liked documentary filmmaking. So I worked on some documentaries during school, and then decided to start shooting footage at big Smash events. The first being\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWmj0V4TnbM\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEVO 2015\u003c/a\u003e, the next,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkIQJmQILrU\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eParagon LA\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI posted those videos under my old YouTube channel name \"that1smasher\" (cringey, I know, but at least T1S sounds kind of cool) I then came up with The Players\u0027 Stories when somebody suggested crowdfunding me to Big House 5 (unfortunately, that didn\u0027t get to happen). I thought I could make a channel solely on telling the stories of the people and communities that play the games we love under an appropriate channel name, that didn\u0027t just shoehorn me into Smash (I enjoy lots of eSports and speedrunning as well!) I also thought it would be a perfect name for a crowdfunded channel, as we, the other players who watch these videos, get to contribute to getting those stories told. It\u0027s not just the single player\u0027s story, but all of ours. It\u0027s kinda cheesy, but I like it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m here on Patreon to seek some support for the videos I make. Patreon is a way for me to get compensated for the high-effort content I produce, while you, the viewers, get to enjoy quality content. I currently don\u0027t have a large subscriber base (hoping to change that though!), so relying only on ad-revenue doesn\u0027t cover the time spent on each video. While I absolutely love these games and communities, and a good amount of people enjoy watching these videos, I can\u0027t do it for free forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what will the crowdfunded money go towards? I want to be able to increase production value right away. Lavalier mics, a camera that shoots prettier images, licenses for plug-ins, and maybe even hiring a crew. I\u0027d also save a little bit every month for travel money to cover events besides those just in SoCal. Eventually, I\u0027d like to live off the channel and quit doing the other freelance work I do to pay the student loans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, what do you get? Pledging some money for each video gets you benefits, which you could see in the rewards section of the page. Extra content will be shoved your way if you pledge enough. Also, if you\u0027re worried about me coming out with something like 5 videos a month and you\u0027ve pledged at the $6 tier, but can\u0027t give $30 in a month, you could limit your spending budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now that you\u0027ve heard this player\u0027s story, let\u0027s get to everybody else\u0027s! (God that was cheesy)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeriously though, if you pledge, thank you so so much! Ya\u0027ll could get in touch with me on twitter at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/that1smasher\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@that1smasher\u003c/a\u003e"
