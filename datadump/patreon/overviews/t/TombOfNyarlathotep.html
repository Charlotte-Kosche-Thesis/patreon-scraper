At this rate I can almost devote myself fully to just RPG material, making it so I can afford to pour some sugar on my games with wicked cool professional formatting plus all the cool stuff at Leather Rebel. Plus I can devote myself to role-playing games part time, with you getting content on a chapter-by-chapter basis! That\u0027s more than 30 pages per posting! There could even be a full rulebook in the future for at least one game. You guys rock!",
