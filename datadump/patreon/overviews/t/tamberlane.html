This is to prevent people from signing up, stealing rewards, and then quitting before they\u0027re charged.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n   After that, you will be billed at the beginning of every month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhen do I get my rewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI do my best to deliver rewards as promptly as I can, but please be aware that I am also battling chronic illness. Most times, $50+ sketch rewards are delivered within the first 14 days of the month after.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027re late getting to X!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n   Regrettably, I have chronic pain and fatigue problems and sometimes I can\u0027t get to things as quickly as I\u0027d like. When that happens, I will usually put out an announcement on the Tamberlane channel on the Discord, and sometimes on my Twitter (\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/pixelprism\"\u003e@pixel_prism\u003c/a\u003e). If it pertains to something that was specifically announced on here, like a sketch stream, then I will make an announcement here too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow do the Comic Cameo rewards work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n   I\u0027m glad you asked, invisible question-asker! It all starts by you submitting your cameo survey, which you can get to by clicking the button up above ($X Patron? Click here!) that corresponds to your tier.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n   For $50 cameos, every few months I go through the submitted cameos and assign each one a career and a role in Treehollow. Then, as the story progresses, I keep an eye out for where each cameo could fit. Sometimes it takes a while to appear, but rest assured I am \n\u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0looking for more places to fit cameos!\u003cbr\u003e\n   $100-Henry cameos are a little more complicated. Because the character needs to have an up-front role in the story, the planning process is quite a bit more involved. Sometimes it will take a while for them to come up in the comic; sometimes it will take a while for them to play an important role. But they definitely have several pages of screen time and are an important driver of the story at that moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOnce I have my cameo in the comic, I won\u0027t have any more, right?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n   Not so! The longer you\u0027re pledged to a cameo tier, the more likely you are to come up again. In fact, if you\u0027ve been a patron for a long time, it\u0027s entirely possible I\u0027ll even bump your cameo to a higher tier as a thank you for your long-term patronage.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n   On the other hand, if you\u0027ve only pledged for a single billing cycle, your cameo will be just as short.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve seen you do YCH (\"Your Character Here\") Cameo auctions. Don\u0027t you have enough cameos from your Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n   Sometimes I need a cameo that a patron character can\u0027t fill. For example, I needed an additional child character, but no one had selected \"child\" as an acceptable age in their cameo survey. Therefore, I had to look elsewhere.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n   Plus, it\u0027s nice to give other people a chance for single-shot cameos! Not everyone can afford to pledge every month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOh my god, why are they naked? With... \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ebits?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eIt was a difficult design decision to make but one I stand behind. I think in America we are very squeamish about non-sexual nudity and it\u0027s a stance I want to challenge. I think it\u0027s important that we acknowledge that we all have bodies and that they are not inherently sexual. I tried to draw inspiration from a lot of Japan\u0027s simplified nudity: none of it is drawn with any detail. In fact, they aren\u0027t drawn with more than two total lines. It\u0027s just an acknowledgement of what a naked body looks like -- and since they\u0027re animals, it worked for me.\u003cbr\u003eI would like to also acknowledge that it has been very difficult challenging my own notions on this. It frequently makes me mildly uncomfortable to draw it. But I really do think it\u0027s important to confront these biases and do my best to break down some of those barriers. Will it change the world? No. But it might help others get more comfortable too."
