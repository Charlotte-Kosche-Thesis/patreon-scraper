    "summary": "Hi everyone, Thank you so much for checking out my patreon page! The very thought that people want to consider supporting me is such an honour. \u003cbr\u003ePlease be assured that \u003cstrong\u003eYOUR CARD WILL NOT BE CHARGED WHEN YOU BECOME A PATRON, \u003c/strong\u003eyou will only be charged when i make my next music video. So feel free to Sign up right away! :)\u003cbr\u003eMy journey in discovering, learning and playing bagpipes as a girl from India where this instrument is really uncommon has not been easy. Im majorly a self taught Bagpiper. Now it has been about a year that i\u0027ve been putting my bagpipe videos on Youtube and i see great response from people! My basic concept is to make some really cool Bagpipe versions of popular songs, themes etc and present it to my audience with a tinch of Surprize/twist in some or the other way!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy i need your Patreon Support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far all the videos that i have posted have all been self funded which restricts my video budget and creativity drastically. I feel like i have so many more creative ideas for upcoming music and video, interesting locations, people to collaborate with and more wacky concepts to work on but it is really difficult and in some cases impossible to execute that with the money i have. If some of you feel like extending your support in singing up for (any) amount for every music video of mine, it would greatly support and motivate me to keep coming up with more stuff without worrying about the \"money part\". I have some interesting rewards too, and plan to add more in the future for my patreons!\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that your money will only be used for the actual music videos i put and not the vlogs, home shot video that i might randomly put up on my youtube account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow this works?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou just need to create a Patreon account to get started and the click on any of the Reward/ Patreon tiers you are interested in and thats it, you\u0027ve become my Patron on Patreon! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE - You will not be charged as soon as you become my Patron, you will only be charged when i make a new video :)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can cancel this payment any time if you wish to discontinue or cannot afford it any longer. Please don\u0027t be obliged to pay money if you cannot afford it, i understand how tough that is. However, if you feel you can afford (any amount) as showing your support to my work, it would really help me in this project and to get more videos for you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, im so thankful and greatfull of your support. You watching and appreciating my video itself means a lot and knowing that some of you would want to sign up to my patreon and be a \u00a0part in the journey to my dream, will mean the world to me!"
