I got blindsided with subscribers after a video theorizing about the TV series Steven Universe blew up. I love writing critical analysis, so I decided to give theorizing about the show a shot. Turns out people enjoy it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve begun to branch out more and more into reviews, of movies, books and comics as well as of Steven Universe itself. I\u0027d like to be able to branch out more, and maybe theorize about other media properties as well. I have other channels too, where I review toys, and upload gameplay videos with commentary. Your pledge will help me to earn a more stable living wage, as well as help me afford the resources to expand and improve upon all of these endeavors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never made a Patreon before, so I may change the reward tiers around after some time, but I will do my very best to honor any rewards that you earned via pledging before those changes were made."
