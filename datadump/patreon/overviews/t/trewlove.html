Drew, an ethical vegan since the age of 16 (in 2006), had experience in rescue.  His family rescued pit bulls when he was growing up and when he was old enough to volunteer he helped out at Wildlife In Crisis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October 2016 we received the letter from the IRS confirming the 501(c)(3) status of our organization.  And in November of the same year we decided to move the sanctuary to a larger property.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn February 2017, we moved 5 hours away from our 3 acre microsanctuary to a 15 acre property in the foothills of North Carolina.  It took 3 moving trucks to move to the new location with 3 pigs, 6 goats, 5 chickens, 3 dogs, 4 cats, 5 guinea fowl, and a fish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince moving to our new home, we have spent over $20,000 of our savings to build enclosures, put up fencing, hire help, fix the farm road, and much more. \u00a0Running a sanctuary is expensive! \u00a0Our monthly expenses run over $3,000. \u00a0This includes rent on the property, maintenance, marketing, food, veterinary\u00a0care, and general animal care. \u00a0Having\u00a0monthly donors helps give us the piece of mind knowing our residents have a secure income to pay for their care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are a 501c3 non profit organization. \u00a0That means, ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
