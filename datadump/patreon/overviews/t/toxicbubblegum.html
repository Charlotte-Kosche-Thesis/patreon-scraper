    "summary": "Toxic Bubblegum is a small project consisting of only two staff members who share the dream of inspiring and promoting creativity in all its forms. This is currently taking the form of a monthly zine and a subscriber gallery - both of which are available for free on our site. We encourage you to check it out, see what we\u0027re about, and let us know if we can promote you or your work through our site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron of Toxic Bubblegum, you help us to pay for our website - which in addition to hosting our small merch page has cool features such as an archive with all the free editions of the zine, the official site blog, and of course, all of the wonderful submissions from other artists and writers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou also bring us closer to our goals; goals such as expanding the staff, doing bigger artists promotions, achieving publication for ourselves and the lovely people submitting to us. It also brings us closer to making the pipe-dreams of our side projects including videos, podcasts, and graphic novels a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, you help support us both as creators. The zine, the site, any upcoming projects - they\u0027re a labor of love put in by writer Cat Voleur and artist Alan Johnson, or as you may know us, Toxic and Bubblegum. While our goal is not to achieve financial stability through this endeavor, any extra profits that aren\u0027t going to expanding our efforts will go to making sure we have the time and resources to do what we love doing; creating.\u003cbr\u003e"
