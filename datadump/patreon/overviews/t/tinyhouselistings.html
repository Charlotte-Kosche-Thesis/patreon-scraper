Since then, I\u0027ve put all of my creative and professional efforts into sharing the benefits of living simply (and affordably) in a tiny home. Tiny houses are my career! It\u0027s my full-time job. I\u0027ve traveled to so many places and I\u0027ve met so many people doing so many interesting things and using tiny houses as a tool to empower themselves by freeing up money, time and energy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m Here on Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI manage alot of tiny house-related websites, the biggest and most resource-intensive is Tiny House Listings. I seriously believed way back in 2010 that the budding tiny house movement needed a marketplace to connect, buyers, sellers, renters and those interested in moving forward with their tiny house ambitions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut of all the things I do, I\u0027ve found making videos to be the biggest consumer of time, money and creative juices.

By this I mean purchasing new camera equipment, more travel, higher-quality videos that take longer to edit, etc. All of this is meant to provide more knowledge, ideas, money-saving tips, inspiration and entertainment for you, the tiny house fan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I\u0027ll be able to provide top-notch video content that focuses on all-things-tiny-living.
