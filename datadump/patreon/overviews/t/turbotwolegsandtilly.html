    "summary": "Turbo and Tilly are two rear leg paralyzed cats showing the world that being differently abled doesn\u2019t mean DISabled! They are both strong kitties with their own quirky personalities. Both were destined to be euthanized but were rescued by their mom, Chelsey, who works full time as a supervisor at a grocery store. It\u2019s a challenge to afford these two and still be able to pay rent. Turbo has some extra special needs that also cost extra money. That\u2019s where Patreon comes in- if every one of our Instagram followers donated just $1 a month, mom could quit her job and go on to rescue MANY more special needs animals. And even if not everyone donates and she still works- the extra funds will REALLY help with the extra bills that pile up with special needs animals and help to put mom at ease. Please consider donating even just ONE DOLLAR a month!! Seriously. $12 a year to change lives?? Consider it! \u2764\ufe0f"
