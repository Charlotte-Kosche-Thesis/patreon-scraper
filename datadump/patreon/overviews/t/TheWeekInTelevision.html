Occasionally there\u0027s some news about what\u0027s been going on in television over the last week. Mostly it\u0027s an excuse to write about my sexual inadequacies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will always be completely free to read and forward and post and steal as much as you like. This page is for the people who want the option to contribute. I appreciate every one of you... not like those free-loading bums! This Patreon is a way to secretly amass our numbers and determine who\u0027s on our side. Eventually we will outnumber them and then we will rise up, take over the industry and greenlight season 4 of\u00a0\u003cem\u003eZoo!\u003c/em\u003e"
