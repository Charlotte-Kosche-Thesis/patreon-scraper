Thanks for taking a look at the true faith podcast\u2019s Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u00a0Podcast, hosted by Alex Hurst, is the definitive Newcastle United podcast. Since 2014 we\u0027ve been the only pod producing numerous NUFC podcasts per week, going to games home and away, living \u0026amp; breathing Newcastle United \u00a0and sharing it with you as often as we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love doing the podcast and had been looking at ways to fund it through advertising, sponsorship or subscription.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of he 16/17 season (where we got promoted disgracefully by buying our way to promotion and little ol\u2019 Brighton won the lea...) we did a survey about where to take the show.\u00a0Many of our listeners suggested crowdfunding and specifically Patreon. It\u0027s a belting idea. You can pledge $7 a month (\u00a35 in the Queen\u0027s) to help with our costs (equipment, guest fees \u0026amp; travel to away games) and we\u2019ll make sure you get loads of shows unique to subscribers including instant post game reaction shows, match previews, podcast documentaries, retro season podcasts, Q \u0026amp; A pods and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re launching a series of live podcasts in Newcastle and (occasionally) London and subscription through Patreon will qualify you for FREE entry to these events, which will be attended by special guests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubscribing for this amount also keeps the main podcast (post game 24-48 hours after) free for those that can\u2019t afford to subscribe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll your support is very much appreciated. We\u2019re often blown away by the feedback to the podcasts. \u00a0Hoy us some questions or comments - your feedback is important to us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMassive thanks for listening to the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlex, Norman, Si, Ben, Micky, Charlotte \u0026amp; Bolland."
