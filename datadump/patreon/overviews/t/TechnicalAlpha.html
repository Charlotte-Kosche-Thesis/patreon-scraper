We\u0027re lucky because that\u0027s a long time for a Youtube community to stay together and we\u0027re incredibly grateful for everyone who has been with us along that journey. For years now we\u0027ve had comments, emails, smoke signals, and a few carrier pigeons sent to us by fans suggesting we do a Podcast. We toyed with the idea many times over the years but we wanted to be in a place where it made the most sense, and to make sure we had our hearts in it. As it turns out, we\u0027ve totally reached that place and are incredibly excited to bring all of you Technical Alpha!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eHosted by Adam (NovaWar), Jeff (MaximusBlack) and Tabin (PanicSwitched), Technical Alpha aims to put our opinions on video games, movies, and tech out in to the real world where people may judge us feverishly.\u00a0As the name suggests, we\u0027re not out to be the most glorious, glorious Nippon steel podcast - folded over 1,000 times. No, instead we just plan to talk in the general direction of our microphones and pray nothing catches fire. I guess we also hope you sort of enjoy it - that\u0027d be nice, too.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve decided to make Technical Alpha free to everyone as a standard. We will be live on Twitch every Friday night from 8pm - 10pm EST with clips and full VODs being posted on the Life\u0027s A Glitch TV Youtube channel. Beyond that we\u0027ve aimed to provide some fun bonuses to those of you who wish to contribute and we are incredibly grateful for those who take that dive - at any level! Ultimately, patrons are what will allow us to keep bringing you our show and we can\u0027t thank you all enough for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVIRTUAL DELIVERABLES NOTICE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon Wall, Jeff\u0027s personalized noises, and other non-product specific virtual deliverables should be fulfilled within a month of subscribing.
