This\u00a0was when I first started to paint in oils with my Uncle Peter who is a fantastic artist now living in Cornwall. We ventured\u00a0into the Derbyshire countryside with canvases and easels and that is where it all began!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor years I have painted commissions for customers, the paintings have varied from portraits and landscapes to animals and birds, completed in watercolour, oils, acrylics and graphite. \u00a0Apart from spending time with my Uncle I have had no form of training, everything you see is through years of practice and the love I put into all my paintings.\u003c/div\u003eI now paint as a full time artist specialising in watercolour and in producing detailed works of fine art. \u00a0It can be difficult at times, not knowing where the next sale will come from, but I love every minute of it and have no regrets at giving up my paid employment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a lovely son, Aaron, who has a good intelligence with the wit and cheek to go with it! \u00a0I live with my partner Jo in North Devon, UK. We spend our free time bird watching and nest recording around the Devon countryside. \u00a0Whilst out and about I try to take photos which I can later use in my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://devonartist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NutMegPaintersOnline-232x300.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I am asked what would be my preferred subject, I would say without a doubt birds and animals! \u00a0I love trying to get the life within the eyes and produce paintings which are detailed and realistic. \u00a0A true reflection of the subject and its soul.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon channel where I can share my painting experience with you. \u00a0I am hoping that this channel will give me some financial stability, with less worrying about where the next \u00a3 of $ will come from. \u00a0In time and with building confidence, I hope to devote more time to producing videos and tutorials for you. \u00a0It is an aspect of my work which I find particularly rewarding and it combines my love of painting, people and technology. \u00a0I welcome you along for the next stage in my journey and look forward to sharing all the ups and downs with you. \u00a0A BIG THANK YOU for your support it is much appreciated and means I can follow my dream and do the job I\u0027ve always wanted to do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
