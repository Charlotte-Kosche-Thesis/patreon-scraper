    "summary": "We are Jenny (the mermaid) and Tomas (the cat) and our family of four, plus pets, are on an unusual adventure. We moved aboard a sailing catamaran (\u003ca href=\"https://www.nautimermaidcharters.com/about/#nauti-mermaid\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNauti Mermaid\u003c/a\u003e -a Lagoon 410) April 2017, leaving behind a 2000 sq foot home in Florida, to move to the Spanish Virgin islands. We came up with a unique plan, we saved, studied, started a family, and now have made it happen by starting a day sailing charter business in Vieques, Puerto Rico. We are taking on a big challenge and a lot of risk but are determined to try our absolute hardest to make this lifestyle and our dream a success! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe decided to share our journey with hopes of inspiring others to go after their dreams too. In the process of sharing we discovered its a ton of work, time and money to make these video blogs. It is also something we love doing and hope that we can help others to learn from the trials and tribulations of our adventure. \u003cbr\u003eWe would really like to continue producing these\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thecatandthemermaid.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evlogs\u003c/a\u003e and want you to join us on our adventure. In the process of starting a business, parenting two tiny people, producing this vlog, moving, and continuing to learn as much as we can to be prudent captains- we have come to a point where our time and resources are stretched really really thin. \u003cbr\u003eWe found Patreon to be an exciting opportunity for us to continue investing so much of our limited time and resources into our vlog by giving the opportunity for our biggest advocates to help support our work. \u003cbr\u003eIf you find our vlog helpful, inspiring or even just entertaining and would like to support our hard work, our time, the expensive equipment, or our dream in general- or just want to buy us a cold beer or a latte - while we upload a video in an internet cafe. You can become a patron to us to help us continue documenting and sharing our journey. We would be honored to have you aboard our team and contributing from afar in making this dream a reality! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything we publish on YouTube and our website is free for everyone We will use any money from our supporters to help create the highest quality and best content we can as we continue on our journey. \u003cbr\u003eWe are forever grateful to have received so much love and well wishes from all over the world from all of you! And we sincerely appreciate your interest and support of our work and this crazy dream!! Cheers and we will see you on the water! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron you can set an an amount you\u0027d like to pay per video and can set a limit to how much per month to stay within your budget. We aim to average one video per week to give updates to our subscribers. (It won\u0027t be more than that). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNauti Mermaids Virtual Crew- WELCOME ABOARD!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
