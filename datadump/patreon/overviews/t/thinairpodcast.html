Since starting Thin Air a year and a half ago, we have grown and changed so much, and a large reason for that is donations made here at Patreon. Our patrons help us to make the podcast better every single day, and we love that we get to engage with people who love what we do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do we do? We are a podcast devoted to missing persons cases. Many of these cases are cold cases: meaning all investigative leads are spent, time has passed: they are open cases, unsolved. \u003cbr\u003eBoth Daniel and I, as the hosts and creators of Thin Air Podcast, are committed to telling stories of the missing and discussing the social issues surrounding each case. We love doing the research, conducting interviews, recording and editing these podcasts. We work on every aspect of our podcast and we do it together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to raise awareness of these cases, renew investigative interest, discuss important social issues related to each case, and to tell great stories.\u00a0Your support through Patreon helps to make these goals a reality. As we continue to improve and work towards both being full-time podcasters and storytellers, your Patreon support is an investment in both of us, and it means so much to us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for being here! We hope you will join us on our journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJordan \u0026amp; Daniel\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
