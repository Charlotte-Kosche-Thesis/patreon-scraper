    "summary": "Hello, The Mountain Jew here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been an avid reader for most of my life and in the past year, I\u0027ve started writing myself. Most of it is in the forms of various fanfictions but recently I\u0027ve begun working on my own original novel. My fanfictions will always remain free and will always be continued, this page is more of a way for you to donate to me so I can devote more time to writing and producing more chapters for you to read. So, really, you\u0027re helping yourself by giving me money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal for doing this is to help me pursue my passion for writing. As of right now, I work a full time job, a part time job and go to school part time on top of that. There\u0027s just not much time to write but I hope to change that with this and your help. My hope is to make enough that I can drop one of my jobs so I can devote more time to making chapters for all of you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my work, if it gives you any enjoyment. If it makes you smile. Then ask yourself if you would like more of it. If the answer is yes, then please consider supporting me for whatever you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy monthly!? - I believe this system offers the least risk to you all. The other option is \"per chapter\" and I do have various fictions in progres,\u00a0a charging system based on that would be incredibly harsh on people. And offer a lot of uncertainty in terms of how much you\u0027d end up paying. This is safer, you know exactly what you\u0027re getting, and how much you\u0027re paying for it."
