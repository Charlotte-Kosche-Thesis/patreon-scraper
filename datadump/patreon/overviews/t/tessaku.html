During the war, my grandparents and father (who was 5 at the time), were held at Santa Anita racetrack, Topaz and then Tule Lake, where my grandfather was eventually targeted as a \"troublemaker\" for speaking out against the injustice. He was in turn separated from the family and shuffled to various FBI interrogation camps, getting out nearly two years after everyone else in 1947. In his later years he started to write a memoir about his experience but he never published it. Nor did I ever get the chance to speak with him about it - he passed when I was eight.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project has blossomed into a much larger-than-expected preservation mission, where I travel extensively and work quickly to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tessaku.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecapture, transcribe and publish\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eas many of the stories from survivors who are still alive today. This strong, stoic generation of our parents and grandparents is dwindling, and nothing has brought me more happiness than helping other families get their histories recorded.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron or \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ekoensha\u003c/i\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0you will help shed light on a group of people who survived incredible hardship but are leaving us every year.
