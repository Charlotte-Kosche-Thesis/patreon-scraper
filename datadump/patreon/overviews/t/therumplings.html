In this world food falls from the sky three out of every four days and, over time, Rumplings created all sorts of brilliant institutions dedicated to food. Alchemists try to figure out what food is made of,\u00a0Foodologists write about food, Healers use healing properties of certain foods to heal Rumplings, and so on. They value craftsmanship, humbleness and perseverance above all else. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first story of Rumplings exists in the form of an illustrated paperback book called Age of Dawn which is available to purchase from a number of bookstores such as Foyles, Waterstones and, Amazon. My dream is to turn the Rumplings into a household name in children\u2019s entertainment, just like the Smurfs or the Moomins.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo achieve this I\u0027m writing more stories which will continue to be turned into books, but I also want to create a whole collection of free content in the form of podcasts, videos, and comics. The podcast series \u003cem\u003eThe Rumplings Bedtime Stories\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0will be created first and as the support on Patreon grows and we can afford to create the content we will. And for those of you who support us on Patreon, you\u0027ll have early access to everything!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Membership Funds\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this first stage, your monthly Rumplings membership will directly fund a number of activities involved in creating \u003cem\u003eThe Rumplings Bedtime Stories\u003c/em\u003e. It will help us pay for everything involved in producing the podcast and all the supporting videos and media that we\u0027ll create to go with it. This includes: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRecording equipment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSound engineering\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIllustration and design\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideo editing\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWebsite development and hosting\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand of course, writing\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAs we grow we will continue to invest further in creating full content for other media formats. We aim to create short comics, picture books, audiobooks, short animated videos, and it almost goes without saying more podcasts. We won\u2019t stop until children the world over know about Rumplings and their world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou Get\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMonthly membership won\u2019t just help us grow, but it will get you access to all sorts of goodies.
