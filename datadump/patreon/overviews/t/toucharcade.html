For a long time it worked great, as iOS games were sold for years with a very traditional mindset of selling a game for a few dollars, and marketing that game with a small advertising budget. As the iOS industry grew, sites like TouchArcade thrived.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2010/02/22/ngmoco-raises-another-25-million-and-buys-freeverse/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2010/02/22/ngmoco-raises-another-25-million-and-buys-freeverse/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ngmoco.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, the iOS game industry has changed drastically.\u00a0Needless to say, the App Store of 2016 is a very different place. Free to play games have almost entirely taken over, and the hyper-metrics-driven business models of giant free to play developers has given rise to a new form of analytics-driven marketing known as user acquisition. Instead of buying banner ads on sites like TouchArcade to reach consumers, marketing a new free to play iOS game involves funneling often hundreds of thousands of dollars (or more) in to companies whose sole purpose is to run elaborate in-app promotion networks to get people to download a new free to play game. In the face of this new style of game marketing, traditional advertising revenue has all but completely dried up, and without additional support TouchArcade is dying.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEHVgpS93Xc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the height of the early days of the App Store, there were dozens of iOS gaming sites covering every conceivable angle imaginable. In recent years, with the shift to free to play and lack of financial support from developers, nearly all of those sites have shut down- Leaving us among the last standing. The few that remain now have either drastically downsized, diversified into covering other platforms, are shifting business models to host developer events instead, are producing significantly less content, or worse yet, are publishing far less interesting content through focusing on padding traffic via exclusively posting things ultra-casual free to play gamers might be searching Google for. We could potentially gain a small stay of financial execution by exploring the option of sponsored posts, obnoxious advertising, and other ways to generate revenue to keep the site alive, but they all come with the significant side effect of making the site worse for our readers... Which doesn\u0027t make them seem like viable options at all, as our community is everything to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2015/03/27/crashlands-the-last-game-i-make-before-i-die/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/crashlands.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor TouchArcade to survive, we need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to continue our focus on all the amazing things happening inside the world of iOS gaming without compromising our focus or diminishing the experience for our readers.
