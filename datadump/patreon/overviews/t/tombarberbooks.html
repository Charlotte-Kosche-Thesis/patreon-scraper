    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eYou like thrills, huh?\u003c/strong\u003e Me too. Hey, we have that in common. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou may have seen my stuff on Amazon or Kobo. It may have\nbeen recommended to you by a friend or family member. You may not have read one\nof the books yet, or you may have read them all. Long story very shortened: I\u2019m\na creative writer doing my best to make a name for myself and my series against\nthe big boys of the publishing industry. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why start a Patreon page?\u003c/strong\u003e Here\u2019s the deal: big publishing\nhouses have huge budgets, access to major bookstores and retail space in WH\nSmiths and Hudson News-esque stores in airports all over the world. They have\nnewspaper ties, networks with movie studios, a long history of dominating the\nmarket and to be honest, are the Goliath in this equation, with yours truly\nbeing David holding the sling.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHowever, they also have a somewhat darker side\u003c/strong\u003e. The privileges\nabove have been used by some to exploit authors from previous generations in\nmany different ways. A 15% royalty (effectively minimum wage) for work a writer\ncreated, total rights surrendered for that person\u2019s life plus seventy years. Delayed\naccounting, no responding to emails or phone calls. A lot\nof these publishers were the only game in town and they knew it. Then a few\nyears ago, self-publishing came along, and allowed people like myself to reach people\nlike you, the audience, people who just want to read good stories. No longer is\nsomeone standing in an author\u2019s way, telling them that their work isn\u2019t good\nenough; if it isn\u2019t, readers will tell the author themselves or it sinks out of\nsight. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd so here we are!\u003c/strong\u003e I turned 30 years old in 2017, with nine\nnovels under my belt featuring my lead character Sam Archer. I always have a\nwork in progress, and have grown my readership to the point that I\u2019m approaching\n100,000 books sold around the world. I run 95% of everything related to the\nbusiness myself (books, social media, website, promotions), but I\u2019m going up\nagainst some gargantuan competition. \u003cstrong\u003eEditing, promoting, research and tax\nreturns\u003c/strong\u003e mean a large proportion of revenue from my book sales is fed straight\nback into the business; these costs build\nrapidly. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why donate to Sam Archer thrillers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Good point. I figure\nwe make a fair trade already; I write a book, you buy it, both of us are happy.\nBut chances are you\u2019ve read one or more of my titles for free. Or you\u2019ve been a\nlong-term supporter. Or you like Arch and the gang and just want more stories. Whatever\nthe case, every \u00a3 or $ helps make it all possible. It\u2019s hard out there, and any\nsupport is always hugely appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA lot of creatives on this site\u003c/strong\u003e offer rewards per tier of\ndonation, but as you all know, it takes a lot of time to write a book,\nespecially one that can match nine previous instalments in a series, but to\nmaintain quality, I can\u2019t release work every month! However, if this Patreon movement\nproves to be successful, I\u2019m thinking about turning up the heat and releasing a\nnew Archer series story on here every ninety days next year. \u003cstrong\u003eFor this particular\ncampaign\u003c/strong\u003e, anyone kind enough to donate gets an exclusive first look at my upcoming Sam Archer thriller, \u003cstrong\u003eCleared Hot\u003c/strong\u003e, after it is finished later\nthis year. You\u2019ll also be the first to know when it\u2019s available and any\ndonations of $7.50 or above mean your name will be included in the acknowledgements\nfor helping make the whole thing happen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSound good? I hope so. As I said, I like you. I think this\ncould work well for both of us. So give an indie author a hand and I\u0027ll do the\nsame for you.\u003cbr\u003e"
