There is a hefty collection of physical works that Dan already owns. A small sample of the collection includes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ean 8mm film cartridge of a dancing genie from a defunct video jukebox\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea WWII-era original photograph of a mermaid painted on the wall of a bunker by American soldiers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eQSL cards with sexy fantasy themes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea vintage gag bra designed for three-breasted women\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe TMNT Mutations MUTATIN\u2019 APRIL O\u0027NEIL Action Figure\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand of course movies (on physical media), TV series (on physical media), magazines, graphic novels, and books.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThe goal is to preserve these, make them available to guests, and legally digitize what we can for international benefit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis money is intended to preserve and house existing items, and will not go towards the collection of new ones - the only exception being the funds gained under one specific Reward, see below for more details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first $65 goes towards 50% of the cost of Dan\u0027s storage unit. After that, all incoming funds will be placed in a special account at a local credit unit, the total Transformeum Funds (or TFunds?) will be tracked here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTotal TFunds: $0.00 (last updated 3/15/18)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money in the TFund account will be used to save up enough for a down-payment, and then to cover the monthly mortgage costs. The goals listed are based on a 10% down-payment on the least expensive property currently being considered. We are looking to buy - under an LCC or other incorporation to be formed at the time - because we do not want to lease and risk a land lord misunderstanding the nature of what we are trying to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWho can enjoy the Transformeum?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plan is for everyone to enjoy the Transformeum, and to use it to show how long entrenched these themes are in our culture. There will be regular open hours. A \u003cstrong\u003eMain Display Room\u003c/strong\u003e would have pieces that anyone of all ages can view and read about, tracking the ideas of Transformations and Metahuman Fiction from Ovid\u0027s Metamorphoses and older stories through classic art and literature to today\u0027s pop culture experiences, such as TV shows like Grimm and Once Upon A Time. An age-restricted \u003cstrong\u003eMature Works Room\u003c/strong\u003e would contain pieces of that nature. And there would be \u003cstrong\u003ean online presence\u003c/strong\u003e for fully sharing works in the public domain, or educational examinations that would fall under Fair Use for anything/everything else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat are the Rewards?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur way of thanking you for your support is to provide backstage insight into the items already gathered for the collection.

He has two ongoing comics series that have each gone for more than 100 pages, along with dozens of smaller comics and prose works available through Amazon, Smashwords, and Itch.io. He has worked hard to be an accessible and pleasant online presence, and supports an inclusive and open community of TF creatives. He hopes that opening something like the \u003cstrong\u003eTransformeum\u003c/strong\u003e not only benefits the genre community through inspiration from these works and a connectedness to an ancient craft, but also to demystify the genre in the eyes of the general public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDan can be contacted about the Transformeum using the following form:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/exksyUBB4wNq5jul2\"\u003ehttps://goo.gl/forms/exksyUBB4wNq5jul2\u003c/a\u003e"
