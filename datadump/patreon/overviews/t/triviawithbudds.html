    "summary": "Dear pop culture trivia fan,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince its inception in 2012, Trivia with Budds has been dedicated to bringing you the best live pop culture trivia events in LA! What started out as a side hobby has turned into my full time business/obsession. From live trivia games, to special themed events and private parties to a twice-weekly podcast, the brand and the fun just won\u0027t stop!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s just scratching the surface. To continue to put out content that you love, I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming part of my Trivia with Budds family, you\u0027ll be assisting me with not just the day-to-day operations of running a trivia hosting business, but also helping me plan for future projects and plans. With your patronage, you\u0027ll be allowing me the time and resources to not only produce the twice weekly show (full episodes on Tuesdays, mini episodes on Thursdays) but also to create much more trivia-based content for you to consume, support artists that support me with great prizes and giveaways, create new merch and unique products based around trivia, and get me into your hometown to run a solid live trivia event! You\u0027ll be a part of taking Trivia with Budds to the next level, and I will be eternally grateful for your contributions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it all breaks down:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore trivia-based content:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m looking to give trivia fans something to listen to, watch, or play daily, whether it\u0027s a podcast, an online video, or an emailed quiz. I want to be your ultimate source for pop culture trivia consumption which can take the form of almost any type of media.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport artists that support me: \u003c/strong\u003eOne of my missions with running Trivia with Budds is curating friends and artists that I think my players would LOVE. One of the ways I do this is by purchasing artwork, stickers, posters, albums, books, and tons more from talented friends of mine that make great stuff, which I then award to you in the form of a podcast giveaway or a live event prize. I\u0027m a big fan of pushing the stuff I like on others, and your patronage would help build existing and new relationships with super savvy folks.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew products and merch around trivia: \u003c/strong\u003eT-shirts about specific episodes of the show, pop culture crossover items with franchises you love, and unique gifts for you, your friends, and family are my main focus with you contributions. I will do my best to provide some truly awesome swag of the highest quality for years to come.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrivia in your hometown, with me:\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI love interacting with fans on Instagram, iTunes, Facebook, and everywhere else online, but man, I\u0027d absolutely LOVE to be able to setup live events not just near me in SoCal, but by you in wherever you live! Patrons supporting this page will directly influence where special events can take place, and their donations will be help me arrange travel, gas, hotels, and all the other tiny stuff that goes into putting on a quality live event elsewhere.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you live in Alaska and love Trivia with Budds? I\u0027ve never been to Alaska, so let\u0027s get me up there for some ice fishing, some questions about Anchorage, and a whole ton of fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut what do you get out of this, you ask? \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a comedy-trivia podcast, you\u0027re going to get some seriously awesome perks and rewards for supporting my efforts. Some rewards, like a signed Sharknado Beach Victim #1 headshot, could be one-time, but something like additional bonus episodes around certain topics could pop up weekly. Budds Box, my quarterly subscription box of two years back, will make a return as a tiered reward! As a patron, you will receive patron-only content designed to enhance your weekly trivia playing/viewing/listening opportunities. And these are just a few of the ideas. You\u0027ll help drive this ship, and you\u0027ll be a big part of me and my family\u0027s daily happiness.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the cut of my jib!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the first time I hosted a trivia night at The Snuggery in the Edison Park, IL neighborhood of northern Chicago, I knew that my goals as a standup comedian had been elevated to something bigger than just telling jokes. At almost 1500 trivia shows and nearly 100 podcast episodes later, I\u0027ve never been happier about the direction my life has taken me. I do these things for people that truly like what I do, for the player that gives me a high five and thanks me for introducing him to his now-girlfriend on another trivia team at a brewery; and for the podcast listener who writes me and tells me they\u0027ve listened to every episode battling against their spouse on road trips and always want more. Without you, I\u0027m just a guy pretending I host a game show. With you, I\u0027m my best self, a machine that won\u0027t stop putting out quality content until my bones cease to exist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m super excited about the plethora of new ideas brewing for fans of what I do, and I can\u0027t thank you enough for wanting to be part of making it all happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time, your dedication, and your patronage. I\u0027ll do my best to match you on all those things as long as I\u0027m breathing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRyan Budds\u003cbr\u003eTrivia with Budds\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "This movie, The Girl Next Door, is not that great. It\u0027s a fun story about a teenage kid who just happens to have the girl of his dreams (and also a pornstar) move in next door to him, and all the hi jinx that ensue. It\u0027s like a great 80s flick, 20 years later. \u00a0Later in the movie, they have a passionate sex scene in the limo at prom, and as goofy as the movie it is, the scene is genuine! Just like your VERY GENEROUS donation! For $20 monthly, get everything in all the earlier tiers AND a very cool extra special bonus pop culture item in your monthly shipment of stuff. A TMNT Krang door hanger? A Road House final fight scene dual pin set? A Big Lebowski coloring book? The possibilities never end, just like our friendship, for life.\u00a0",
