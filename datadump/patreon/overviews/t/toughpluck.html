I founded and facilitate a playwright\u0027s support group in DC called Bridge Club where we have whiskey and feelings about writing and encourage each other to do the important work. I am constantly on the grind, on top of a day job, and my art simply does not support me -- and I deeply believe that art should be able to do such a thing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI run a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/love.porter/\"\u003ediary-instagram for one of my cats\u003c/a\u003e (Coal Porter), which sometimes has guest posts by the Queen Maybelle.

They\u0027re a little bit weird. They\u0027re a little bit magic.

With the threat of any support whatsoever for artist being taken away, it is now more important than ever that we recognize that it takes a village to do this thing, and to support our artists.

     "description": "This will allow me to better support the artists with whom I work on my monthly theatrical, political salon, ActOut. Art is political and people need somewhere to meet and talk about it. I put together professional actors \u0026amp; a director \u0026amp; playwrights each month to read five or so scripts -- which are then followed by an hour of open mic. I want to support these people as much as humanly possible.\u00a0",
