If your patronage can not be maintained at all the points you have earned will expire by the start of a new Year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommission Coupon:\u003c/strong\u003e At certain levels of patronage you can earn and accumulate commission coupons which will be sent to you via E-Mail at the end of each month.
