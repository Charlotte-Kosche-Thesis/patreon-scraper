I\u0027ll begin with radio\u0027s earliest moments,\u00a0focusing on the technological creation of radio, followed by the rise of the networks, programming, shows remembered and forgotten, industry growth, why the networks shifted most funding towards television in 1953, radio drama\u0027s subsequent decline, attempts at an radio drama reboot, and finally what could happen next thanks, to the growth in podcasts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 1999 I discovered the Golden Age of Radio after my grandmother bought my grandfather a box set of sixty old-time radio shows selected by Walter Cronkite. He popped on an episode of a science fiction show that ran in the late 1950s called X-Minus One. I was instantly hooked! I\u2019ve been listening to and collecting shows, as well as reading about that early era of broadcasting since. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe this is a story best told chronologically and audio is the correct format for it. Audio drama truly is the \"theatre of the mind,\" as it\u0027s been nicknamed, and many of its stars directly influenced the stars we\u0027ve grown up watching.\u00a0This documentary will be a combination of dramatic story, audio quotes, interviews, golden age of radio clips all woven together with sound effects and narration. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can dedicate the time and resources to making this documentary happen while the last members of the radio community who were working during the Golden Age of Radio are still with us, and make sure that the quality of the documentary does the medium justice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also a wonderful way for an entire generation of young people to learn about what Americans of past generations were listening to and why. There are so many entertainment standards that came from radio! For example, did you know the term Soap Opera originated in the Chicago radio industry because many sponsors were soap manufacturers based in Chicago?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve recently become a member of the wonderful\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://otrrlibrary.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOld-Time Radio Research Group\u003c/a\u003e. It\u2019s helped me meet and speak with fans and historical researchers alike. I have access to interview libraries, show archives and will secure new interviews with radio historians and radio veterans who\u2019ve worked in radio since the death of widespread network audio drama, as well as go to view private library collections in person.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have a specific number of episodes in mind for this documentary because I\u0027d like it to build organically. My main desire is to make it the most comprehensive documentary on the history of the radio industry ever produced, which to me means several dozen episodes over the course of multiple years. I\u0027m incredibly excited for this undertaking! It promises to be life-altering and something I\u0027ll share with the entire world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
