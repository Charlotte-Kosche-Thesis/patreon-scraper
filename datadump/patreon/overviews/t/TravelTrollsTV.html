I set off alone but grabbed myself a wonderful girlfriend named Mazzy very early into the trip so everything is changing for the better because now theres two off us with the aim of getting ourselves a campervan and scouring the UK for the next 10 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe still haven\u0027t got our campervan (which will be both of our home) but are hoping to get one by the summer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mission of our trip is to collect and share the biggest collection of videos from all corners of the United Kingdom. Very few have been lucky enough to see all 100 counties of the UK, the few that have may have taken photos in each which they may have shared on their own personal blogs. How many have actually made a YouTube video in each? I\u0027m guessing none and I\u0027m sure nobody has made up to 100 videos in each county. This is a first, and the biggest challenge I have set myself to date. The second mission is to metal detect in all 100 counties, again, something which is surely a first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough we will \u00a0put all our spare money into these trips and videos, it simply isn\u0027t enough to sustain it all the time right now. We are hoping to be fully sufficient once we are fully into the trip and creating regular videos. \u00a0Until then we really need your help in helping us to afford the petrol, food, campsite fees, museum costs, car parking fees etc along the way. Our trip is only possible with your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help us in anyway you can so that we can sustain this trip for the duration and together lets make thousands of videos together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce fully on the road we will be looking at a way to reward our Patreons to show our support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTravel Trolls UK \u003cbr\u003eA.K.A.\u00a0Deep Digger Dan \u0026amp; Mazzy"
