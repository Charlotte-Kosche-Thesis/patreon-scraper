For 6 years and counting, I have kept this beast of a podcast rolling and I have no intention of stopping any time soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, a move in servers has meant that the first six years of content for the show (including some 300 full episodes, years of my \u003cstrong\u003e31 Days of Halloween \u003c/strong\u003especials, and countless other random recordings) can no longer be made available for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter you - my glorious \u003cstrong\u003eLegion of TWoRP\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you will gain access to the complete \u003cstrong\u003eVault of TWoRP\u003c/strong\u003e.

Everything will be made available to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s not all. While new episodes of the show will continue to be made available free to everyone on the \u003ca href=\"http://tworpodcast.blogspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e, I will be recording exclusive content just for my patrons. Drunken Commentaries. Extra episodes tying into the month\u0027s theme. Patron-selected episodes. All of these will be made available to the dedicated soldiers of the \u003cstrong\u003eLegion\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTWoRP \u003c/strong\u003ewill never die.
