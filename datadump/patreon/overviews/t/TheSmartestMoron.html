    "summary": "Welcome to the Patreon of The Smartest Moron! On my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1jd__xH8F0pdo2TzFNn7uQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e, I make it a point to analyze a video game\u0027s narrative if it is significant to talk about it, regardless if it is good or bad, and try to at least make it entertaining as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor my videos, I have now decided to mostly focus on the stories to ease the stress when creating videos. Gameplay will not be fully neglected however, as it\u0027s important for it to flow well with the plot too, and I plan to analyze some problems or positive aspects within that game. Just not to the large extent I did before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould a plot only give me certain well-done characters, I look them over with Saviors of the Tale. I have done analysis on a few characters like Selvaria Bles of Valkyria Chronicles, and Homura of Senran Kagura.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I need help in doing all of this. That is where you guys come in! Supporting my Patreon will help me out in a lot of ways, and you taking the time to read this is supporting me already. I genuinely want video game narratives to be improved upon, even in genres where others say the story doesn\u0027t matter. That\u0027s really only because there has not been enough effort put into one. I hope that one day others can learn from these videos, but I too intend to learn from what I play so that way I can better understand other games. It is my belief that every game has at least one positive element of story telling, and I intend to find that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll except Dante\u0027s Inferno the video game. That one was just terrible. And The 3rd Birthday was even worse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd also, I have fun seeing these stories and picking them apart. I have been busy thanks to college life, but I still intend to make the best content I can. This is a constant learning experience, and I intend to hopefully evolve out of being a moron, and truly becoming The Smartest Moron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso, I do have limitations as to what I can review on (at the moment):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlaystation 1 and 2, PSP, and Vita TV, and now a PS4\u003cbr\u003eXbox 360\u003cbr\u003eWii and Wii U\u003cbr\u003e"
