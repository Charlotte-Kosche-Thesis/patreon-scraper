    "summary": "We are just a group of friends producing the worlds first Morrow Project RPG table top Live play Podcast. \u00a0We record and produce the podcast out of the love of the game and the desire to share with everyone. \u00a0But costs to host it online are surprisingly high. It actually costs $12.00 as month just so I can upload ONE episode so that others can download and listen to it. \u00a0On top of that we have website hosting and other expenses that simply add up. \u00a0 We also pulled together all the equipment to record on a shoestring. \u00a0Old broken mic stands, etc scavenged from garage sales and second hand shops as well as buying a new recorder to make sure the audio sounded clean. \u00a0 We would like to upgrade equipment as time goes on, \u00a0donations will allow that to happen faster. \u00a0We are also going to be producing the first Morrow Project magazine for players to not only find great information but also submit information to be published out to the world of other players. \u00a0the Magazine will be 100% free to everyone and distributed by TimeLine LTD themselves in digital format. Supporters will get a 1 month early access to the magazine. we also will be releasing special audio and other items to our supporters just to say thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in mid 2015, our group got together to play the Morrow Project from Timeline LTD, I had recently assisted a friend at launching his own podcast so I presented it to the group and they thought that our insanity might be interesting to others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love what we\u0027re doing, but there are costs associated in producing a quality podcast and a magazine. That\u0027s why the Patreon.  We aren\u0027t ever going to charge for any of our episodes, but by supporting us through Patreon, you help us improve the quality of the show and give us more ways to interact with you - our listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
