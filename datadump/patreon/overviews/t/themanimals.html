The whole thing was a pretty rad experience: we got to make tons of art that deepened the project, people from\nall over the place were able to find us and enjoy the record, we got to play at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.iceandfirecon.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efan conventions\u003c/a\u003e, and we made so, so many friends. There was\na level of engagement that felt so different from anything else, because our\nlittle record got to live inside these worlds that already existed- the one\nwith Westeros and the dragons, sure- but also the fandom world, full of brilliantly\nclever and interesting fellow nerds who all felt inspired by this same source\nmaterial.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5681667269a91a9534a64469/58935b96ff7c501b3d6c8f9b/5a33dce58165f5e58a438b8b/1513348326576/18198482_1836988402986623_679857474098323140_n.jpg?format=2500w\" style=\"width: 324px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t \u003cbr\u003e\nJust as \n\t\u003cem\u003eSEVEN\u003c/em\u003e used our favorite characters to talk about\nuniversal themes,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eMultiverse\u003c/em\u003e uses fantastical and fictional tropes and\nimagery as metaphors for an emotional and spiritual journey.

We\u2019ll all go play in a private\ngroup where you can share anything you come up with. Throughout, you\u2019ll also\nget vlogs and updates from the band, including all the miscellaneous art we\nwant to add to the worldbuilding efforts ourselves. When the next month begins,\nwe\u2019ll collectively tear through the fabric of time and space to venture on to\nthe next universe we\u2019d like to explore. Don\u0027t like to make stuff or feel sort of intimidated about the idea? That\u0027s cool, you can still be a \"regular patron\" and lurk around for as long as you like.
