    "summary": "We are Tomorrow Girls Troop, a worldwide fourth wave feminist art collective. We are working for equality of all sexualities and genders in East Asia, through art, social action, education, and pop culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince Tomorrow Girls Troop was founded in 2015, our membership has grown to nearly 50 artists and activists living around the world, working tirelessly to bring awareness to feminist issues in East Asia and to create a more positive world for all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are all volunteers. We do this because we believe in this cause and we believe in this community. But as our group\u2019s visibility has risen, our costs are also rising. We are receiving invitations to participate in more international exhibitions, interview requests by members of the press around the world, and requests by educators, scholars, and feminists around the world who want to know more about feminist issues in East Asia. This is all wonderful, and we are so thankful that Tomorrow Girls Troop\u2019s message is resounding and making such a huge impact! But we would hate to say \u201cno\u201d to opportunities because of the limited time and financial resources of our members!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we have decided to start a Patreon account to raise funds for Tomorrow Girls Troop\u2019s activities. Because we have several projects ongoing at any given time, doing fundraisers for each project is not feasible. But Patreon offers us a way to receive a monthly income, which we can use for labor and materials, and the other costs that a social art collective incurs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the current things our patrons\u2019 donations will help pay for:\u003cbr\u003eInternational shipping of exhibition materials\u003cbr\u003ePrinting, video editing, and the other costs of making art\u003cbr\u003eTranslation and editing\u003cbr\u003ePaying writers, performers, and artists a stipend for their contributions\u003cbr\u003eCreating educational materials\u003cbr\u003eAdministrative costs, public relations\u003cbr\u003eProducing Tomorrow Girls Troop masks\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut even beyond the possibility of being able to fund our art, actions, and campaigns, we are truly excited about Patreon becoming a new platform for us to raise awareness of feminist issues in East Asia. As one of the only feminist art collectives active in Japan, Korea, and elsewhere in East Asia, we receive many requests for information about what is happening and what we are doing in East Asia from feminist allies, scholars, and supporters of the cause. We are eager to respond to these requests, but they can be very time consuming, particularly since our members\u2019 time and resources are already stretched so thin!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo as part of our Patreon rewards, we will be offering a patron\u2019s only English-language newsletter, offering the Tomorrow Girls Troop perspective on important news from the feminist frontlines in the region, interviews with our members from around the world about their experiences and the specific challenges they face, links to and reviews of feminist resources, and other behind-the-scenes exclusive content. This newsletter will be full of vital information, which can be difficult to get outside of the region in English.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the patron\u2019s only newsletter, at the next reward level we are offering admission to a special supporters level email group, in which Tomorrow Girls Troop members will answer your specific questions! We are so excited to hear from you what you are curious about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd at the upper level, additional rewards include high res digital downloads, early access to videos, art, and behind-the-scenes photos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are beyond grateful for your support and appreciation. Together we can make an even greater impact and create a better tomorrow!\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f!\u003cbr\u003e\uace0\ub9d9\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4!"
