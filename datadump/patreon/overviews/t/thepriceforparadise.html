    "summary": "The Purpose of the \"Price For Paradise\" YouTube Docu-Series is to keep island locals, mainlanders as well as those around the world up to date with the current happenings in Hawai\u0027i and show an honest depiction of the Struggles and Successes that those who live in Hawai\u0027i face on a day to day basis...There is a Price to Pay for living in Hawai\u0027i as it\u0027s not all Pineapples and Palm Trees...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Purpose of this Crowdfunding Project is to allow the funneling of Monthly funds that will allow us to bring 30-60 Min Episodes to Youtube about the \"Price Of Paradise\" which will be brought to everyone through the \"Poor Man\u0027s Guide To Hawaii\" by Wayde\u0027s World.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe had been able to Kick Start this Project with a Crowdfunding group of 58 CORE FUNDERS who had helped us raise $4,000.00 to get this off it\u0027s feet to purchase Tech gear, video, audio as well as computer equipment. \u00a0This allowed us to\u00a0complete our first opening Episode I.\u00a0We now have a Group on Facebook called \"CORE 58\" which had been the original 58 funders for the \"Price For Paradise\" Project...Since that time we have had an additional 10 one time Funders moving us up to 68 Funders...But all of these had been one time donations and we are running out of funds for future Videos. We are looking for a $1,250.00 Monthly Donation from Funders to keep this project alive and allow us to compete in the Youtube Social Media Market. \u00a0If we make more all the better for our fans, funders and film crew. If we go past our monthly funding this will allow us to exceed and excel\u00a0our monthly expectations in grandness and scope when it comes to our video production! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce you Fund this Project you will be joined to the \"CORE 58\" Facebook film team... here you will stay in the loop and informed about all future productions of the Docu-Series...You will be the only ones to see behind the scenes, first released videos and outtakes, HDR images and speak with Wayde himself and have a part in producing what will come next in the series...You also will have the oppurtunity to STAR in upcoming epsiodes with Wayde and his Crew and if you are a monthly funder you will be given the royal treatment when you come to Hawaii with FREE JEEP TOURS by Wayde and his Crew. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese all new Videos will not only show the beauty of Hawaii, but the Struggles and Successes of its people. We will be producing 30-60 min High Production valued Docu-Series Video adventures on a monthly basis. It is because of the \"CORE FUNDERS\" that we will open the eyes of those outside Hawaii in an entirely new light. Watch us blossom, give us advice and ideas for future videos and content, watch us produce our Videos with behind the scenes footage and photography. Also be the first to watch our Videos here privately before we launch them to the public."
