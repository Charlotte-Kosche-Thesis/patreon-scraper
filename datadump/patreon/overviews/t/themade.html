    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment is Oakland\u2019s Video Game Museum\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment is a non-profit 501c3 located in Oakland, focused on educating the public as to how video games are made. We host free classes for kids on technology skills (programming, art, audio design) as well as community events, exhibitions and lectures about software development and video game history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn our five year history, we\u2019ve been cutting a completely original path towards both bridging the digital divide, and preserving our digital heritage in a playable and relatable manner.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a non-profit, we\u2019re heavily focused on improving the world around us. We\u2019re especially good at bringing together people and children who might never have interacted, otherwise. Our classes and exhibits cross cultural lines and unite visitors in a mutual love of video games. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first time most kids enter the museum, they are understandably overwhelmed: choosing one game to play out of the over 5,000 in our collection, spanning the era from 1972 to today, can be a daunting task. Fortunately, most parents, these days, have video game memories of their own, and they\u2019re usually ready to suggest their own childhood favorite to their progeny.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis leads to many situations where kids and parents are playing Super Mario Brothers together for the first time. Even more interesting are the times when our visitors are interacting with each other, cross racial, cultural and class lines, by playing together the games they grew up loving. From Madden football, to Pong, to Street Fighter 2 and Pokemon, video games unite us culturally, as a society, just as movies and television have done in the past.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo games are now a cultural default in our society. Kids grow up with their contemporary video games as cultural touchstones, like Star Wars, or Spartacus, or Archie Bunker. The best part of all this is that we can use this cultural closeness to encourage exploration of computer science and digital arts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe kids taking our classes today will be applying for jobs in the software industry in the future, and because we\u2019re in Oakland, we have a wide diversity of students. When kids first visit our classes, they tend to unleash a floodgate of creativity. This can be seen in the names they use for the save files of the games they make. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese names are never \u201cAsteroids,\u201d or \u201cShooting Game.\u201d Instead, they\u2019re things like \u201cSteve\u2019s super awesome exploding cat space game!\u201d Or, \u201cStar adventures with flying basketball-man!\u201d We make it easy for our students to learn digital skills by unlocking the enthusiasm they already have for video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn our first four years, we educated 400 students, half of which were minorities or female, or both. In February of 2016, we opened our doors on a brand new location at 3400 Broadway in Oakland, doubling our capacity and giving us a retail window for the first time.In that year since we moved, we\u2019ve hosted another 400 students with the same demographics. We\u2019re on track to greatly increase those numbers in 2017, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re also working to preserve Habitat, the first graphical MMO game for the C64 from 1986. http://www.neohabitat.org\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d love to have you as a patron. Our yearly budget barely tops $100,000 for our entire 4400 square foot space at 3400 Broadway in Oakland. With your support we can continue to teach kids, and preserve our gaming history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe MADE is open Saturdays and Sundays, 12 \u2013 6, 3 -9 Fridays and weekdays for events.\u003c/strong\u003e"
