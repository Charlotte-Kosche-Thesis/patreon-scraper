But if you feel compelled to do more, to contribute more, every penny will eventually go back into developing more apps and supporting the old ones!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe development process is a long and weary one and sometimes for weeks there may be no news or update as to what is being developed or being worked on. But rest assured, there is always an app or an update in the studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have kept my Patreon pledge tiers remarkably low because truthfully there are many, many better creators to spend your valuable money on. \u003cstrong\u003eThink of this as a thank you gift or a donation. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRemember, all your support and contribution will not go unnoticed or unappreciated.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e"
