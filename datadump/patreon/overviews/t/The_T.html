But um, feel free to drop me a few dollars to help me out while I get myself back on course?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello everyone, I\u0027m The T!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a full time college student. In the past year I\u0027ve had a lot of trouble holding down a job, related to a variety of issues related to anxiety, depression, and a frequent inability to handle stress. I\u0027ve been seeing a therapist for it, but, going forward, this is no longer something I can afford, either.\u003cbr\u003eIn my free time, I like to play video games and make videos of those games, especially with my friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my hope that I can keep doing this, and supplement my income; being able to make end\u0027s meet from month to month would surely do wonders for my stress and anxiety.\u003cbr\u003eSo, with all that depressing stuff out of the way, let\u0027s give a rundown of some of the major things I\u0027m doing, and what I have planned for the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKFOLFhbiZvjkUxqe85w4s4Yiy7aDxrF\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLet\u0027s Play Super Mario 3D World\u003c/a\u003e: Our first LP, 4-player assholery and plenty of bonus games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKFOLFhbiZtqDmYTDcvtdjGLwrtAs36k\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Magfest Trundle\u003c/a\u003e: A series of bonus videos recorded in a hotel room at Magfest 2015!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKFOLFhbiZttc3W4bxCCpJdrAh5kUNqk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLet\u0027s Race Sonic\u003c/a\u003e: I first raced many games with others; eventually I took up the mantle of organizing races of the Sonic series, something I hope to return to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKFOLFhbiZsTD2E-8cwOgMLCv24dV00s\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSuper Mario 64: 120 Stars or Bust!\u003c/a\u003e:\u00a0My first stream series!

I try my best to listen and fix my mistakes; if there\u0027s ever anything in my videos that bugs you, call me out on it! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, in addition to putting money towards bills and groceries, I hope to be able to start a back-up fund. I plan to move when I graduate college this summer, and having some money to use to facilitate that move would help a lot. I hope to move closer to my friends majormonotone and Annie; so if this goes well, it will mean much more couch multiplayer games in the future, and many more group LPs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you don\u0027t care about any of my dumb videos, it would mean so much to me for you to just toss $1 a month my way! Every tiny little bit helps; small amounts add up over time. Even if I only ever made $5 a month, $60 a year is enough to cover some small costs! And it goes up exponentially from there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now my reward tiers are a bit sparse; this is a combination of not knowing what to offer, and not having much to offer! If you have any creative ideas for things you\u0027d like to see, definitely get in touch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to send me a message on Patreon, contact me\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/The_T113\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon Twitter\u003c/a\u003e or even send a message on YouTube!
