I am obviously extremely committed to PC content on Youtube. My dream is to become self sufficient enough that I can create content full time for you the viewer. I am setting this Patreon up to add another revenue stream to the channel. This will allow me to purchase hardware, new and old, fund contests and user submissions and ultimately provide quality content to my viewers as often as possible with the quality and research. I am keeping the donation amount low as I do not have much to offer to my Patreons, at least not yet. I plan on doing Patreon exclusive content, contests and more in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy audience is so awesome and grows by the thousands each month! I can\u0027t thank y\u0027all enough."
