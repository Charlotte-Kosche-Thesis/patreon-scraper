    "summary": "Hello Everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Travis aka TheHandicapable Gamer. I am 32 years old and have had a passion for video games since about the age of 5. As a kid I always wanted to be a novelist or writer of some kind. As I grew older, I felt that I did not posses the ability to develop a story and characters properly so my desire to write a novel subsided but my passion for video games stayed strong. Although, writing in the games industry, for a reason unbeknownst to me, never crossed my mind. Having been out of college for some time now I have been working a 9-5 office job. In recent years I have had an itch to create content and currently my office hours have been cut down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI saw this as an opportunity to allow me to pursue a passion project but I wanted it to have importance. Given my love for gaming I gravitated toward the idea of content within that space. However, I know that gaming content has become heavily saturated so I wanted to deliver something that often gets over looked by the masses. I decided to draw on personal experience. I am a an individual that happens to have been born with cerebral palsy. As such, certain everyday things have to be tailored to work for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe same could be said for my gaming hardware and peripherals. Due to slowed coordination, it is often better for me to play certain fast paced button mash type games with the controller upside down. That of course is just one example. Ever since we started seeing motion gaming being pushed I always wished that I knew how the hardware could be used by disabled individuals before I purchase it. I am in a wheelchair but I have found way to adapt most controllers, sensors etc to work for me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am starting this project project because I want to provide insight for other individuals like myself and the gaming populous as a whole. I know that accessibility issues will not apply to every game or new gaming tech that arises... so I will discuss it when applicable. Along side those types of posts I will have personal opinion posts and reviews on various games or hot topics in the industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOverall I am going to strive to help my fellow gamer while offering content from a vastly unexplored angle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking time to read this. Hopefully you also enjoy my content. Of course, no one is obligated to pledge but if you think what I am doing is worth while and would like to help me improve that would be amazing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTalk to you all soon at www.thehandicapablegamer.net or right here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e"
