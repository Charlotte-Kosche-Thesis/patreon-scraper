    "summary": "After the adventures in Amsterdam\nwith Omega (The Ark of Infinity), The Doctor finally returns to The\nNetherlands, this time by accident. He crash lands and meets a girl named Emily\nWillemsen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe girl is semi-shocked by the\nsudden appearance of a man in a box in her backyard, but she connects easily\nwith The Doctor. Together, they will face old enemies, like Missy and The\nCybermen, but also new enemies; like The Kathreptes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi I\u0027m Wim and together with my good friend Gijs we are creating the first Dutch Doctor Who Fan Series. We both have a huge passion for Doctor Who and making movies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I (Wim) was a little boy I dreamed of being The Doctor. In 2012 I started to realise that dream could actually come true, through the magic of a video camera, some editing software and YouTube. I started writing a script and we started shooting (SideNote: because of cringeness we no longer have this material). This was one of the biggest mistakes I\u0027ve ever made. But I still wanted to feel that thrill of playing The Doctor. After a few years of brainstorming, we\u0027ve made a script of 7 Episodes and a Christmas special. The Legoplays Crew has a bigger team than ever before. With specially selected people for: Test Reading, Storyboards, Costumes and CGI, we are ready to start with filming.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is only one problem, and as you might have guessed, that is money. This money is not for paying our cast and crew as they all want to be part of this on a voluntary basis, but for building and constructing sets, making costumes and making sure we have beautiful locations to go and shoot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, if you donate you will be credited, we can not do this without you, but that is not all, the more you donate, the more you get. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e-Every donator will get their Patreon user name in the special Patreon credits\u003cbr\u003e-Every donator will be forgiven if they use Adblock on our videos.

Here we will share stuff that Non-Patreon subscribers won\u0027t get to see. This includes our weekly updated work log.
