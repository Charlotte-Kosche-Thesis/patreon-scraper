We have a small team of gamers all intent on delivering the best possible news, reviews, videos and opinions from the Xbox world and I\u0027m keen to move us on to the next level.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will you be getting out of this? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are using this Patreon system as a bit of an experiment. To be honest, we\u0027re not even sure how it will go but should things take off you can ensure that we\u0027ll find some rewards to send the way of our most dedicated supporters. Whether that be in the form of exclusive giveaways and competitions, or just throwing out the odd preview piece up onto our feed, so you can see what we\u0027re up to, we\u0027re not 100% sure. What you can expect though is that if you\u0027re an Xbox gamer, it\u0027ll be hugely relevant to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll find all our articles posted on \u003ca href=\"http://www.thexboxhub.com,\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.thexboxhub.com,\u003c/a\u003e a good number of videos available on our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/thexboxhub\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e and exclusive pieces popping up every now and then on our Patreon feed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an established mid-sized site, we post monthly, weekly and daily news, a whole multitude of reviews, tons of opinions and a fair old smattering of videos as often as we can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically put, if there is some Xbox news that is interesting enough to be covered, then we\u0027ll cover it. You won\u0027t however find us bothering with those damn rumours which seem to circulate every five minutes - anyone can do that and they annoy us just as much as they probably annoy you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell why not?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re not doing this to make a profit. In fact, donations raised will go towards making TheXboxHub the best it can possibly be, building on the years of foundations and pushing TXH on to the next level. Your cash will therefore be going solely towards operating costs, server payments and site upgrades.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks and we look forward to delivering you the Xbox content you, the fans, deserve.\u003cbr\u003e"
