    "summary": "We are The Vita Lounge, an independent PlayStation Vita enthusiast site and we have existed since July 2012. In the three years since we were founded we have grown from a single person blog to a site which received \u003cem\u003ealmost\u003c/em\u003e one million visits in 2014, despite the niche nature of the system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost\u00a0PS Vita owners know that the system has not performed as much as they had hoped, but this has not deterred a passionate and dedicated following and it is this audience that we want to reach. There are still games coming, there is news to report and there are still reasons to own the system and we want to engage with these people and build the best Vita community experience possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhilst we post a significant amount of PS Vita news, it is our reviews that we really excel with, and we have the largest collection of Vita reviews online, with 122 native Vita releases covered in 2014 and more than\u00a0330 in total. In addition to the news and reviews, we have a \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-vita-cast/id879477677\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eweekly podcast\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e which has been running for more than\u00a080 episodes, longer than any other Vita podcast. We also have regular gaming sessions with Vita gamers which we call Lounge Play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe journey we have had has been incredible, but we really want\u00a0to improve what we do and this is why we need your help. We want to reach more Vita owners, improve the quality of our website and our writing and explore new ways to connect with Vita owners, such as an \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TheVitaLounge\"\u003ee-magazine\u003c/a\u003e, growing our video content and much more. It would also be great if we could compensate the amazing volunteers that write for the site, who currently do it out of love for the Vita!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love what we do or if we have helped you in any way and you want to\u00a0see us expand or even if you want to chip in with the running costs\u00a0then we would really appreciate your assistance. It is\u00a0a massive clich\u00e9, but the truth is that you, the dedicated and passionate Vita fan are the reason that we do this and anything you can give, whether it\u0027s sharing our work, telling others about us or pledging, if you can will be amazing. We will also have a few rewards for your contribution!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, and for your support! With your backing hopefully we will continue to spread the Vita news as far as we can and even come up with new ways to give it some attention!\u003cbr\u003e"
