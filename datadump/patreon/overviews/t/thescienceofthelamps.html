     "about": "Quite appropriately \u2018Science of the Lamps\u2019 was dreamt up by Norwegian Liverpool musician Kaya in an off the beaten track restaurant in the fairytale darkness of the city of Prague in December 2010, although it took another year to realise the project. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA band perfect for festivals and encompassing all that is music, storytelling, art, creative flair, melancholy and silliness - framed in catchy songs, lyrical gems and outstanding musicianship from the quirky band. Their inspiration comes from vaudeville, visual art, early Hollywood movie scores, Nordicana, wine, flamenco, trip-hop, music boxes, Paris and whiskey bars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"music that proudly smacks their audience in the face, their theatrical flair and overwhelming passion for the music\" MusicmafiaUK\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAward winning for her songwriting, Kaya fronts the ensemble with charm, confidence and a four octave range filled with dynamic expression. In addition to the band, there\u2019s gorgeous close vocal harmonies from \u2018The Usherettes\u2019.\u003cbr\u003eLike a fevered lab experiment Science of the Lamps has become a beast of proportions, lighting up the crowds at festivals and high profile events alike in UK and abroad. Noted appearances include the Liverpool International Music Festival, Sound City, Los Angeles USA, Threshold Festival, Standon Calling Festival, Disconnect festival, Scotland and gigs in Norway, France and Germany and two UK tours in 2017, one with New York Japanese act Emergency Tiara.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second release \u2018Duckling Hell\u2019 was named by Liverpool Sound and Vision as: \u003cbr\u003e\u201cone of the finest songs released by an artist in Liverpool in the last decade\u201d\u003cbr\u003eThey have worked in collaboration over the years since its inception with local \u0026amp; international talent such as, Grethe B\u00f8rsum, Thom Morecroft, Greta Svabo Bech, Mark Brockelsby and Luke Moore \u2013 the latter two now permanent band members. Now an 8 piece outfit, of drums, bass, cello, keys, acoustic and lead guitar plus vocal harmonies from \u2018The Usherettes\u2019, their inspiration comes from vaudeville, visual art, early Hollywood movie scores, Nordicana, wine, flamenco, trip-hop, music boxes, Paris and whiskey bars. \u003cbr\u003e\u201cA magic veil of true class.\u201d \u2013 Liverpool Live \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cAn alluring hybrid of driving rock and burlesque blues.\u201d \u2013 Bido Lito \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014 the band composed and recorded the soundtrack to a forthcoming feature movie and also released their second EP Candela, launched at a sell-out gig in Williamson Tunnels.The same month, their video to \u2018Superhero Me\u2019 gained 1000 views within 48 hours of it\u2019s release on Youtube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cIt\u2019s oId Pop in its nicest possible form, the song writing ticking all those imaginary boxes\u201d #SRCZ \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheir reputation for flamboyant, quirky, upbeat and odd performances combined with magnificent musicianship has led to bookings at some of the best venues in the North West. \u003cbr\u003e\u201chauntingly melodic yet a little dirty at the same time.\u0027 ManGoneBlog\u003cbr\u003e",
