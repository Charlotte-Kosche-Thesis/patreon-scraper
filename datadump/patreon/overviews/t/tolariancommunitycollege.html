There\u0027s very likely deadly mold in the walls. \u00a0If I can reach this level of funding, I can afford to rent an actual office space for Tolarian Community College! \u00a0This will allow me all sorts of advantages that translate into better quality content as well as new and exciting projects that can now be pursued. \u00a0Also...no more deadly mold!",
