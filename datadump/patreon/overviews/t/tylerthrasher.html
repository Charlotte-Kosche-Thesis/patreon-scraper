    "summary": "Your support has given me the immense privilege and resources to create and explore and my free time has been filled with just that, creating art and exploring the world around us. The easiest way to sum up a majority of what I do is simply stating this, \"I strive to combine art and science.\"\u003cbr\u003eThey\u0027ve always gone hand in hand in my mind, and this exact mindset is what brought so many of you to my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOver the last few years, my work has somehow received an astonishing amount of publicity, support, and love. During these years, I\u0027ve slowly been sharing ME- what I love, the things I do in my spare time, and the things I research. It turns out, most of you are on the same page and are into a lot of the things I am. I find ways to incorporate creativity and experimentation in almost everything I do, and that\u0027s what I want I\u0027m bringing to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, my art. Paintings, drawings, illustrations, zines, you name it. I\u0027ll be sharing that with all of you. By supporting my Patreon, you\u0027ll get free copies of every zine I make when I make them. You\u0027ll also get exclusive sneak peeks at the art I\u0027m making and I will share tips and things I learn along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, my science. You\u0027ll get first class access to my research, experiments, you name it again. I got alot going on in the lab, such as growing and classifying different synthesized crystals, trying to create opal, and working on fabricating other sorts of materials and what not.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThirdly, my plants. I collect and grow rare succulents and cacti. Its an ever consuming passion of mine and so many of you have expressed interest in my greenhouse and collection. I will share new additions to my collection, growing and care tips, tutorials, and I\u0027ll even send out some of my excess seeds from time to time! You\u0027ll even get sneak peeks to the plants I\u0027m currently trying to hybridize and create.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFourthly, my music. I\u0027m an electronic music producer, who dabbles and gets his feet wet in genres such as trance, house, progressive trance and house, ambient, and dark trance. By backing my Patreon, you\u0027ll receive free downloads of ALL of my music. Anytime I release an EP or track, its yours. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFifthly, Everything else. Seriously. If I\u0027m working on something, you all will get front row seats to it. Any avenue that I utilize creativity in will be shared with all of you. I will invite all of you to be my pen pal. We can talk about anything. Science, art, plants, DnD, maybe even mysteries of the universe. *maybe\u003cbr\u003eI will also be sharing my experiences as a Dungeon Master, tips, and other things for the Tier 2 nerds out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAntyways, this is a compiled list of everything you\u0027ll get by backing my Patreon for 5 bucks a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
