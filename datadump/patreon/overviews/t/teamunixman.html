We\u0027re working on creating materials for all kinds of people from a diverse range of backgrounds to improve computer science literacy universally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOur Goals\u003c/h2\u003eWe\u0027re currently focusing on creating videos, screencasts, animated visualizations, and writing articles and books. We explain computer science concepts in plain English. Our focus is on how these principles are everywhere in life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOur Values\u003c/h2\u003eWe believe that because every person has a different background and understands the world in a different way, each concept can also be understood in many ways and from different directions. Our materials are intended to be skimmed, browsed, marked up, jumped around in, and generally taken as collections of short stories more than unified, linear lesson plans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eOur Current Projects\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eLearning Materials\u003c/h3\u003eWe have three books in the works: F# Programming, Beautiful Functional Web Programming, and Machine Learning for People. Each of these is for anyone to pick up and start learning. We\u0027re also producing a downloadable system that will run on most computers. It will come with a sample chapter and exercise from each book, and automatically download the latest versions of all your subscriptions. The system will be free to download\u00a0so you\u0027ll experience our unique methods and then help sponsor us to help people from all backgrounds learn about the systems and people influencing every part of their lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eJacquehammer: Helping Trafficking Survivors\u003c/h3\u003eWe\u0027re also building a system in Haskell that will help trafficking survivors connect with the more effective assistance organizations, and report back on how they were helped. We anonymously track the stories and the assistance of each person and each organization, and then we can report on the effectiveness of the help each organization offers compared to the amount of money received from donors, government grants, and other sources. Currently there\u0027s no source of information on this, and so many people aren\u0027t being helped, or worse, are harmed, and collecting this information and presenting it will help people understand better where their contributions are being spent.\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e"
