I\u0027ve been making gaming \ncontent on youtube since 2011, and have loved every moment! I\u0027ve built \nmy channel up around my life in such a way that I could\u0027nt even imagine \nnot making videos and sharing my experiences with you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not \none to put on a show or be disingenuous, I take pride in being the same \nperson in real life that you hear in every single one of my videos. I \nlaugh at stupid things, stutter and jumble my words. I am Real. And its \ngoing to stay that way! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIve decided to \"reboot\" my patreon \ncampaign in the hopes that with your support, this crazy dream that I \nhave of becoming and \"Fulltime Youtuber\" can succeed! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the\n questions i get asked alot is, \"I love your videos, why don\u0027t you post \ncontent daily?\" Well the simple answer to that honestly, is time. As it \nstands I put in about 40 hours or more into the content that I have \navailable to your guys now (be it on screen and off screen work that I \nput into the actual game for the current video). Which comes out to \naround 3-4 videos a week. On top of the 40+ hours of producing \nentertaining gaming content, I also work a full time job. So thats 40 \nmore hours a week that i could potentially pour into video creation. \nWhich would be a dream come true! That would mean, daily content of 1-2 \nvideos a day, more streaming and time to hang out with you guys one on \none, and an all around happier Me! With your support of a small monthly \ndonation, This could become a Reality!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy content on youtube is\n and always will be free, This is not a pay to watch kind of deal. \nPlease dont not feel that it is nessicary to support me via Patreon. \nJust by liking, commenting, and even just watching my videos on youtube \nis more than enough support. I just wanted to give an option to the \ngenerous few, that would go above and beyond to help support me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith\n your direct support, we could upgrade the production quality of the \nsetup (Hardware, green screen, anything that we need) and would give me \nthe ability to do what I love without the worry of how Im going to pay \nmy bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those that are willing to go above and beyond, I \nthank you! And to everyone, Your continued support over the years has \nbeen nothing short of amazing and I could never thank you enough!\u003cbr\u003e"
