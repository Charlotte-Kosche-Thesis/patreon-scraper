    "summary": "This page is all about supporting an artist as he does his best to achieve his goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat artist is Will Caron. Some might even say \u0027The\u0027 Will Caron. He\u0027s an award-winning cartoonist and illustrator who currently works as a freelance artist, writer, editor and photographer to pay the bills. And that\u0027s swell. Will likes his work (most of the time). But, like the caged wombat, his true ambition currently lies just beyond the reach of a month-to-month, gig-labor paycheck. What is that ambition, you ask? Simple: to write and draw graphic novels that inspire, awe and intrigue readers through use of sophisticated art and storytelling that addresses relevant, topical societal issues while keeping readers hooked with action-packed plots, imaginative dialogue and memorable characters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage can help this artist achieve his goal. So, what is this aspiring comicker working on first? What will your patronage go directly toward funding?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent project:\u00a0First Born\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTreatment:\u00a0Set in the year 2050, First Born is the story of the world as it will be if we continue down our current reckless path, endangering the very planet, and each other, with over-development, militarization and a flawed economic and social structure. The disastrous effects of climate change have sent the environment spinning out of control; the world\u2019s last two superpowers, China and the United States are on the brink of war; and the rapid advance of technology has forever disrupted the neoliberal framework on which the world\u2019s societies are built and caused unrest around the globe, even as the governments of the world cling to power through increasingly draconian measures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the midst of this chaotic backdrop, an ancient being--the last pure specimen of his kind, a powerful race that civilized the ancient Middle East before mankind rose to dominance--plots his revenge on the species that undermined and overwhelmed his world. Amon, last king of Isin, and last of the forgotten people known as the \u201cNobles,\u201d to the handful of humans who are aware of their existence, sets a grand scheme in motion to topple human civilization by exploiting the weakness, the arrogance and the hubris of mankind, playing off the social inequality and economic injustice, the racism and hate, the irresponsible stewardship, the apathy and the escapism of the majority of the population to sow confusion and incite rebellion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy drawing China and the United States into an all-out war, Amon hopes to destabilize the governments of the world and plunge the globe into chaos. Out of this chaos, he intends to forge a new order; one where the foolishness of mankind is replaced by the iron fist of his own creed. Led by the mysterious and powerful Samantha Innes and the enigmatic and altruistic Kensuke Ishida, it will be up to a small group of super-powered humans--men and women from around the world, attuned with the energy of the human spirit and with forces of nature itself--to find a way to save mankind from Amon\u2019s plot, as well as from itself, and lead humanity into a new era of peace, justice and prosperity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey there,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this sounds like a project you\u0027d like to see produced, please consider supporting me as I continue to develop material. As of now, your contribution will only be collected upon successful completion of a new piece of artwork for you to enjoy. The more patrons that contribute, the more these pieces of art will benefit me and the easier it will be for me to work on what I am truly passionate about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMahalo nui loa,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill Caron\u003cbr\u003e"
