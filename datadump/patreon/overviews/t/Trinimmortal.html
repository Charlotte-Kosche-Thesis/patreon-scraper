    "summary": "MOSHI MOSHI MOTHERFUCKER, welcome to my patreon. This is the sole reason I\u0027ve been able to do YouTube as a full time job. Without it, there\u0027s no way I would have been able to get by, so thank you to anyone and everyone who\u0027s ever decided to support me. I can\u0027t thank you enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the time of this writing, YouTube is going through some very serious issues regarding ad revenue. To put it simply, everyone\u0027s ads have pretty much taken a big hit. I can\u0027t speak for others, but I\u0027ve noticed a 40% decrease in revenue. That is absolutely awful. I\u0027ve got money saved up thankfully so I won\u0027t immediately go broke, but simply put, this just isn\u0027t gonna cut it in the long run. Taxes ate half my savings, and will likely do the same next year, so I have the rest of this year to basically increase my income to the point that I\u0027d be able to not only pay all my bills and save like usual, but also survive the tax season without going bankrupt. To put it bluntly, this COULD be my last year doing YouTube if I\u0027m unable to increase my income.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want that to happen. This is a very stressful job, but there\u0027s really nothing that can replace that feeling of releasing a good video. I love what I do and I want to continue to make dumb videos. I want to be able to go out and buy a Macho Man Randy Savage cosplay and a box of coffee creamers because \u003cem\u003ewhy the fuck not\u003c/em\u003e. I wanna be able to buy whatever equipment I might need to make my videos better and entertain you more. I wanna be able to pay my bills and save for my future. I want this to be a legitimate career that I could do in the long term.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0Choosing to support me means that you will help me pay my bills, improve the channel, and save for my future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI understand that not everyone is able to pledge per month. If you\u0027re even considering it, I love you. I couldn\u0027t have gotten this far without you. I\u0027ll keep doing what I can to keep the ship afloat. Thank you for your time.\u00a0"
