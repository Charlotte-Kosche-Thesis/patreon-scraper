I think the community there is one of the best around, as evidenced by the comments and feedback I receive on the regular. In conjunction with the website, I also do work on YouTube. The idea behind having a Patreon is simple. I want to supplement my meager ad revenue and give people a way to support my operations, should they feel inclined to do so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I do and want to see it continue for the long-haul, please consider donating. And if you can\u0027t donate, just sharing or consuming the content itself is good enough for me. I appreciate all the support, monetary and otherwise."
