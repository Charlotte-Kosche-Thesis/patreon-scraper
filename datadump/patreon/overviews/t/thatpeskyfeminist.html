You may know me from Twitter (\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/femmenistfatale\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@femmenistfatale\u003c/a\u003e) or my blog \u003ca href=\"http://thatpeskyfeminist.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThat Pesky Feminist\u003c/a\u003e, or some amalgamation of the two. I\u0027ve been writing there and freelancing elsewhere for a good few years now, and you can view the results of that at my portfolio, \u003ca href=\"http://tillygrove.contently.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etillygrove.contently.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s only been something I do on the side until now, but I\u0027m about to enter a new chapter of my life and that\u0027s going to change. I have PTSD and am undergoing the treatment to match, and that\u0027s made it hard to work a 9-5. Writing, be it as a freelancer for other outlets or on my own blog, is something I love and would like to support myself on, but I\u0027m going to need some help to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write, and have always written, deeply personal essays about my experiences with mental health, body image, rape culture, alongside feminist critiques of music, films, and cultural events. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027d like to be able to do more of this\u003c/strong\u003e, especially on the things I know you, my readers (which may be all two of you), relate to the most. I listen to your responses to my work, and I know the things I write that you like the most are articles about mental health, about sex, about dating, and about life that other people don\u0027t or can\u0027t write about. \u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s what you\u0027ll get if you donate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI know that times are tough and money is tight (which is, in fact, why I\u0027m here), and I would never ask for money if I didn\u0027t need it and I would never expect anyone to give a penny. However, if you \u003cstrong\u003edo \u003c/strong\u003efeel able to give even a quid - and you feel like what I do with my blog is even remotely worth something - I would be extremely grateful. It will allow me to create more of the content that you like to read. Where before I\u0027ve seen you request that I write things and I haven\u0027t had the time, with your donations I\u0027ll be able to be responsive and write exactly what you want me to. Better, I\u0027ll make sure you get to read it before anyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s lots of other things I\u0027d like to do with That Pesky Feminist given the chance, including a Youtube channel and longer form essays about specific subjects. I\u0027d also like to create a zine, which will remain secret for now. With your help, I can make these things a reality and create what you will enjoy. If that\u0027s enough for you, your support will mean the world to me. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
