    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi everyone! I am Elizabeth, aka The Dragon\u0027s Cosplay. I am an eighteen year old artist and cosplayer. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been creating art for pretty much all my life, beginning more seriously in 2013. I have been cosplaying since 2013, after discovering it through the Doctor Who fandom. \u003cbr\u003eFor four years I worked with exclusively traditional art mediums, mostly acrylic and oil paints, but this year I began to explore the world of digital art. I have been using Krita to created my digital pieces and am excited to develop my skills in this area. I paint mostly fictional characters, imaginative images, and my versions of classic paintings. \u003cbr\u003eI love cosplay because it combines my interests of crafting and fictional characters. I try to use creative materials and techniques that allow me to make accurate looking pieces on a budget. I am mostly drawn to portray female characters from science fiction and fantasy genres.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a place where you can sign up to help your favorite artist with a monthly donation pledge! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW DOES THIS MONTHLY DONATION WORK? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe monthly donation will be determined by how ever much you want to donate to me each month, could be a dollar or two dollars, what ever you would like to donate. There are rewards for higher donations! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT REWARDS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn patreon, we artist create DONATION TIERS. Each TIER has its own reward. You can choose to pick what ever amount you would like to donate\u00a0or\u00a0go off according to the reward tier located at the bottom of this description. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE DOES MY PLEDGE MONEY GO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations allow me to buy cosplay materials (fabric, prop making materials, spray paint, etc,) travel to conventions/ other cosplay events, and pay for my traditional art supplies, (acrylic and oil paints, canvases and brushes.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCAN I CANCEL ANY TIME?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYES!! you can cancel at any time you would like. If you choose that you want to change the amount you can do this as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you choose not to fund me I hope that you still enjoy my content!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
