It might be an adult coloring book, an animated short, a new song, a tutorial, comic or even better, collaborations with other artists. Specificall,y I have started an initiative called \"The Hair Project\", where we go bi-monthly to a Montreal shelter to cut hair for free. \u003cbr\u003eYou can have access to patron exclusive content that no one else will see. I mean it! Expect downloadable prints and pages, writing, mp3s, etc. I\u0027ll also continue volunteering for homelessness and youth organizations in Montreal, and contribute my skills to their efforts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027ll be doing it:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was 14 years old, I would go to the punk shows in my hometown. I would create pins, badges, stenciled hats, skirts etc. and set up a table at the show and sell it. I loved doing it. Nothing has really changed since then except I have moved to other digital platforms. Patreon is this incredible thing that allows artists to continue creating while being able to sustain themselves and their craft. It creates this amazing community of people supporting other people. It also allows art to come into fruition that maybe wouldn\u2019t have existed without support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me on Patreon, you are helping me to sustain the work that makes me happy. You will be allowing me to invest the time and care into projects that I can then pass onto you. When you pledge me, you\u0027re allowing a piece of art to be created, that wouldn\u0027t have been otherwise. I am a firm believer in crowdfunding support. I pass on the support to people who are searching for the same artistic freedom as me, and people who are as attached to a sense of community as I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to help in other ways that doesn\u0027t involve monetary support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s great and I am so very thankful. You can always support an artist you love by interacting with their social media. Share their images, their music, their projects. Social media has so much power. By sharing it you\u0027re allowing their work to step even further than their own reach. That\u0027s powerful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026gt; My\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://instagram.com/triciarobinsonillustration\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIllustration Account\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://instagram.com/triciarobinsonphotography/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePhotography Account\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026gt; My\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tricia-Robinson-Photography\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePhotography Fan Page\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/triciarobinsonillustration\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIllustration Fan Page\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I\u0027ve always had a general and vast interest in the arts. I\u0027ve been playing guitar since 14, doing photography since 16, and drawing/painting for probably longer. I originally began selling my work on Etsy and to the people of Montreal to help raise money for my cat, Kevin Bacon, who was very ill at the veterinarians. Crowdfunding saved his life. I realized how much fun I had doing it and now continue doing original work and commissions. I often use my art to help raise money for different animal shelters in Canada.",

I\u0027d be able to focus on my efforts in non profit youth and homelessness organizations in the city, and use my skills to generate income for those organizations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d also purchase an easily transportable computer so work can still be done on the road. I often visit my family out of Montreal and when I visit I am unable to work and promote my work so it hurts me as an artist. A portable work station would make getting my personal projects to you, my patrons, so much more accessible!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
