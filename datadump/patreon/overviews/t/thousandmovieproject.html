    "summary": "The Thousand Movie Project is a series of personal essays, equal parts critical and reflective, in response to every movie in Steven Jay Schneider\u0027s book \u003cem\u003e1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\u003c/em\u003e. Now and then I\u0027ll be hosting a contributor\u0027s essay (hopefully more and more as various writers get wind of it and show interest), with a spattering of multimedia responses, but for the most part the project is a personal one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI graduated from college three years ago and while I think I\u0027ve learned a lot in that time, read plenty of books and met lotsa people and listened to their stories, I\u0027ve had this longstanding concern that I\u0027m not growing as quickly as I did when I was in college. And, sure, you tend to go through lots of fazes and mature very quickly between freshman and senior year because you\u0027re in a formative age (if, of course, you enjoy the privilege of attending when you\u0027re young) but I think it\u0027s also because you\u0027ve got professors guiding you through the mazes of information that make up the world. The Thousand Movie Project is, most of all, an effort to expose myself to things that would not have otherwise crossed my paths. And yes it\u0027s risky to be devoting this much time to a list that was compiled by a team of strangers, but the dialogue among those who\u0027ve tread this path before me is encouraging. There\u0027s growth to be had, it seems, especially if you\u0027re really opening yourself up and trying to learn about not just the craft of filmmaking, and of the individuals involved in its production, but also about the geographical, historical, and cultural origins of those works.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the rate of two essays per week I suspect the project will run for about seven years. \u003cstrong\u003eFunds donated through this Patreon will go toward the quickly-accumulating expenses of movie rentals (about $4 each, and I\u0027m watching roughly four movies a week), the pursuit and acquisition of obscure movies (a really rare one can go from $30 to a couple hundred, and it\u0027s looking like I\u0027ll have to get region-free DVD player at some point in the future, maybe even a laser disc player), as well as the miscellaneous expenses of running a website. The domain, layout, occasional advertisement.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m only asking/allowing for almost imperceptibly small monthly donations. This is a big project but it isn\u0027t a startup or anything. If I end up spending a few thousand dollars it\u0027ll be over a pretty long haul. This project is about making a longstanding connection with a number of readers. My emphatic thanks to those of you who\u0027ll give it up for the cause. You\u0027ll be getting that thanks in writing."
