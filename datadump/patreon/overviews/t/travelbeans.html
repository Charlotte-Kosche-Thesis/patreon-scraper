    "summary": "We met 5 years ago on our own solo backpacking adventures and have been travelling or saving to travel ever since. We are creating our own story and the last 2 years have been better than we could have ever imagined. We truly want to inspire others to do the same. The world is not how the media portrays and we firmly believe we can create a movement of tolerance through seeing it together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are currently at the start of our latest adventure and we are terrified! We have booked one way flights to Thailand with very little money in the bank in the hope that we can create a business that will help turn travel into a lifestyle, not just a hobby.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo travel is our decision and funding it is our responsibility!\u003c/strong\u003e We are now focusing on making this our lifestyle with our own production company but we want to keep creating valuable content for you at the same time. We have never taken any handouts and have earned all of our money to travel so Patreon has never been on our radar. However, we are now at the point where we really could use your support but only feel comfortable if we can provide you with value so have devised the different structures to offer you something for your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust by watching our videos you are doing more than we could ever ask but any support you show will go directly towards creating more content and help us during the uncertain road ahead.\u003cbr\u003e"
