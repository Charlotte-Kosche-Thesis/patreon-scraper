All Patreon funds will be used to get the channel back up and running again! \u003cbr\u003e\nPlease keep in mind that pledges may not result in more videos uploaded and that the videos I do upload will be of lower/inconsistent quality for the foreseeable future.\u003cbr\u003e\nI do plan to expand this page at a later date, adding goals and rewards. Until then, you\u0027ll be able to find update videos on my channel, as to where I\u0027m at with bringing the channel back. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBelow is a preview of my future Patreon page for when the channel is fully operational..\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(245, 53, 170);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nHey I\u0027m Lauren from TastyPC and welcome to my Patreon page!! ^-^\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027ve found yourself here, it\u2019s likely that you\u0027ve already helped to support my channel in some way! Be it by simply watching my videos, commenting under them, or subscribing; you\u0027ve already helped me to do what I love! So from the bottom of my heart, thank you for your support and I promise that you\u2019ll never need to do any more than this to be able to watch my videos. \u0026lt;3\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, if you are crazy enough to want to take your support to the next level, and directly help fund new content, new equipment and keep TastyPC running then this is the place to do it!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst though, please consider the many other, much more deserving causes. Especially, all the many other content creators, who not only make absolutely amazing content, but make it on a more regular basis than I can currently manage. If you decide to support a different project, I completely understand, and am truly flattered that you even took the time to consider TastyPC. :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSecondly, please be aware that I\u0027m just not a very good YouTuber.. I\u0027m a shy, quiet, introvert, with low self-esteem, who normally dives out of a room if someone pulls out a camera. Despite this though, making YouTube videos is genuinely my dream (weird I know) and it makes me happier than anything else in the world! I can\u2019t think of any other job I\u2019d rather do. So, although I can\u2019t promise that your support will allow me to develop the level of confidence needed to become the presenter that you deserve (and that I aspire to be), I can promise that I\u2019ll never stop trying to make the best content I possibly can for you!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(245, 53, 170);\"\u003eHow does this effect ads/sponsorships?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy ultimate goal is to get enough support through Patreon to make TastyPC fully-funded by its viewers. But for now I will still look to get additional funding through ad placements, such as banners, pre-rolls, product placements, logos and adverts.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI may also make fully-sponsored content occasionally, where a manufacturer has purchased the creation of a video. However please rest assured that it will never be possible for a manufacturer to purchase a positive review from me. The only way to get the TastyPC seal of approval is to make a great product!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ll always be open with my viewers about sponsorships and if you have any questions feel free to ask me. :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(245, 53, 170);\"\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this! \u0026lt;3\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhether you decide to simply continue as a viewer and subscriber, or choose to become a Patron and help make TastyPC even better, I thank you for your support and your belief in me and the channel! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLove, Lauren xx\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
