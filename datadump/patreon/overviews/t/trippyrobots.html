My friend and I, writer Adam Winchell made comics together in junior high and high school, but life took us both in other directions. This has been a dream put on the back burner for far to long. Now with the rise of crowdfunding, and a surge in popularity of indie comics, we hope now is a good time to try and make our mark. We are currently developing 3 titles, the first one in production now is \"Down River\".\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease take a look around, We will be offering plenty of free content, but your support will help keep the ball rolling. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(165, 165, 165);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003ePlus, we\u0027re offering some really great rewards for your patronage!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003ePatrons will have first access to the process as it happens while also receiving great rewards and access to tutorials and educational resources\u00a0as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis will mostly pertain to the artistic side of the venture for now, most things to do with the story will be kept under wraps so we don\u0027t spoil our own book.
