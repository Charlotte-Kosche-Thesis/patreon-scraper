I am Kim Phan and I am a student artist, watercolorist, illustrator, and foodie!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been taking art classes for four years now and more than one class per year. I have taken five traditional art classes and two pottery classes. Aside those, I have taken a creative writing class which helps me in creating a story behind my pieces. I\u0027ve always been drawn to art as a small child, I drew a lot. I drew on anything I could get my hands on. I drew on lined notebook paper. I drew on clean, crisp printer paper. I even drew on walls (which is a bad idea that I do not recommend). I drew everything that a small child could imagine. Still life. Nature. Fan art (Haha). It wasn\u0027t until my freshman year of high school that I realized that art was my passion and it wasn\u0027t until my junior year that I fell in love with watercolor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an imaginative person. I am fascinated with creating new and wondrous worlds that no one has seen or heard of. Art is a portal for me to create these worlds. Canvases are a window to my mind and the dreams that are my inspiration. I love making worlds, from fantasy to sci-fi and everything in between. Whether I paint or draw, I feel as if my art is living and growing. In my future, I want to create more and more fantastic worlds. I want my dreamscapes to become a reality, one piece at a time. To create these worlds, I use oil paints, because it is bold and rich in color. It has the depth and beauty that I want my worlds to have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a \u003ca href=\"http://thephanartist.weebly.com/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e that\u0027s still in its infancy but will grow as time passes.
