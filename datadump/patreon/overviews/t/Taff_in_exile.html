    "summary": "This is my\nFan-Tasy-Dastic! Patreon campaign page!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n I would like to take a minute to thank the huge support I have received from my viewers and subscribers and\nto let you know I appreciate all the kind words and helpful information you\nhave given me. I did not foresee recording my game footage would be enjoyed by\nso many people around the world, Thankyou!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo the main purpose of this Patreon\ncampaign is to assist me with sustaining and improving the channel. Unfortunately, providing long form content (ie\nlonger than 15min videos) takes a great deal of time and\ndedication. Video creation is still a hobby for me and it has increasingly become a time consuming black hole with all the editing and admin required as the channel grows. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m effectively\nworking a part-time job to keep up with all the tasks related to running the channels. As time goes on, the desired quality / variation and new features\nexpected of content creators continues to rise along with the running costs of\nkeeping the show going. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m a realist and know\nthat there is very little chance of this becoming a full time job and therefore\nwill remain a hobby. However as circumstances change I\u0027m no longer in a\nposition to solely finance the ongoing channel costs. The increased costs\ninclude a variety of things ranging from purchasing new games, software DLC,  hardware replacements,  Software licences, server hosting to the\nincrease in electricity costs due to the PC\u0027s running 24/7 whilst rendering/uploading. I do not\ncalculate the time I invest into the channels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve been a content\ncreator for 3 years now, and we are coming up to the point of a required major upgrade\nto the rigs which is a very daunting prospect. I\u0027ll be honest, I\u0027m\nuncomfortable asking for support via donations, however a number of people have\ncontacted me on email, via messages/comments if they can subscribe to my twitch\nchannel for example or if they can do a re-occurring donation. To this point\nI\u0027ve always thanked them for the support but dismissed any need to donate, however now maybe the time to swallow my pride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo become a Patron, you can pledge any\namount you\u0027d like (check\nout Patreon\u0027s FAQ at the very bottom of the page for more info). When you pledge via Patreon, you\u0027ll be giving money each month\nto help me keep producing all the content you love. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nFinally, while\nimportant, money is not everything. I still appreciate every view, comment and\nrating I get from you guys. If you are not in a position to donate don\u0027t worry,\njust keep watching the videos and enjoying the content, may be consider\nallowing the ads on the videos to play.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnyway thankyou for\nreading and most importantly thankyou for all your support in whatever way it\ncomes, I really do appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCheers Taff\u003cbr\u003e"
