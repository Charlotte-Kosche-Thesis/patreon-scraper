    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003etl;dr: I want to write more high quality content, but that takes time, and time is money. Support me and I\u0027ll do my best to write high quality content as often as I can (you\u0027ll never be charged for more than one a week). Better yet, once you\u0027ve pledged $10, I\u0027ll send you some stickers for free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI write privacy tutorials and articles over at TheTinHat.com, where every post is the product of hours of work. Unfortunately, as it is for many others, my time is in short supply. I\u0027m currently finishing up a Master\u0027s degree focusing on biometric surveillance and resistance, and will be starting a PhD in 2018, but I don\u0027t want to get lost purely in academic issues; I want to provide practical help to real people. TheTinHat.com is how I attempt to do that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause of the time committment, it can be hard to put the site high on my priority list, particularly when my other priorities are what are putting food on the table. Getting some income in return for my work on the site makes allocating more time to it much more manageable. The problem, however, is that I refuse to paste advertisements from Google all over my privacy site so that everyone is passively sucked into Google\u0027s databases.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eEnter Patreon. I\u0027m asking you to help fund each post I make so that I can create more content and turn a hobby into a job.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0You enjoy my work and want to directly support my ability to write about privacy!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will the money be used for?\u003c/strong\u003e Food, rent, tuition, and the occasional board game. Also, as more goals are achieved, I\u0027ll be setting up extra Tor and I2P relays, as well as donating money to various charities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow many posts per month can I expect? \u003c/strong\u003eFor now, at most once per week. There is a tough trade-off between writing useful content that doesn\u0027t expire in a week (like news posts), and the amount of time that well-crafted and timeless posts require. It\u0027s much harder to build content that\u0027s useful to people for years to come than it is to quickly fire-off some news about some company\u0027s bad data-mining practices. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy per post and not per month?\u003c/strong\u003e Simply because of the fact that given my grad-school schedule, I go through between having a tonne of free time to write posts, and having no time at all. Therefore, because there might be a few stretches each year where I don\u0027t post content, it makes much more sense to just charge per post and write whenever I can!\u003cbr\u003e"
