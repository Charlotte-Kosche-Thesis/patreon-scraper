That something was the interaction with fellow hobbyists.\u00a0 The sheer number of people coming through the door day after day looking for help or guidance with their aquariums, or even just to chat about what was new in their tanks was a great source of joy for me, because at heart I am truly a fish geek!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0 So this past year I started up \"The Fish Guy\" channel on YouTube.\u00a0 Slowly but surely building up an audience of viewers with whom I\u0027ve been able to interact with on a regular basis either through the comments section or during LiveStreams.\u00a0 This has been exactly what I\u0027ve been missing, being able to share my knowledge with people looking for help, and to interact with people that are just as big of fish geeks as I am!\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0 It is my hope that this Patreon page will help offset some the costs of producing content for my channel.\u00a0 I have so many projects and ideas that I would like to work on and showcase in new videos, but currently am limited only by funding.\u00a0 Breeding projects, new tank builds, coral frag tanks, the list goes on and on! Other areas where I feel I\u0027ve been struggling is new hardware not only to make editing/uploading of new videos faster and easier, but to be able to make livestreams/google hangouts more friendly as well! \u00a0 Time is at a premium most days for me, so to able to reduce the amount of time spent in front of the computer would be a huge help, and would mean that I can put out more videos! Between my business, 4 kiddos, a house to maintain, and a wife to keep happy their is rarely enough time/money to go around!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Thank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Jay The Fish Guy\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
