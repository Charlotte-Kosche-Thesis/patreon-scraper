    "summary": "Hey guys, I\u0027m Tina Kenny Jones! I\u0027m a freelance musician, chugging along in this great thing we call life, hoping that the music I\u0027ve been creating for the past few years has had a positive effect on people\u0027s lives. I have my own band, called Tina and the Balance (we play indie alt-rock, with a retro sound, and just released our debut album this past year... download it, or stream it for free\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tinaandthebalance.bandcamp.com/album/making-monsters\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e), and I also play in a band called \"Danny Weinkauf and his Red Pants Band\", a kindie-rock band, where you can hear me playing bass and singing along side the grammy-award-winning bassist of \"They Might Be Giants,\" Danny Weinkauf (we also released a record this past month called \"Totally Osome\", stream for free, or pay what you want\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://dannyweinkauf.bandcamp.com/album/totally-osome\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e). I also compose, teach, do recording session work, play cover gigs... whatever pays the bills. I have been playing the piano since I\u0027m 3, studied Film Scoring at Berklee College of Music, and now I\u0027m studying at Brooklyn College to become a certified music teacher for the NYC Department of Education!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been passionate about creating different types of music; on my YouTube channel you can see me playing in my own band, playing the ukulele and singing, having fun with my loop-pedal, and most notably, my one-woman-band videos. I\u0027m hoping that by starting this Patreon page, this website\u00a0will aid me further in this journey by rallying YOUR help. As a full-time musician, it can be difficult for me to finance many of the musical projects I envision. By subscribing to this website, it gives you an opportunity to invest in me, and my music. You have the option of making a monthly pledge (literally, any amount helps... even $1 a month goes a long way), and this directly helps to fund any projects I\u0027m working on. Also, for choosing to invest in me, you get perks depending on the amount you give! Perhaps you\u0027ll get a free download of a song exclusive only to Patreon members, access to special video content for investor-eyes-only, or yearly handmade gifts as a thank you for your support. The possibilities are endless!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, by supporting me, you never know what I\u0027ll decide to come out with (though hopefully it\u0027ll be something you really enjoy). I like to keep it interesting. Maybe one day it\u0027ll be an original rock song, another time a really cool piece of chamber music, or perhaps I\u0027ll do another one-woman band cover! Maybe it\u0027ll be a cover of a famous song, but arranged only for voice and loop pedal. What I do know is that by having a steady stream of income, not only will this give me the confidence to create more of what you hopefully love, but it will allow me the time to prioritize these creations, as time is money. Please consider supporting my music! \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-TKJ"
