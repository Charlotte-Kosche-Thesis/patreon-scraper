    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello. \u00a0My name is Michael Pocse, most known by the alias of Timbertaft on YouTube.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a passion for creating video content and singing/song production. \u00a0I found YouTube to be a great outlet for this, allowing me to find an audience while doing the things I love, and not being limited by having to sacrifice one or the other in the process. \u00a0The end result is a channel of music, humor, passionate opinions, all wrapped up under the umbrella of the video game medium, a form of entertainment that has dominated my life and is a perpetual influence in my hobbies and decisions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like my channel.  I like what I make for it, and I like spending my time on it, but to help keep it growing I know I need more than just willpower.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo hey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis place, Patreon, is where you can go to help me make what I make even better. \u00a0But what is it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that lets you support your favorite content creators easily! It is similar in concept to Kickstarter in the sense that you\u2019re pledging a certain amount of money in return for content and rewards, but unlike Kickstarter, you\u0027re supporting smaller projects by pledging support for each small piece that is put out on a release by release basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can set a monthly cap for your contributions, so you\u2019ll never go over the amount you set regardless of how many videos get uploaded (Your Patreon contributions will only go towards songs, top 10s, and Reviews, or as I dub it the \"main\" content that I upload on my channel \u2013 you will never be charged for vlogs, update videos, or stream highlight reels.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can adjust or cancel your patron donations at any time. \u00a0There is no restriction in how you handle your funds here, and every donation is \u00a0entirely voluntary. \u00a0While you won\u0027t win any donor awards by refusing to be a patron, it will not stop me from continuing to appreciate your views, subscriptions, and continued support as I make my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to currently only doing YouTube as a hobby, release times can vary, though I tend to only release \"main\" content every two-three weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis means a lot to me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe kind of content I create on my channel is the kind of thing you can\u0027t find anywhere else. \u00a0It is a fusion of every thing I love: every passion, talent, and ability I have at my disposal goes into these silly little comedy video game musical things. \u00a0I want to be able to keep on doing it for a long time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy contributing here, you are sincerely helping me develop my dream into a more tangible reality and that is not something that I can easily forget to be grateful for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being the awesome audience that I\u0027ve come to love and respect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eMichael \"Timbertaft\" Pocse\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
