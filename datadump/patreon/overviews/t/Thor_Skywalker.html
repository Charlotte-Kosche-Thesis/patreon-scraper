    "summary": "Now, I want to start by saying thank you for even coming here to consider supporting what I do on YouTube (and what I might do down the road, such as writing a novel).\u00a0 But at the same time, I want to keep it honest with you and tell you my story and what you can expect by supporting me.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started YouTube, I never really thought it\u0027d go anywhere.\u00a0 My goal was to periodically make some videos about Star Wars and to get a few subscribers to \"talk some Star Wars with\" from time to time and it never crossed my mind anything more would come of it than that. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, after making about a dozen videos or so, I had amassed 11 subscribers--none of which seemed all too interested in leaving comments and talking with me--so I quickly realized that maybe this just wasn\u0027t for me and forget about making videos for awhile...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeveral months later, and after getting frustrated at the endless string of elaborate Rey\u0027s parent\u0027s videos I was watching on YouTube... I made a video boldly titled: \"The Last Rey\u0027s Parent\u0027s Video You Ever Need to Watch\" where I proposed that Rey\u0027s parents would essentially be nobody and irrelevant to the story. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I hit the publish button on that video, I had no idea my entire life was about to change.\u00a0 I honestly thought I\u0027d get a dozen views on it (like with my other videos) and that no one would even leave a comment.\u00a0 However, within a couple hours, it had over a thousand views and plenty of comments--some good... some bad.\u00a0 And as the days went by, a thousand views turned into a hundred thousand and a couple dozen comments turned into hundreds and then thousands... and I did everything I could to read and respond to each and every person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd to this day, a little over a year later, I still do that.\u00a0 I still read every comment I get (or at least 99% of them, some do slip by me no doubt) and respond to as many people as I can, though that is not always easy because I also have a full time job, family and friends, and other responsibilities to tend to.\u00a0 And I\u0027m not trying to complain, I truly love my life and doing what I do on YouTube.\u00a0 Being able to talk Star Wars with so many amazing fellow fans is beyond a dream come true... and, honestly, I just want to be able to do more of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you choose to support me, you\u0027ll be allowing me to potentially spend more time doing this; more time creating videos, telling stories, talking Star Wars and maybe even allowing me to write a novel--something I have always wanted to do but lacked the time for... and that\u0027s it.\u00a0 I\u0027m not going to promise rewards, prizes, special recognition or any kind of special attention... because that defeats the purpose of why I started this channel in the first place and why I love doing this:\u00a0 And that\u0027s talking Star Wars with anyone and everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
