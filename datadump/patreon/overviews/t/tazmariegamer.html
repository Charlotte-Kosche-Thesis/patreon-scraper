From GameBoy to XBOX to computer to app games- he plays them \nall.\u003cbr\u003eSo, it really is my sons fault for getting me into watching game play or \nwalk through videos on YouTube. \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\udc4d\u003cbr\u003eWe love watching Dan from The Diamond \nMinecart\u0027s videos, and he adores Ethan from EthanGamerTV.\u003cbr\u003eSo much so, \nthat my son was very inspired to start his own channel.\u003cbr\u003eWe\n took the next step that made the most sense: We worked together on a \ngaming video (he did everything- I did the editing, lol).\u003cbr\u003eAs soon as it was ready, I set his gaming channel up \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb6nv4tHKLqreFE0SD0Na6g\"\u003eon YouTube\u003c/a\u003e, and we uploaded his first video.\u003cbr\u003e(It\u0027s a Minecraft video of him playing a mini game on a Minecraft server.
