    "summary": "- Coming Soon - Teaser Trailer TBA Late 2017\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProject is in Pre-production phase, going over the tentative script with the potential director. We\u0027re trying to keep it as a short film, due to time constraints.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Patron Goal is for relatively decent filming equipment to get the project\u0027s teaser trailer started. We still need a camera and hopefully a good set of lens, but the prop making portion of this project is relatively done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a side note, if we\u0027re issued a take down notice from Konami, we\u0027re just gonna change the name of the project to something random that isn\u0027t trademarked or owned by them but still MGS related so no worries in that department- thanks for reading! #FucKonami\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca\u003e \u003cimg src=\"//images.dmca.com/Badges/DMCA_logo-std-btn225w.png?ID=e5abae0a-793d-48db-ae50-01849981ffdf\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e  \u003cbr\u003eLEGAL PRIVACY POLICY: Any UNAUTHORIZED use of my profile, video, pictures or audio in any form or in a forum now or in the future is not permissible without my expressed written consent.
