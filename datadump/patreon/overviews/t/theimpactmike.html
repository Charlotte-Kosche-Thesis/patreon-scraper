It\u0027s time to take the digital relationship and make it personal! We want to meet up face to face and reinforce the strength of The Impact Entrepreneur Community. We are beginning to plan for local and regional Meet Ups with networking opportunities, featured speakers and live podcast recordings. In addition to that, we are in the beginning stages of brainstorming the first ever IMPACT YOU SUMMIT. Woot, woot!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your patronage, we hope to be able to cover all the costs that go into producing content, a digital hub, merchandise and in person events to continue the momentum built in each weekly episode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you say?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe do the show every week for you, the listener. Without you, there\u0027s no reason to even do a show. But time is moving on, and we\u0027ve realized that if we\u0027re going to turn TIES into something even greater, now is the moment to do so! I\u0027ve kept it basically free of advertisements and I want to continue doing that. We all have enough noise in our lives; we don\u0027t need any additional distractions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re super excited about all the new ideas and directions we have planned for the show, the brand and the impact we hope to have in the world.
