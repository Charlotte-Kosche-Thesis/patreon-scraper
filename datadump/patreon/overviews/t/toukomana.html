It has, single-handedly, changed my entire life for the better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack in 2008, a high school friend invited me to my first anime convention. I was familiar with cosplay, thanks to seeing photos of Yu-Gi-Oh! cosplay on deviantArt, but I didn\u0027t think that I could ever go to a convention because they were all on the coasts. But her invitation told me that there was one in my area named Naka-Kon. My mother and I pulled together a really basic Namine cosplay from Kingdom Hearts II, but I had the time of my life. I kept going back year after year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/FbnCW98.jpg\" style=\"width: 284px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(left: myself, right: an Amy Rose cosplayer)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut come 2011, my entire life was changed and defined by this cosplay weekend. I had bought a Yusei Fudo cosplay in August 2010, wore it to one other convention, and decided to wear it to Naka-Kon 2011. That convention I got to meet my cosplay idols [a.k.a. the people whose Yu-Gi-Oh! cosplay photos I had seen years ago], I had a great time, and then I additionally met my fiance. I not only started to take cosplay more seriously from then on, but I also found some great friends that were the base for my improvement. Especially my fiance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HukbLnW.jpg\" style=\"width: 291px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(from the left: my fiance, Malindachan, myself, a friend named Jess)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy fiance and I chose our first couple cosplay later that year, Touko/Hilda and N Harmonia from Pokemon Black/White, which came out in America in the same year. We\u0027ve been cosplaying them ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vqMjle4.jpg\" style=\"width: 285px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(From the debut of these cosplays, Anime Festival Wichita)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since then, I continued to either grab closet cosplays or make cosplays from scratch. In 2013, I really got into doing photography because of cosplay. My parents were sweet enough to purchase me a Canon Rebel T3i that I use to this day. I now run my own photography business that mostly focuses on cosplay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Dap0ddf.jpg?1\" style=\"width: 245px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(A recent photo I took of myself with a tripod and two ring lights.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplay also landed me a modeling job in 2016 as a model for Career Images Model and Talent Agency Inc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/1jwFkPk.png\" style=\"width: 287px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Photo by James Fotoz, editing by me)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven though cosplay has brought me amazing opportunities, the opportunities have not brought much in terms of income. Despite working at a full-time job I enjoy and pays me well, my heart is still seeking to create. I want to create photos that are works of art that can be enjoyed. I want to create costumes that are works of art too. Creative jobs are few and far between, thus I came to Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DL4lKNy.jpg\" style=\"width: 273px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Shadow the Hedgehog cosplay; the design is by me and pieces were\u00a0made or edited by me.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal in life is to make cosplay, modeling and photography my main source of income. These things are my biggest passions in life and I want nothing more than to do that for a living. However, a more realistic goal is to consider the work I do here for Patreon as a part-time job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jEiFTS9.jpg\" style=\"width: 273px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Camilla cosplay by me, photo by Stellare Photography)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny money coming from Patreon will not only go to cosplay and photography, but also supporting me and my soon-to-be husband. My fiance and I need to pay for our apartment, college debt, and other miscellaneous living expenses, purchase my business license for photography, get the equipment necessary for a studio, and to recover from paying for our wedding in March.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are wanting to help me in a small way that makes a big difference, I really appreciate it. Even if you can\u0027t become a Patron, sharing alone is a way to get exposure and maybe someone else will be interested in helping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will try to reward and spoil all of you as much as possible because, without all of you, I would not be able to do anything like this. You all are the ones who help me live my dreams, and I cannot thank you enough for taking the time to read all of this and even considering becoming a Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all again and stay sweet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Touko Mana\u003cbr\u003e"
