Why is it named The MMA Road Show, you ask? My name is John Morgan, and I am the lead staff reporter for MMAjunkie. Each week, I sit down \u2013 often on location from spots around the globe or in my hometown of Las Vegas \u2013 to record the show and talk about my world travels covering the sport, giving you behind-the-scenes stories that don\u0027t always show up in the headlines. MMAjunkie videographer and The MMA Road Show producer \"Cold Coffee\" often sits in on the show, as we bring you interviews from and access to the biggest names in MMA.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve been doing this show since 2015, and while we\u0027re committed to keeping the content free to all listeners, there are costs involved behind the scenes, and we\u0027d also like to expand our offerings, which requires additional financial support. For that, we\u0027ve launched this official Patreon page.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d appreciate any level of support you can offer and can assure you we\u0027ll work hard to ensure it\u0027s money well invested. In the meantime, sit back and let us entertain you with stories from the road and beyond. No other podcast does the leg work to bring you new and exciting episodes recorded on location from so many venues around the world, hence the name \"The MMA Road Show.\" Get your passport ready and crack open your frosty beverage of choice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
