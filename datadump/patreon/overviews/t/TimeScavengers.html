Together we develop and curate the content on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://timescavengers.blog/\"\u003eTimeScavengers.blog\u003c/a\u003e. We explore and explain climate change and evolution through the lens of deep/geologic time. We have 30+ content pages that explore science, data, paleontology, geology, isotopes, paleoclimatology, and more. Additionally, we have several blog components that brings the public into the lives of scientists. Scientists are classically pictured in lab coats with wild hair - this is simply not the case for 99% of scientists. We hope to dispel some misconceptions about scientists and help make our work and lives more understandable!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur blogs include:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://timescavengers.blog/category/meet-the-scientist/\"\u003eMeet the Scientist\u003c/a\u003e, where we feature new scientists twice a month to explore their work, experiences, and drive for scientific curiosity.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://timescavengers.blog/category/climate-paleo-news/\"\u003eClimate \u0026amp; Paleo News\u003c/a\u003e, blogs\u00a0dissect a recent scientific article and provides a better understanding of the bigger picture for a non-science audience.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://timescavengers.blog/category/field-excursions/\"\u003eField Excursions\u003c/a\u003e, showcase our field trips, research trips, or just fun adventures outside that involve geology, paleontology, or related content.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://timescavengers.blog/category/education-outreach/\"\u003eEducation and Outreach\u003c/a\u003e, a blog where we show how we give back to our local communities through outreach or educational events, and why doing so is important.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://timescavengers.blog/category/science-bytes/\"\u003eScience Bytes\u003c/a\u003e, where we explain what we, as scientists, do on a regular basis.

This ranges from applying to graduate school to being part of marginalized groups and a scientist, and how we navigate our struggles and successes.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWe have many collaborators that are listed on our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://timescavengers.blog/biography/\"\u003ebiography page\u003c/a\u003e. We would not be able to keep the blog components functioning without the help of our friends and collaborators. The website is expensive to keep up on WordPress and we hope to continue promoting the site through Facebook and Twitter. This is where you, the patrons, come in! We hope to keep the site up and running indefinitely. We are currently not in secure financial situations to pay for it out of our graduate stipends. We hope that through releasing content early on Patreon we are able to raise enough funds to keep our work moving forward!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading and please check out our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TimeScavengers/\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/TimeScavengers\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e communities!\u003cbr\u003e"
