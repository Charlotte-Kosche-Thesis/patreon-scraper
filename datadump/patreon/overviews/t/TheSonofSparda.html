We\u0027ve got breadsticks!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eName\u0027s Scotty Bishop, and I have a channel on YouTube by the name of \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Son of Sparda\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e. Ever since 2014, I\u0027ve been making video content mainly centered around gaming, and I\u0027m glad that I\u0027ve been able to provide entertainment to people for as long as that amount of time and I hope to continue doing so as long as I\u0027m able to! Here\u0027s the basic gist of what kind of content I make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Countdowns-\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eYeah, countdowns undoubtedly the most recognizable type of content on my channel. The basics of these videos are self-explanatory, really. I pick a topic, positive or negative, relating to video games, think of usually 10 entries relating to said topic, and try and order them. Undoubtedly, these are the videos that take the most effort to make concerning scripting, editing, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Video Reviews-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eHere we\u0027ve got my other regular series of video content on my channel. Video Reviews are....well....basically that. Pick a game and make a video giving my in depth thoughts on it. In between the opening and final verdict, the videos are segmented to analyze the game\u0027s story, presentation, and gameplay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Discussion Videos-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eMostly a recent series of videos I\u0027ve started doing on my channel that I hope to maybe make into a regular series in the same vein as countdowns and video reviews. Basically just picking a topic and talking for a while about said topic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Commentaries-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eI mean, it seems that I only do about 2 of these things each year, but it is technically a series of videos I have done and do want to get more of done in the future. Basically doing a response to a video I find flawed enough to make a response to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Why Patreon?!-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eOutside this whole video making hobby, I\u0027m attending college. And as me saying I\u0027m a \"college student\" probably gives away, I\u0027m pretty much broke and don\u0027t exactly have options to make substantial income until I graduate. I figured that opening a Patreon could be of use for me to earn a bit more off of a hobby that I\u0027ve dedicated so much time and energy into over these past few years. Of course, donating is entirely optional and it\u0027s perfectly fine if you can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to do so. I have no intentions of the Patreon page negatively effecting output of content, in fact I hope that maybe it\u0027ll increase productivity, but I will do what I can make it worthwhile for anyone that does decide to donate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Certain Rules and Conditions-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eIn the tiers that involve requesting videos, you can only do one request per each. You can go for multiple categories, but only one time for any of the 5. You may continue to donate under any of those tiers if you wish, but don\u0027t expect much more out of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the tiers with limited slots relating to editing videos, I ask that you please leave after one donation to make room for someone else who\u0027d want to have a video edited for them. Theoretically, you can go for as many as you\u0027d like in general, but please wait a while or until a few others have a turn at it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
