I create, lead, and perform in new theatre works that deal with body language, the power of objects, and the intersection between theatre and games. I maintain an active artistic practice, creating 2-3 full independent projects a year; am the founder of WEIRDO, a monthly open mic night for short-form live artwork; am the Head Administrator of WPA WPA; and am a member of The Bats at The Flea Theatre, among many other things! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page is where you can support my work with small and easy monthly \ndonations that will make it possible for me to afford rehearsal space, pay my \ncollaborators, and generally keep making the best theatre that I can. In exchange, I am offering some sweet perks, the sweetest of which is that, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eif you pledge at the $5 level or above, I will make you a custom-made theatre piece\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Seriously. For the price of a fancy latte, you can get your very own piece of bespoke live art. I\u0027m excited. Are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW TO PLEDGE\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis page comes from Patreon, a platform that helps artists support their craft by connecting them with patrons who support their work through small, per-project donations. By paying me tiny amounts of money per project, you make it possible for me to make theatre and performance art for you and a whole bunch of other people!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClick the orange button above to become a patron. Pick your pledge and reward level, set a monthly maximum if you\u0027d like, enter your payment info, click the Confirm button, and you\u0027re good to go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges are charged at the end of each month, when the Patreon folks tally up how many updates I posted during that month. I\u0027ll update whenever a project that I am a \u003cstrong\u003elead artist on\u003c/strong\u003e first occurs or has its opening night. I\u0027ll also post a monthly \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGeneral Update\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e on how ALL my current projects are going, including my own work, bespoke theatre pieces, and any other projects I\u0027m working on at The Flea or other companies.

But, you can set a monthly maximum when you create your pledge, so you never have to spend more than you want to! If you set your monthly cap at $5, then you will never pay me more than $5 in any given month, even if I post a bazillion updates. And you can change your pledge amount or cancel your pledge at any time.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGETTING A CUSTOM THEATRE PIECE\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eONCE YOU HAVE COMPLETED YOUR PLEDGE: Email\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e bespoketheatre @ gmail.com \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ewith your name, the city or area that you live in, and a brief description of what you\u0027re interested in for your piece.

I also believe that, at the end of the day, creating theatre and live art is an act of caretaking and generosity. I can\u0027t think of a better way to take care of a large, diverse group of people then by making work in collaboration with them, listening to each person\u0027s hopes and desires for what they want to experience, and then working with them to make that experience a reality. Through the magic of the Internet, I can introduce that possibility to anyone with an Internet connection. And, by setting the price point for that possibility at $5, I can make it attainable to the biggest and most diverse group of people that I can. Making personal artmaking available to the masses - for me, that\u0027s what making theatre is all about. And I can\u0027t wait to start making that happen through this Patreon campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMORE ABOUT TAYLOR\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTaylor Edelhart is a devised theatremaker and performer whose original work focuses on body language, the power of objects, all things sinister, and the intersection between theatre and games.
