Through the power of storytelling, theatre, live art and debate, The Party Somewhere Else wants to champion female-led projects and give everyone a great night out. We organised a sell-out scratch night in July 2017, an Open House and Open Mic event in January 2018, and  now we\u0027re holding a week-long festival at Nottingham Playhouse from the 20th to 24th March 2018.

We want all artists involved to be paid for their time, for sharing their skills, and for showcasing their work. We are very grateful to have received funding from Arts Council England in order to put on our first festival. Ticket income is split between the artists and Nottingham Playhouse, but we as organisers have given our time and resources for free to programme, promote, and run both this festival and our previous events.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis means we need your help to carry on the party. If you love what we\u0027re doing and want to see it continue, please consider supporting us by giving a one off donation or signing up for however much you can afford to give monthly. We will love you forever for it, we promise.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now we\u0027re focussed on getting the festival on, but as soon as it\u0027s done we\u0027ll be back here to add some monthly rewards and a video explaining how our Patreon funds will be spent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANKS!\u003cbr\u003e"
