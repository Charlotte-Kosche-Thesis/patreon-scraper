My name is Theodore (Ted) Jander (see my bio below for more). The \u003cem\u003eSeasonal Scriptures in Song\u003c/em\u003e project grew out of my passion for composing sacred music. Through \u003cem\u003eSeasonal Scriptures in Song\u003c/em\u003e, I will compose a new song every month using rhyming versions of scripture verses or the scriptural text as is. This aids in learning Bible verses or passages pertaining to church seasons and grows one\u2019s Scriptural foundation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis mission is grounded in Colossians 3:16, \u201cLet the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.\u201d While the mission is initially manifested in scripture based song, the vision of \u003cem\u003eSeasonal Scriptures in Song\u003c/em\u003e is to realize:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMany lives, across the globe, enriched and transformed, having embodied scripture through music and song;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn ongoing and creative means to assist teachers, parents, pastors, music directors, children, families, and congregations embody the scriptures through song;\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA transformative, growing, and readily available canon of music for small and large churches alike all around the world.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to develop the project further, making the above vision a reality; to distribute the music beyond the conventional marketplace, and to make a living as a composer, I need your support. So\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2026here is what you can do!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eYou begin here on Patreon, a website where you can show support to creators who work on projects they enjoy. You can liken it Kickstarter. Only, instead of a one-time donation, Patreon is an ongoing support system in the form of a monthly contribution, or a per creation pledge. By becoming one of my patrons, you pledge a certain amount each month towards the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a church or individual to receive a copy of the music and the usage rights for unlimited reproduction of the song, the cost would be no more than the cost equal to three or four lattes a month from your local coffee shops ($10/month). You do not have to be super wealthy like the patrons of old who supported the likes of Bach, Haydn, Mozart, etc. Every contribution helps, no matter how small. You can even set a monthly max, so you never go over your budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I will be able to release one new piece of content each month. Also, this reliable income will give me the flexibility to focus more time on composing music for \u003cem\u003eSeasonal Scriptures in Song\u003c/em\u003e, as well as other future projects, and most importantly, in serving each of you through the benefits of your patron level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow will I serve you, my partners in this Patreon project, besides just writing music and making it available? You will be entitled to special rewards. Plus, in the \u003cstrong\u003eAll Posts\u003c/strong\u003e feed, you can share stories, art, etc. as well as leave your comments. Take a look at the column on the right to see all of the different benefits that are available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so very much for taking the time to read all about this project! I humbly invite you to join me in this venture where we can work together and make great music happen. All the while, I will serve you as best I am able within this thriving, supportive, and independent music community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheodore A.

I have been composing and arranging for a little over twenty years, although singing was my first passion. Growing up in a singing family helped build my confidence to take those first big steps onto a stage at the age of ten. I have not stopped performing since. From participating in grade school choirs, church choirs, collegiate ensembles, to honing my musical chops as Artistic Director and member of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.greenleafsingers.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGreenleaf Singers\u003c/a\u003e (a St. Louis-based Early Music Vocal Ensemble), and as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lccrp.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eComposer-in-Residence\u003c/a\u003e and Worship Ministry Coordinator at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.lcgoodshepherd.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLutheran Church of the Good Shepherd\u003c/a\u003e in Hazelwood, Missouri, sacred choral music emerged as my passion, more specifically, composing music for the church.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy enthusiasm for writing music was nurtured through compositional studies while completing my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.umsl.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBachelors in Music Education\u003c/a\u003e, my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.webster.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMaster of Arts\u003c/a\u003e degree with an emphasis in Choral Studies and Composition and studying counterpoint and composition at the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.eamusic.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEuropean American Musical Alliance\u003c/a\u003e program in Paris, France. Teaching various music classes and ensembles at the middle school and high school levels added to my compositional skill set. Over the past twenty-one years, each of these circumstances provided me with multiple opportunities to also cultivate my music engraving skills utilizing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.eamusic.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFinale Notation Software\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOut of these experiences, my musical\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theodorejander.com/?page_id=54\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eoeuvre\u003c/a\u003e has grown. From this, a new mission has evolved, to create \u003cem\u003eSeasonal Scriptures in Song\u003c/em\u003e. This project will grow the available canon of music for small and large churches alike all around the world, all for just the cost equal to three or four lattes a month from your local coffee shops. Teachers, parents, pastors, and music directors will be able to use these songs to help children, as well as families and congregations, embody the scriptures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all these hats (did I forget to mention that I am also a Wellness Consultant for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://jander.juiceplus.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJuice Plus\u003c/a\u003e and an avid cyclist?), I spend as much time as I am able with my two amazing children, Ellie and Evan, and with my fianc\u00e9, Jennifer, who is awesomely supportive, beautiful, and talented.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
