When I began to apply to nursery assistant... I knew something was wrong. From university teacher to nursery assistant? Am I so desperate? (... yes), do I really need money so badly? ( duh!... yes!) Why I am wasting my time searching for bad payed jobs in stead of writing? (because... I need the money?...)\u003cbr\u003eMy husband force me to put my first book as a e-book, waiting to became a best-seller... it did not happened. Is there another solution? I don\u0027t know. What I know is that you must always try.\u003cbr\u003eSo again here I am, trying to earn some money for the things I normally do for free.\u003cbr\u003eIf you help me I will not only continuing writing in Amazing Stories once a week, but I could write also in my blog once a month (I have abandoned it), and I am planning to make flash fiction readings in youtube at least once a month (and both in Spanish and English), and continuing organizing Latin American Science Fictions events in different cons (in 2017 there is worldcon in Helsinki), and of course the most important thing: write my books and eventually translated them to other languages.\u003cbr\u003eSo What do you think? Does it sounds interesting for you?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is what I propose you\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you help me with 1$: You will have access to my Patreon only feed an twice a year you will participated on \"raffle\" to give away books and ready-to-print goodies such as calendars, bookmark, etc at least twice a year.\u003cbr\u003eIf you help me with 3$: You will have access to my Patreon only feed, the \"raffle\" \u00a0and a personal thank you in my blog \"Piedra que corre no coge moho\".\u003cbr\u003eIf you help me with 5$: You will have access to my Patreon only feed, a personal thank you in my blog and you will be in the random surprise group, meaning you will not need to wait to the\"raffle\" to received the goodies, you will have them anyway at least twice a year. And for the books, you will have a double opportunity. On the raffle.\u003cbr\u003eIf you help me with 10$ You will have access to my Patreon only feed, a personal thank you in my blog, a random surprise, double opportunity for \u00a0the books raffle and participation in a interactive web cam once a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will change time to time, I am thinking that if this work I can offer previews to my work, workshops, personal meetings, etc. \u003cbr\u003eI hope you find my work interesting enough, so I can finally breath a little... and send my high maintenance cats to the vet."
