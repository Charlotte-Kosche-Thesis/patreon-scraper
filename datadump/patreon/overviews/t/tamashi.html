    "summary": "Hello and welcome to the official Patreon page of the comic/manga \u003cem\u003eTamashi. \u003c/em\u003eThis is we\u0027re readers and fans can support the continuing efforts of the comic and keep it going. I\u0027m Ryan McCarthy, the creator of the comic, and I\u0027m happy that you would show interest in supporting my series that I have had in the making for a long time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is \u003ca href=\"http://www.ryanmccarthyproductions.com/comics/tamashi/\"\u003eTamashi\u003c/a\u003e?\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTamashi\u003c/em\u003e is a story about self discovery and prejudice. It follows the adventures\u0027 of Tamashi, a young Japanese girl that suddenly finds herself lost and alone in the Ancient Land; a foreign and bizarre place with magic like spirits and unique monsters. Things turnout even more bizzar when she discovers she has the power of the Child of the Moon. She is only one of many special type of people in the Ancient Land that hold powers of nature and life. Many of which are persecuted and feared for these powers. Being a girl from modern day Tokyo, it\u0027s a lot to take in. But with some help of new friends and finding her self confidence, in both herself and her new powers, Tamashi just might find a way home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe series operates on a chapter a month and is planned to last for quite some time. It takes many inspirations from shonen and seinen manga. Series like: \u003cem\u003eOne Piece, Soul Eater, Zatch Bell!, Inuyasha, \u003c/em\u003eand many others.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt has always been my dream to be a cartoonist that creates stories and art that can inspire many different people. (and live off it) Patreon seemed like the best way to help keep this dream in reach and would allow me to interact with fans of my work. \u003cem\u003eTamashi\u003c/em\u003e seemed like a much bigger investment than some of my previous works so I wanted to give readers a way to give back to a series they might enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat would my money be funding?\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe money made here would mostly be used for living expenses and other artists needs that would allow me to work on \u003cem\u003eTamashi\u003c/em\u003e as a job. It will be my job to continue making new chapters and to tell an interesting narrative through the medium of comics. I\u0027m looking to keep a healthy relationship with my readership.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture Perks\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m also planning some future bonus perks for the \u003cem\u003eTamashi\u003c/em\u003e Pateron. Stuff like exclusive discussions on new chapters with the creator (Me), art commissions, and maybe some donator exclusive merchindise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you checking out the \u003cem\u003eTamashi\u003c/em\u003e Patreon.
