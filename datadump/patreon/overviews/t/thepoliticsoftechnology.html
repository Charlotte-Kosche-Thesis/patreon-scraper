    "summary": "I have spent over three decades following, involved, and thinking about democracy. I have worked on election campaigns from city council to the presidential level, including California Governor Jerry Brown\u0027s 1992 Democratic primary run and Governor Howard Dean\u0027s 2004 run. In both campaigns, I helped successfully introduce new communications technologies into the campaign process. In the last couple years, I had the great opportunity to work on elections in Nigeria and Tanzania.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have \u00a0extensive experience studying and working on energy issues. In 2000, I worked to help the City of Santa Monica, California become the first city in the US to get all their electricity generation from renewable sources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the course of my life, I\u0027ve closely observed and studied the evolution of technology as it had an increasing impact on our lives including politics, the economy, and environment, yet we have little politics to either understand what\u0027s happening or technology\u0027s impact. This piece is meant as a foundation to change that, to begin the development of a politics of technology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Politics of Technology\u003c/em\u003e is a beginning to helping develop a vibrant and vital politics for the 21st century. By reading and promoting this first step, you can help build a larger effort to educate, organize and implement a healthier politics addressing the issues we face as a species.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(At the first oil well in Nigeria.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18268103_10155325165687718_2291567226888774837_n.jpg?oh=c438bed52ab64779aac86e7fe764bdd2\u0026amp;oe=59788497\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
