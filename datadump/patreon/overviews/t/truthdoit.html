Now alot of people want me to put on some booty shorts, dumb down my flow and be just another pretty face thats saying the same thing everybody else is rapping about. However with your help I can continue to put out music for the people by the people. I can do what WE want to hear not what radio wants to sell ads with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron and helping me cover the costs of making these videos, music and other art contributes to free expression without compromise. Now I know some cant afford at this time to donate anything and for you please enjoy all the art made here by me. Yet those of you that can give one dollar, three dollars five or more per upload would be a part of \u003cem\u003eTeam Truth\u003c/em\u003e and we have special rewards for doing so. Interested, then check out the page, enjoy the videos and lets make both music and history together see you in the club. \u003cem\u003eTruth\u003c/em\u003e out!\u003cbr\u003e"
