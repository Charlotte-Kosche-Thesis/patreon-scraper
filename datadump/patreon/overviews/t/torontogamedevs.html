However, I don\u0027t think people are passionate about locally created games. People will want their clothes made in Canada, Farmer\u0027s Market\u0027s are full of local food and you always hear people say \"buy local\" - but not for video games. TorontoGameDevs hopes to fix that, by promoting and discussing the games that are created in Toronto, and Southern Ontario.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will The Money Be Used For?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs time went on I\u0027ve realized the costs of running a website can quickly get out of hand. This Patreon is designed to help out with the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo help pay and maintain website costs (hosting, domain, etc)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchasing new, and maintaining old equipment\u00a0for podcasts, youtube videos, and anything else that\u0027s needed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGoing to events across the city/province to help promote and write about Toronto developed games.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI have a full time job, and TorontoGameDevs.com is a hobby which one day could turn into a full time thing. For now though, the goal is reduce costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Are The Rewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatron\u0027s will always get early exclusives to interviews, the podcast, as well as most videos - I\u0027ll post them here on Patreon, and you can set notifications to receive update - however I always tweet out when something is shared.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also occasionally get free games from local developers, which I give out to Patron\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery piece of content we ever do will be free. The writing,\u00a0videos,\u00a0the podcasts, anything else we do in the future, all of it.\u00a0\u00a0That being said it does take a lot of time to manager everything, so please feel free to give whatever you can for as long as you can.\u003cbr\u003e"
