This rather unusual combination of skills and academic qualifications gives me what I hope is a unique approach to working with myth, fairy tales and folklore: my passion is for the \ninsights these traditions can offer us into authentic and meaningful \nways of being which are founded on a deep sense of belonging to place, a\n rootedness in the land we inhabit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent many years living on the wildest Celtic fringes of Britain and Ireland. After several years as a crofter on the remotest shore of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, I now live among the hills and lochs of the Connemara Gaeltacht (an Irish-speaking area) on the far west coast of Ireland. This is the magical place where, in early 2017, I decided to found The Hedge School, to offer academically sound, up-to-date,\n and personally transformative teachings in the native culture, folklore\n and traditions of the Celtic lands. It\u0027s the culmination of a life\u0027s work; the vehicle for bringing the teachings in my books in a practical and focused way to as wide an audience as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://theartofenchantment.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/helligan.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout The Hedge School, and growing a new folk culture\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt its heart, our work at The Hedge School is about growing a new folk culture \u2013 about finding ways to make ancient wisdom, native stories, and traditional knowledge and skills relevant for our lives in today\u0027s challenging world. It\u0027s about living folklorically, about living in ways that are deeply informed by and rooted in the lands we inhabit. It\u0027s not about harking back, but about taking our ancestral traditions and discovering what we might learn from them today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe term \u2018hedge school\u2019 has its roots in\n Ireland; it dates back to the 17th century and attempts to force\n Irish children to attend schools designed to train them in English \nlanguage and customs, and the \u2018true religion\u2019. Rather than submit to \nsuch indoctrination, the Irish went back to the hedge, and created their\n own schools. No institutions, just a healthy respect for the old ways. \nIn 1655 Oliver Cromwell called them trainings in \u2018superstition, \nidolatory and the evill customs of this Nacion.\u2019 We\u2019ll go for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur Hedge School \u2013 a physical location \nas well as a virtual space \u2013 has a similarly subversive intent. No \ninstitutions, no dogma, no prophets or preachers: just the wisdom of the\n hedge, and of the land. The wisdom which the wind blows down from the \njagged peaks of the Connemara mountains, which the sea salts away in the\n vast network of rocky tidal inlets which characterise our coastline. The wisdom of the old stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that what we offer at The Hedge School is deeply needed in these challenging times. In Western societies we are seeing more calls for a return to native wisdom, but we can\u0027t live by the worldviews of other cultures which are rooted in lands and histories that have little relationship to our own. Fine as all of those other traditions are, we don\u0027t need to look to the myths and traditions of others for role models, or for guidance on how to live more authentically, in balance and harmony with the planet on which we depend. We have our own guiding stories, and they are deeply rooted in the heart of our own native landscapes. We draw them out of the wells and the waters; beachcombing, we lift them out of the sand. We dive for them to the bottom of deep lakes, we disinter them from the bogs, we follow their tracks through the shadowy glades of the enchanted forest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s time to reclaim our stories and folk traditions. They ground us, and teach us; they teach us how to find the trail of breadcrumbs which will lead us to our own unique calling. And that\u0027s what The Hedge School is about. I call it \u0027applied mythology\u0027: the reclaiming of our native wisdom, so helping us to live more lightly and more meaningfully. It\u0027s about practical guidance for living well, living authentically, connecting with our places, finding a deep, embodied sense of belongingness to this wide, beautiful Earth. And ultimately, it\u0027s about growing a new folk culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to know more about The Hedge School, its location, and current programme, \u003ca href=\"http://thehedgeschool.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eplease visit our website\u003c/a\u003e.

But all of that doesn\u0027t leave much room for anything else. And my primary aim is to offer more resources which are freely accessible to everyone. I\u0027d like to make The Hedge School website an authoritative source for people looking for accurate information (in the face of so much misinformation on the web!) about the myth and folklore of Britain and Ireland, and the native traditions of these islands. I\u0027d like to offer articles by guests, interviews with people who are choosing to live well in these troubled times, videos, and podcasts. A database of useful articles on a per-topic basis, reading lists and lists of useful links. I\u0027d like to encourage other writers and teachers to join me there, as contributors, co-conspirators, co-creators. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like also to think about the possibility of producing relevant books and other occasional publications. I founded, and for many years worked unpaid to champion the work of \nothers at, independent literary publisher Two Ravens Press (which \u003cem\u003eThe Herald\u003c/em\u003e newspaper in Scotland called \u0027a quiet publishing revolution\u0027) before we passed the company on in 2013. In 2012, I founded \u003cem\u003eEarthLines Magazine\u003c/em\u003e,\n a unique full-colour publication for writing about nature, place and \nthe environment described by Jay Griffiths as \u2018a deeply intelligent \npublication\u2019, by \nGeorge Monbiot as \u2018a rare combination and much needed\u2019, and by Robert \nMacfarlane as \u2018a real point of convergence for many \nthought-tributaries and philosophical paths\u2019. I\u0027d like to bring those skills, and that passion for curating the work of others, to this new initiative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, as a writer, I don\u0027t have the necessary skills to do everything myself. And the burden of administration at The Hedge School takes me away both from my writing, and from teaching. If The Hedge School is going to achieve any of the things I\u0027ve outlined above, then I\u0027m going to need help. So that\u0027s where, I hope, Patreon comes in. To help provide the funds to pay others to create content, maintain the website, and expand our outreach. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://theartofenchantment.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/mistypurpleloch.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Patreon funding will be used for\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo pay other contributors for their time and writing, so that we can expand our content.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo pay an assistant to help us occasionally with administration and outreach.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo help cover the costs of website hosting, design, and admin.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo allow us to create relevant educational videos.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd ultimately, to allow me more time not just to develop the programme at The Hedge School, but to focus on my writing and teaching in the field of myth, wild mind and enchantment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://theartofenchantment.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/maxime-simoncelli_beautiful-bizarre_09.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy commitment to you ...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e... is that all of the funding received through Patreon will go towards making The Hedge School accessible to more people, and to paying others to help produce content which is free to everyone, and which brings an understanding of the value of our native myths and traditions to as many people as we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
