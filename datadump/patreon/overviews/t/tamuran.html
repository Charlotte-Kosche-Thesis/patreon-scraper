Ann \"Chezhnian\" Kennedy and Eren Fitzgerald, and we make an epic fantasy webcomic called \n\u003ca href=\"http://tamurancomic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTamuran\u003c/a\u003e. The comic has been running online since 2010, with over 400 pages posted to date. It updates with a new page every Tuesday and Friday, and you can read the whole thing for free on our website. \u003ca href=\"http://www.tamurancomic.com/index.php/tamuran/prologue-page-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e(Click here to start at the beginning.)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn\n2008, we started writing Tamuran via chatroom as a way to keep in touch and have some fun exploring a setting that Chezhnian created for\na never-written novel. Since then, the story has evolved and grown to\nencompass a vast world populated by dozens of major characters, whose \nlives\nweave, unweave, and re-weave in the telling of several different plot\nthreads.  Our\nlove for the story and its denizens has only grown as we\u0027ve continued\nto delve deeper into their world, and more than anything we want to\nshare that story with you in its entirety. 400 comic pages is still just the beginning - we have a long way to go!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe comic\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.tamurancomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pp09-rais.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTamuran tells the story of a kingdom besieged by dark forces after two princes make a pact with long-banished sorcerers in order to seize their father\u0027s throne. The comic follows a number of characters whose lives become entangled in the princes\u0027 plot, including a fatherly elf searching for his vanished family, a brash but sheltered lady shapeshifter who has a lot to learn about actions and consequences, a misplaced forest beast with academic leanings, and a cheerful traveler who might not be quite what he seems. At the center is the scholarly young heir to Tamuran\u0027s throne, as he struggles to seek aid for his people and follow the difficult path his father has laid for him. But the sorcerers\u0027 dark powers already have a stranglehold on the land, \nand his brothers\u0027 pact may carry a higher cost than anyone could have imagined...\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA few sample pages from various points in the comic:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.tamurancomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2010-01-15-Chapter-1-page-02.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"http://www.tamurancomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2010-01-15-Chapter-1-page-02.jpg\" style=\"width: 319px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.tamurancomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2012-05-08-Chapter-7-page-11.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.tamurancomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2012-05-08-Chapter-7-page-11.jpg\" style=\"width: 321px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.tamurancomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-05-Chapter-9-page-16.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.tamurancomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-05-Chapter-9-page-16.jpg\" style=\"width: 319px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.tamurancomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2013-08-16-Chapter-10-page-26.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u00a0 \u003cimg src=\"http://www.tamurancomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2013-08-16-Chapter-10-page-26.jpg\" style=\"width: 320px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Patreon campaign\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe love sharing our comic with readers for free, and we will always continue to do so in the future.
