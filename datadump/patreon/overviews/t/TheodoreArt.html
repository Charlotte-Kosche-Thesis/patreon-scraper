    "summary": "Since 2010, Theodore:Art has been presenting emerging and mid-career artists of all ages in exhibitions that provide new and unusual contexts.\u00a0 The gallery is committed to the consistent support of artists for the long haul -- trust and collaboration between gallerist and artist allows\u00a0 studio practice and exhibition program to be interdependent and more productive as an organic community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gallery\u0027s exhibition program offers a wider audience for seasoned, influential artists in new phases of their respective practices.\u00a0 Collectors have the opportunity to connect with new work and new artists, and to reconnect with the artists who have influenced younger generations of creators by their teaching, curating, criticism, and studio work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the founder of this enterprise, I have always worked hard to NOT pressure the artists to make work for the \u0027market\u0027, whatever that is.\u00a0 The artists are encouraged to make the work and the exhibitions that THEY want to do.\u00a0\u00a0 By means of a longer term collaborative commitment, the gallery and the artist together can present multiple exhibitions that show the development, growth, and change of the artist\u0027s practice.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe connection between art buyer and art work is always gratifying, but not always reliable.\u00a0 Ergo, I have worked outside the gallery, as do almost all of the artists I work with.\u00a0 I do not take any salary or income from gallery revenue.\u00a0 The Patreon system would allow for our program, and our work with artists, to continue with just that much less pressure.\u00a0 Many friends and visitors cannot necessarily buy a more expensive work of art, but by means of Patreon, your continuing advocacy translates into long term survival!\u00a0 and let me tell you, it is most gratefully appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the bonuses we have listed, we will be changing up the premiums for those extra special friends who keep the support going after 12 months.\u00a0 We are thrilled to have this boost and will not forget to thank you, again and again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0- Stephanie Theodore\u003cbr\u003e"
