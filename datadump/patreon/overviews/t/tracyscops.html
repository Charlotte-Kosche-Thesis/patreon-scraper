My work, besides initial financial investor, is restricted to putting together the team as an editor, writing the comics, working the designs and layouts and distributing the editions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s actually quite a lot, but without my artists, I\u0027d be only stuck with my own figments of imagination. And writing these is not as easy as it might seem and it involves constant re-writing and considering a great amount of input from the actual artists. Comic page commissions tend to be particularly expensive, which is why I decided to stick to 8-page stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always try to hire the most talented artists I can afford, but my own funds are limited. That\u0027s why I relied in the past on donations received from people interested in reading the comics. Unfortunately, that did not work very well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut now, I\u0027m taking a shot at Patreon. And I hope this works well...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are 3 main rules I try to follow on my projects: \u003cbr\u003e1) It has to look like a regular comic book, both in design and narrative, except for being NSFW.\u003cbr\u003e2) It has to respect the fundamental characteristics of the characters, so that rule #1 is respected.\u003cbr\u003e3) It has to have as much sex as possible, as long as rules #1 and #2 are not disrespected. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to explore their personalities and powers in ways that it could never be shown in a publisher mainstream product. I also try to look for details in actual comics that are either forgotten or overlooked, and use them in my comics to give more weight and density, and also because my readers recognize this as something that could really be canon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eThank you so much for your support.\u003cbr\u003eI hope to keep them coming for a long time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKindly,\u003cbr\u003e- Tracy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
