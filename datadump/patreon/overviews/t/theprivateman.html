    "summary": "Over four years ago I started blogging about attraction and dating advice for post-divorce singles. After 521 blog posts, 2.3 million page views, and 13K comments, I think I\u0027m on to something. I\u0027ve also got a parallel Twitter account with over 2,700 followers and over 10K of my own Tweets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the link to my blog:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://theprivateman.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://theprivateman.wordpress.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eHere\u0027s a video of me talking about my blog:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://theprivateman.wordpress.com/2015/08/16/video-podcast-1-introduction/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://theprivateman.wordpress.com/2015/08/16/vid...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOK, enough of such boasting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really enjoy providing solid, truthful attraction and dating advice. There is an awful lot of crap advice out there that only provides feel-good information that results in frustration. Worse, it prevents singles from meeting their relationship goals. I\u0027m passionate about this, I really am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve not monitized my blog directly. There are no advertisments on it. There are no promotions for pick up artistry (PUA) systems that too often sell a false bill of goods to frustrated men. I don\u0027t pitch pale platitudes to single women through affiliate marketing. Actually, my Wordpress account doesn\u0027t let me do that. That\u0027s actually a good thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem with monetizing a blog is that the blog\u0027s creator(s) become beholden to advertisers. I don\u0027t want to go that route. I would rather reach out directly to my readers so they can provide honest motivation for me to keep creating solid articles and then eventual podcasts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s the call to action:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSupport me through Patreon. Allow me to devote more time and effort to something that is desperately needed for post-divorce singles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason that I\u0027m doing the pay-per-post model is that I\u0027m used to being paid for each that I write. If I don\u0027t provide good content, I\u0027m not going to be rewarded. I like the model.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould I post more than you expect, \u00a0you can of set a monthly limit in your Patreon account settings to stop yourself going over budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the Patreon incentive provides:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMotivation!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I used to write for newspapers and magazines, I learned that the number of paid subscribers was obviously vital to the financial health of those publications. Patreon serves as something of a stand-in for a printed publication\u0027s paid subscribers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eResearch!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is also a time-consuming effort. Sure, there are plenty of research studies on attraction and dating but are those studies any good? Digging into the study methodology to find truly useful data for my readers is my goal. If I post a link to a study, it\u0027s passed my clean bill of intellectual health and therefore has value to my readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis research also includes going out in this world and watching the actions of men and women while they dealing with each other. The best type of research is to watch post-divorce singles on dates. Thankfully, I know where these singles go on dates. It\u0027s fascinating and can fit in nicely with the content that I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwitter mining!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI spend way too much time looking at blogs, forums, and other websites to find pithy and interesting content that can be distilled into a fine Tweet. I know my Twitter followers like my Tweets and Patreon support would provide some fine motivation to continue my efforts. I\u0027m @man_private on Twitter. Follow me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDating!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy Patreon supporters would actually be helping me go on dates so I can experience, learn, and provide content to help other post-divorce singles through my mistakes. Please note that I rarely, if ever write about individual dates. This is because I respect anonymity and that I\u0027m looking for dating patterns, not anecdotes. As well, I have my own relationship goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u00a0do have some goals with this effort:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eIncrease the monthly number blog posts.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve done this in the past but is was so very time consuming. To be motivated through Patreon . My blog is the core of my content and delivery method. I will make sure each post is longer than 300 words and chock full of prime content with no re-posts from old content unless warranted by something recently\u00a0relevant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eReorganize my blog to make it easier to find specific categories of content.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e With over 500 blog posts, this is a very time-consuming and daunting task. This also includes updating my blog roll.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eStart podcasting\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e so that my subscribers have another medium to receive my content. I\u0027ve been listening to many, many podcasts and I know the value of audio content. I was once in the radio business so I can make my voice compelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eStart a publicity campaign to reach out to the mainstream media.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I know... But this is something important if the message of good attraction and dating advice is to get out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eComplete a book on attraction and dating for post divorce singles.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I have already an outline for this book and I can obviously create sufficient content to make this happen.\u00a0There is an alternative to the first book - a work of \"adult\" fiction (and you know what I\u0027m talking about). What I\u0027ve not admitted before is that I\u0027m an award-winning writer - 2nd place over all! - on the largest erotic fiction website on the Internet.Final goal?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo do this full time. \u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHere\u0027s what I\u0027d really like -\u00a0When I wake in the morning, check my Twitter feed for potential retweets and links to dating advice that need to be researched. Then, correspond with subscribers who need some advice directly. Then, continue to work on a blog post and review some online dating profiles to see if I should send an outgoing message. Also, work on an outline for a new podcast so my listeners can have something informative and entertaining to listen to at their leisure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
