    "summary": "Hello everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page. I am here to build my fan base and gain more support for my brand as a poet and teaching artist. My best friend who is also an artist and entrepreneur told me about this site and I thought It would be a great way to share my art with more people. I have been writing and performing going on 12 years and I have been doing poetry professionally for going on 6 years. I perform at different venues across the east coast, and I also teach workshops on radical healing, community advocacy and activism, and poetry writing. I use writing as a tool to create solidarity for other marginalized voices like my own. In my poetry I speak about the misogynior, patriarchy, and classim black women face in America. I also discuss other issues like warfare, domestic violence, body positivity, and the prison industrial complex. I am also pursuing a masters degree in social work, specializing in macro-practice in HIV prevention, HIV treatment, and trauma informed care. I couple my skill set in poetry with my academic knowledge to develop intersectional forms of activism in stride of creating intersectional justice. I hope you all will follow my journey towards growth and building a better future by donating to my travel expenses, lending constructive advice on branding and marketing, and promoting my products and future showcases via social media. Feel free to contact me via email for any further questions about what I do and for booking purposes. My email address is booktammakastaley@gmail.com. I hope to be in touch with some of you soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith joy,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTammaka Staley\u003cbr\u003e"
