    "summary": "Hey! Zack Smith here, from The Walla Recovery. Watch the video to learn 1) Why I make music and 2) How you can make music with me. Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u2014\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhy I write songs\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing songs for a long time (18 years), but I\u0027ve never seen it as my job or my calling, until recently. I spend my time asking the biggest questions I have about life, through music, and, as a result, exploring what\u0027s good, true, and beautiful about the world around us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe an artist\u0027s job is to look at the world and tell the rest of us what they see. And I couldn\u0027t have described the way I approach life any better than that. I just can\u0027t help but try and process everything I experience through music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf all the things I could spend my time doing, this is what I\u0027m most passionate about.\u00a0So I\u0027m submitting to you my \"application.\" This is who I am. I want to be \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e songwriter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is scary for me because it requires vulnerability. But that\u0027s why it\u0027s worth trying for, too. I want to practice the same honesty and openness that my favorite singer-songwriters bring to their work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so grateful for the chance to tell you about what I\u0027m working on and to ask for your support.\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003eKeep reading for a description of how this works and to get a special gift from me just for being here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0Get in touch with me if you have any questions at all: band [at] thewallarecovery.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for being here. It\u0027s a gift to be able to share what I love with with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u2014\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch4\u003eMaking art work\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatronage is not a new idea, but it makes a lot of sense. It\u0027s the way the world\u0027s art has been funded for thousands of years. It\u0027s only been in the past hundred or so that we started capturing art onto film/paper/devices and trying to charge people for the copies. We\u0027ve found that doesn\u0027t really work very well, because there are a lot of hidden costs that support the infrastructure needed to distribute the work with modern technology. After an artist pays the myriad of middle-men getting their art into your hands, there\u0027s very little left to bring home to their families. No wonder art seems like one of the riskiest businesses you can get into. I don\u0027t blame an artist for giving up on the system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons finance the time required for an artist to do excellent work because they believe in what the artist is doing. After that, the work is available for the whole community to enjoy. I want that situation because I like those ideals. I want to serve a small group of people who want to make my work happen in a way I can\u0027t on my own. Trying to do this alone defeats the purpose. My music should be about more than just me and my little story. I want it to be about you, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy patrons are a family; everyone is important. \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003eChoose to contribute a dollar or more per song, and choose a maximum amount per month, so you will never be charged more than you wish. You\u0027ll have secret access to the demo stream of new songs I\u0027m working on.\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0The demos are just me and the guitar. I get to share the process with you, not just the final product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are songs of encouragement, solace, and hope. I\u0027m writing new ones all the time. If you\u0027re anything like me, they will help you to feel a little bit less alone as you traverse the landscape of your life under the sun. My newest work is my best to date. You\u0027ll get to hear the songs before anyone else does, and you\u0027ll have the chance to talk with me and the other patrons about them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u2014\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat I\u0027m working on\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the songs I\u0027m writing now are going into an extended album. And this album is actually kind of weird because it is going to tell a fictional story I\u0027ve been working on. I\u0027ve written a 50,000-word rough draft of it, and about a hundred pages of outlines and notes and character backstories on top of that, over the last five years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a story about a little girl who grows up in a home void of compassion. She needs a transformation from bitterness to joy. And it\u0027s the story of the boy who has loved her since childhood, and the lengths he will go to, to redefine her entire life for good. Here are some lyrics from the first song (find the free download on this page), \u003cem\u003eShe Is the One\u003c/em\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eI was born on the northern border\u003cbr\u003eShe is the one I\u0027ve fought for\u003cbr\u003eShe is the one I\u0027ve loved\u003cbr\u003eI came down of an ageless order\u003cbr\u003eShe is the one I sing to\u003cbr\u003eShe is the one I\u0027ve dreamed\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of writing a book or a screenplay, I want to tell the story through a series of songs. I\u0027ve got almost all of them written and next I\u0027ll be working on polishing them up for the final full-band version of the album.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been through some difficult times in the past and this story is my way of responding and processing all of it. I can\u0027t help but think that sharing my story might help someone out there. So that is my purpose and my hope.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want this story to come to life, and to give other people some sense of the truth and beauty I have seen by talking with those who have suffered a lot more than I have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs someone who has walked in the loneliness of life in the past, what excites me most about this album is the chance for it to incubate among a group of patron-friends, together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u2014\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch4\u003eBecome a patron\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll continue writing and recording songs until the project is done. In exchange for one dollar or more per song that I write, you will be able to download a demo recording of each song. There will be some instrumentals as well. When I have written portions of the story for you to read, I\u0027ll publish those here, free of charge.\u00a0Some tiers have special rewards you can read about on this page.

I will offer the content to other people at different times, but you and I will know that we are part of a small group of people who made this happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome months will be more productive than others. No matter how many songs I write per month, you will simply pay the amount you\u0027ve chosen to give per song. Also, you can set a cap on your total monthly spending, so that if I churn out 10 songs in one month, you will receive all of them, but still pay no more than your selected monthly maximum amount.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClick a giving amount under \"Rewards\" on the right-hand side of this page (or below?) to get started. \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 230, 148);\"\u003eYou will have immediate access to all of the content I\u0027ve uploaded so far based on the reward you choose.\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0I look forward to publishing new songs for you here in the coming days!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so grateful for your support.
