From a subscription stance, Tier One Magazine makes no profit. This publication is a free digital magazine on the ISSUU platform that can be shared and viewed by everyone. With our content contributors, we work like a honor system similar to a PFT arrangement. You collaborate with other content creators. You submit your themed projects, and when decided for publication, the work gets uploaded into the magazine. This arrangement keeps the magazine up and it gives your work instant promotion that lends an opportunity to those content creators just starting or seeking another exposure outlet. Yes, to collaborate is free and yes, submitting content is free, but at the same time, there is a dedicated work being done here. Our goal, the magazine is for you, and knowing that I want to push out the best publication I can on a monthly basis, a publication that promotes content creators, the idea of having pledges that support the magazine does make a difference. I want to thank everyone for the support.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eUnlocking Your Dreams:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe question here is do you want your Patreon profile featured in a digital magazine dedicated to all things Patreon?

Today our design format is using the Microsoft Publisher platform. When a monthly subscription is purchased from Adobe InDesign/Photoshop, our design will jump in quality for our followers. We also want to upgrade subscriptions at the ISSUU platform, to make the magazine more accessible to the media as a whole. At Tier One, we also want to be able to payout for the content contributed to our publication by opening doors for all freelancers in photography and writing. Imagine content creators finally getting paid for the time and effort when submitting usable content to the Tier One Magazine. Also a reachable plan, we have a goal to visit Patreon related events all across the United States. We want to be at the event with a mobile photoshoot set to hold real-time interviews with the content creators attending. With $1000, many fees and costs such as payouts, event financing, and monthly subscriptions will make a big difference on how we want to be the best magazine for the creators, by the creators.",
