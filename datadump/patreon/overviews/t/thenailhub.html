Nail technicians are an amazing breed.  We are the perfect mix of creativity, care giving, and hard work, but one thing that\u0027s lacking is a wide-spread knowledge of how to leverage these amazing skills! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My goal is to help educate, inspire, and motivate as many nail techs as possible and The Nail Hub is my way of sharing my experience and business expertise with all of you.",
