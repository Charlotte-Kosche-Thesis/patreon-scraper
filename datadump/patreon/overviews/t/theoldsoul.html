    "summary": "Hi, hello, and greetings! My name is Aaron Aiken, and I am starting a print and online cigar magazine called \u003cem\u003eThe Old Soul\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Old Soul is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ea community of people who enjoy cigars and the cigar lifestyle\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea podcast keeping you current with cigar legislation updates and other banter\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ean online cigar lounge\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea quarterly cigar lifestyle magazine curated by the community!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Old Soul Magazine is focused on thoroughness and quality, and is 100% community curated\u00a0and reader supported!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is not your standard, run of the mill, cigar magazine or website. Each issue is given at least 3 months to be created, and is \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003efocused entirely on one cigar company\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. And the only method of monetization is right here, on Patreon. No ads. No sponsors. No conflicts of interest. Just \u003cem\u003ecommunity\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0input.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy vision of \u003cem\u003eThe Old Soul\u003c/em\u003e is based entirely on community curation from people like you. People who are passionate about cigars, people who want to understand their favorite cigar companies at the deepest level possible so that the cigars they smoke become more than just a cigar. \u003cstrong\u003ePeople who want to be a part of building a new cigar magazine tailored to what they want.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Goes Into Creating Each Issue?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFirst, I listen to the community here and let them decide which cigar company/individual the issue will focus on, and other topics they want to have covered in the magazine\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI smoke as many cigars manufactured by the company that I can get my hands on, reviewing them in detail along the way, so that I am able to get a complete sense of their product and quality.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI take an academic approach to researching the company, unearthing their history, character, story, passion, and origins, sharing my notes, findings, and interesting tidbits as I make progress.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThen, I sit down (face to face if possible) and talk with the company owner, or as close to there as I can get, and ask them as many questions as they will allow. I round out the story by talking with at least one of the company\u0027s reps.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFinally, I tie all of this together into a comprehensive story - from the first tobacco seed planted, to the last puff of smoke. You\u0027ll come away from each issue of The Old Soul having a greater understanding of the cigar company, and a deeper appreciation for the cigars they craft.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Can You Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimple - become a part of my community. (If you are on your phone, keep scrolling to view the rewards. If you are on your computer, the rewards are on the right side of your screen).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a part of \u003cem\u003eThe Old Soul\u003c/em\u003e community puts you in the position of an influencer for each issue. The community provides ideas of what they are thinking for each issue, and then I\u0027ll put it to a vote among the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eEditors\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach issue is curated entirely by the community. You tell me what to work on, then I do all the work. \u003cstrong\u003eIt is a cigar magazine for you, by you\u003c/strong\u003e (not to steal the FUBU line...). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, becoming a community member will help with production costs of each issue, including the podcast, photography and video content, and the material cost and time. Each issue requires hundreds of hours to publish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDoing all of this on Patreon allows me to focus entirely on the content, instead of having my time and energy divided between content and sales. Growing this community on Patreon gives all of us the best possible outcome: I, the writer and creator, can focus entirely on the cigars and the companies making them, and you, the reader and viewer, get to consume that content in an ad free, unbiased, environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you in advance for becoming part of this community, and look forward to shipping the first issue in the Summer of 2018. None of this is possible without people like you becoming a part of this community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHumbly,\u003cbr\u003eAaron Aiken\u003cbr\u003e"
