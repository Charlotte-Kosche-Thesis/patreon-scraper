    "summary": "Hi future fan or current fan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is James and I run an entertainment review site called The Chairport (\u003ca href=\"https://thechairport.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.thechairport.com\u003c/a\u003e). Here at The Chairport we focus on providing three things;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. A place to find quality reviews on content that we love and content we are yet to discover. Our reviews are fan friendly, wait what do you mean by fan friendly? It\u0027s our way of saying that we get you. We\u0027re fans of a lot of various different content and we keep that in the front of our mind when we\u0027re writing our reviews. For example, if you\u0027re a Star Wars fan then you can come to our site and check out our Star Wars review which will be written by myself...a huge Star Wars fan. Does this make us bias? Maybe. Does this make our reviews more accurate? Yes, because if we don\u0027t like it and we\u0027re a fan than something must be up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. We make cool podcasts for you to listen to! It might be our main podcast where myself and Kyle talk about everything we\u0027ve been watching and general life or it could be our retro gaming podcast, Retro-Spective, or it could be any of our future podcasts. We hopefully make stuff you want to listen to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. I started up The Chairport as a solo project that was all me. I soon realised that was pretty impossible and very difficult to do and so I figured I would open up my site to other writers. I wanted to do this because I knew a few people who wanted to do similar things to my site but didn\u0027t have the time to create their own website like I had. The Chairport is currently eight writers strong and still growing and providing the other writers with a place to write their reviews has been very exciting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I run everything myself and I would like to continue doing that. As the website gets bigger we can make more and more content and you can help us. Since I started the site in December 2016 it\u0027s grown from 100 viewers a month to 20,000 in the last year! I want to be able to provide more content to read, listen and watch and provide more people with the opportunity to write on the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, simply enjoying our content, viewing it and giving feedback is enough for me to be happy but a donation of your small change would help The Chairport to grow and become even better. All of the money that you donate will go straight to The Chairport to create even better content. Thanks for reading all of this and thanks for being a fan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHope you have a wonderful chair to sit on,\u003cbr\u003eJames."
