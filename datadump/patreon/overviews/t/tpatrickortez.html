I write mostly speculative fiction, including fantasy, science fiction, and horror (which encompasses most of the genre). Also, I love dogs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing short stories. Unfortunately, short stories don\u0027t pay very well, if they pay at all. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in. Patreon makes it possible to share my work directly with the people who would enjoy it and get paid for it, one patron at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do You Get As A Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you will receive access to the full collection of my stories. Every story I\u0027ve published to date will be available for you to read. Unfortunately, I am unable to publish original stories at this time. Translation: if you look really hard, you can find them for free somewhere else (like most things on the Internet). But that\u0027s why you get to pick how much you want to contribute. In addition, I will add something special to every story, from deleted scenes to character sketches to original artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Much/How Often?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe answer to the first question is up to you. $1 is all it takes, but you are welcome to contribute as much as you think my time and effort are worth. The second question is slightly more complicated. Regrettably, I am unable to guarantee original work at this time. I will publish original stories here from time to time, but I will primarily publish stories after they have been featured in other collections. Because publications are irregular, my publishing here will also be irregular, but I aim to publish at least every third month and not more than monthly.\u003cbr\u003e"
