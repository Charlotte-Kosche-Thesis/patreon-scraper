    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s here! It\u0027s time for\u00a0\u003cem\u003eFaith and Fear... the podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFriends, family, beautiful people... the moment has finally arrived. It\u0027s time I share with you the entire #HomelessToHarvard story. The story encompasses 15 incredible years of successful moments, upsetting setbacks, surprising turns and quirky characters. And of course, Harvard.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope for this podcast is, for those of you who have wondered, \"How did she do it?\" you will get your answer. For those who watched me do it, you\u0027ll get the rare glimpse into some of my most intimate moments, as seemingly disparate events converge to create a tidal wave of good fortune. But above all else, \u003cstrong\u003eI want to share this story because my life has, and continues to be, about dispelling the myths and stories we tell ourselves about what\u0027s possible.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, thanks for joining me on this journey. I hope you\u0027ll stick around as I launch this story as an amateur podcaster who is finally ready to tell her story without the newspapers, magazine articles and TV interviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrequently Asked Questions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \u00a0How many episodes do you plan to publish a month?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: One, unless folks want more. And if there is a demand for more, I\u0027ll be sure to notify all of my subscribers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What\u0027s the format of this podcast?\u003cbr\u003eA: As a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://nsb.com/tonimorgan\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epublic speaker\u003c/a\u003e, I find storytelling to be particularly powerful. This first season will be about my story-- told in reverse chronology-- and feature some of the people who played a role in my journey. Once my story is told, I hope to tell others in a similar way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: So, is this entire podcast is about you?\u003cbr\u003eA: Kind of. The first \"season\" tells my story in reverse chronology. My hope is that it will provide the foundation to tell other stories like mine. But, let\u0027s get through season one first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What costs are you incurring to produce this podcast?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA: I don\u0027t have equipment just yet. So, I\u0027m renting equipment and a studio while I\u0027m in Boston and working with my good friends at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://postofficesound.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePost Office Sound\u003c/a\u003e (shoutout to Chris!) to do interviews in Toronto. It also covers the startup cost for things like hosting fees, music licenses, and more.

But also, people like some of the folks you\u0027ve seen on TV. If I\u0027ve met them, then there is a real possibility they\u0027ll be a guest on the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: How does the \u0027\u003cem\u003eAsk A Question\u0027\u003c/em\u003e option work?\u003cbr\u003eA: Each week, I will field questions from supporters. Then, I will answer the question on the F\u0026amp;F Patreon blog the following week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What\u0027s this Google Hangout option? How does that work?\u003cbr\u003eA: Each week, supporters will receive an invitation to join me for a weekly discussion about the previous episode or issues related to the theme of faith and fear. This is limited to a small group to ensure the experience is meaningful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Will there be somewhere to listen to the podcast for free?\u003cbr\u003eA: I\u0027ll be producing at least one episode a month for the next year. Once my first podcast is complete, I plan to make it available free of charge on a platform like iTunes or Soundcloud.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What\u0027s your ultimate goal for this podcast thing?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003cstrong\u003eTo prove that success comes in all shapes and forms. Further, my hope is that by sharing non-traditional success stories, I can effectively use this platform to disrupt traditional ideas of success. It\u0027s something I needed as I navigated my way through the world, and realize has been helpful for others who have learned about my story.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
