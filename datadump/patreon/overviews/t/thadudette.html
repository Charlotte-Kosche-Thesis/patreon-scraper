    "summary": "Hey! Welcome to my Patreon page, friend! :D \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Who are you and what do you do?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m Thadudette, a super nerdy parody artist on YouTube who loves music, writing, Disney, anime, video games, and making people laugh! As dorky as my creations are, I make them because I feel that I\u0027ve been so blessed by God that I just have to share that blessing with someone in the form of laughter. It may not be everyone\u0027s sense of humor, but if it makes even one person laugh, I\u0027d say it\u0027s all worth it!\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a brief snapshot of what I just said, except with my voice, and some clips from my actual videos :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3MBjMUrmVE0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Okay, but what\u0027s this Patreon thing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Great question! Patreon is like Kickstarter, but instead of helping me reach one big goal, you help me reach a lot of small ones--my videos, and ways I can improve them! Sure, I like my videos as they are, but there\u0027s so much that could make \nthem even better--think video editors, professional audio mixes, hired singers and artists, \noriginal recordings of instrumentals--the possibilities are endless! If you sign up to be my patron, you\u0027ll get to join me in this video-creating journey, by helping me produce higher-quality and more frequent content. In addition, you\u0027ll get cool swag like early access, a chance to play Guess That Parody, access to extra content, song downloads, or even your own custom parody! \u003cbr\u003eFor each supported video I make, you can have backed up anywhere from $1 to $1,000,000! (That second number is a ballpark estimate.) I try to upload about once a week, but if you don\u0027t think you want to support that many videos, Patreon has an option that allows you to choose how many to support a month. So you can give as little as $1 a month, and I would be so grateful. Every little bit counts! :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Cool! But I can\u0027t afford to be your patron. Am I dead to you?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, of course not! Just you being here means you\u0027ve shown some interest in my passion and videos (unless you\u0027re suuuuper bored and just stumbled across this page :P). My main parody content is free, and always will be. Whether or not you decide to become my patron, you\u0027re a part of the Thaddie family, and it\u0027s because of that that I\u0027m able to keep doing this as more than a hobby! I\u0027m happy about that, so you should be too! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
