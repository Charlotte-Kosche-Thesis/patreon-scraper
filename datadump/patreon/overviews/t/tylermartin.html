It\u0027s quite fun and silly, yet endearing, as well as a comic that takes some opportunity to raise awareness and knowledge of Antarctica and its creatures (polar bears too!). In my accompanying blog posts you\u0027ll find a mixture of fun facts and life experiences. I\u0027m a nerd and love some learning with my entertainment so I try to provide you with a bit of edutainment too. Mostly though, Wally \u0026amp; Osborne are here to add fun to my life as well as my readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create comics for myself, but also ones that my kids and friends of all ages can enjoy with me. I enjoy my current profession as a freelance Web designer, working out of a home office where I\u0027m able to be with my family while I work, but ultimately I\u0027d love for all of my creative work energy to be spent creating Wally \u0026amp; Osborne. I want to see it have daily updates and I want more time to interact with my readers and the rest of my time with my family and exploring and enjoying this planet we all live upon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery dollar you pledge helps... it buys me that much more time to spend on this comic. Help me bridge the gap between generations and bring smiles and laughs to all people young and old. Help me share awesome and important subjects. I hope you can be part of this dream with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank You!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
