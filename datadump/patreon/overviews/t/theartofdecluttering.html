We love being in your ears as you go about your weekly routines. We love that you know us both so well! \u003cbr\u003eWe created this Patreon page so that our listeners who love the show have an opportunity to support us by helping us to cover the cost of the show. So many of you have ask how you could support us directly as opposed to supporting the brands or companies who sometimes sponsor us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re excited to bring you the option of supporting us via Patreon, which where you the listener can choose to help us cover the costs of producing our podcast, from as little as $1 per month (so 25c per episode). AND... as our thank you to you, each and every patreon supporter will be invited into our Art of Decluttering Inner Tribe, which is a private Facebook group where you can connect with us, share your declutter story and be inspired by others who are sharing this journey with us. It\u0027s a private group, so only those in the group can see what you post (meaning you can share authentic photos of your home, ask for advice and be confident you\u0027re in a supportive environment where everyone is on the same declutter journey).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe really value and honour you for all that you do to support us and not just here via Patreon! We love how engaged our tribe is on Facebook and we love receiving your suggestions for episodes and the encouragement you give us via emails.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease know, there is no pressure or obligation here at all. If you want to continue just loving the show and spreading the word to your friends and family, that\u0027s awesome too! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBig Love and Enjoy the Freedom xx\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"
