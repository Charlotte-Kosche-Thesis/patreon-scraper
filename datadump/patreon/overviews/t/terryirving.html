I imagine that the brave soul in the Stone Age who ventured deep into the caves of Altamira Spain to paint aurochs had brawny hunters topside who provided roasted aurochs for his family\u0027s sustenance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/9_Bisonte_Magdaleniense_pol%C3%ADcromo.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(courtesy of Wikipedia Commons and Museo de Altamira y D. Rodriguez)\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In 1973, I began a career as a television journalist with a job racing news film\u00a0around Washington DC on a really sweet BMW R60/5 motorcycle. Among other highlights, I was in the hallway during the Saturday Night Massacre and watched Vice President Spiro Agnew enter State Court in Baltimore to plead \"nolo\u00a0contendere\" to taking cash bribes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Promoted to producer, I spent 20 years at ABC News: ranging from \u003cem\u003eAM America\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to \u003cem\u003eNightline with Ted Koppel\u003c/em\u003e. During those years, I heard bullets zip past in Beirut, was rousted by a policeman outside an illegal union meeting in apartheid South Africa, followed Ted Kennedy and Ron Reagan on the campaign trail, and found myself on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall on that historic evening in November 1989 when the world changed.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OK, it was the most fun that anyone could have and I did win an armful of Emmys but one too many 72-hour edit\u00a0sessions put me in a hospital and I\u00a0turned to writing. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For a quarter-century, I crafted scripts for shows, field reports, and documentaries and had my words read by a number of brilliant writers who burnished my work and by a far lesser number who would have read Bazooka Joe if it showed on the Teleprompter. It was a vocation where every word\u00a0had to be exact, where I needed to become an expert in an afternoon, and where ten minutes to write was a luxury reserved for lead stories and heartfelt testimonials.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Several years ago, I decided to compose novels. Coming off my speed-freak work habits, \u003cem\u003eCourier\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0my first thriller, was completed in six weeks and the sequel,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eWarrior,\u003c/em\u003e in three months. I found an agent and he\u00a0found a publisher. Movie options were just around the corner. The brass ring was within my reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yeah, right.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The publisher vanished in a corporate reshuffle, the agent turned a corner like Orson Welles in\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Third Man\u003c/em\u003e, and the movie studio that called had previously produced \u003cem\u003eAlvin \u0026amp; the Chipmunks: the Squeakwell. \u003c/em\u003eDon\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027d have taken an offer for peanuts but they never called back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When in doubt, keep writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cem\u003eDay of the Dragonking: Book 1 of the Last American Wizard \u003c/em\u003ewas a Publisher\u0027s Weekly Indie Book of the Year but my\u00a0 Swiftian satire on political Washington was \"trumped\" by reality. I plotted out the arc of\u00a0\u003cem\u003eTaxi Dancer, \u003c/em\u003ethe first in a planned series of private detective novels based in 1930\u0027s Manila. (These books are inspired by the research and writing of the PBS documentary\u00a0\u003cem\u003eRescue in the Philippines: Refuge from the Holocaust \u003c/em\u003ewhich included an interview with the daughter of real-life Philippine detective Angel Zervoulakos.)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 Just as I finished the third chapter, I received an email from legendary ABC News cameraman Yasutsune \"Tony\" Hirashiki. Tony-san wrote that he\u0027d bought my first novel and wanted to compliment me on how I\u0027d written about the \"invisible wounds\" my Vietnam Veteran protagonist was trying to endure. I responded with thanks but needed to make clear that I had based the character on friends at ABC since I hadn\u0027t served. Tony, as it turned out, had worked in Saigon for a decade with many of the same correspondents and staff. I wrote that this would make a great memoir and then found out that Tony had already published it to critical praise and national awards--in Japan. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As is said at ABC, Tony communicates superbly in no known language and consequently tried his own translation with a Japanese-English dictionary. The result was exquisite but incomprehensible \"Jinglish.\" Fortunately, I had worked extensively with Japanese motorcycle manuals in the 1970s and had become fluent in \"Jinglish.\" One email led to another and I had the opportunity to work with him for the next three years as we researched, edited, re-wrote, and marketed his book as \u003cem\u003eOn the Frontlines of the Television War: \u003c/em\u003eCasemate Publishing\u0027s #1 selection in Spring 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Oddly enough, the book was begun and completed via email, Tony and I never spoke much less met until we\u0027d signed a publishing contract. It\u0027s amazing how much you can come to love someone through the power of the written word.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 There were many intangible benefits: showing the art of a cameraman in still images drawn from 50-year-old films, learning of the courage and humanity of the reporters (American and Asian) who invented TV news in the middle of a war, knowing every word was mine but it remained completely Tony\u0027s book, and moments like that shown in the cover photo above where I hosted three of my personal heroes at the National Archives: Tony, Ted Koppel, and Barrie Dunsmore.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0In the meantime, tangible benefits were a bit low so I started my own publishing company (www.roninrobotpress.com,) developed a line of t-shirts and hats (www.zazzle.com/terryirving,) and wrote a raft of ebooks under a host of pseudonyms. My income is slowly increasing but I still post Instagrams (#lyftwriter) of post-midnight Washington as I drive drunks home in my UberX.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I\u0027m asking for you to become a part of all this. Become an ally in my effort to write the best books I can and not just the easiest books I can sell. Give me the time to find another agent and claw my way back into the world of real publishing. Watch as I strive to pass on a lifetime of experience by editing the books of authors who can\u0027t afford to pay and continuing my two-way telecasts on Nepris (www.nepris.com) where I engage high-school students interested in television news, creative writing, and slam poetry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This will be a case of doing well while doing good. Enjoy chapters before they\u0027re published, book covers in the review process, stories of some rather odd moments in television production (driving at 100 mph to Miami with Hunter Thompson and a six-pack of Heineken, a bottle of Pinch, and his ounce of coke springs to mind.)\u00a0 Work with me to create better books by reading and critiquing the raw product. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Make sure there is an aurochs waiting to drop on the grill.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If that\u0027s not in the cards, I would like to thank you for reading all this way and hope that you find another creator to support on Patreon.\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
