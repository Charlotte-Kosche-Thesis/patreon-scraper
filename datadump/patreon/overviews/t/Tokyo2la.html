I use all my platforms to provide experiences and insight to help everyone\u00a0of all ages.\u00a0I was previously in the U.S. Navy and had a blast.\u00a0However, I always wanted to live, travel,\u00a0make music, and films\u00a0so I decided to move to one of the best cities that provide such things. I have been blessed with\u00a0many things and opportunities to\u00a0travel amongst some of the greatest places in the world and meet\u00a0some of the best people the world\u00a0has to offer. I was able to establish a good platform for myself in preparation for what I am now doing in LA. I am a fulltime student currently with a 3.4 GPA and I\u0027m having fun\u00a0this\u00a0process called LIFE.",
