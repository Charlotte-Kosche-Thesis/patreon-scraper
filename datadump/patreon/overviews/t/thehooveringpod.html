    "summary": "Welcome to \u003cstrong\u003eHOOVERING\u003c/strong\u003e, the podcast about eating. Host, Jessica Fostekew (Co-host of The Guilty Feminist, BBC\u0027s Motherland and Cuckoo) has a frank conversation with an interesting person about gobbling; guzzling; nibbling; scoffing; devouring and wolfing all up\u2026 or if you will, hoovering.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m talking to all sorts of people. Lots of comedians (because they tend towards being gloriously open wounds) but also athletes, chefs, food-writers, MPs, journalists, my Nana, everyone. Because \u003cstrong\u003eI think we ALL have interesting stories and opinions and relationships when it comes to food\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout this journey I\u0027m properly addressing (with a therapist, not just with you guys) my own relationship with eating, facing the truth of my being somewhere on a spectrum of a binge eating disorder, all the shame and complexity that has sometimes entailed - \u00a0and that I might not ever be \u0027cured\u0027 - and how complicated it can be to try and work out what \u0027being kind to yourself\u0027 is when it comes to eating. And my story is the least interesting so far compared to my guests. Lots of the conversations I\u0027m having are honest, moving and many are also simply funny, compelling, intimate, totally bat-shit and some just down right informative.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m interested in eating and food from every angle: doing it, not doing it, being able to afford it, experimenting with it, using it to make your body do something extraordinary, what impacts how you were parented might have, food as art, food in art, control, creativity, memories, loving through doing it, hating through doing it. And more. It\u0027s FASCINATING. And complicated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis are all conversations worth having. I\u0027ve come to Patreon because I can\u0027t keep doing, let alone improving this podcast without monetising it and this looks like a pretty cool way of hopefully doing just that. I\u0027ve really enjoyed cooking up the rewards for my Patrons and I hope to be increasingly generous and creative on that front. Thanks so much, in advance, for you help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
