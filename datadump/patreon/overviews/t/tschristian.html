My hope is that you guys will enjoy these and it\u0027ll help diversify the type of fiction that\u0027s available!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eThe Why:\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor several years I stopped reading because I was particularly unsatisfied with many of the books I saw: many of which were by and about white men (particularly in genre fiction like horror, sci-fi or fantasy) but even when I found a book by a black woman (specifically), I never really enjoyed it. I felt at a loss - I don\u0027t enjoy the same books everyone else praises, but have a difficult time finding works that speak to me specifically. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo although I\u0027ve begun reading again - albeit slowly - I definitely would like to start creating works that I would like to read - and perhaps by extension, others - that isn\u0027t widely available (at least not without a great deal of searching). I wanted to focus on queer speculative (and genre) fiction (specifically f/f) that highlighted people of color. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, Patreon will allow me to write full-time, so I can work on creating even more awesome pieces for everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eHow Does The Money Situation Work:\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are charged \u003cem\u003eonce a month, on the first of the month.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eSo if you pledge $3.00 \u2013 that\u2019s how much you\u2019ll be charged each month. This is not a single donation site, since the idea is to be able to support creatives in a continual way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if you\u0027re unable (or unwilling) to provide monthly support, you CAN make a pledge then delete it after you receive a verification email stating that your pledge was successfully charged. Just be sure to delete your pledge so you won\u0027t be charged moving forward!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I have a \"per creation\" set up which means that in order for you to get charged, I have to create new paid content. You can also set up a monthly maximum, which means that you won\u0027t ever get charged more than your limit, no matter how much paid content I upload (and you\u0027ll still have access to everything I create!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(There\u0027s also a FAQ to answer all your additional questions:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq)\"\u003ehttp://www.patreon.com/faq)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
