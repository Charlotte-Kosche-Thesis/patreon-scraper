We hope to be able to provide all of our food and most of our daily needs using natural resources from our own land. We are currently mostly off the grid and are hoping to improve our solar power and rain water capacities in order to become less dependent on the power grid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are building our own life on an 18 acre mostly wooded homestead surrounded by wild State land. We raise chickens for eggs and meat, hunt and fish for food, grow our own vegetables and preserve our own food. We study the old ways on our path to becoming self sufficient.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe make daily videos showing our progress on our off grid homestead as we strive to become less dependent on the grocery stores and the energy grid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin us and follow our daily progress."

We are living on 18 acres on a homestead in Michigan and studying the old ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong ago I lost everything and moved into a camper in the woods during a blizzard. I had no light and heat and only a cell phone connection to the outside World. I started making daily YouTube videos and they were a hit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI later built a tiny house on wheels, got married to my beautiful wife Melanie and now we have a daughter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have some solar panels, septic system and a well. We hope to collect rain water as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are growing our own vegetables, raising chickens for meat and eggs, and fish and hunt for food. We preserve as much as we can in attempt to get through each year on a reduced budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow us as we strive to become self sufficient and off the grid on a budget.",
