I\u0027m always fascinated by new and foreign things, especially in culture and folk lore.\u003cbr\u003eI began drawing and writing at an early age. While I\u0027m not the worst artist, my true passion (as you\u0027ll see by the quality of my art work) is literature and story telling in all its forms. I wrote my first short story when I was twelve. It was never published (big surprise) and I\u0027ve never found the time to go back and edit it with a more adult style, but it set me on my path. I\u0027ve always been fascinated by horror and suspense, but also value more sentimental story points. I\u0027m also a huge gamer nerd. One of my favorite video game franchises would have to be kingdom hearts, though I am mostly a PC gamer. My interest in story telling from around the world and the progressive nature of video games has played a heavy influence on my writing. I enjoy watching a character go on a journey, over coming obstacles and the feeling of determination when they finally triumph. I\u0027m also a big dumb otaku, so there will be nose bleeds aplenty.",
