    "summary": "Thank you for your interest in Tales of the Boatman. Whether by spreading the word among friends and family, supporting financially as a patron, or just allowing these stories to be a part of your life, you are doing me a great service - \u003cstrong\u003eThank You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAllow me to introduce what this series is all about, and what I hope to see it grow into in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeaturing an acoustic musical score with instruments from around the world, and presented serially like an old-time radio drama, Tales of the Boatman is a magical storytelling series - It uses only the rich medium of stereo sound to bring imaginary realms to life. Narration, voice acting, music, SFX, and natural soundscapes are all woven together to immerse your ears in a world beyond time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this world, The Boatman, clothed only in a breech cloth and alone but for the company of a mischievous otter-cat, sails his tiny house boat down the endless river; The series chronicles his many adventures as the river spirit guides his way through encounters - some dangerous, some beautiful, all magical -\u00a0 in which he must be the restorer of peace and harmony.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe series is meant to stimulate understanding, tranquility, and courage in the listener, as the stories and music explore the inner life of the human being through the beauty of sound and the vibrancy of imagination.\u00a0 It is founded upon the belief that all which we experience, no matter how challenging, has meaning\u00a0and can lead us to greater wholeness and understanding.\u00a0In a world crowded with priorities, commitments, and stimuli, I hope this series can help you slow down and connect to your heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn line with this vision, the many hours of episodes, musical suites, and videos that comprise Tales of the Boatman are, and always will be, completely free and without advertisement.\u00a0 My goal is that all children, adults, or anyone in need of an escape, should have free access to a world of sound - a world through which their hearts delight in travelling, a world in which who we are in our hearts is what matters most,\u00a0 a world in which it is the humble, the kind, and the poor who are the protagonists.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am grateful for any support you can lend in support of this vision.  Your patronage, in whatever form, will help generate necessary resources - i.e. instruments, audio and visual recording gear, space, and the endless maintenance of all of the above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting in January 2018, Tales of the Boatman will consist of one monthly installment of the story and one performance video of the musical score from that story, available on the website and on Youtube.\u00a0 In addition, musical interludes will be occasionally added between episodes, and a behind the scenes blog, \u003cem\u003eEndless River Diaries, \u003c/em\u003ewill be updated regularly.\u00a0 I\u0027m always looking to attract artists and dancers and their contributions will be added whenever possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that, in time and with your support, Tales of the Boatman will grow well beyond its current boundaries. I foresee an increase in recording and production quality, the acquisition of ever more world instruments, the gathering of field recordings from diverse locations, collaborations with musicians, artists, and actors across the world, the creation of live storytelling experiences, and, perhaps most importantly, the more frequent release of episodes. In the coming years I hope to develop Tales of the Boatman into a universe comprising hundreds of hours of material!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChris Rippey\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
