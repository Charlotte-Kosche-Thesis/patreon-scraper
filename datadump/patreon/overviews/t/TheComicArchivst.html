But doing so, you get to actually influence all three shows!\u00a0YOU at home can become a driving force to make\nall these shows better. Better equipment, a real team behind it. \u00a0You can choose what comics go up on the chopping block for ComicSins, or\nhave me pulling my hair out because you want me to review Marville for A Comic\nA Day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a member of this community, you aren\u2019t\njust supporting me or my two wonderful kids who\u2019ll be randomly popping up in stuff like From The Collection or my inevitable Twitch streams.
