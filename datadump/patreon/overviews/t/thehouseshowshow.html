    "summary": "Hello! Before we do anything else: Thank you for checking out my Patreon page, listening to my podcast, and participating in what we\u0027re building here! Thank you, thank you, thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is The House Show Show?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.thehouseshowshow.com\"\u003eThe House Show Show\u003c/a\u003e is a \u003cem\u003epodcast\u003c/em\u003e and a \u003cem\u003elive concert series\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ein which musicians share their music in the most stripped down intimate way possible and then we talk about it. Or we don\u0027t, and we talk about other stuff instead. We then wrap each episode up with a Q\u0026amp;A with questions from the live audience, Facebook and Twitter. The end result is always a truly intimate and unique look at the artists work, day to day life and world view!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe live concerts happen monthly and the first one took place at my home in North Hollywood on February 4th, 2017. For each concert (or \"house show\") I book two guests. The concerts and then edited into two podcasts, which are released on Tuesday every other week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I launched the The House Show Show I had two goals in mind:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e1. Some of my all time favorite musical memories have been listening to my super talented songwriter friends play their tunes to six or seven people in my living room. I wanted to bring\u00a0that \"House Show\" experience that I love and adore \u003cem\u003edirectly to you. \u003c/em\u003e(Hence \u0027The House Show \u003cem\u003eShow\u003c/em\u003e\u0027. Get it?!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. I find music interviews to be fairly dull most of the time. Run-of-the-mill questions that invoke run-of-the-mill answers (\"Who are your influences?\" \"Where did your band name come from?\"). I wanted to ask musicians questions about their lives and other interests and glean more insight into their music through their lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho\u0027s making this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s me, Zen Zenith! I\u0027m a Los Angeles based singer-songwriter with a love for supporting other artists and putting on concerts. I edit, produce, record, book, design, build websites for, Tweet, Facebook and promote the whole thing ... with a little help of course!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my helpers include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eJake Lloyd (My amazing co-producer and often engineer and friendly supplier of apartments)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlease Do Not Fight bandmates Erin Keely and Geoff McCann, who helped write the theme song.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll of the guest engineers, kind hosts and artists who make the podcast possible!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI used to think to myself \"Man, subscription models are THE FUTURE for artists\". One time I stopped thinking it, said it out loud and heard back: \"You absolutely have to check out Patreon then! RIGHT NOW.\"\u00a0So I did. Not only did I discover that my idea had been fully realized, but it had been realized \u003cem\u003eeven better than I had imagined\u003c/em\u003e it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like Patreon because it allows a direct way for artists - like me - to actually get paid for the act of creating art instead of slinging merch or booking shows. As an artist, that is hugely motivating!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the content I release here will be exclusive to my Patrons, but the majority of it will be available everywhere. It\u0027s important to keep that in mind and note that this is less a way of paying me for specific content and more like giving me a tip. It\u0027s a way of saying \"Hey, I like what you\u0027re doing. Keep doing more of that please and thank you\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this doesn\u0027t sound like your cup of tea there are, of course, a ton of other great ways to support what I\u0027m doing!
