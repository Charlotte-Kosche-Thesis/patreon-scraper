We appreciate every comment on YouTube and every question and suggestion that you send us. We want to improve and make our videos even better for you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho are we?\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re JoAnn, Doug and Rodrigo and we started an animation studio called MindBug Studios a couple of years ago. We\u0027ve since made fun intro videos for lots of startups. And since January we started creating these YouTube videos that explain economic concepts in the form of stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy did we do that?\u003cbr\u003eWell, it all started when\u00a0JoAnn studied economics and Columbia University and got really into Milton Friedman and Adam Smith, Rodrigo worked at the New York Stock Exchange and then started a company that runs bitcoin exchanges all around the world and we got to see some behind the scenes of Business and Government. And we saw so many people supporting policies that sounded pretty the way the politicians were describing them, but were guaranteed to screw them in the end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pTGO039pRQ4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eWhen we saw this video of Milton Friedman talking about the invisible foot of government we knew that was exactly what was going on. Government policies by default have the opposite effect of what they claim to have. And we decided that it was going to be the inspiration for a YouTube channel to educate people about economics. We want to give people at least the basic intuition of economics to be able to question what politicians say and smell when something\u0027s fishy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow do we make them?\u003cbr\u003eWe have a file with lots of video ideas. Each week we try to write 2 or 3 into a fun script. Then JoAnn records the narration and edits the audio. The audios then wait in line for Doug to add illustrations and effects. In the simple black and white style that we are doing right now (that doesn\u0027t use any actual animation) he can finish about 1 minute per day. In the future if enough of you love our work and we end up making enough money, we can hire another artist and a sound guy, maybe even add some color!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do we need from you?\u003cbr\u003eWe decided to go all in and focus on making these videos instead of working for clients. So right now we are running on a couple of Bitcoins that we bought back when they were cheap, but we\u0027ll run out of cash by the end of 2018. By then we\u0027ll need to be making money some other way. So if you would like to see lots and lots more videos for a long time, help us make this a sustainable project by signing up to send us a couple of dollars per month.\u003cbr\u003e"
