I created this channel many years ago to spread scientifically accurate and humane dog training techniques because there is a lack of easily-accessible information in this area. Whether you are new to dog training or a more experienced professional, you will learn step-by-step how to improve your skills in the art of dog training and take your furry companion\u0027s training to the next level.\u00a0I have created tutorials on everything from common issues that most people struggle with to skills that require more practice and are frequently used by professional working dogs. This is not just about keeping your dog out of trouble, but also about having them join you more fully in the adventures your life brings with confidence and ease. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy you should contribute\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour support will allow me to \u003cem\u003eregularly\u003c/em\u003e create more and better content! Putting together videos takes hours of planning, shooting, and editing. I \u003cstrong\u003elove\u003c/strong\u003e this work and have always wanted to do it more than I am able to. This is now finally possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have built a lot of momentum in our work partly because positive reinforcement techniques are highly effective, but also because of the support that dog lovers like you have given us. I want to sincerely thank you for becoming a part of our community and allowing us to grow, create more videos, and share more information that will be helpful to people all over the world. No matter how big or small, your contributions will help improve the relationships that people have with their dogs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTab with Solea and Watson\u003cbr\u003e"
