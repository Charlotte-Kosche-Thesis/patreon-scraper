     "about": "The Random A** Podcast started way back in 2015 from visionary creator and host Jeremy as a way to get his and his friend\u2019s opinions on pop-culture, beer, sports, and more out to the masses. And even more so, he wanted to accomplish it on a week to week basis.  In order to do so, he needed to recruit some help. But with no real options or entertaining friends close enough to be regular co-hosts, he turned to his only available \u201ctalent\u201d, the Bender. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLuckily, and unexpectedly, the move paid off and since then the two have enlisted the help of the #SilverBadger Tommy and the first lady of podcasting (or #TheFLOP as it were) Missy. With the later being Jeremy\u2019s wife\u2026 so he kind of had to include her in order to justify all the time spent talking pop-culture and drinking beer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe R.A.P. has gone on to become the single biggest and best number one pop-culture and variety podcast in the entire mid-west. Or at least the biggest and best one that records in Jeremy\u2019s basement. So if you enjoy moderately funny and mostly inebriated conversations about booze, comics, movies, life, and sports of all types as told by four good friends and the occasional guest or two, then this is the show for you!If not, then you probably didn\u2019t read this far into the description anyway. So piss off. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo the one\u2019s that are still here, thanks for checking us out! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd remember if you listen and catch us out in public, tell us you\u2019re a fan and we\u2019ll buy you a drink!But not if you\u2019re underage. That would be wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers!",
