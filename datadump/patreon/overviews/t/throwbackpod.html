    "summary": "It started at a dive bar on Pico. That\u0027s where \u003cstrong\u003eDan Hanzus \u003c/strong\u003eturned to his lifelong friend (not counting a prolonged stretch from 1988 - 1994) \u003cstrong\u003eBob Castrone\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and suggested it was time for an adventure. Bob assumed this meant \"let\u0027s join a bowling league!\" when in actuality it meant something much, much sadder: \"Let\u0027s start a podcast.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where The Throwback Podcast was born. The idea that, every week, two friends would get together, throw back a few drinks, play an old album, and shoot the sh*t about everything from what that artist means to them, to whatever the hell else came up in slightly-drunken conversation. It was a great idea, and an ever greater excuse to escape from their families and drink in a garage like a couple of buffoons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter knocking out 36 incredible episodes (and 1 episode about Robbie Williams) in Year 1, and amassing a fan base of what they assume to be mostly hairy guys in their late 30\u0027s with a few presumably less hairy women mixed in, Bob and Dan were poised for greatness... until disaster struck. Their podcast network dumped them and left them with nothing -- not even an \"It\u0027s Not You We Don\u0027t Love Anymore, It\u0027s Your Show\" mixtape. All hope was lost. The guys were giving up. The 35 stellar episodes (not counting the previously mentioned Robbie Williams pod or the Wyclef Jean ep, if we\u0027re being honest) were all for naught. The Throwback Pod was destined to disband before it found greatness, much like Billy Corgan\u0027s under-appreciated early-aughts band Zwan,\u00a0 or even, perhaps, The Bens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then out of nowhere, a handful of those listeners who were told to go F themselves on a near-weekly basis stepped up and inspired our hosts to keep going. To keep fighting the good fight. To avoid imploding before they reached their full potential like The Libertines, and to keep pumping out content until everyone just lost interest, like R.E.M.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings us to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Throwback Podcast is throwing this to you, the fans, to keep this tour going. We don\u0027t need much - just some equipment, a hosting service, beer money, and partial financing for our\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCorky Romano 2: Still Corkin\u0027 Around!?!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e feature film that we\u0027ve poured our hearts and souls into. You know - the essentials.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plan is to bang out 3 episodes a month -- plus some bonus content for our patrons. And we\u0027re gonna keep this going FOREVER... or until we receive our first cease \u0026amp; desist letter. Whichever comes first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for encouraging our debauchery and buffonery. Now go f*ck yourself."
