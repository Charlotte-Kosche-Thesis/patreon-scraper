We started generating some revenue through a number of revenue channels, but that amounts to at most 50% of the site\u0027s budget in a good month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, this isn\u0027t sustainable. In the future, it would be awesome if the site could actually pay for itself while we can continue to expand the content and keep existing posts up to date. Here are some of our current and future expenses: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriting and Research:\u003c/strong\u003e We would like to cover a wider range of topics and improve the quality of our guides. This means we have to hire more writers, who are knowledgeable in other topics related to expat life in Thailand.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEditing:\u003c/strong\u003e It currently takes us about two months from start to finish to publish every guide on Thailand Starter Kit. This means we not only have to pay writers, but two editors. Using two editors means we can create accurate and error free long-form content.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eActive Campaign: \u003c/strong\u003eWe use this paid newsletter tool to send our audience articles as they are published and to keep them updated with our latest news.  \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook: \u003c/strong\u003eWe run a private Facebook community where current and future Thailand expats can ask each other questions, get advice, and pick the minds of our special AMA (Ask Me Anything) guests. Moderating the Facebook group to keep away trolls, spammers, and negative Nancy\u0027s (sorry Nancy!) takes time. As does setting up and hosting our AMAs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePodcasting: \u003c/strong\u003eKarsten also hosts the Brewed in Bangkok Podcast, which showcases fascinating interviews and off-the-beaten-track insights about Thailand. It\u2019s a unique show about about Thailand. We would love to produce more episodes of the podcast but this has also been challenging with the current budget limitations.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWebsite Maintenance: \u003c/strong\u003eJust like we take our cars in for regular service and oil changes, a website also needs to be maintained. We have to pay for hosting, plugins, and other tools that allow us to keep the website up and running. We\u2019ve also hired an IT professional to maintain the site.  \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeep the Website Ad Free:\u003c/strong\u003e Similar websites to ours run banner and popup adds to generate income for their sites. But we would love to structure Thailand Starter Kit so that you could read our guides ad-free.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you can become a patron and join our community of Thailand expats, tourists, and the plain-old curious.\u00a0Your support, no matter how big or small is greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
