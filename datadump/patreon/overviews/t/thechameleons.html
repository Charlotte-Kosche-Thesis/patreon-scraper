We\u0027ve been \"creating theatre\", as Patreon puts it, since 1966.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think theatre is a community event: the production and performance of theatre can bring people together of all ages, from all walks of life, and has been an important part of community life. There\u0027s no connection like people can get to theatre- we all watch TV, and movies but the process of watching a play, or acting in a play, is an important part of the life we want to lead for the community we want to build. Our pantomines have, in the past, brought several thousand people together over a weekend, and have been an important part of life in the area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, this way of life is more and more threatened by the modern world; people don\u0027t have time to rehearse plays, to watch plays, to perform all the neceesary backstage roles inherent in putting on a play. We\u0027re not able to perform at the scale that we once did due to many reasons: lack of local government support; changes in lifestyle meaning people are less able to commit to shows;\u00a0 professionalisation of theatre by big organisations; competition by Netflix and a thousand other types of entertainment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need your help to make sure we can introduce a new generation to theatre and install this benefit for the community for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e"
