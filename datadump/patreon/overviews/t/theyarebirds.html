    "summary": "HEY! It\u0027s me, Alex! I am a queer, african-american artist, poet, writer,\n DJ, essayist, collage artist, curator, and musician. My work speaks \ndirectly to the futuristic aspects of life as a non-binary black person \nnavigating through the chaos and uncertainty that is Philadelphia. I am a\n member of the Metropolarity sci-fi collective and the singer of chaos punk band Solarized (\u003ca href=\"http://solarized.bandcamp.com),\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://solarized.bandcamp.com),\u003c/a\u003e as well as the curatorial \nforce behind Laser Life and Chrome City and other events that galvanize,\n center and empower queer and POC involvement in the arts. I\u0027m also a \nbarista! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSplitting my time between a myriad of projects and \nartistic endeavors and working for the man has gotten to be extremely \nburdensome. After losing a decent paying job at the end of 2015, I have \nstruggled to make ends meet, struggled to find even simple things like \nfood, to pay my bills, to afford transportation. It\u0027s been with the \ncontributions of friends and family and my partner Shane that I\u0027ve \nmanaged to even survive thus far. The stress of having to slog through \nbad, horribly paying jobs has affected my work. As well, I\u0027m currently the caregiver for my beloved partner Shane who has suffered a debilitating stroke at a young age. This caused me to divert many funds and grants won in the past year to taking care of him. He is doing quite well but there\u0027s still a long way to go for his recovery, there are still staggering hospital and nursing home and rehab co-pays. Helping me would, without a doubt, also be helping him! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know, I \nknow, there\u0027s plenty of starving artists out there. We all deserve some \ncompensation for our work, no doubt! But despite my recent success-- \ngetting published in anthologies like Stories for Chip, a dedication to \nSamuel Delaney, being published in the November 2016 issue of ISLAND Anthology from Image Comics or self-publishing my own comic with Jacob Mazer, I am \nstill an outsider when it comes to finding funding, navigating the world\n of writing grants, or finding investors. All of that is foreign to me. I\n believe that my future projects are of high value to the community I \nserve. Queer, trans, non-binary, LGBT spectrum folks, particularly LGBT \nspectrum folks of color, are highly devalued and underrated and misused \nby the mainstream. My work seeks to empower them. But I need a moment, I\n need time away from the grind to do so. This means time away from work.\n So, with this patreon I pledge to use all funds to \nfocus exclusively on my art, writing and music. By funding me you will \nsee the completion of novellas, scripts, screenplays, TV and film concepts, comic books, the final issue of my zine ARKDUST as well as a novelized compilation of ARKDUST stories and art, and even more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, that\u0027s a lot, but if I\u0027m dedicated and focused-- and at the age\n of 40 I certainly need all the help I can in that regard-- then I can \nget this done. We can get this done. Join me on the journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003elove and rage,\u003cbr\u003ealex\u003cbr\u003e"

This will pay for my bills as I proceed to make art, curate shows and events that support other marginalized artists, finish writing projects like screenplays and TV show concepts that center queer people of color, work on comics for indie and self publishing, and continue to make music and perform for various bands (Solarized, The Zodiac Vein, Trash Panther) and even more! The breakdown is for rent, utilities, cell phone, public transit, food. I keep my expenses very simple, but as you know they certainly can be expensive no matter how thrifty one can be. The funds will help free up time, space and energy for me to concentrate on the work and less on working for \"the man\" (typically i work in the food industry, which can be extremely stressful, long hours and intense, diverting concentration from my writing). \u003cbr\u003e",
