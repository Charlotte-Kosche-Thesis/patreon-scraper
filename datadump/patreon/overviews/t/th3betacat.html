You may know me from my YouTube channel, Th3BetaCat, where I make videos of myself playing all kinds of games adding my own comedy to it all. I also live stream on YouTube as well! If you happen to stumble across this on your own, well, hello!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/th3betacat\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHere is my channel!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eMaking content of any sort definitely puts a hit on your wallet. Of course, this has not stopped me from sharing joy and following my own passions. Quite a few of you have asked about supporting my channel and, honestly, it was a tough decision. As many of you know just from being a viewer of mine or in previous vlogs, I have a hard time asking for help - especially if any form of currency is involved.\u00a0 However, I have finally convinced myself to do this thanks to you guys!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003ePatreon is a place where you can pledge whatever dollar amount you want per month.\u00a0Patreon will charge you on the 1st of every month. It\u0027s a monthly subscription, think of it as Netflix. Instead of paying for movies and TV shows every month, you are donating directly to the channel every month! If you ever want to stop supporting my channel, you can simply stop.\u00a0After you pledge and become a Patron, we\u0027ll also be able to interact here in the Patreon activity stream so I can talk with you guys privately. A huge benefit about the Patreon Activity Stream is if there\u0027s anything you really want to see on the channel or just want to say hello, please feel free to post in the activity stream below this page as we go. I really enjoy interacting with you guys in the comments on YouTube and I\u0027m looking forward to talking with you guys on here, too!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn conclusion...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eIf you enjoy my videos and live streams, please, feel free to help out and support the channel. Your support goes directly into what is needed to run my channel, both in terms of what you see, and what you do not. Thank you so much for stopping by and thank you with all of my heart for the support!"
