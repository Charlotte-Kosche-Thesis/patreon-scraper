    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWHO I AM\u003c/h2\u003e\nHi I\u0027m Kristina \"Toadie\" Miller, and I\u0027m a 3D animator by trade and for the past year and spare change I\u0027ve been creating custom content for ArmA 3. It\u0027s been an excitiing new experience for me, the challenges of the engine and it\u0027s limitations, the creative challenges of making animation that looks good in both first and third person, it has been what I\u0027d call a momentous success for me. It\u0027s also made me somewhat of ArmA\u0027s go-to \"arms dealer\".In raw equipment terms, if there\u0027s a niche itch someone needs filled I\u0027ve either- attempted to fill it, am currently working on of filling it, or plan to in the not to distant future. And what I\u0027m proposing here is I\u0027d like to step that up to the next level, with your help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTraditonally, while all of the animation, sound engineering and actual arma-side configuration and porting of everything I\u0027ve made for Arma has been predominantly been my own work, the majority of the source meshes (that is, the the physical object that the weapon looks like) have been sourced elsewhere (created by the likes of Milennia, Sarv,Tigg, etc.) While the majority of these look fantastic, availability of source material tends to be a factor more than anything (and sadly quality and consistency is not always possible) when it comes to deciding what gets done, and I for one would like to break free of this limitation and start from scratch. This would not only for more variety of content as a whole (as I\u0027m not tied to what\u0027s already out there, but it would on the whole ensure a MUCH higher level of consistency across the board. The problem: time is an impinging factor. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs it stands, getting a weapon into Arma, not even counting creation of \nthe assets in the first place, takes about 10 hours all told, depending on \ncomplexity. Even for something largely modular such as my most recent \nrelease, Steyr AUGs, all told it took about 25+ hours over months to set up. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo go the next step and go from scratch is asking for about 40 hours per item, from Blank canvas to released item. \nMinimum\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWHAT I AM ASKING FOR\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I\u0027m asking is basically to subsidise some of the additional time that developing assets entirely from scratch at a pace that means I\u0027ll actually get through it all before the end of time. To be clear, I\u0027m not asking to make a career out of this, I\u0027m more than content to continue my casual scut work day job. The idea is that the more is contributed, the more time per-week I can dedicate to creating for arma, and the more scutwork I can subsidise away.\n\u003cbr\u003eWhy?\u003cbr\u003eBecause I love ArmA. While flawed in many aspects, ArmA is very much the posterchild for success despite adversity, and is probably the best social gaming experiences you can have. And I want to give back to something I get so much enjoyment out of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWHAT THIS GETS YOU\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWork Rate\u003c/h3\u003e\nYou\u0027ll notice that I\u0027m not setting a material per-month goal or a comissionable rate, and I\u0027ve done this for one specific purpose- I don\u0027t work linearly on any one thing. However, that isn\u0027t to say there won\u0027t be a performance metric. The metric I\u0027ve set for myself is about one weapon a fortnight(though this isn\u0027t concrete as it depends on the complexity of the item itself. From Scratch, to complete,ingame and entirely ready for release (and depending on what\u0027s practical or required, colour/camo variants). The plan is to then push out a publicly available arma addon of the content at the calendar start of every month. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll content I make will be, as always, released unfettered and publicly available as the mods themselves and all the source material, including configs, will be available under an\u003cstrong\u003e open-source Non-commercial share-a-like license\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the base level donators will get access to both the source material and the addons as work progresses, as well as some amount of control in the \"yay or nay\" on how items are going, as well as access to item priority in \"The List\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, more time available means more testing time. While last year I was time locked and a one-man dev team, I had limited time to do my own stress-testing. It\u0027s why small things would crop up in updates. Well, no more. If I\u0027ve got more time to Arma Work, I\u0027ve got more time to test, so everything will be going out AS close to bugless as humanly possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe List\u003c/h3\u003e\nThe List is in essence the prioritised list of all items not yet completed or currently in progress. It\u0027s a long list, currently about 200 items of work for Arma, comprised of personal interest items, requests made, and pipe dreams. Currently there\u0027s no real order of importance to the list, but with the addition help of donators voting on the order, I shall be working in a direct top-to-bottom order, and donators will directly vote on what goes where in the order. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eQuality Assurance\u003c/h3\u003e\nSo I want to demonstrate the level of detail you can expect out of my work as a whole as part of this new scheme. Obviously, Every weapon will be appropriately animated, and you already know what to expect on that front already, but I want show of some of the finishing detail on that you can count on my delivering. And I\u0027d like to say ahead of time, neither of these are photo-textured or procedurally painted, it\u0027s all hand-crafted love.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://imgur.com/1L1gVoe\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/1L1gVoe.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ek94Uho.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMore?\u003c/h3\u003e\nSo, one of the things I want to deliver more upon with more time at my disposal is getting you guys more direct access to myself, to help on how to develop for Arma, and more places to use Arma Stuff in general. These range from live streaming on development through to setting private and public Arma 3 Servers. See the milestone goals for information on specifics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFAQ\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs donating mandatory? IF I don\u0027t donate, will none of the things you\u0027re talking about happen?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNO\u003c/em\u003e. My plan is to with or without donations to begin work from scratch, albeit at a slower pace. Donating will help me create more time to work on these arma projects, therefore completing them faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAm I paying for a mod?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNO. By donating, you\u0027re not paying for any mods. All content will be publicly available for free at release, and all source files will be open for download. Donations are directly paying for development time, not content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you suddenly get a job that prevents you from keeping rate , or any other reason that production might get stalled, what happens?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf for any reason at I\u0027m unable to work at a rate approximate to what\u0027s being donated (whether that is by personal justification, or outside factors)\u00a0 I will put a stop on donations, and will only start up again IF I can guarentee the level of output will return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAm I REALLY paying for a mod?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo. If you feel you might be, or at all feel that you\u0027ve been pressured into donating, don\u0027t. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDONATING IS OPTIONAL\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere will I be able to view progress? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBackers will be able to check the backer feed here. I\u0027m also opening a blog which will chart progress for everyone, as well as provide details for additonal benefits as neccesary (Stream Times,urls, etc). Additionally, I have a Twitter,which will also carry info in a more immediate state. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e"
