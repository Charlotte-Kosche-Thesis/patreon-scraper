(Stupid fumble paws!) \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been a part of the furry fandom since 2001, and in that time I\u0027ve done a great deal of writing.

And, because I\u0027d like a way to support all the other artists and writers I\nfollow! Seriously, all my patreon contributions are getting a bit out of hand, but I want to keep supporting all the artists I love!

When I started thinking about doing this, I did some research\nand found almost 250,000 words that I had never posted or shared with anyone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also have a huge amount of art that I have commissioned, based\non my stories and various characters I\u2019ve written about. I hope to post this\nart alongside the story that inspired it, writing new scenes when necessary, with links to the awesome artists who\nmade if for me so you can go support and commission them yourselves.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\tWhen will you be posting? \n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStories:\u003c/strong\u003e Each month I\u0027m going to post about 10,000 words from the stories in my \narchive that no one has ever seen before.
