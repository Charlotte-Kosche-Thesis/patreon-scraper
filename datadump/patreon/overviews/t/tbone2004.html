I\u0027ve been doing videos since 2006, whether it\u0027s silly entertainment or I\u0027m expressing my personal opinion on things wrong with the world. To put it simply, I\u0027m a ranter tried and true, but I have fun making videos for you, my fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may be asking yourself why I\u0027m opening this Patreon page. Well, let me go ahead and tell you why. I\u0027m what you would call \"a starving artist\". While making videos is one of my specialties, it\u0027s also hard to do so with bare bones software and computers. Granted I\u0027ve always done it this way, many have told me I can do better by expanding my software, or getting a powerful PC to make them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I mainly do these videos without asking for much, but with the economy tanking, finances drained due to bills, and the threat of having to pay to upload on Youtube, it\u0027s becoming very hard for me to even make videos now. Although I have a ZippCast page, I still want to reach out to Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell gang, that\u0027s where YOU come in! I\u0027ve never asked a lot from you guys, but your kind words and best wishes have gone a long way for me. Even the PayPal donations mean a lot to me as well. So what could I be asking for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m asking for you to donate to my cause, so I can keep making more videos, and possibly expand on them, making them look more professional, and be able to present them to bigger causes. After all, we all want to reach for our dreams, so why not help out? I greatly appreciate anything that\u0027s given to me, and I never take anything for granted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd before anyone claims this is a \"Fund My Life\" deal, NO! FAR FROM IT! While I appreciate you guys helping me out, I also want to make sure that I can provide top quality content for you guys as well. They always said \"Rome wasn\u0027t built in a day\", and I\u0027ve lived by that axiom to this day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please consider donating to my Patreon today, and I\u0027ll do my very best to keep bringing you the videos you want to see! And as always...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"THIS IS TBONE2004 SAYING GOOD NIGHT, GOOD LUCK, AND GOD SPEED!\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

I didn\u0027t realize it at first, but I was creating radio plays before I even knew what a radio play was! Ever since then, I\u0027ve always loved getting on stage, playing a character, and entertaining a crowd.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom there, I discovered the internet is like a huge stage for performers, and that\u0027s how I got started. Ever since, I have made over 150+ videos on Youtube and ZippCast. I have also hosted two podcasts between 2012 and 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main goal is to eventually become a professional entertainer, if not on stage, then on the internet. Of course, I live by the axiom \"Rome wasn\u0027t built in a day\". But with dedication to my goals, I know I can make things happen!",
