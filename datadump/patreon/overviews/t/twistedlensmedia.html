    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhy we decided to start a Patreon page:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAndreya, Anthony, Lexy, and Steve at Twisted Lens Media really appreciate all of the wonderful support that you have gifted us over the past several years. Thanks to that support we\u0027ve made engaging and hilarious podcasts in 1000 Ways To F This Up (\u003cem\u003econcluded\u003c/em\u003e) and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://middlevillemornings.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMiddleville Mornings\u003c/a\u003e (\u003cem\u003eongoing\u003c/em\u003e), and live for the sweet fan love those projects bring us. We\u0027re now diving in to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/twistedlens\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estreaming live content\u003c/a\u003e with Squeeb Plays, Tony\u0027s Completatorium, and Blindly Forward. We\u0027ve had so much fun with all our projects and we\u0027d like to do more. We love getting to know the people out there who like what we do, so we\u0027ve sweetened the pot a bit by giving anyone who becomes a Patron the opportunity to see what goes on behind the scenes as we make all of this great content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe will never charge for anything we make for you. We see it as a wonderful opportunity to entertain and that is what drives us.  While we don\u0027t require anyone to contribute to this ragtag band of misfits, we decided that it wouldn\u0027t hurt to give you the opportunity to give.  Anything we receive, whether from Twitch subscriptions, PayPal donations, Patreon contributions, etc., all goes directly into creating new content for you. We\u0027ve been overwhelmed with the amount of support that we\u0027ve received since we started out on this adventure and we\u0027d like to continue to grow.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of the things that we want to create for you:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore podcasts ranging from informational to comedic\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWeekly short comedy series\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWeekly live stream of our Dungeons and Dragons campaign and other tabletop games as opportunities arise\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA show about puppets and humans going head-to-softer-head in a Judge-Judy like courtroom drama that we need (and you need, you\u0027ll see) to bring to life\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOther projects that will come to us by magic on a random Tuesday (or by intelligent deliberation, whatever)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to creation more for you, we also need to invest in more and better equipment (we use things until they break, and boy do they break) and maybe expand into a larger space (so we aren\u0027t stepping around film and audio equipment nearly every moment). Your contribution will also help us pay for a large chunk of the podcast hosting and other operational costs that come with running a burgeoning media network like Twisted Lens Media. This will help us keep making the awesome stuff we make now and give us a chance to show you what else we can do . We sincerely appreciate every single penny graciously given, but remember that if you can\u0027t give, you can still enjoy all of the same content you always have and we thank you just the same. We are humbled and excited that you take the time to pay attention to our little corner of the Internet.\u003cbr\u003e"
