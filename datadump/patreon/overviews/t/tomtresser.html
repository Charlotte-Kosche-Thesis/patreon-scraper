     "about": "I am a civic educator, public defender and community builder based in Chicago. I\u0027ve been doing grassroots democracy for over 40 years. I\u0027ve started or led 14 nonprofit enterprises in the arts, community development and civic engagement.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2009 I was a co-leader of the \u003ca href=\"http://www.nogames.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNo Games Chicago campaign\u003c/a\u003e that help to derail the bid for the 2016 Olympics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.ford1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27336261_10155367580475829_534176101473099068_n.jpg?oh=e650c3a28935c6538c2e3b53a68fd3b8\u0026amp;oe=5B24D63C\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 I opened the \u003ca href=\"http://http:/www.civiclab.us\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCivicLab\u003c/a\u003e in Chicago\u0027s West Loop. This was America\u0027s first (and, I believe, only) co-working space dedicated to innovation, education and collaboration for civic engagement and social change. From there we launched The \u003ca href=\"http://www.tifreports.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTIF Illumination Project\u003c/a\u003e, which investigates and exposes the hyper-local impacts of tax increment financing districts. That project triggered 64 public meetings since 2013. That work led to the publication of \u003ca href=\"http://www.wearenotbroke.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Chicago Is Not Broke. Funding the City We Deserve\u003c/a\u003e.\" The book was published in July of 2016 and has spawned 55 public meetings all over the city! That work has led to the creation of \u003ca href=\"http://www.powerinstitute.us\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTthe POWER Institute\u003c/a\u003e to train up champions for social justice to win campaigns and move public policy.
