The Custard TV Podcast on Patreon and thanks for visiting our page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past five years we\u0027ve created almost 200 TV review podcasts alongside bonus episodes and interviews, a trend we hope to continue going forward although we need your help for a number of reasons:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003cstrong\u003eImproving the frequency and quality of the podcast\u003c/strong\u003e: We\u0027re hoping to invest in new recording equipment \u00a0which will allow more than one of us to record each of our sessions. Additionally, this means we\u0027ll be able to record an episode of the show if one member of the trio is unable to appear we can put an instalment out regardless.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003cstrong\u003eTravel Costs\u003c/strong\u003e: We\u0027re hoping to attend more events and screenings so we can report on them for both the podcast and the website. However, being scattered across the country this is easier said than done and having a bit of extra cash will afford access to increasingly steep train fares.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) \u003cstrong\u003eBonus Episodes\u003c/strong\u003e: In the near future we\u0027re hoping to add bonus content to the main feed such as the recent Talking Peaks series. Additionally, we\u0027d like to reach a major milestone and do our first live episode with all three of us in the same room. However, these take time to do and your contributions would be able to allow us to free up some time to do just this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4)\u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSite maintenance\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0We\u0027re having to pay a lot to host the podcast and would like to have that cost covered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor your donations you\u0027ll receive a bunch of new content including two Patreon-exclusive Podcast series, previews of any shows we attend screenings of, access to the podcast before they become available to the general public as well as show notes and plenty of other behind-the-scenes content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always we appreciate the support that you\u0027ve given to us over the last five years and hope that you\u0027ll join us on this new adventure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLuke, Gary and Matt\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
