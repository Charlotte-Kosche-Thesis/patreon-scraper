Two\nsimple (very simple) video producers, graphic designers and entertainers who are looking to make their mark by creating content to please.

He may not be as rage filled as other online personalities but he is just as passionate of the films he talks about. Delving into each topic in this movie autopsy review format. Nero is always willing to deliver the verbal execution to any movie he sees fit and is ready to rip and tear a movie that crosses his execution block.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.toongrin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the moment thoughts, reactions and brain farts; we\u0027re just watching stuff.

The best course we decided to take was for those of you who decide to become ToonGrin Patrons that you wouldn\u0027t become some exclusive club of the upper elite for ToonGrin fans but have a more direct hand in ToonGrin\u0027s development as producers of our shows. Rewards will work as if you were taking part in the development of each video and project. With the freedom to inject your own ideas into the development process by joining in the patron discussion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTo access content,\nyou need only access it\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNo particular reviews will be walled off. Pay as much or as\nlittle as you want. Pay nothing if you don\u0027t believe you should. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have some milestone goal(s), though the one major one is to\ncover production costs as well as supporting ourselves (paying bills,\ngroceries, etc.) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe idea is simple. We need to make a living off this in order\nto keep it going, but it\u0027s your decision as to whether or not we can. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile crowdfunding is a scary notion we also know that it is\nthe best bet for true independence. We\u2019ve all heard the noise about other\ncritics being paid off, review embargos and other ways the corporate masters\ntry to conceal shady deals. So we want to avoid that and we hope that we can\ngrow and bring this endeavor to life with great gusto! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eAnything to Declare?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nWe\u2019ll be straightforward with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are creatives pure and simple. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe want to create. \u003cbr\u003eReviews. \u003cbr\u003eAnimated Shorts.\u003cbr\u003eBecome\u00a0published\nauthors for comics.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe want to create for ourselves and for you and by being independent like this assures we stay as such.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAgree to Disagree\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJust because you fund ToonGrin doesn\u2019t mean we always will agree. Let\u0027s be honest\nand clear - we will not always say things you agree with. We are\ncritics we are true to ourselves on the subjects and products we give our\nthoughts on and so that might mean we have opposing views here and there. Now,\nby all means, you are allowed to disagree and even bring it up in the comments\nthat you don\u2019t agree with us and we welcome that! We love civil disagreement, it\nmakes for intelligent conversation and different viewpoints that may have been\noverlooked or simple never thought of. Engaging in intellectual conversation\nabout a film or show is always fun and can be brilliant in its own right. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eZero Tolerance on\nBullying\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nKnow that we enact a zero tolerance policy on bullying. That\nmeans the moment you start a fight you are gone. We will not tolerate any\nprejudice in our community. We are all here with one like-minded ideal and\nthat\u2019s to be entertained and have a good time. If you are here to disrupt that\nthan you will find yourself quickly removed from the situation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre We Done Here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nFor now, if for whatever reason we figure something out or\ndecide any changes we will happily inform you. We get wholeheartedly that this\nis scary new territory. But it seems as our audience has grown we have met\nmagnificent people so we have faith that this will work out. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhether you fund us or not, thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe appreciate you for even stopping by, for even considering\nus, for even clicking on a link, thank you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou have helped to give us hope that we can make this\nhappen.
