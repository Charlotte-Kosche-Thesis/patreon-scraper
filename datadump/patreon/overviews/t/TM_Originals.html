    "summary": "Hi! My name is Tamera and I\u0027m a jewelry artist! Some might consider it foolish to become a full time artist in your late 40\u0027s but sometimes the Universe gives you what you need - not what you think you want. I couldn\u0027t find a job in the corporate world and one day, in a blinding flash of DUH, it occurred to me that maybe the Universe was telling me it was time to get serious about my art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth my mother and my grandmother were artists so it\u0027s in my DNA. I have always enjoyed arts and crafts and working with my hands. I\u0027m an artist and my preferred medium is jewelry. It\u0027s the thing I keep going back to and I am blessed with more ideas about what I want to create than I have the time and energy for currently. This is a good problem to have as an artist. So, as of February 2016, I decided it was time to take the plunge and do this full time. It\u0027s hard. This is the hardest I\u0027ve ever worked - and that\u0027s saying something!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a new line I\u0027m working on creating in metal. It combines both my drawing skills and my metalsmithing skills. I am drawing animals, cutting them out of sheet metal, shaping them and either hand finishing them with either metalwork detailing or by fusing glass enamel onto them in layers. You see, I never was one to pick the easy route. My business name is T. M. Originals because that\u0027s what I prefer to do. I am not interested in creating jewelry to be sold at online boutiques and ripped off by Urban Outfitters. I\u0027m interested in making distinctive wearable art that stands out in a crowd. \u00a0I want to have it in the gift shops of art galleries, museums, aquariums, and zoos. \u00a0I need help, though. \u00a0I need to buy full size enamels and kiln equipment. \u00a0I need your support to get this new line going!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry - I\u0027m still planning to work on my recycled watch \u0026amp; pocket watch pieces and my found object \u0026amp; recycled tin pieces. \u00a0However, old watch parts are not in infinite quantity and someday I may start having a very hard time finding them. \u00a0I\u0027ll still have my hard drive parts so that\u0027s something! \u00a0Seriously, I love the work I do in resin but as an artist I like to keep pushing myself to do new and different things and there are so many techniques and materials to create with!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m close. \u00a0I\u0027m really close to supporting myself. \u00a0I have cut my personal expenses down as far as I can. \u00a0I\u0027m good at managing money but I need to have enough coming in to actually be able to manage it. \u00a0Right now, a large portion of my jewelry income is being used to pay rent and bills rather than being invested back into my business. \u00a0I have plans for making my business successful but I need to have enough to cover show fees and be able to save up for equipment, materials, and studio space to help me be more self sufficient. \u00a0My new metal line could eventually be laser cut for me offline so that I\u0027d just need to do the finish work - which would save a lot of time and enable me to have more available for stores and shows. \u00a0While I enjoy doing shows and plan to continue, it would be a great relief to be able to reduce my schedule a bit so I have more time for making the art and the many other things that go into running a business. \u00a0One of my major goals this year is to pay down my credit card so that I have more manageable monthly payments. \u00a0Ideally, I would use it only when I travel or to make a major purchase which would be paid off as soon as possible. \u00a0By becoming a patron now, you will be investing in an exciting future in my art business and you will be the first to be notified of new designs and exciting business news!"

In my Ice Resin pieces I often use layers to create visual interest. I incorporate  beads, charms, recycled watch and hard drive parts, decorative paper and rubber stamps in my work, as well as found objects. I\u2019ve been exploring both symmetrical and asymmetrical designs.\u003cbr\u003eI have taken three quarters of the Jewelry Design Certificate courses at NSCC and I have been doing continuing studies with Danaca Design. I completed the business development and financial management programs at Washington C.A.S.H (a local non-profit organization that helps low income folks start small businesses) and continue to work with them to create a successful business!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my beaded items is included in the Lark Publication \u2018Showcase 500 Beaded Jewelry\u2019 released in late July 2012!

I have cut my personal bills down as much as possible but I need some help to make my ends meet while I build my business. \u00a0My first major goal is to have $600 a month come in through my Patreon account so that I am able to invest more of my business earnings back into the business, pay down my credit card, and start putting more money into my business savings account to save up for future materials and equipment purchases.",
