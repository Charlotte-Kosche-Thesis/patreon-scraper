    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome and Thank You!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe economy does not work equally or equitably for everyone. Decades of reporting on poverty, wage inequality, wealth inequality, disparities based on race and gender, and a shrinking middle class offer ample evidence of economic distress for millions of Americans. What is important to remember is that these are not simply data points or economic trend-lines; they represent people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEconomic justice is a central part of God\u2019s message in calling humanity to reconciliation. Jesus impressed this upon his first disciples. In fact, his teachings and manner of life indicate resources must be shared more equitably. And the Early Church patterned their community life and ministry after an economic fellowship in stark contrast to economic disparity in the world. Numerous biblical scholars give clear evidence of not only economic oppression in antiquity but, also, the prophetic witness in advocating for economic justice in both the Hebrew and Christian scriptures.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe church today is mostly removed from the economic advocacy of the prophets, Jesus, and the pattern of economic life modeled by the first disciples. Christian faith in our culture tends to treat economics as a side subject of the biblical tradition rather than a central element of God\u2019s activity in the world. When we do reflect on economics and poverty it is mostly in relation to supporting outreach efforts. While outreach is an important response of faith, the biblical testimony goes far beyond helping those in need. Advocacy for a restorative economics which is rooted in God\u2019s distributive justice are central to biblical texts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo assist in reclaiming a gospel of economic justice as central to Christian life and witness, I am launching the God\u2019s Economics Project. I will draw on the outstanding work of biblical scholars and theologians as well as my own research and experience as priest and economist. The God\u2019s Economics Project will result in multi-media resources (book, study guide, audio book, webinars, and other presentation materials) to facilitate conversation and action among faith communities toward a more just economic system in the United States. The God\u2019s Economics Project will provide a series of practical action steps faith communities can engage toward real economic change for the common good.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/therevjaylawlor\"\u003emonthly contribution\u003c/a\u003e, in any amount, to support the research, writing, and promotion of \u003cem\u003eGod\u0027s Economics\u003c/em\u003e is greatly appreciated. E-book and print copies of the forthcoming book, as well as other multi-media materials, are provided as gifts for various levels of patronage. You can also make a contribution as little as $1 per month without receiving a gift. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSharing with others about this project is another great way to show your support. Whatever you can offer, thank you for your commitment to proclaiming a Gospel of Economic Justice toward the common good of all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nChrist\u2019s Peace,\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg height=\"113\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.therevjaylawlor.com/wp-content/uploads/Jay-signature-1.jpg?resize=150%2C113\u0026amp;ssl=1\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\" width=\"150\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
