    "summary": "I am passionate about two things in my life, service to my community and elders through my role as Dance Chief in the \"The Dance for all People\" a ceremony based on the indigenous traditions of the Great Basin. \u00a0And to the creation of art and performance which explores our collective search for understanding and healing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my art life I have more opportunities than I have time or money to explore. \u00a0I am at a frustrating cross roads where many doors are opening and most of these opportunities, while creatively rich do not include sufficient pay to be explored without outside support. I am at a similar place in my ceremony life, in my role as Dance Chief I am expected to attend at a minimum all 7 primary ceremonies a year, each one taking, with travel and recovery time, between at least 7 days, and the stipends I receive for this work do little more than cover travel and basic expenses and does not come close to covering a weeks lost wages. \u00a0I do own a small business and support myself, my art and my service to community through my labor there, \u00a0As I grow older I am finding the labor harder and harder to do and less and less time available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout a month ago I was approached by the Artistic Director of On The Boards, a performance art theater here in Seattle. \u00a0And I was offered a rare opportunity, a chance in create a main stage evening length performance to be presented as part of OTB\u0027s 2017/2018 season. \u00a0Which is amazing! \u00a0And I ponder the time required, the research needed to do the show I want to do, I wonder how is this going to happen without outside support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am reaching out to my communities and beyond and with a humble heart asking for help in supporting my ceremony and creative life. \u00a0Your donation will allow me continue my work in both arenas. \u00a0Without support financial pressure will force me to sharply cut my participation in the things of love, in the things I believe to be my life\u0027s calling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy focus with this funding effort is small, monthly donations to support my work going forward into the future. \u00a0I plan on reaching out and sharing this page with my friends, family and communities. \u00a0Please know that whether or not you are able to support me in this way that I value our connection and certainly understand that not everyone will be able to contribute.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you sincerely for your consideration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTimothy White Eagle\u003cbr\u003e"

Support at this level will allow me build the final room in my series. \u00a0It will bring the \"Swallowing Monster\" to life!",
