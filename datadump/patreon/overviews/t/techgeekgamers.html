    "summary": "Gather round and allow me to regale you with the epic tale of the origins of Tech Geek Gamers. It was dreary day in October and the founders -- Chris, Cory and Mark -- were engaged in mortal combat with Malygos within the Eye of Eternity. Upon falling to the legendary dragon for the thirteenth time, our heroes gazed into each others eyes in silence when a moment of clarity came upon them. The silence was broken and the follow words were spoken...\"Maybe we should do something more productive with our time?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to today and Tech Geek Gamers has grown to included more best friends -- Tara and Rob -- and A LOT of board games. Sure...we make an absurd amount of mistakes while playing them on the smash hit show with hundreds of views,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eHouse Rules\u003c/em\u003e, but it\u0027s ok, because when our amazing fans call us out, Chris drinks! Of course we still play video games, we just play the ones that truly test friendships, on our other smash hit show with dozens of views,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eCouch Co-Op! \u003c/em\u003eEvery once in a while we\u0027ll sit around and talk about whatever we want, and when we do we\u0027re always 100% accurate in every statement...except for Mark.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2016 was a very successful year in terms of growth and for that, we say thank you to everyone who subscribed, shared and liked us. This got us thinking about what\u0027s next? What else can we do? How far could this go? We\u0027ve got some ideas of things we want to do and try, but without the support of our friends, family and community it would be an empty journey. This is where Patreon comes in. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince Cory is a dork and mentioned that we had this page live on our Gift Guide episode, we will be expanding our tiers and goals in the coming weeks, so expect changes. In the meantime, no matter what tier you support us at, please know that this is going directly into the Tech Geek Gamers shows. It will be used to buy more gear, more games and give us the ability to produce better and eventually MORE shows. For you support, at whatever level it may at be, we say \u003cstrong\u003e\"Thank you!\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
