    "summary": "Hi Guys,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Phil Buck. I am a musician who is also obsessively inspired by comic books. As an extension of the music we create for the \"virtual band\" called Those Shadow People, we have also penned a gigantic story to further explore the themes of the songs. Back in 2012, we were able to bring the project to life with our first music and comic book combination. This product was a 7\" vinyl record, a 32 page comic book, and a hand-made, screen printed cover.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first comic/vinyl release was a success for us. We made a limited run of 100 and pretty much sold out. Since the first release, I have learned A LOT about comic book creation and I have made numerous connections with excellent artists who are helping me bring the next episode to life. I have been writing comic book scripts and designing characters like a beast, but my sequential art skills are not up to snuff. I would love to illustrate the comic myself, but I have a certain standard in mind that requires I hire more talented artists than myself to uphold this standard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, it\u0027s with all that being said that I have started this Patreon page to help fund the cost of illustration. Pretty much all the funds donated here will go to pay an artist to produce a page of the comic. My page rate for artists is between $50 - $65 per page, thus the goals you will see on the left side correlated to these amounts. As a reassurance to you that the comics \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0come out, I am still currently funding every bit of the work that I can from money that I make doing commissioned comic book scripts and lettering. Unfortunately, as a freelancer, the income is unpredictable, so every little bit helps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo explain my goals here a bit better, we are still working to make physical comic and music releases, but to help gain a bigger following, we will also be releasing new comic pages online through our webcomic. The music will also be available digitally on our website, www.nematoderecords.com, and all major digital music retailers."
