     "about": "As a former family law attorney, Erik describes himself as someone who\u2019s \u201cbeen through a thousand divorces and still believes in love.\u201d Ushering couples through divorce wasn\u2019t easy for Erik, a romantic from birth, but it turned out to be the ideal medium through which to understand the entire life cycle of a relationship. As a result, Erik has a unique, real-world comprehension of what makes one marriage thrive and another fall apart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring his time as an attorney, Erik racked up a few accolades: He founded a successful law journal, built the largest and fastest-growing family law firm in the Bay Area, was named a Super Lawyer three years running, and garnered a 10-star Avvo rating. He also teamed up with a psychologist friend to lead premarital courses for couples, hoping to give them the skills they\u2019d need to stay out of his office. Ultimately, his calling to help couples build healthy relationships superseded his legal career, and he decided to dedicate himself full-time to creating a place couples could go for information, inspiration, and a big dose of truth. That\u2019s when Together was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eErik lives in San Francisco with his fianc\u00e9, Aubrie. After three years of amazing vacations, silly fights, gushy displays of affection, and pet vomit, they\u2019re more passionate than when they met, and going deeper daily. It\u2019s hard work, but good work. Erik also volunteers as a marriage commissioner at San Francisco City Hall and has had the honor of marrying more than 180 couples.\u003cbr\u003e",
