They share their stories to help inspire others to overcome the lasting effects of their own traumas. If you are a survivor, you will find that you are not alone in what you are going through, and that no matter how difficult things are now, there is always hope that you can move beyond your past to live the life you deserve to live - for the grass to get greener for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTopics have included: bullying, emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, trafficking, adoption, abandonment, and more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve reached a point with the show where I need to hire an assistant to help free up some of my time so that I can focus on other projects and ultimately put out more content and resources for you. Your contribution will help keep the show running. It\u0027ll allow me to have an assistant as well as cover the monthly costs associated with hosting the show and its website.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cool thing is that I\u0027ll be setting goals so that you can see what we are striving for together. And I\u0027ll also be able to reward you for being a patron of the show. You\u0027ll always be able to see the latest goals and rewards here on this page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny contribution you are able to make, no matter the size, will be greatly appreciated. And if you\u0027re not able to become a patron at this time, that\u0027s okay too. I still appreciate your support and for you checking out this campaign. If you know someone who you think might be interested in becoming a patron, then feel free to share this with them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMelissa\u003cbr\u003e"
