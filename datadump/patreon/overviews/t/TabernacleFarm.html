Everyday you see commercials on TV for agencies wanting to help neglected dogs and cats... \u003cem\u003ebut what about neglected farm animals\u003c/em\u003e ?  In our area, there are many farm animals that are kept in tiny areas with no food to eat and no one to love and care for them. They are sad, lonely, malnourished, and often abused.  Perhaps they were gotten to be a pet but the owners soon realized caring for them was too much of a physical or financial burden, or they are simply no longer wanted or needed... so they are left to suffer in terrible living conditions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will take in those poor animals and give them a loving, happy home. We accept cows, horses, llamas, alpacas, goats, sheep, chickens, etc... and NO, we \u003cstrong\u003edon\u0027t\u003c/strong\u003e eat any of them!  The only animal we cannot accommodate is pigs and that is due to local ordinances.  With our own money, we have purchased 22 acres of land and are building a small house. We also bought a small Kubota tractor and we are working to get everything ready for the animals. We need your help to be able to build proper fencing, shelters, barns and coops for the animals. We also will need help purchasing the various types of food for the animals as they arrive on the farm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will keep track of all donations and show exactly what they were spent on.\u00a0 If you let us know, we will list you as a donor on our website. We also post progress updates on our website and you can follow us on \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tabernaclefarm/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 Every donor will have full access to our website and all other content.\u00a0 We do not want to restrict anything just because one person might not be able to give as much as someone else. Thank you all for your support and may God bless you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eJerry and Cynthia\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
