By becoming a patreon with a small monthly contribution you get to be part of that,\u00a0enjoying the stories and helping others become more. Helping to decide how and what we do next and more. \u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Assateague-Trip/i-ZDcdXtv/0/04d60466/S/patreonbanner-S.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBecoming a Patreon means you are bringing yourself to the forefront of everything we can and will do. From adventuring to places that are on the verge of being lost, to locations which you, the Paterons of The Adventure TAB will decide. Along the way, capturing stories of individuals we cross paths with, the homeless, those fighting with stigmas, towns which have suffered great loss and more. My goal here, is quite simply, to help and to bring more of our country to the forefront.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Assateague-Trip/i-5TKXv97/0/83aa55a6/S/TAA_9974b-S.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isn\u0027t just about adventures and photos and those stories, but it is also part of the Squashing Stigma project. So along the way there will be stories of families that may be in a sticky situation, individuals battling with stigmas that so many place on them, mini family sessions for families that may have lost everything in the floods, a fire, or natural disaster and more. Being a patreon means you\u0027re helping to help them as well....\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patreon also means that you are pledging a donation to special posts which only you, our patreaons will have access to. And there\u0027s even two special pledge amounts for photographers and wedding brides / grooms. These two pledge amounts will be posts relative to just that, photography and weddings, so if you don\u0027t care about those two things, those options definitely aren\u0027t for you!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAnyway, back to what I was saying, as a patreon you will have access to stories, highlight videos, moments of joy and sadness and special photos which you will have access to download and make a print of. (for person use only). You choose your tier of donation, and you\u0027re in, not only are you in, but you get the special pieces and parts that come with that donation!. And don\u0027t worry, for one, \u00a0we will never post more than 4 donation based posts per month. And two, your pledges are by post, not monthly. So if I have a quiet month, then no pledges are extended... So sometimes, we may post none at all. Either way, wether you donate in our most basic tier or opt to become a larger part of this journey. And even if you feel as though it\u0027s not the right time to become part of the team, \u003cstrong\u003ewe thank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
