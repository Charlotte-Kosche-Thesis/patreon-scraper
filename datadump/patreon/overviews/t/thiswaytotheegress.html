In an industry that doesn\u0027t always have the friendliest climate for a sustainable living, we have still managed to keep this project going for almost ten (10!) years and it has solely been because of\u00a0the support of our fans, family, friends and a tiny dream of being able to write our future, our way. We have funded two out of four of albums using crowdsourcing platforms and had great feedback from folks.\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e is a bit different but that\u0027s ok, we are changing with the times. And we are inviting you to come along with us on our newest adventure.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho We Are.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Taylor Galassi \u0026amp; Sarah Egress coming at you with our troupe of weirdos\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis Way to the EGRESS;\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0the accordion-led neo-vaudeville, ensemble that has been kickin\u0027 it DIY-style for the last ten years. No real funding. No real backing. Just a lot of finger crossing, wincing and our drive to create. Luckily, our music has connected us with artists, friends \u0026amp; fans \u003cem\u003e(that\u0027s you!)\u003c/em\u003e who have helped us see it through.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Is Patreon!?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt is a place in the inter-world where we can invest in our own and each others future. A place to keep art, music and things happening. It is where we can take what matters into our own hands. There is something liberating \u003cem\u003e(albeit at times terrifying)\u003c/em\u003e about that sentiment. The people have the power to be a part of the things they want to see made. Patreon is a way to join your favorite creator\u0027s community and assist them with backing for making the stuff you and others love. You can now pay a few bucks \u003cem\u003eper thing\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ethat a creator makes. Not sure howit works? here\u0027s an example, if you were to pledge $2 per video, and the creator releases 3 videos in February, then your card gets charged a total of $6 that month.  This means the creator gets paid regularly \u003cem\u003e(every time we release something new) \u003c/em\u003eand you become a bonafide, real-life patron of the arts.  That\u2019s right--\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003emaking an impact on the art and music world long after we are all here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We Do.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTaylor \u0026amp; Myself- \u003cem\u003e(along with everyone in our band) \u003c/em\u003ejuggle a full time creative project with full/part-time \u0027day\u0027 jobs. Sometimes we are working 80+ hours a week between the two which is how we have managed\u00a0to write and release 4\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e \u003c/strong\u003efull length albums, several EP\u0027s, music videos, Zines and a butt-load of content while also delivering sushi, teaching 9 year olds how to play Fur Elise, taking odd jobs, bar-tending, waiting tables, and the like. It is a labor of love but it is exhausting and at times not the best thing for our minds, bodies, or spirit. Oh yeah, and we also bought and are converting a 29ft school bus for touring named Frances. We are just makers. Makers of music. Makers of art. Makers of things!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Patreon will help us do.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBalancing art life \u0026amp; day to day life- often doesn\u0027t leave enough hours in the day to complete all of the band work or personal projects we would like to see come to fruition. There are all of the EGRESS things like:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003emore music!\u00a0 (another album, EP\u0027s, Concept albums, soundtracks for films, etc)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emusic videos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEGRESS unplugged series (MTV Style)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCover Song\u0027s Series\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA documentary of life on the road in the bus!?!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ezines\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003epuppet shows\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eskits\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn EGRESS video game app.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ea DIY Youtube blog with everything from how to launch a crowdsouring campaign, how to release an album, how to convert a school bus, or how to not lose your mind on Facebook!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand tours, tours, tours\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut then there are all of the other things:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid you know that Taylor has also been writing chopper rap? Or that him and I have been writing for a death-country album? How about my solo album which has been waiting in the wings for the 10 years life span of this project. We have also been brainstorming a children\u0027s book series.\u00a0 One of mine and Taylor\u0027s life dreams is to score for a film. And there is so, So, SO much more and that is what this Patreon will help create. With enough patrons, we can make \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0027things\u0027\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e a full time priority, which means more access and content for you. Instead of serving booze we will be serving music, instead of delivering sushi we will be delivering things, instead of second guessing our purpose we will be able to breathe with out a paper bag on our face. It\u0027s scary.\u00a0 We are inviting you to be a part of our collective in exchange you will have exclusive access to our content that no one else gets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy this matters.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you\u0027re a child, everyone tells you to dream big. If you put your mind to it, you can do anything. What they don\u0027t tell you is that as you get older that changes. They often want you to compromise. More times than not, the arts are looked at as extra- curricular; a past time and certainly not a means to make a living. Expendable. WE.DON\u0027T.FEEL.THAT.WAY. Music, art, poetry and invention are the very things that define cultures, era\u0027s and human nature. In a system where those programs are cut from schools and grant funding is slashed every year, where the cost of living keeps going up and people figure \u0027why pay $15 dollars for a cd when I can stream it for free\u0027 there must be folks leading the charge and leaving things for the future generations to aspire to create. The internet threw the arts for a loop and while it\u0027s recovering and the pendulum is coming back around, it needs folks like you to keep it going. That\u0027s what we want to do. That\u0027s what we want to do with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat your contribution does.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney is weird. No doubt about it, it can also make people weird about it. Often artists have a difficult time accepting money for something they enjoyed creating. This is something I personally struggle with.\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThe truth is we are thrifty, we can \u003cem\u003e(and have)\u003c/em\u003e made a lot of \u0027things\u0027 happen but some \u0027things\u0027 cost more than others to make. Some \u0027things\u0027 cost more than the financial backing it takes and costs us in sleep, comfort, stability, and mental wellness. However, our little creator economy doesn\u0027t just feed us, it feeds other creators as well. Your contribution will be the first stone in a pond that makes a ripple. \u003cbr\u003eFor example, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eour last music video was done by the kindness of all of the volunteers that came out and our AMAZING friend Strat who is a phenomenal film/movie maker. Seriously, he is so good. We want the world to see how great he is. Moving forward, if we have a budget for these things we will be able to pay him, he can take the money from these side jobs and invest into better equipment and the projects he\u0027d like to see happen. He can make more things. Things that will inspire people. Things that matter and color life.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe get all of our merch from an amazing company called\u003cstrong\u003e Lehigh Valley Apparel Creations. \u003c/strong\u003eThe owner went to high school with Taylor and started his company in a shed in his parents back yard. He has now expanded for the 4th time. The quality is amazing and LVAC is the definition of the \u0027american dream\u0027. Starting a business with your hard work, sweat and fury and slowly rising through the ranks. We are honored to be a part of their journey. We want to keep giving him our business, he is a huge supporter of the local music, art and DIY business scene where we live.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOur producer, is by far one of our favorite human beings. He built his studio with his own bare hands and made it an amazing space for musicians to create. Every album we \u003cem\u003e(and other artists)\u003c/em\u003e do with him helps him keep his doors open. His integrity and honestly is a rare gem in this industry, he has done albums for Balkan Beatbox, Gogol Bordello, World Inferno and we want to see and hear him make many more awesome albums. The magic of the best albums out there are from the musician and producer connection. We can\u0027t let that art get lost.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMeet Sarah Monster one of our favorite illustrator\u0027s to work with. She is responsible for doing our infamous sugar skull design, along with others. She is an amazing artist and sculptor. The more we commission through her, the more she can continue to touch peoples lives with her amazing vision and beautiful sculpture\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIt. Goes. On. And. On.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution doesn\u0027t end with us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePer Thing verses Per Month\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs of now we are choosing to charge \u0027Per Thing\u0027\u003cbr\u003eAt the start it is we feel this is the best choice for us as creators and you as our patrons. Sometimes life get\u0027s busy, people get ill, we tour, or simply we need a bit of personal time. If we don\u0027t release an \u0027official thing\u0027 you won\u0027t be charged. Our personal goal is to release about a thing per month once this ball gets rolling but we understand our industry well enough to know that in the beginning we will be watching ours and your backs and keep ourselves accountable by only charging you when we have something substantial to give you in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if we are on a roll and release more than one thing you ask?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe folks at Patreon are doing a great job of tweaking things as this newer platform grows\u003cbr\u003emoves along and they have a super awesome Monthly Cap option. So if you are like us and on a super fixed budget and can only every afford to throw us $20 a month, set that as your cap and if we make more than one thing a month you won\u0027t be charged more and if we put nothing out, no one will be charged. You won\u0027t lose any access to the \u0027things\u0027 because hell, we are all in this together. The idea is to make this sustainable for each other. We are grateful for everything we are assisted in creating.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I said. We want to do it with you. We welcome and encourage your feedback. Let us know what you think via twitter, FB, email, etc. The neat thing about it is, as life changes, you can change. You can change, adjust or remove your pledge to the arts at anytime. We are aware that there are a lot of worthy causes to be contributing to now-a-days and we don\u0027t take for granted that you deem our art as one of them. Thank you for reading this novel, being a part of our cause and deeming it worthy of your time, energy and support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s do this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eso much love \u0026amp; fury, \u003cbr\u003eyour humble friends\u003cbr\u003eTaylor, Sarah \u0026amp; those darn EGRESS kids.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
