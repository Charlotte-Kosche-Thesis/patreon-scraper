It takes persistence, time, practice, rejection, and more time to get each piece I write out into the world as a published work. Whether that is an essay in a literary journal or a self-published zine, the same materials are needed to make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI support a family of four with the income from my \"day job\", which leaves very little in the way of funds to pursue opportunities in writing. When I write something new, I want the work to find a home someplace where people will read it and react to it. Submitting to literary journals or for fellowships/grants or for writing prizes requires not only time for writing but also money for submission fees.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy eleven-year-old zine \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://pioneerspress.com/products/quitter-10\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eQuitter\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/em\u003eis a literary work that I design, print, and package using a color laser jet printer (expensive toner), lots of staples, fancy paper (plenty of it), postage, and--again--time.

Older editions take an hour to make 30 copies. Writing a new essay for submission can take 40 or more hours from rough draft to final draft. With two little children at home, both receiving the attention that they deserve, finding time to do this work is challenging in itself. A conservative estimate of what it would take per month to have 80 hours of uninterrupted writing time is $1,200. That would cover some childcare as well as day-to-day items that my income struggles to cover like groceries or a trip out of town just to recharge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubmission costs: A well respected literary journal requires $2 to $5 per submission. This cost covers the processing of online submissions (mostly through Submittable.com). Some magazines require $0. Fellowships and grants require $15 to $40 per application. Literary prizes require $15 per submission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eColor laser-printer toner: The full compliment of four high volume color cartridges costs $100. This is enough to print several hundred zines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaper: One ream of 500 sheets of nice printer paper is around $15. The cover stocks I use are typically $10 for 50 sheets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePostage: I prefer to send out zines in bulk to one place. Mailing one zine costs $1.20 for First Class (the cheapest rate available for that size package).

His writing is a\n reminder that we are part of something bigger than what is inside us \neven when it doesn\u0027t feel that way. It\u0027s an understanding that despite \nall of that, our internal ecosystem doesn\u0027t stop moving and growing for \neven one second.

Like Scott McClanahan\u0027s \u003cem\u003eCrapalachia\u003c/em\u003e\n this is a story of American roots, of fallen family members, secrets, \nsickness, memory, a narrative that looks at the past from a struggling \n(but hopeful) present. Trace\u0027s writing is a quiet, contemplative thing \nin a world (and a scene) that for both good and ill gives us a lot of \nflash, sex, and noise. In a sense, Trace\u0027s work is a kind of throwback \nto a more restrained and gentle time. Which is not to say the ideas he \ntackles are either. His work can be (almost as a running theme) wholly \ndevastating. Like a spider he can kill you with a touch. Just the same, \nyou get the sense he doesn\u0027t want to. There isn\u0027t a note or strain of \ngratuitousness or sensationalism to his work. Everything in these pages \nis done with respect and class and is rendered with a deliberate, \ncareful touch. Ten issues in, he has built up a substantial body of \nwork. You should expect big things from Trace Ramsey.

That novel, \u003cem\u003eThe Ornithologists\u003c/em\u003e, has the basic pieces needed to make a decent work of fiction. The problem is that when you write that much in 30 days, the result is not that great. I have offered the rough draft--unedited, unfiltered--out to several friends to read over. I will extend that to my patrons, to take or leave, to offer feedback and see it through to a finished piece.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePraise for\u00a0my writing:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"The new issue of \u003cem\u003eQuitter \u003c/em\u003e[#9] is a quiet, deep-moving river of \npersonal history, ideas, and true things told in a way that feels right \nand grounded. Trace\u0027s best work yet shows him moving through \ntime--boyhood to youth, pre-memory to adulthood. We find ourselves in \nhorse pastures and wintery fields, anarchist farms and downtown \ncoffeehouses. Outstandingly well-written, all of it. As his work \ncontinues to get better each issue, we stand solid in our belief that \nTrace Ramsey is a major talent destined to write things that last.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Trace Ramsey\u2019s new zine series, \u003cem\u003eLasterday\u003c/em\u003e, is a graceful, deliberate, engaging piece\n of American storytelling. Over the course of these four minis, Trace \nwrites about cabin life and depressive episodes, the lying inherent in \nstories and lost things that are not truly lost. Beautifully written and\n presented (each zine folds out into a poster), these tiny documents are\n something you\u2019ll keep in your stacks forever.

A Pioneers Press favorite, we look forward to future \nwork from Ramsey, a great and powerful new voice in American writing. We\n can\u0027t vouch enough for this. Buy this zine. It\u0027s well worth your time. \nOne of the best zines of the year, hands down.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eQuitter\u003c/em\u003e #8 is a quiet, elegant look at passing storms and \ncoming sadness.

A zine about \ndepression and children and childhood and dreams, the eighth issue of \u003cem\u003eQuitter \u003c/em\u003e(though brief) is one of the most substantial pieces of literary work in the Pioneers Press catalog.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNEWS:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI received the 2016 \u003ca href=\"http://www.nclr.ecu.edu/news/2016-Albright-CNF-Prize-Winner.html\"\u003eAlex Albright Creative Nonfiction Prize\u003c/a\u003e from the \u003cem\u003eNorth Carolina\nLiterary Review\u003c/em\u003e.
