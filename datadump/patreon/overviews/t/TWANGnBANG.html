    "summary": "Interestingly enough, I was one of the first gun channels to start a Patreon campaign. \u00a0That was three years ago, and I learned a lot from that early effort, but in the end, it didn\u0027t seem to be a good fit for the gun community as a whole. \u00a0With much appreciation for those who were supporting me at the time, I deactivated the campaign to focus on delivering content to everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings have definitely changed dramatically for gun channels since then, and I am both honored and flattered to have viewers interested in supporting TWANGnBANG. \u00a0I will not be generating exclusive content this time around as I didn\u0027t really feel good about cutting dedicated fans off from content simply because they didn\u0027t contribute to Patreon. \u00a0Rewards will be limited to an exclusive TWANGnBANG morale patch, one that I\u0027ve never sold and only otherwise give to people who meet me in person. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m actually turned-off by basically selling lottery tickets as rewards like I\u0027m seeing in many campaigns, and I already answer every email and PM that viewers send me. So, I\u0027m at a loss for what I could offer Patrons without:\u003cbr\u003e1. Running afoul of the IRS and Patreon\u0027s TOS.\u003cbr\u003e2. Cutting dedicated viewers off from access because they can\u0027t contribute to my Patreon campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, know that your contributions will help keep the channel going as best as I can manage with the resources I have. \u00a0I have always been blown away by offers to help out, and I will continue to be grateful for the support of my viewers in whatever form they give it."
