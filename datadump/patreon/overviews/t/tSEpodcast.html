    "summary": "We\u0027ve created a weekly podcast,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ascienceenthusiast.com/category/podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Science Enthusiast Podcast\u003c/a\u003e! Our show consists of myself and Natalie discussing current events as they pertain to skepticism and atheism. Additionally, we have a weekly guest to discuss topics ranging from pseudoscience in cancer, why people believe conspiracy theories, how to engage in positive science communication, and how to get more involved with the atheist movement. (And we talk about meme pages. Because this is the internet.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, our guests have included pediatricians, psychologists, and dentists, who have all written for sites such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eScience-Based Medicine\u003c/a\u003e, as well as guests such as Eli Bosnick, David Silverman, Kevin Folta, Cara Santa Maria, and Lawrence Krauss.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also are working on growing our website to include multiple writers and to have content created on a more consistent basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, we have multiple different projects running on Facebook. We have our discussion/social group,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/groups/ascienceenthusiast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Science Enthusiasts\u003c/a\u003e, which as of this writing has well over 30,000 members. The main page,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/ascienceenthusiast\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eA Science Enthusiast\u003c/a\u003e, has over 800,000 followers as well. In addition, we have some \"fun\" pages where we have significantly fewer skepticism-related posts, but still inject some from time to time: \u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/inspirationaltardigrade\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInspirational Tardigrade\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/webelieveinnihilism\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWe Believe in Nihilism\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/skepticalkitten\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSkeptical Kitten\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/spacekitties\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCats in Space Quoting Scientists\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/apseudoscienceenthusiast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA Pseudoscience Enthusiast\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll these things take time. A LOT of time! The podcast and website also cost money: New/better equipment, hiring writers/editors/etc. Additionally, these things take a lot of time to create/produce, which is time we could be spending doing things that would actually make us money.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027re able, we definitely appreciate any contribution you can make. Even if it\u0027s just $1 an episode, we would be extremely grateful. We post weekly, on Wednesdays, and you can also set a monthly limit on how much you spend.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe completely understand that not everyone can offer financial support, and that\u0027s okay! If that\u0027s the case, we hope you continue to enjoy the content, tell your friends about our pages/website/podcast, and tell them about this Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support. This has been a lot of fun for us and we are excited to see where it\u0027s going to go from here!"
