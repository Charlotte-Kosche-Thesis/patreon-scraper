    "summary": "The Dog in the Clouds is the blog that exists only to serve a once-terrified and wounded Golden retriever named Roo, and you, the readers we\u0027re so grateful for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who don\u0027t Roo, a short book about her,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Rescue-Progress-Brian-Beker/dp/0615782507/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1481046863\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=notes+from+a+dog+rescue\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eNotes from a Dog Rescue in Progress\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, tells her rescue story. The account of her journey, which began as a sick, rescued foster puppy,\u00a0was a Number 1 Amazon best seller and in the top-ten of all the dog categories for three years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe little Kahoo\u00a0was deeply traumatized and lived in an unrelenting state of terror. All she knew how to do was to hide behind a toilet with her eyes pressed shut (I know\u0026#8212;dogs can\u0027t press their eyes shut. That\u0027s what her vet said, too. Until she saw her.).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon after adopting her, Roo and I began traveling the United States. You might hthink that a terrorized dog wouldn\u0027t do too well on the road, but she loves it. For the last year, we\u0027ve been to 44 states,\u00a0towing a tiny camper on backroads. The downside is that this has changed into being on the run. But more about that in the Patreon-sponsored posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoo is much better. She\u0027s a happy dog now, but her journey continues, and it will for the rest of her life. I\u0027d like to keep providing readers not just with her story, but also with a better look at the real nature of our travels. Patreon might make it possible to keep up with her story on our award-winning blog. Our award-winning blog has been down lately because with all the work of camping every night and trying to sell stories, the blog became impracticable without a way to pay. So, we\u0027ll be experimenting with the Patreon platform to see if that works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way it\u0027ll work is by subscribing, you\u0027ll receive a link to a members-only section of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thedogintheclouds.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Dog in the Clouds\u003c/a\u003e. By writing for an audience who is more interested than the casual drive-by web surfer, I\u0027ll feel more free to let a little more of our story be known. The way it was on the blog, I was pretty much only posting the happy pictures of Roo frolicking in rivers and streams and mountains and deserts all across America.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s much more of a story there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a Patreon of The Dog in the Clouds and not only will we strive to entertain, you\u0027ll get to know that you\u0027re responsible for The Second Greatest Dog Walk in History\u0026#8482; and the ongoing happiness of one of the world\u0027s truly brave dogs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUPDATE ADDED 12/9/2016: Please be aware that the way Patreon works (I think) is that they\u0027re going to hit your card for a charge every time I make a post. I didn\u0027t realize that at first, and there were higher pledge amounts available. I took those down, because on a per-post basis, that might have meant that someone was making our trailer payments without intending to. So, please be aware that a buck pledged will be a buck per post\u0026#8212;already pretty pricey, I know....\u003cbr\u003e"
