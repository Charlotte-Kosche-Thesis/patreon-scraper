You have been warned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to this patreon I have managed to move out of my abusive household with someone who I am safe with, and is making sure I\u0027m not being stalked by my abusers. So please do not worry about that stuff anymore. The page may be undergoing some mild reconstruction in the meantime given I am currently settling into our new apartment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot thank those who have contributed enough. If you wish to withdraw donations, go ahead and do so. But I will still be accepting them to aid with my new lifestyle where I am actually capable of going out on my own, getting the physical and mental health care I have been in desperate need of, and of course, capable of producing artwork on a more regular basis for all those who enjoy the odd flavor of content I produce!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***DISCLAIMERS***\u003cbr\u003eContributing patrons will only receive their monthly free art, IF they contact me via note on FA at some point during the month with what they would like! I am not a mind reader, so If you want your art for contributing -LET ME KNOW!!-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is NOT my primary income. It is there for those who want to support my work, or have a secondary option for monthly commissions. The majority of my living expenses are paid via my artwork commissions. Patreon funds will be used for things that will benefit my artwork such as software, hardware repairs, utilities (such as internet access, or even electricity), etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon Art is Intended to be Single character, with a super-simplistic background at most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon Art is strictly SFW until I can get a place with some privacy. Fetish work is OK\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon Art can include the characters of your friends and loved ones if you intend to \u0027gift\u0027 it to them, in place of your own characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Pay What You Want\u0027 Commissions are 5$ minimum at any tier.\u003cbr\u003e"
