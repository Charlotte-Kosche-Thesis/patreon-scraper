I\u0027m not just the glitz and glamour, I am the grit and brains behind the shows too!\u003cbr\u003eI am a makeup artist, hair stylist and costume designer; endlessly hunting down gigs on music video sets and photo shoots.

Additionally, it helps to cover the cost of travel expenses and costumes. Or, you can consider it to be your tuition payment for my little online art school.\u003cbr\u003eYour financial pledge will allow me to start doing what I love full-time so that I can push myself every day to become a greater artist.

WEIRD SHIT happens in strip clubs...weird and wonderful! \u003cbr\u003eAfter the successful self-publication of Volume One, which sold about 200 copies, I completed and self-published Volume Two, which is now available in my Etsy shop.

While I\u0027ve had some success in my own city, I haven\u0027t had the means to travel much. I\u0027d like to perform on faraway stages. I\u0027ve come to realize that burlesque and it\u0027s festival culture are a way for me to see the world. I\u0027ve done very little travel in my life due to lack of funds, I\u0027ve always lived hand to mouth.

In 2017 I was able to visit Seattle and Texas to perform.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to apply to a list of festivals across the nation in 2018, but I need the funds! I\u0027m able to stay with other performers when I travel, which saves on cost, but airfare is expensive! $400 per month would be incredibly helpful.\u003cbr\u003e",
