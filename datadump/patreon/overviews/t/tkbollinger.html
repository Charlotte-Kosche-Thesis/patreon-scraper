    "summary": "Music is the thing that speaks loudest in my head and my heart. It is a rare moment that I don\u0027t have a song playing in my internal jukebox. Music not only inspires me, but keeps me sane. It is also the best way I know to meet and connect with people all over the world and from different walks of life. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe music I make and wish to share with you is something that grows from shared intimacy. One of the most powerful things I have found on the internet is the way that it allows us to be honest, open and unafraid to bare our souls to each other, even though we have never met. Being able to foster this connection and trust and create something meaningful from it with you is what I am building in my art practice and reporting on here on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI find solace in songs and music because they help me to make sense of a world that at times seems uncaring, brutal or unforgiving. Music is something that points to what lies beyond and beneath the sea of tears that we all cry in our lives. Learning to swim in this together, elevated by song, has always given me joy and hope. If there is a meaning for sadness, and I think there is, music will help us to find it. I adore uncovering these kinds of insights and here on Patreon I will share them, and the work I create from those insights, with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is not only a way for me to find support for my art, but a way to grow community. No one is an island. We all need others to bounce our ideas off, if only to check that we aren\u0027t going crazy. Collaboration can take inspiration to intriguing new places, and interesting new forms.The connection I make with you, I hope, will result in a collaborative inspiration, for both of us. What ever your means of expression, or even if you do not consider yourself creative, I want to find the common ground between us and nurture and grow that inspiration into new songs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have always been drawn to music in a minor key. The songs that sing loudest, and most truthful, to me are sad songs. I do not find such songs depressing, but strangely elating, similar to the relief that comes from well cried tears. I have been an independent artist writing and releasing music for over 20 years. This journey reached a new height when I explored the beauty of the nadir in my bummer opus Shy Ghosts. The songs that emerged during the writing of this album was a collection of tales\nof lost and little mourned ghosts \u2013 slow, delicately arranged songs that spoke\nof sorrow and loss, dementia and decay, fog and fear. \nSince then I have released another album, What\u0027s Left Now You Are Dead To Me, and have another album in the works.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe stories I most want to explore are those that speak of things that are otherwise ignored or may be considered unworthy of attention. To me these voices, that we so often push to the side, tell tales that are often profound and quietly beautiful. I want to share these creative journeys with you in my regular updates. I hope to show you the ways I come to know the songs that I write, and have learned to listen to the sounds that surround me every day, and that inspire me to make beautiful and truthful art. By supporting me I hope that I can truthfully and honestly tell the stories that resonate in me, and also in you. I hope my work excites, enlightens and inspires you to walk forward in life with a spirit of joy, acceptance and hope.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Long-time sad sack and\nveteran tiller of doom, t.k. bollinger has been writing and recording songs since\nthe grunge plague of 1991. His music has developed over the years to become a\nsweetly tortured fusion of Doom Blues, Gothic Country and post apocalyptic\nGregorian Chant. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHe cut his teeth,\nmainly as a back seat driver, playing drums in the Melbourne alt-Rock 3 piece \u003cem\u003eRifled Slug\u003c/em\u003e and later for the much-ignored\nacid-folk combo, \u003cem\u003eThe Stinking Badger of\nJava\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDefecting briefly to\nelectronica at the end of the millennium, but later saw the error of his ways\nwhile driving through the deserts of Australia in 2004. Collecting songs and\nimpressions on his way to the top-end caused him to strip back his material and\nto begin playing an idiosyncratic style of country blues. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNot content to leave\nthings there, and to cries of Judas, he went electric again in 2011, jamming\nwith \u003cem\u003eVis Ortis\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eR.S. Amor\u003c/em\u003e, two long time friends and\ncollaborators. The ensuing musical apoplexy coalesced into \u003cem\u003et.k. bollinger and that sinking feeling\u003c/em\u003e. They released the album, \u003cstrong\u003eA Catalogue of Woe\u003c/strong\u003e, in August 2014. Upon\nit\u2019s release, the rest of his band was so appalled that they moved to Tasmania\nand now seek to redeem themselves \u2013 crafting the log awaited sequel \u003cstrong\u003eDoom Blues\u003c/strong\u003e, to be released in 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the meantime Bollinger\ntook it upon himself to hand tool his bummer opus, \u003cstrong\u003eShy Ghosts\u003c/strong\u003e. Released in January 2016, it was a collection of tales\nof lost and little mourned ghosts \u2013 slow, delicately arranged songs that spoke\nof sorrow and loss, dementia and decay, fog and fear. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2017 proves to be an\nexciting year for bollinger and his musical fanatics. A new album, \u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Left Now You Are Dead to Me\u003c/strong\u003e has\nbeen completed and set for release in October 2017. Still in bollinger\u2019s\nconfessional style it promises to be a lusher and, possibly, more hopeful\ncollection of songs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo find out more visit\nhttp://tkbollinger.com/",
