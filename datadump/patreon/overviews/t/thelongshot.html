So we did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you listen to the show, thank you so much, we couldn\u0027t have made it this far without you. You\u0027ve been with us through all the whirlwinds, guests, and hosts, and you get it, you know, that\u0027s why you keep listening. Seriously, we have the best fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027ve never heard our show before, here\u0027s a little rundown. Charlie Chaplin once said, \"Life is a tragedy when seen in close up, but a comedy in \u003cem\u003elong shot\u003c/em\u003e.\" And that couldn\u0027t describe our lives more accurately.\u00a0Together, we discuss our struggles through the general terrors of everyday life.\u00a0And In spite of our sometimes \"tragic\" circumstances, we\u0027re usually able to mine every ounce of humor, even when it hurts... it\u0027s a comedy podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if you enjoy the podcast, we hope you\u0027ll contribute. We love making The Long Shot and we hope you find enough value in it to support our efforts. We\u0027ve tried to put together some fun things for those of you that do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks,\u003cbr\u003e\nSean, Jamie, Amber, and Joe\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.thelongshotpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Unknown.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
