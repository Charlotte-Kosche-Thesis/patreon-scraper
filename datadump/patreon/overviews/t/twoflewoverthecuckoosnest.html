     "description": "Being a guest on a radio show can definitely create feelings of nervousness---even for myself as the host sometimes!! One of the things I have found to happen in the studio is that individuals will not be able to let down their guard at first and as the interview gets underway, they start to become more relaxed and comfortable in the setting. And then after the show is over, we usually have some good laughs and some incredible conversations! The \u0027winding down\u0027 time is so enjoyable for myself and for my guest/s and it is during that time that their personalities start to shine. \u003cbr\u003eIf you become a patron of The Stigma of Mental Illness Radio, you will have access to these fun, often very funny, and insightful \u0027after the show\u0027 sessions! This will give you the opportunity to get to know the guests---as well as yours truly---on a different and most times hilarious level. \u003cbr\u003eThank you again for your support---and hope you enjoy the bonus of the \u0027after the show\u0027 sessions!\u003cbr\u003e",
