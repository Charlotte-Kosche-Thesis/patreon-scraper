    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e \"Art (art, writing, music, sculpture or any other form) is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words or images, to achieve changes in consciousness .... An artist or a writer is the closest thing in the contemporary world that you are likely to see to a shaman\"\u003c/em\u003e   Alan Moore on magic\u003cbr\u003e\"Art is the Door Though Which the Mysteries of Consciousness can be Approached\" Chance Gardner\u003cbr\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eHello to you lovely people reading :) And thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHalf French half British and London born in 1973, my curious childhood, not without its challenges, was spent between France, the cultural bustle of Hampstead, London and the natural calm of the rural British Shires.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy introduction to Buddhism came early in life when Tibetan Geshes escaping their home, moved in to the London family home during the early 1980\u0027s, where we become the Manjushri meditation center for a while. Between the playful yet wise Tibetans as well as the array of wonderful western minds that stepped through the door, seeds were planted (or rekindled) that would germinate over the following years. By 1996 I started life as a full time parent and the seeds were nourished in all sorts of new and unexpected ways as our family grew.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy 2009 I was working as a professional artist having relocated to France and was the same year I became a qualified practitioner in an art based depth psychology healing tool. This deepened my cognitive understanding of the power of imagery and colour on the emotional body, the psyche and resulting manifestation. This fueled my already deep fascination with alchemy, quantum mechanics and the nature of reality, myth, natural medicines, neuroplasticity and magical symbols.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo having studied the effects imagery has on the biology of the brain and ensuing emotional being, I see art as playing a vital part in our own personal alchemical journey. Art, as Alan Moore has said, is a shamanic took for healing and transformation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if art is the manifestation of ether into physical reality, we can even call it a bit magical. So, as much of my work is archetypal and figurative in nature, I could even say that art is an act of Theurgy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough meditating on archetypes, we can better understand ourselves. Personal alchemy is not always an easy undertaking, but the rewards are worth every step. The psychological and subsequent emotional affects imagery has on us can not be underestimated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn recent years, my focus, though not exclusively, has been on breathing new life into the traditional feminine Yidams of Buddhism. As a result, I\u0027m honored to be part of a few creative collectives which I will list below. I am also a muser and writer of headier subjects and a regular columnist for a Buddhist magazine based in Hong Kong, bridging an important gap amidst the turmoil since the 1050\u0027s.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am essentially a Visionary artist I have been creating iconographic art for well over a decade, but painting since forever. And whilst I can jump from substrate to substrate and medium to medium, I love to paint on diaphanous ahimsa silks that are wrapped over gilded canvases with 24ct gold details. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy reasons for loving gold and silk is wrapped up in my understanding of Alchemy and the significance of the materials used when using art for something more profound than filling a wall. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAs one of the strongest, most enduring and versatile natural protein fibers known to man - from underwear to parachutes, kimonos to wall decoration, the oldest evidence of silk being used by humans seems to actually dates back to 1300 where it was used in weaponry! Silk is tough, durable yet refined and delicate, with that added bonus of its extraordinary versatility. \u003cbr\u003eArt ties us together as a species, ever since the dawn of humanity. There is also an ancient Oriental proverb that states that we are connected by an invisible and unbreakable thread with the people we are destined to meet (I love this idea) and Silk is one of, if not the strongest and most extraordinary protein fibers found in the natural world. It is organically produced to protect the caterpillar whilst it undergoes its unrecognizable\u00a0transformation and evolution into its flying ascended form. \u003cbr\u003eAlchemy in action.\u003cbr\u003eAs within so without.\u003cbr\u003ePerfect for Alchemical Art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day, I\u0027d like to be setting up a gallery space, where I can also show case/work with other artists, whose work echos the integrity of times gone by and memories of things yet to happen. Sound and vision of the ancients, the theurgists and the phantasmagoria of the dream makers. A space that honors the shaman, the pagan, the heathen, the alchemist, the witch and goddess. How much will this goal be? Where will the space be? these are sill unknowns.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBuying original art can be out of the budget of many people. Through Patreon and regular pledging however, I am able to offer you unique silk and gold collectibles starting from as little as $25!\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can grow my body of work and repay you all with more.   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind me in the creative collectives of \u003ca href=\"http://dakiniasart.org/artists/ti-campbell-allen/\"\u003eDakini as Art\u003c/a\u003e and Santa Barbara based \u003ca href=\"http://www.sheislove.com/tillys-artwork\"\u003eSheisLove\u003c/a\u003e. writings in Hong Kong based\u003ca href=\"https://www.buddhistdoor.net/features/silk-alchemy\"\u003e Buddhistdoor Global\u003c/a\u003e and Danish \u003ca href=\"http://levekunst.com/?s=campbell+allen\"\u003eLevekunst\u003c/a\u003e (\"Live art\") and artwork with Hong Kong based \u003ca href=\"http://www.studiosteppe.com/silk-alchemy/\"\u003eStudiosteppe\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e"
