I am your host, Robin Warder, and each week, our podcast releases a new episode in which I cover an unsolved cold case and provide analysis and theories about what might have happened.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs wonderful as releasing a weekly podcast might be, it can also be a costly and time-consuming process. However, by pledging as little as $1 per month, you can help us with such expenses as production costs, web hosting, research, and promotion of the show. Better yet, it also affords us the opportunity to create more content for you. In exchange for your support, you will have the opportunity to earn some fun perks and rewards from us, which may include access to exclusive bonus content. In fact, we will offer a couple of unique rewards that I can guarantee you will not find on any other podcast. You read the full details about what we\u2019re offering to your right.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for support and we are very thrilled that the trail has no longer gone cold on our Patreon feed."
