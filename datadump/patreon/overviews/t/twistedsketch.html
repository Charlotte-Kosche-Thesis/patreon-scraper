Or Kira, if you know me personally. I love to create and draw multicolored horses and a wide variety of characters. I enjoy entertaining people with my stories and comics that I\u0027ve written and co-written with friends and, as most of you know, I\u0027ve been making one of my collaborative scripts into a comic known as Wings, Horns, and Chaos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://67.media.tumblr.com/3b82c1f29730f91d8945e96b9bb89a3a/tumblr_odoyrywZkK1ue4k2so3_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started out with Twisted Ribbon as a ponysona a few years back and she\u0027s grown into so much more since. Along with a few other characters on my Sleepy Sketch blog, (which, unfortunately, is currently on hiatus till I have a bit more free time) I\u0027ve been developing them as personalities for some time and just enjoying the ride since!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNow I\u0027m sure you\u0027re asking yourself. Why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell.. Like most artists, I\u0027d love to become self-sufficient doing something I love but, of course, that road is paved pretty rough. When work is slow or some extra expenses come up, Patreon is a great way to help out at the beginning/end of the month while also supporting my passion and allowing me to give back to those who donate. Each goal reached is one step closer to being able to support myself solely on my art and it also frees up more time for me to work on Wings, Horns, and Chaos and any other stories (Like Sleepy Sketch\u0027s) more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://67.media.tumblr.com/abefb06f7bb2e1e4cdf4d338fb807f51/tumblr_odoyrywZkK1ue4k2so5_r1_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the very bottom of my heart, I wanna thank you for supporting my work. It is very appreciated and gives my life as a creator and artist meaning knowing you want to help me and my art grow. It means so much to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
