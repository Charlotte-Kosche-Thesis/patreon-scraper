I live and breathe stories; I always have. More than anything, I want the opportunity--and the means--to keep creating stories. I\u0027m a novelist, a storyteller, an aspiring playwright. I\u0027m an actor, a mentor, a story \u003cem\u003eenthusiast.\u003c/em\u003e Show me a medium, and I probably want to try my hand at it someday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny pledge, no matter how small, helps. (I feel like there should be some sad-eyed puppies and plaintive Sarah McLachlan happening here. Sorry.) It buys me time I can spend writing, a roof under which I can write, and cat food so the adorable little jerk doesn\u0027t distract me with his wailing. Other goals I\u0027d like to work toward include developing both online and in-person writing workshops, and finally organizing that writer\u0027s retreat in Iceland I\u0027ve been planning for years!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you. Even if you can\u0027t pledge right now, thank you for being here, and thank you for taking the time to read my words and offer me emotional support. You\u0027re great. I\u0027ll name a character after you someday. (And not a villain.) ((Unless that\u0027s your thing.)) (((No judgment.)))\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, because I believe strongly in paying it forward, ten percent of what I earn here will go toward supporting other writers, artists, and creators, either here, or through sites like Kickstarter or Indiegogo.\u003cbr\u003e"
