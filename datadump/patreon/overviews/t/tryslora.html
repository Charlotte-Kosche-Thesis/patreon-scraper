    "summary": "Hey there, everyone!\u00a0I\u2019m Tris Lawrence, and I write!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been writing since I was little\u2014my very first story was written in (I think it was) second grade, based on a magazine picture I was shown, where I wrote a paragraph about how a little boy was sad because his parents were getting a divorce. My first angsty storyline! I went on to struggle with words to the point where my sixth grade teacher once said I would never be a writer. HAH, I\u2019ve shown her\u2014ah, the power and inspiration of needing to prove oneself, right? And how did I do that? I never stopped writing. I wrote in notebooks throughout middle school. I learned how to type on a manual typewriter, then deciphered how to use a word processor on a TRS-80 (go on, laugh, it was the 80s). I wrote my first romance \u201cnovel\u201d when I was in high school. I sent out short stories and got my first rejection letters when I was fifteen. And when I was a senior in high school, I \u201csold\u201d my first work, by publishing a thirty episode serial that I printed and delivered weekly to all subscribers (I think I charged 25 cents per week). I still have a hard copy of that; I might be convinced to share it if y\u2019all really persuade me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWriting is as necessary as breathing for me. It\u2019s something I do out of love, and it\u2019s something I do to stay sane. There are people in my head, and I want to share their stories.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy current project is an online web serial,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://welcometophu.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWelcome to PHU\u003c/a\u003e, which launched on September 4th, 2016, and updates twice weekly (Sunday and Wednesday). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWelcome to PHU\u003c/em\u003e is a web serial about the students who attend Pine Hills University, a fictional liberal arts school, and the folks around them. It\u2019s about magic, and love, and football, and music, and taekwondo, and just about anything else that college students might get involved in. And magic. Did we mention the magic? Because in this world, ten years ago, the public found out that magic is real, and ever since then, more and more Talents have become public in the world, and Pine Hills University happens to be one of the schools that welcomes these magical students with open arms.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy preferred genre is best described as either urban fantasy or perhaps magical realism. I love writing about the world we live in and incorporating fantastical elements. I try to include a diverse cast, and many of my characters are LGBTQ+. Prior to PHU, I\u2019ve had short stories for adults published as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Deb-Atwood/e/B008F8XX44/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeb Atwood\u003c/a\u003e, and also a YA novel and a YA short story published under the name\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/D.E.-Atwood/e/B008VE7YHE/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eD.E. Atwood\u003c/a\u003e. I\u2019m also a fan, and yes, I write fan fiction, which can be found on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/users/tryslora\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArchive Of Our Own\u003c/a\u003e. I babble about my writing process on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tryslora.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e as well as fangirling (I am unapologetically part of fandom). I blurt randomly on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/tryslora\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e. I\u2019ve been online a long, long time (hey, I remember bitnet).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs my children have grown (my daughter\u2019s in her first year of college now), I\u2019ve watched our expenses grow as well. I started looking into the possibility of getting a second job, and I realized that hey, wait a minute, I already have a second job: I write! I spend a lot of hours per week on this job; I just don\u2019t get paid for it. And that is where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI write because I love it. I write because I have stories to share, people I\u2019d like to introduce you to. I write because I can\u2019t \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e write.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWelcome to PHU\u003c/em\u003e and my fic will always be available freely on their respective websites. If you\u2019ve made it this far and you have nothing to give, I understand. But if you are able to help me out, to contribute so that I can focus more on words and less on finances, then you are a wonderful, wonderful person. Take a look at the different Patreon levels, and know that whatever you are able to give in order to help me make words, I am thankful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

I will critique 1,000 words of fiction for you (you can save up multiple months of support in order to ask me to critique something longer). Be careful what you wish for! I\u2019m a brutal beta, but I am also honestly committed to making sure you learn and grow.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnd of course, don\u2019t forget the prompting and polls, ebooks, stream, acknowledgment page, and my undying love (please remember the love when you read the red pen comments applied to your work).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
