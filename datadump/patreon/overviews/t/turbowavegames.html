My name is Kye Beaudoin, sometimes known as Starturbo. I\u0027m currently a college student, who makes indie games on the side. I\u0027m also the leader of a game development group known as Turbowave Games, which currently consists of me, some artists, and a composer. Currently, we are entirely volunteer based, which means, no one is paid. We are all fine with this, though I would like to start paying the team at some point in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/mNPnLo/Roblet_Land_5_24_2018_7_12_21_PM.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAbout the Game:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://image.ibb.co/jtCNfn/l3qNUSj.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eArt by DemXUltra\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first project is Roblet Land, a 2D indie game with pixel art, which takes inspiration primarily from the Chao Gardens of the \u003cem\u003eSonic Adventure\u003c/em\u003e games. However, you may notice similarities to the \u003cem\u003eMario \u0026amp; Luigi\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0series, the original \u003cem\u003ePetz\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0games for PC, or \u003cem\u003eTamagotchi\u003c/em\u003e. We plan to release Roblet Land for Windows, and hopefully\u00a0Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS, with console ports also being a possibility.\u00a0The goal is to include a lot of content for the game, but also ensure everything added is of great quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Game\u0027s Plot\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e (subject to change):\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/ntG6D8/Roblet_Land_5_27_2018_9_05_40_AM.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eAcross multiple dimensions, portals have been discovered, which all lead to a mysterious land unlike no other. No humans or animals live there. On planet Automatopia, the company Electriware, famous for their household robotic pets known as Roblets, decides to build a petting zoo in the mysterious dimension. Naturally, they name it Roblet Land. The company holds a robot building contest, stating that the 4 winners can access the park early, for the price of having to help prepare it for opening. Technic, Rop, Rachael, and Chromer are declared the winners of this contest. They then travel to Roblet Land to help prepare for the park\u2019s launch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy Patreon?:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/eYMnmT/Roblet_Land_5_27_2018_9_12_49_AM.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is being made in GameMaker: Studio, and I hope to port it to other platforms. Doing this for certain platforms will cost money, and due to GMS1 being phased out, I can no longer guarantee the game can work on all platforms without being ported to GMS2. Worth noting that I\u0027ve already tested Roblet Land in GMS2 when it was free for a limited time, and it worked perfectly. In addition, I\u0027d like to pay everyone involved and form a LLC sometime before release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eRewards:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach reward will contain all previous rewards.
