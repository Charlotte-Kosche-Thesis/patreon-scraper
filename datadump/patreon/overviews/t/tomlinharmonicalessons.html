    "summary": "Hello, my name is Tomlin and I make free harmonica lesson videos which I upload once a week to YouTube. I don\u0027t just do video lessons; I also teach privately at my studio in Edinburgh, Scotland and all over the world through Skype. I feel that some of the aspects of a face-to-face lesson are missing from the video lessons so...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a new vision that bridges the gap between online teaching videos and the experience of having real one-to-one lessons. My dream is to create a unique online Harmonica School, where learners can actually meet and talk with their teachers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as a library of pre-recorded lesson videos which I already have and will continue to expand I will be implementing the following features;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMonthly practice challenges specific to the level that you are to guide your growth as a musician\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emonthly Q\u0026amp;A sessions where I will answer questions that you have sent in to me\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003elibrary of harmonica tabs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003elibrary of backing tracks\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eonline forum where you can discuss anything harmonica related with your fellow students and me!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I have two main aims with this campaign which are to improve the quality of my current lesson output as well as create all the elements of the full \u201conline harmonica school\" which is why I need your help both financially and creatively\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, you will get access to extra stuff which you can see in the bonus section. Furthermore, you will be able to have a hand in guiding the creation of the school either through the Activity feed or during monthly hang outs :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the financial goals below and what each one will enable me to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are not interested in the online school but you want to help support the ongoing creation of my harmonica videos you can still chuck a small tip in the tip jar...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, thanks for getting this far, you are awesome and I really appreciate you reading the pitch.
