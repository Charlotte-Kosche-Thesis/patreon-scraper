     "description": "\u00a0\n\u003cp\u003eThe rank of midshipman originated during the Tudor and Stuart eras, and originally referred to a post for an experienced seaman promoted from the ordinary deck hands, who worked in between the main and mizzen masts and had more responsibility than an ordinary seaman, but was not a military officer or an officer in training. The first published use of the term midshipman was in 1662. The word derives from an area aboard a ship, amidships, but it refers either to the location where midshipmen worked on the ship, or the location where midshipmen were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the 18th century, four types of midshipman existed: midshipman (original rating), midshipman extraordinary, midshipman (apprentice officer), and midshipman ordinary. Some midshipmen were older men, and while most were officer candidates who failed to pass the lieutenant examination or were passed over for promotion, some members of the original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission. By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.\u003c/p\u003e",

The primary function of an officer with this rank was to take command of a small naval vessel (a sloop) which did not qualify for any of the six rates and therefore did not merit a post-captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rank developed in the late seventeenth century and derives from the fact that, originally, such an officer was required to function as his own master as well as exercising overall command. However, by the late eighteenth century all but the smallest sloops (those with ten or twelve guns and a total crew of 45) carried a warranted master as well as the commander. In recognition of this, the words \u0027Master and\u0027 were officially deleted from the designation of the rank in 1794, although undoubtedly many officers already in the service (such as Jack Aubrey) would have continued to use the old familiar form of words for many years afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not uncommon for a lieutenant who had distinguished himself in action (perhaps by leading a boarding party or commanding a cutting out operation) to be promoted to commander shortly afterwards. This was very far from guaranteeing he would have a ship to command, since the number of commanders was often three or more times as great as the number of suitable vessels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat confusingly, a commander who held a current commission - in other words, who was actually in charge of a vessel - was addressed and referred to as \u0027Captain [surname]\u0027 despite the fact that he was not strictly a [post] captain.\u003c/p\u003e",

An exception to this rule was that a very junior post-captain could be posted to command an admiral\u0027s flagship, which was almost always a large ship of the line. The admiral would usually do this to keep his most junior captain under close observation and subject to his direct supervision. Captains commanding an admiral\u0027s flagship were called \"Flag Captains\". One example of this is the appointment of Alexander Hood to the command of HMS Barfluer, flagship of his brother, Admiral Sir Samuel Hood.\u00a0",
