He is a healer made of stardust, and the most powerful being in the Universe (which, in fact, is quite highly populated!) He has the ability to heal any disease, any affliction other than death itself, and has been healing since the beginning of the Universe. But this power comes at a price. Try as he might, he cannot remember when or why he started healing, because of the gravity of Singularity 47, a small but powerful black hole in his chest. A chance meeting with an angel made of indigo light sets him on a path to discovering the truth about this black hole, his power and his existence...as well as that of the entire Universe.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is The Interstellar Healer?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePart Graphic Novel, part Rock Opera the Interstellar Healer is a comic book with singing and a musical soundtrack.
