I am a 24 year old, queer woman and Artist of African descent. I was brought up experiencing various types of oppression and found my purpose through creative expression. Showing my artwork and inspiring other underserved youth at a nonprofit known as A Reason To Survive (A.R.T.S.) was an integral part in my growth as a young artist. Currently, I am in the process of building a creative brand and a \u00a0series of works exploring identity and the empowerment of marginalized peoples. In order to dedicate the time and energy required to utilize art as activism, I seek your support, advice and or mentorship.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was accepted and will be awarded scholarship funds to attend PNCA this Fall, 2017 as a 1st generation college student. Having your support along the way and throughout the process will enable a more graceful transition. Art as a means to explore status, class, gender, race and politics in a society that undervalues people with my lived experiences. Funds raised will go towards: art materials and books, a camera to document work, a laptop to upkeep my website, upkeeping my website domain name, business cards, prints and transporting artworks to schools, galleries, homes and venues. My vision is to give back to my community of family, friends, teachers, mentors, organizations and supporters through paintings, poetry performances, motivational speeches and more! My goal is to transcend and expand further into self-actualization.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art explores spirituality, identity and social justice as a whole. It also presents systemic issues associated with such topics and provokes meaningful conversations, actions and outcomes. For more information, please visit: TazhaWilliamsArt.weebly.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny donation from $25/month+ goes a long way and you may use this platform or contact me directly.

I create to explore identity, healing and transformation. In my work, a new narrative is told for the empowerment of folks with marginalized identities who are under-represented in the art world, the media and society. I explore various mediums including, but not limited to acrylic and oil paint, watercolors,\u00a0pen and ink, collage and wood-burning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe process of art-making is nonlinear. Creation stems from my lived experience as a queer person of African descent. In my studio, I aim to reconnect with ancestors who\u2019s stories have been erased via enslavement. Painting portraits of people of color, self-portraits and abstract work is an attempt to reclaim those narratives. Artists such as Wangechi Mutu, Jean Michel-Basquiat and Tamara Madden largely influence my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlways seeking to transform pain into positivity, my work is shared from a cultural perspective, fostering community and self-love.",
