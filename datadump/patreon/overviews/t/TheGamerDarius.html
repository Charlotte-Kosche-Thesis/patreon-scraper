If you become a loyal patron, I will be able to make better, high quality videos, replace components of computers and games that I use exclusively for recording and playing for Youtube and maybe make a living off of doing something I have so much fun doing. And who knows, if this all goes well, then I\u0027ll be able to make special content for my patrons.\u003cbr\u003eSo to sum up, yeah, I would still be doing Let\u0027s Plays even if Patreon wasn\u0027t a thing. But if I can make enough, then I can do it better!\u003cbr\u003eSo, hopefully, I\u0027ll see you guys on my channel!\u003cbr\u003eTake care!\u003cbr\u003eCheers!"

If you\u0027re familiar with my Youtube Channel, you\u0027ll be familiar with what I do and don\u0027t need to listen to this schpeal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf this is your first time, well hi! I\u0027m TheGamerDarius, but you can just call me Darius. I\u0027m a Let\u0027s Player on Youtube and cover (What I believe to be) a variety of games on my channel, from older, retro games to not all that new games that I can pick up for a fair price! I kid though, I play what I have access to and have a load of fun playing for the internets. I would be doing Let\u0027s Plays weather I got paid to or not. BUT if I can make enough through Patreon, then it makes it easier to replace broken components, get games more people want to see being played and even get myself out there even more! So if you like what you see on my channel, become a Patron! Who knows, maybe when all is said and done I may be able to do some special things for my fans and new friends!\u003cbr\u003e",
