    "summary": "Hello Video Store people! Do you miss 80\u0027s Video Stores as much as we do? Do you love Horror films, Trashy flicks, Sleazy movies, VHS, and 80\u0027s movies? How about joining our Trashy Team?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Trash Video Podcast is a bi-weekly show set in an old-fashioned \"mom and pop\" Video Store located in the fictional Sleazoid City. Hosts Seth and Roxy love to review obscure Horror Movies! Every episode is crammed full of fast-paced editing, sound effects, silly Skits, VHS collecting, Music, and more. TVP has more madness, mayhem, and murder than you can handle! \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started podcasting TVP in 2014 and have tried to make it a bit different than other horror movie review podcasts. Sure we do horror movie reviews, but we do a lot of other things as well. We write and perform \"skits\" that have a storyline throughout the year, and have made many other parody skits based on film trailers, commercials, and so on. We use sound effects and bed music to create a complete atmosphere in the podcast. Each episode is comfortable, weird, and fun. There has even been more than one murder in our podcast world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTVP is a hobby for us. But it is a ton of work. We spend many hours every week in promotion, editing, writing skits, reviews, etc. Since we both work full time jobs, the podcast is literally our second job. We intend to keep the show FREE.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet we love our show. We pour our heart and soul into it.\u00a0 \u003cem\u003ePlease Note:\u003c/em\u003e We feel very awkward about creating this page. We have been encouraged by some listeners to try it out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also love our listeners! So we\u0027d like to take it to the next level. We want to grow TVP, and get more interactive with our listeners.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur intention is also to provide Bonus material that will be exclusive to Patreon.\u00a0 We feel that Patreon is a new part in our journey with Podcasting and thank you greatly for taking the time to read this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eSeth and Roxy"
