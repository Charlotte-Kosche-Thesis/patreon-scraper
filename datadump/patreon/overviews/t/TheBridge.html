    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHow can we make personal development and coaching affordable?\u003c/strong\u003e This question triggered the start of - as we believe - an epic concept: The Bridge. Meaning. Belonging. Purpose. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your pledge, we can make that happen, so thank you in advance for your interest and support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is our aim to allow people to join an intensive coaching program without paying hundreds and thousands of $$$ each month - we aim for a voluntary payment between fully sponsored, $17 (students), $37 (lower income), $57 (standard), and higher supportive payments. To create a sustainable platform, we need to reach within two steps $5000 / mo and $10 000 / mo. The more support we can pledge here, the more fully sponsored or lower paying students can be accepted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is The Bridge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLess than a month ago, I posted a question into a\n Facebook group: \"What do you want? Really, really, really want?\" Within a few \nhours about 200 people commented, and as I replied to each comment, I \nreceived lots of friend requests. The post was closed after less than 24\n hours as it seemed to have dominated the 200 000 member strong group \u003cimg height=\"16\" src=\"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v8/f4c/1/16/1f642.png\" width=\"16\"\u003e:)\n It tells me however about the need to skip from small talk to deep \ntalk, asking deep questions for personal reflection. I feel like quite \nsome time that we should shift from passive quote consumption to active \nreflection.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Together with my nephew Henri, living in Prague, we are about to launch \"The Bridge. Meaning. Belonging. Purpose\" - an affordable coaching membership group for true and real \nengagement.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e The membership we \nare creating is a space of pure authenticity, compassion and \nunderstanding where relating and belonging will be experienced. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as we intend to create a space of pure authenticity, we decided to go a very unusual way in these days: \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo marketing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo ads\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo copywriting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNot even an editor!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWe only want to attract with our authentic content and teaching. My nephew Henri (22) and myself (52) are very different in our approach, but follow a mutual aim: supporting people to explore their authentic self, and to live a truly exciting life. Therefore I decided to reduce my executive coaching clients to a very low number, and give my time and everything I have learned in my coaching journey to The Bridge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Bridge is a co-creative mastermind group ideal for people in search of the next level of meaning, belonging and purpose in their life. The Bridge creates the opportunity for everyone to share oneself in the truest expression, to drop the facade and be totally authentic with what is currently real. As members will do this they will feel the compassion and support from us and other fellow co-creators and realize the beauty of allowing oneself to be truly authentic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe intend to run a small group, supporting a few people on their journey.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of investing tens of thousands of dollars in expensive marketers and copy writers, aiming to influence or manipulate people to do what they might not be ready for, we want to keep things simple. Either someone truly resonate with what we are offering, or not. We are not interested in creating a group of 100 000\u2019s of followers. We are interested in supporting and guiding consciously the lives of a few inspired individuals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe \nassist in\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e connecting to the true self on a deeper level,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003efinding ways to break away from pain, past and trauma, from limiting \nbeliefs that creates a life unconsciously in a non-desirable fashion,\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eembracing life challenges with grace and gratitude,\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003efinding joy in the here and now instead of hoping for happiness to come in the future,\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eliving life consciously!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e With your support, we can help the one person in need of what we can add to his / her life. And often, one person is all that matters - on the helping as well as the receiving side. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e With love, Henri and Jay\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: I hope that this is allowed: Here you will find some more info and also videos we just posted for the launch: http://thebridge.masterstories.com/Offer/TB005\u003cbr\u003e"
