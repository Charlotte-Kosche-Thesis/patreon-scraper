I\u0027ve read tons of comics in my life, from x-men when I was 12 to batman and wonder woman a few years later, that\u0027s why a big part of my cosplay creations are comic characters, and you know guys, being a superhero is every kid\u0027s dream. My cosplay name comes from the Devil May Cry character Trish, the first time I tried using this name for an on-line game was already (obviously) in use so I just added -neen, so yeah, the story of my nickname it\u0027s not really amazing XD\n\u003cbr\u003eI love cats (I\u0027m a cat nyaaa~~~~~) comics, anime, cute things, all of the nerd stuff and I\u0027m a megasuperultra\u00a0 Dr.Who and Harry potter fan!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 220, 219);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u2229(\ufe36\u25bd\ufe36)\u2229\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eAnd no Behemonth, Jedis are the best, I will never be part of the dark side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy profile on:\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/trishneen_cosplay/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/ih5Ycc\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/h3WjiH/Sin_t_tulo_1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 220, 219);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/ih5Ycc\"\u003e(\u30ce\u0ca0\u76ca\u0ca0)\u30ce\u5f61\u253b\u2501\u253b\u00a0 \u00a0 Behemoth\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m more of an anime nerd and gamer, I\u0027m also a fitness nerd and I like to weight lift, part of the reason i\u0027ve started making fitness a habit was because of my love to want to look like really cool anime and comic book characters, ranging from Batman to All might or Illidan Stormrage.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCosplay is a personal challenge to always try and improve my physical appearance.\u003cbr\u003e\nI started cosplaying in 2015 and my first convention was Anime Expo wearing Cid from FFVII because I thought I looked like the character. However, when I went to the convention, no one knew who I was and I felt I did a bad job at my cosplay even though it was my first one I created. I didn\u0027t even know what worbla, foam, barge or anything was! I didn\u0027t feel good about myself.\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter this I decided that I was not good enough to cosplay but then in 2016 I decided to be my favorite character of all times, Squall Lionheart from FFVIII and I had the best time of my life and I made new friends and found my place among the cosplay community, that turned out to be super supportive.\u003cbr\u003e\nI love dogs, I have a siberian Husky and she is the cutest thing ever (wan wan\u00a0\u263b\u1d25\u263b) I like to cook and I like when people love my food (I need to feed my girlfriend because she is a cat)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nMy cosplay name comes from the purple monster of Final Fantasy saga.\u003cbr\u003e\nI truly believe that Siths are better than Jedis.\u00a0\u00a0(\u25e3_\u25e2)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy profile on:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/behemothcosplay/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/m0SziH\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/hPP1xc/Sin_t_tulo_1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/m0SziH\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAnd the final question... Why are we now on Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eActually this is something that we\u0027ve been thinking for a while. We love this community called cosplay with our heart and soul, thanks to cosplay we made friends, we discovered a way to express ourselves and work hard and we found each other throught it, cosplay is something that makes us happy, we want to dedicate all our time to this but sadly we are both students right now and we live together paying bills, so our budget for cosplay is really tight.\u003cbr\u003eWe are not going to offer nudes, lewds (sorry, we are not into that) or spicy exclusive content but we have something that we can offer to this community, all of our knowledge and everything that we are learning with every cosplay.\u003cbr\u003eAlso, we see patreon as a good place to show all our cosplay content\u00a0 (\u3065\uff61\u25d5\u203f\u203f\u25d5\uff61)\u3065\u003cbr\u003eWe are going to post our sets for free, you don\u0027t need to pay to see our photos since we do cosplay because we love it! But if you want to support us as Patron, as a reward we will give you tutorials, tricks, information about how to find everything you need and more fun stuff!\u003cbr\u003eAnd one thing for sure, you will have all of our gratitude, either patrons and people who stop here to read or just to see our cosplays, we love you, this is important to us, and it\u0027s beautiful when someone understand that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of love from these two nerds.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
