    "summary": "In the immortal words of Bernard Black: Well, here I am. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just a bloke from Norway who finally, after years of casually playing with the idea and slowly building my world/setting, decided I was ready to actually begin putting words to the page on a proper storyline of a novel. The project is as of yet unnamed. Mostly due to me not wanting to define it by any name before it\u0027s finished. But rather hope that a fitting name for the first of what I hope will be at least a trilogy will come naturally once the story is actually told in its complete form. It is a somewhat unorthodox high fantasy setting, where I hope to challenge the \"tropes\" of the genre as much as possible. While also baking in aspects of fields such as ethical philosophy, sociology, social-psychology, anthropology, microbiology, physics and thermodynamics to create a world where as many things as possible actually have a proper, tangible and somewhat logical explanation. Which I\u0027ve always felt was lacking in general fantasy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight off the bat I\u0027ll just be blunt and say this is a long term project, along with several others. Including hopefully studying journalism part-time, having a fantastic son part-time AND a day-job. (Which I suppose the point of this would be to possibly slowly be able to scale back on and focus more on the actual writing and other more creative and rewarding stuff). Meaning any tangible rewards I may offer beyond little sneak-peeks and such will be quite far into the future. My goal is to finish the first novel within about two years. But if you\u0027re as patient as you are generous I am forever beyond grateful to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also dabble in humorist journalism. Though that\u0027s mostly in Norwegian. And me and a buddy who\u0027s a professional photographer are working on a couple of projects where we hope to bring back the good old Victorian spirit of exploration and adventure! Which I might be douchey enough to slap in a kickstarter link to at some point. :P If the expeditionary projects take more shape I will possibly include aspects of that in stuff like rewards and goals etc. Since, though the primary goal of this at present is to support, or at least supplement me writing my first novel, it is really about a larger scale plan to create lots of different creative content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
