    "summary": "First and foremost, thank you all very much for checking me out! A lot of people have been encouraging me to go public with my love of historical clothing and, for a long time, I have been reluctant. I do this, generally, for me and a few commissions here and there. It was one saying that kind of \"pushed me over the edge\" and that was, \"I wish I could learn to do this.\" When I asked, \"Why not try?\" I was told all the patterns out there were too complicated and they would never learn it as well as others. Well, let me tell you, that doesn\u0027t jive with me. I love sewing and I love what I do. That is why I am here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to teach others how to tailor historical clothing without over-complicated instructions, step by step \u0026amp; updated how-tos pulled from period manuals (when available) and help people learn how to make everything from William the Conquerer to Queen Victoria. Now, I will say, I primarily do mens wear and I will also use this platform to branch out to ladies wear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary expertise is 16th Century and some of the Victorian Era. If you choose to patron me, you will get tips and hints and instruction for sewing garments from history that are concise, easy to follow, and reliable. You will also have everything explained in a way that, no matter your skill set, you will be able to understand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be garments made that will be going up for sale on Etsy. A percentage of these sales will be donated to the Amputee Coalition (amputee-coalition.org)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, come join me, as we live in the past (and make it look good!)"
