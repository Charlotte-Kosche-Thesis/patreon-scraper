    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to Twist Hypnosis! I\u0027m Twist. I\u0027m a kink-positive, LGBTQ+-positive hypnotist with years of experience in the BDSM community who has been practicing hypnosis for around a decade now. Hypnosis is a fantastic way to explore fantasies or indulge in desires. In addition to practicing hypnosis, I have long enjoyed listening to hypnosis and brainwashing files. Something that I have always found missing in most of the erotic hypnosis world is BDSM, S/M, and D/s content. With Twist Hypnosis, I aim to fill that gap and provide BDSM hypnosis catering to many different fetishes, including masochism and sadism, humiliation, bondage, forced/coerced-bi and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge $10 or more to unlock the \"Supporter Files,\" a collection of files produced by Twist Hypnosis featuring a variety of interests, sent out after the 1st of each month! To celebrate the launch of my Patreon, I\u0027m also offering a special $5 script reward tier, where I\u0027ll record any script you send me up to 700 words! Lastly, if you\u0027d like me to create a custom file for you, you can pledge to the Custom File tier and I\u0027ll make any sort of file you request! As a bonus to all backers, for every $20 that you pledge each month to Twist Hypnosis, you can claim one Reward File on the 1st of each month! You get all the rewards that you pledged for, such as the month\u0027s Supporter Files and any custom requests, \u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003eget a Reward File! Reward Files are high-quality files that take extra time and effort to create that are typically only available as separate, paid files. Basically, it\u0027s a way to buy my pay files from my Patreon for \u003cem\u003eless \u003c/em\u003ethan you\u0027d pay usually, while getting all the same rewards you pledged for!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy many different kinks and fetishes, and you can expect files featuring many BDSM activities, including files drawing inspiration directly from real experiences I have had in the BDSM community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my other favorite fetishes is coerced bi / \"slutification\" / cock addiction / brainwashing on this theme. I\u0027ll be making plenty of scripts lending to this fetish and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, when I first started making hypnosis files one fetish I ended up dabbling in was tentacle sex. I\u0027m quite open to \"hentai\" fetishes, and you can expect some of that here as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy voice is a relatively androgynous male voice: soft but playful, and strong but supporting. Most of my files are also available in a female voiced version, created using professional voice modification software, if you prefer to be hypnotized by a feminine voice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for checking out my patreon! Stay twisted!\u003cbr\u003e"
