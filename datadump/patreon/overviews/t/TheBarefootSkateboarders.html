    "summary": "In 2015 Ulrike, a German native, founded the first skatepark in rural India in Janwaar, a small village in rural Madhya Pradesh; a village left behind like many of the 700.000 villages in India. What seemed like a small intervention back then has today turned into something much much more. Together with Mannan she is trying to uplift the village society as a whole. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMannan started working with her 10 months ago to observe the change in kids and help in the development of village culture in Janwaar.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe impact on the village\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJanwaar was drowning in caste discrimination, gender bias, bad sanitation, inefficient education system, drought and a lot more. Since Ulrike has built the skatepark a lot has changed. The kids no longer see caste, they play together, eat together and even sleep together. The village has drinking water all year round \u2013 thanks to a solar system which was set up. Have a look at The Barefoot Skateboarder\u0027s video (intro video) to see how simple rules have completely changed the dynamics of the village.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSkateboarding, a sport which has long been identified with urban neighborhoods across the world has triggered change in a rural village. It\u0027s gradually changing the social fabrics of the village and addressing some of its most deep rooted issues. Trust was built with the villagers through continuous interaction and by \u201cwalking our talk\u201d! Most of our activities are crowdfunded \u2013 and we are planning to keep it like this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJanwaar\u0027s kids are now among the best skateboarders in India. They never ever had a teacher \u2013 they all learnt by learning from each other. Self-organized.\u00a0 This video by Decathlon/olexo beautifully covers the first skateboarding challenge in Janwaar which attracted the attention of people from all over the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGs6KTOenK0?list=PL2h7VyDqgC_BCMk5LeM-s0hYmouBs6QpQ\" width=\"854\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAnd this is just the start, we will start an experiment of what we call a ...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e... Model School\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur model school has 5 pillars:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2013 \u003cstrong\u003ethe first pillar\u003c/strong\u003e is the government school with the traditional curriculum in the village itself. Through teacher training Prakriti, our learning partner, will improve the capabilities of the teachers and Prakriti will have in addition to the government school \u201clearning labs\u201d where the kids can come and get on a very individual basis coaching lessons which help them to find their own path in whatever they do \u2013 away from the traditional curriculum.\u003cbr\u003e\u2013 \u003cstrong\u003ethe second pillar\u003c/strong\u003e are the arts \u2013 here our partners Art Ichol and Kunderpura or the Jaipur Litfest come in \u2013 and again with the help of Prakriti we will design special learning labs according to where the single kid is heading to.\u003cbr\u003e\u2013 \u003cstrong\u003ethe third pillar\u003c/strong\u003e of the model school is sports \u2013 in our case skateboarding.\u003cbr\u003e\u2013 \u003cstrong\u003ethe fourth pillar\u003c/strong\u003e is our bamboo house where the kids can come and build stuff. It\u2019s on its way to become a maker space where the kids can build what ever they want to.\u003cbr\u003e\u2013 And \u003cstrong\u003ethe fifth pillar\u003c/strong\u003e is a kisan school where the kids learn self sufficient farming following the ideas and concepts developed and practiced by Prem Singh. Farming is a fundamental income source in the rural areas and most of the children work in the farms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are building three more skateparks in three more villages. Our goal is to bring at least one kid from the rural areas to the Olympic Games in Tokyo 2020.\u00a0 In addition to skateboarding, each location has a unique experience \u2014 arts, tribal music, sustainable agricultural practices and this is where the model school becomes in \u2014 so each Olympic Center will at least contribute one pillar to the model school.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApart from working on the model school, we also work on several short term projects \u2014 building an open library, giving micro-loans for home stays, running a campaign \"A farmer adopts a city family\", a musical idea and more. You can read more about them on our \u003ca href=\"http://www.janwaar-castle.org/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis has become a full-time job for me and Mannan.\u00a0We do this as volunteers with no guaranteed income.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat became obvious for us over the last months is:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) We are here to stay. \u003c/strong\u003eWith new projects unveiling over time, every step is strengthening the village. The kids have taken the ownership of the park. They are trying to close the gap between what was earlier, and what they now learn at the skatepark. The parents are following their lead. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) For the community, supported by the community. \u003c/strong\u003eAll our projects are crowdfunded. What remains are the costs to sustain. The income source for these costs should be 100% transparent. And there is no better way of doing this than doing it with Patreon \u2013 this is what many people have told us. So here we are :-)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is a person can donate whatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. So anything, from $1/month up, is hugely helpful to the cause. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u0027ll Use the Money For\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is $2,000/month. That money will be enough to keep us going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe need a place to stay close to Janwaar. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe need \u003cstrong\u003eto eat and wear things, make phone calls and access internet\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd we need to \u003cstrong\u003etravel\u003c/strong\u003e to engage our stakeholders and grow our network.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
