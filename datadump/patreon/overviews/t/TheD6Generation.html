We can increase how interactive the show is, get more feedback from you, and be sure we\u0027re talking about the things you want to hear about and less about the things you don\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short: It is our hope that Patreon will allow us to reduce, perhaps even someday eliminate, our dependence on advertisers while giving us the opportunity to spend more time on the show and better engage with you, our listeners. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, thanks for listening!
