    "summary": "I launched the TiLT Parenting Podcast in April 2016 as a way to provide useful, inspirational, and truly life-changing content for parents raising what I refer to as \"differently-wired\" kids.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMillions of children today move through the world differently than their peers. They might be a highly-sensitive kid and experience input more intensely. Or maybe they have ADHD and battle to stay focused. Maybe they\u0026#8217;re highly gifted and find school boring or have trouble connecting with other kids. Maybe they have Asperger\u0026#8217;s or dyslexia or anxiety or another learning difference (or all of the above) and struggle with situations their \u0026#8220;typical\u0026#8221; peers would sail through.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAt TiLT, we believe that being differently-wired isn\u0026#8217;t a deficit \u0026#8212;it\u0026#8217;s a \u003cem\u003edifference\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e We want to help parents raising unique kids do it from a place of choice, confidence, and peace so these awesome children can \u003cem\u003ethrive\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027ve had the privilege of spending the past fifteen-plus years creating motivational and empowering content in the form of books, going back to my production roots and launching the TiLT Parenting Podcast has been perhaps the most fulfilling venture I\u0027ve embarked on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach Tuesday, I share a thoughtful interview with a\u00a0parenting expert, parent or life coach, educator, therapist, author, or parent in the thick of it, all aimed at inspiring, informing, and supporting parents raising differently-wired kids. Every third or fourth episode is a \"special kid\u0027s POV\" episode, which features a short conversation with my 12-year-old son Asher (Asperger\u0027s, ADHD, gifted), who offers his honest perspective on issues many families are facing. We\u0027ve been fortunate enough to be featured on iTunes top twenty in New and Noteworthy for Kids and Family since our launch!\u00a0"
