I\u0027m also a public speaker, having given\u003ca href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u00a0dozens of presentations\u003c/a\u003e around the world for the last 20 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have debt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to generous gifts by many, many people over the years, the debt is a lot less than it could be, but it still floats in the background - some tax payments, bills, and cases where I\u0027ve borrowed money to finish projects or get something done. This is definitely my fault - like a lot of people of my ilk, I foolishly considered myself too smart to get ensnared by basic finances, but I definitely made mistakes and I\u0027m working to get things settled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, I\u0027m cutting back on luxuries and recurring costs, including paying for going to conferences. This is a good decision, but it does cut out something a lot of people like - my speeches and stories and my attending those events. I can\u0027t do much about my attendance, but I figured I could combine the speeches with paying down debt with something simple: a podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast is called \u003cstrong\u003eJason Scott Talks His Way Out of It\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and will be a weekly recording of stories and essays about subjects I care about, recorded in the style of my presentations, and meant to fill in the gap for people who like to hear my talks, while also getting away from this remnant debt.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast will be recorded simply - just me talking, with minimal editing. Besides owing debt, I also owe people a pair of completed documentaries and I have a lot of work I do for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://archive.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInternet Archive\u003c/a\u003e, basically 24/7. This is all about being realistic, and adding a highly-produced weekly product to my workload is realistically a terrible idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money from this patreon will go into a savings account set aside for debt and bill payment. It\u0027s not a funding for my projects or for spending sprees; it will make numbers on papers go to zero.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a huge experiment for me, but I am willing to take on the challenge, and I hope what comes out from this will provide entertaining and educating for all involved.\u003cbr\u003e"
