The Flying Cloud\u0027s mission is to be an advocate of and for aviation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Flying Cloud will be a hub for aviation news and information that people, both inside and outside the field of aviation, will find of value. The mobile-first website design is just the first of many steps in the works, to improve access to aviation news and information.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you are an aviation journalist writing about the next innovation in aviation, someone who is writing or creating aviation videos, or a museum writing or publishing a video about an aviation artifact.... The Flying Cloud will be 100% focused on what you are saying and doing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Flying Cloud is unique because there is no requirement to publish on the website. In fact, bloggers, journalists, video creators etc. would continue publishing as usual with no disruption in ad revenue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSocial media will become one way to find aviation articles and videos to share on the website. One method that is being explored is through the use of hashtags on Twitter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to The Flying Cloud website, social media will be a major focus. Social media is one of the best ways to introduce people to aviation. In time, The Flying Cloud will take a proactive approach to growing the aviation community through the use of social media. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an internet-based platform that allows content creators to build their own subscription content service. It is popular among YouTube content creators, webcomic artists, writers, podcasters, musicians, and other categories of creators who post regularly online. It allows artists to receive funding directly from their fans, or patrons, on a monthly recurring basis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, The Flying Cloud will support the aviation community. In return, you\u0027ll be given the opportunity to provide feedback and offer suggestions on how to improve the user experience.\u003cbr\u003e"
