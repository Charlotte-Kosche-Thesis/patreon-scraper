Starting off as three you-tube skeptics making group rebuttals to creationist claims, then into a bi-weekly live web show which became weekly interviewing scientists, philosophers, activists and many other people of interest. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce a live web stream, the show has now been rebooted into a pre-recorded panel discussion format with new team members. We discuss skeptical topics and review films of dubious scientific credibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are an amateur production but with your patronage we can help improve our audio quality and cover the costs for doing the show. We are grateful for anything you can pledge to the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur main goal is that we can raise enough per show to hire a professional editor to free up the spare time of the team members.\u003cbr\u003e"
