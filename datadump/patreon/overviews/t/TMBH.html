    "summary": "My name\u0027s Matt Whitman and I like talking about the Bible and Christianity in a way that\u0027s useful, sane, and hopefully funny. I\u0027d planned to be a Major League Baseball player and President but I accidentally ended up being a pastor instead. I studied fancy history, theology, and philosophy stuff so I could impress people at parties by telling them I\u0027m a college professor, but I kept bumbling my way back into church, which does not impress people at parties. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bottom line is that even though I\u0027ve tugged at the leash of this thing, I really care about the Bible, the Church, and the God I believe is behind them. I also love trying to talk about it in a way that makes sense to normal people who use normal words and ask normal questions and laugh at normal funny things. Talking about God and the Bible on the Internet often gets weird, confusing, and crappy, but I\u0027m hoping we can do it differently, and be one part of something bigger and good. That\u0027s why I make the Ten Minute Bible Hour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make more and better stuff. I\u0027ve got a bajillion ideas for one-off videos and great big ambitious series, but this stuff takes a ton of time to put together and it requires help. That\u0027s where you come in. If you dig what I\u0027m doing, and you\u0027re able to kick in, I\u0027d welcome your help at any level. Even if contributing\u0027s not in the cards for you, I\u0027m still wildly grateful for you caring about some of the same stuff I care about, and for your investment in that in your own way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGracias,\u003cbr\u003eMatt W."
