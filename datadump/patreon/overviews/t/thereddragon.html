My channel has not been the exception and has also been heavily impacted by these problems. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePractically every video I upload recently has been demonetized.\u00a0 It has led to fewer and fewer videos because there are no benefits to putting in the time to create recently.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created a Patreon page months ago, but refused to publish it because it\u0027s honestly the last thing I wanted to do.\u00a0 I don\u0027t feel it should be up to the subs to have to donate to keep my channel going, and I was hoping Youtube would straighten things out and fix the situation without me having to resort to this.\u00a0 But here we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is merely an option for those that have the means and the desire to support this channel.\u00a0 Every amount is appreciated and will help me continue to do what I love and create videos \u0026amp; upload regularly to the channel.\u00a0 No matter how big or small the donation - Thank You.\u00a0 If you don\u0027t have any money you can donate - I still Thank you for being a follower and you can support me in other ways like checking out the links in my description box.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003eThe Red DRagon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
