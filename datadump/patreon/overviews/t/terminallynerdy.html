    "summary": "Hello everyone.  Thanks for visiting my little Patreon here and being a fan of my work.  Hopefully I continue to amuse you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Clay, and I am Terminally Nerdy.  It\u2019s a chronic condition, no hope for a cure.  What do I do about this horrible condition you may ask?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I write about Tabletop Gaming, RPGs, as well as create Youtube videos.\u00a0 Reviews, articles, the works!\u00a0 Generally focused on Tabletop RPGs (Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons and such) and RPG Video games!\u00a0 You can find me at \u003ca href=\"http://www.terminallynerdy.com\"\u003ewww.terminallynerdy.com\u003c/a\u003e in fact!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhats the point of this Patreon you might be asking yourself?  Why are you here?  How did you end up at this point in your life?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can only really answer the question about the Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this Patreon mainly as a way to help fund my work.  Time is money, as they say, and frankly I don\u0027t have a lot of spare cash. New products to review are not cheap by any means, and while I can on occasion get freebies from creators, often I will have to purchase my own products and games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNevermind PC Upgrades, equipment upgrades, and web hosting.  I figured I might as well offer an option for those of you who wish to support me directly and help fund the site, while also providing what few extras I can offer.  I am a simple man after all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything I raise from Patreon will be put right back into my creations for the most part.  I intend to be very transparent with what I do here.  Here is a list of the things the money may be used for:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eNew stuff to Review! (Tabletop Products, Video Games, ect)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy Web Hosting (Roughly $100 a year with the domain name)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideo Equipment Upgrades (Portable Camera, Better Camera, Tripod, ect)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePossible Video Game Consoles / PC Upgrades to keep up with RPGs and expand my ability to review games.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePossible Cons / Events (to do v-logs / articles about, but I need better portable camera equipment first!  This would be expensive cause we got tickets + hotel + airfare!  Never mind that I would have to take my wife with me)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSupport RPG focused Kickstarters and other Patreon Pages. \u00a0This way I can help the community AND get things to review.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePersonal Expenses. \u00a0As of January 2018 my work moved me to a new location that now involves a 1 hour 15 minute commute one way, and increased my insurance costs.\u00a0 This has caused me a bit of strain so at times I may need to use funds here to help stay afloat in meatspace.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAs far as rewards go, given what content I create, there is not much I can offer.\u00a0 This entire page has been created so folks who want to help me can do so.\u00a0 There is a single reward tier, and you can pledge as little or as much as you like.\u00a0 Everyone is equal to me no matter what.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE REWARDS:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to the Terminally Nerdy Discord Server VIP Room (Directly connect with me!)\u00a0 The server is public but there is a special patron room.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to Patron Only Events.\u00a0 These could be Hangouts on Voice Chat using Discord, Game Streams, and even Tabletop RPG Ones Shots!\u00a0 These are random but I am trying to get better at doing them.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePatreon Only Updates on my life and work!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCopies of any Tabletop Content I create for free!\u00a0 If I make something for sale, you get a copy.\u00a0 As well as copies of any Tabletop Content I work on for others OR contests I judge.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInput on Future Reviews / Topics \u0026amp; Release Order when I finally run out of things to work on.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEarly Access to Posts/Videos/Reviews.\u00a0 The instant I am done with something you all get access to it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA Twitter Shoutout every so often using the #FF hashtag as well as the #KnightsofNerdy tag.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePut on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://terminallynerdy.com/friends-of-the-nerd\"\u003eFriends of the Nerd\u003c/a\u003e list on my website!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDiscounts and Other Cool Things!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a note, Patrons do get a specific role in my Discord based on their pledges.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e$1 to $4 you are a Bugbear\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$5 to $9 you are a Minotaur\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$10 to $19 you are a Young Gold Dragon\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e$20+ you are an Ancient Lich\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you mean \"Discounts and Cool Stuff\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand that\u0027s a really vague sort of thing to offer.
