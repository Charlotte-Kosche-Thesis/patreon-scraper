    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Tyrannitor, and welcome to my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a huge fan of the written word, and have been ever since I read my first Enid Blyton at the age of 4. I\u0027ve been gorging books ever since. My favourite genre is fantasy, and my goal is to read all the amazing works of fantasy fiction in the world, while my dream is to write my own series of fantasy novels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of writing, you\u0027re most likely here because you\u0027ve read my ongoing novel length fanfiction called \u0027Pain, Hunger and Betrayal.\u0027 It\u0027s an idea that got stuck in my head one arbitrary day, and before I knew it, it grew teeth and tentacles and all the adorably gruesome parts that make up a story. Which is why, after writing nothing for almost 5 years, I decided to give it a shot and see if I really was as terrible at writing as I thought I was.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not one of those people who say, \u0027pay me or I else I will hold this story hostage\u0027. It\u0027s a fanfiction, therefore it needs to be enjoyed by other fans of the same franchise, that\u0027s the only way that the fanfiction experience is worth it, in my opinion. I am, however, a review glutton, and I \u003cem\u003ethrive \u003c/em\u003eon feedback, whether it\u0027s positive or helpfully negative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor my patrons, I intend on giving loads of sneak peeks for upcoming chapters and arcs, and chapters will be available to you 3 weeks before they go up on the fanfiction.net. So you will be able to comment on and discuss changes/improvements way before anyone else does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really want to be able to write for a living, so any help you guys can give me will be greatly appreciated. Life in an urban town is expensive, and every little bit helps. I\u0027m very grateful for any and all support you may choose to offer, so thank you in advance to you generous souls!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarm Regards,\u003cbr\u003eTyrannitor\u003cbr\u003e"
