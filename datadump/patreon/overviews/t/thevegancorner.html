We focus on helping people with their daily cooking while also trying to share plant-based recipes that are easily enjoyed by foodies of all sorts.\u003cbr\u003eThe entirety of our project is currently relying on YouTube and its rules. However, for us YouTube has always been nothing more than a medium to share our work, and since this platform has proven to be rather unpredictable at times, we are working toward becoming completely YouTube independent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2835/33973705430_0f48ce08bc_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will always be passionate about cooking and happy to share recipes with you, and that is why we want to sustain the existence of this project without having to rely on a specific sharing platform. By creating a community here on Patreon, we will be able to keep sharing our work and love for food regardless of the existence of YouTube and its ad revenue programme. Also, at the moment YouTube completely lacks ways to interact directly with the subscribers without having to go through a video, which is a missing feature that is crucial for all the people like us who use their skills to create content that is exclusively intended for other people to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4191/33515987334_41380cae7a_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith a small contribution, you have the power and opportunity to fuel something real, and to make this project sustainable and independent from any specific social media, while at the same time getting some really interesting perks in return. With appropriate monthly funding we would be able to offer a lot more, like giving you the possibility to decide the recipes to develop and share, answering your food-related questions, and even offering some sort of cooking podcast or masterclass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2836/33515987424_53033c6e20_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHere on Patreon there is literally no limit to the things we could decide and do together in regard to this project, and by pledging a contribution to our work, you will allow us to keep creating effective and entertaining productions, and to work towards making recipe videos full-time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2818/34358111915_3d9e8f74b9_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
