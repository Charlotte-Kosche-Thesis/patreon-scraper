My name is Thomas Castle and I need \u003cem\u003eyour\u003c/em\u003e help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m 22 years old and I\u0027ve been writing and working on various stories and ideas for over a decade. Most of that is not public, as it was either for hobby purposes or just not very good. I\u0027d like to change that with the \u003cem\u003eSorrows Of Blackwood\u003c/em\u003e franchise, starting with \u003cem\u003eSolemn Graces\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout My Stories\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current focus is \u003cem\u003eSolemn Graces\u003c/em\u003e, a long-term serial drama that serves as the backbone of a larger franchise. Taking inspiration mostly from supernatural and Gothic horror stories, \u003cem\u003eSolemn Graces\u003c/em\u003e stars a witch by the name of Grace Morgan, who discovers the dark and foreboding town of Grimstead hiding away in Blackwood Forest. This terrifying town is a world where nightmares and superstitions are real and where supernatural mysteries pop up on a daily basis. Grace takes it upon herself to investigate them - with a little help from her partner, a local gravedigger known as Gallo Belgrave.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs stated, \u003cem\u003eSolemn Graces\u003c/em\u003e is intended to be the first story in \u003cem\u003eSorrows Of Blackwood\u003c/em\u003e, a franchise of ensemble character dramas set in a secluded valley called Inglenook. More series will come if \u003cem\u003eSolemn Graces\u003c/em\u003e proves successful, and several of them are already planned out. While each one will have its own tone and setting within the Inglenook, all of them will be largely character-driven and explore themes including sexuality, disability, the effects of abuse, and the meaning of family and familial relationships.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach series in the franchise is formatted like a television series - grouped into \"seasons\" of 10 stories each, which will usually be 3 to 5 chapters long. It should provide a good and easily digestible length, both from a reading and writing perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, \u003cem\u003eSolemn Graces\u003c/em\u003e is my focus because it\u0027s where the whole story starts and I just don\u0027t have the time to focus my writing on anything else right now. However, once it gets rolling and proves successful, I can start thinking about lending focus on the other series as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find out more about \u003cem\u003eSolemn Graces\u003c/em\u003e, as well as \u003cem\u003eSorrows Of Blackwood\u003c/em\u003e, on the \u003ca href=\"http://sorrowsofblackwood.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eofficial Tumblr page\u003c/a\u003e! If you\u0027d like to chat directly with me or other fans, why not join \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/Pfhk3GQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe Discord server\u003c/a\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere You Come In\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do I need Patreon for? Basically, so I can focus on writing and publishing these stories and turn it into my full-time job. Pledging to \u003cem\u003eSolemn Graces\u003c/em\u003e means that:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ll be able to afford fancy cover art to publish each completed serial with.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ll be able to produce useful marketing materials such as brochures and flyers and those pesky Twitter ads.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ll be able to survive and stuff and still have time to produce entertainment for all of you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIsn\u0027t that exciting? But, you may be asking, what do you get out of it all? Well, keep reading! Under the current system, you\u0027ll be pledging per chapter of each individual \u003cem\u003eSolemn Graces\u003c/em\u003e story as I release them serially to you, as well as any other little short I come up with - which means that, not only will each chapter help finance a completed, all-in-one publication at the end of the story, but I\u0027ll also be able to get live in-progress feedback from potential fans! That in turn will help me make this story into the masterpiece I\u0027ve always dreamed it to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Note: Depending on how many patrons I get, I might change this system up a bit in the future. For now, though, it\u0027s what works out the best for me.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach and every patron will receive a coupon code so you don\u0027t have to make another purchase just to get your own copy of the completed release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at the other links to find a pledging level that works for you!\u003cbr\u003e"
