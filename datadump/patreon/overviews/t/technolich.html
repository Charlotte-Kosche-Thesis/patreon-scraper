    "summary": "Greetings. \u00a0My name is Steven Dunne. \u00a0Thank you for taking the time to check out my page and thank you in advance for considering becoming a Patron of my work. \u00a0First and foremost, I consider myself a storyteller. \u00a0The job of the storyteller to challenge society and engage the audience (even if it as small as one) to provide a shared experience. \u00a0I create art in two mediums:\u00a0 I am an illustrator and a painter.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy interest in Illustration is primarily comic and fan art driven.\u00a0 I prefer to work in physical media such as graphite and ink, but would be interested in spreading into digital work at a point down the road. The things that capture my attention are primarily American Horror comics, Japanese Manga, Video Games, and Film.\u00a0 Basically, I am a massive proto-geek and find myself spending a large amount of time drawing pictures of the stuff that I love.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I paint under the name of Dr Nyx. \u00a0My visual work is principally dark and evocative of uncomfortable emotion, but I feel that to be the primary purpose of art. \u00a0It is through these explorations into the meaner aspects of the human psyche that we come to terms with parts of ourselves that are at once cripplingly beautiful and terrifying beatific. \u00a0The painted work that I do is meant as a guided journey on this path of self exploration. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me in this endeavor, you will provide me with resources such as art supplies (paint, canvas, pens, pencils, boards), time, and human souls. \u00a0Well, maybe not time as we all know that is a mental construct but the human souls are very real. \u00a0Come with me on this adventure. \u00a0Be part of something that changes the landscape of the artistic community, even in some small way. \u00a0Help eliminate gravity so these black, leathery wings can glide us into the horizon. \u00a0All contributions are appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
