Boots and Hatchet, teens at the local high school, are the only ones who seem to notice. Armed with little more than curiosity and friendship, the two set their amateur sleuthing skills to resolving the mystery of THE HOUSE THAT VANISHED. Soon they\u2019ll discover the HOUSE is just the beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS THOM UP TO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE HOUSE THAT VANISHED is a longtime passion project. I love telling stories. That\u2019s what drove me to pursue illustration as a career. I\u2019ve managed to collect two degrees in studio art focused on telling stories with visuals. And, while I have pursued a more traditional illustration career, working with clients on projects from a variety of markets -- magazines, newspapers, apparel, music, marketing and so much more -- I\u2019ve always wanted to tell my stories and share them with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE HOUSE THAT VANISHED is just the first installment of what I hope becomes a series of \u003cem\u003eillustrated novellas\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stories of THE HOUSE THAT VANISHED started off as a series of strange dreams that occurred shortly after moving in with my longtime girlfriend. Bizarre cross country roadtrips and haunted houses that all seemed to revolve around this hiding and enduring secret society pushing the world toward some disastrous end. I\u2019ve decided to rest the weight of these strange happenings on the shoulders of Boots and Hatchet, a couple of young friends plagued by curiosity and a penchant for adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u2019ll join Boots and Hatchet -- and me! -- as we explore these stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW YOU CAN HELP!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I mentioned, THE HOUSE THAT VANISHED is a passion project. I\u2019m doing this on my own -- no clients and currently no publishers helping me out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis first illustrated novella is roughly 250 pages long with roughly 120 unique illustrations. This is going to take some time and dedication. This is where my patrons really matter.

Zuz is an amazing artist (she designs cloths for a major fashion brand). We have two dogs, Pilot, the Boston Terrier, and Jozefine, some weird hound dog lightning bolt remix. We garden a lot. We\u0027re both vegetarians and love animals a lot. I like riding and racing bicycles. I\u0027m trying my darnedest to rehab one old motorcycle and one old car (1971 Honda CB450, 1965 Volvo 122). I have a BFA and an MFA, both in applied arts. In addition to my freelance work, I also adjunct at the local art \u0026amp; design college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI grew up in a small village near Dayton OH\u003c/strong\u003e, where I imagine most of my influences began. I love small town culture and how it skews big town understanding. I love nihilism and exploring it along with themes of perseverance \u00a0and hope and darkness and humor and horribleness in my artwork. I grew up on weird young adult fiction, Saturday morning cartoons and an aunt who didn\u0027t think R ratings should be an obstacle between a young boy and horror movies. I went on actual adventures with my best friends, exploring the forested bits and country roadways around our small village.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI love telling stories and sharing my artwork and collaborating with other creative people.\u003c/strong\u003e Follow me, here, on Patreon, and on twitter and instagram (@thomglick) to witness my current adventure as it unfolds.
