In only 5 short months we now have 6 paid contributors across four different countries.

We started with one goal: create amazing content that we think people will want to read, whether that\u0027s help and how to\u0027s or recommending the apps and accessories we love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the very beginning we wanted The App Factor to serve two main purposes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo help readers discover amazing apps and relevant products, from a source they can \u003cem\u003etrust\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo help developers share their apps in more meaningful ways\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbove anything, we want our readers to \u003cem\u003etrust\u003c/em\u003e us. We will \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e accept paid app reviews, or market products we don\u0027t like just for advertising dollars. That\u0027s just not who we are, or who we want to be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMonetizing The App Factor is something Thierry and I take very seriously, and something we\u0027ve thought long and hard about. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you may have noticed that there are now a few ads in the header and side bars of the site. These are \u003cem\u003enative ads\u003c/em\u003e, made by the developers behind the apps we love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll also see ads for Amazon products mixed in. Any Amazon ads you see are \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e random. They are all hand-picked and created by the staff here at The App Factor. If you see an Amazon ad for a product, one of us on staff is using and loving that product. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goals and attitude towards the readability of the site have not changed.\u00a0Here are a few things we will never do on The App Factor:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou will \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0see an ad interrupt what you\u0027re reading\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou won\u0027t \u003cem\u003eever\u003c/em\u003e see an ad that isn\u0027t relevant to this site, that means no men\u0027s boxer short ads or banners for new cars\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we ultimately want to be able to sustain ourselves on nothing but our recommendations, based on the trust we build with our readers, we also want to give our readers a way to support us directly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love our content and want to see even more of it, becoming a patron of The App Factor can help us do the following things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLet our contributors write more content, more often\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelp us cover any site related expenses, such as hiring developers to make it better\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have lots in store for our readers in 2016, including high quality video content.
