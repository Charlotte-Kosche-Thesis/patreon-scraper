    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am The Bearded Bryan, and my art is changing the world....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy sole mission in life is to make this world better than it was when I arrived. I merely want to help every person possible, and we will not stop until I part ways with this life. To date, I have helped thousands of people in country\u0027s all around the world to\u00a0include; Nepal, Oman, Yemen, Libya, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, and Afghanistan. From building\u00a0villages to simply providing food and water, I have used my life\u00a0experiences in war to bring a little bit of light into peoples lives. And this is just the\u00a0beginning...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Bryan Myers, and I am\u00a0a 13-year veteran of the U.S. Army Special Forces. I have an unyielding passion for both adventure and philanthropy. While in the military, I deployed eight times to combat zones including three trips to Iraq and five times to my \u0027Second Home,\u0027 Afghanistan. These experiences have provided me a wealth of knowledge in leadership, human terrain, and negotiating incredible logistical and operational challenges. All of this has allowed me to follow my passions and to help in my favorite goal, \u201cto leave this world better than when I arrived.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get started,\u00a0I want to bring you all back to the beginning of my path towards philanthropy; especially since some of you have not been following my journey since day one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTowards the end of my last rotation in Afghanistan, I started doubting my purpose in life. Having been a career Special Forces soldier, I had spent the majority of my adult life in some of the worlds most war-torn areas in a direct combat role. Having lost countless teammates/friends/brothers and seeing no actual measurable success, the doubt started taking over my thoughts. With each loss or setback, the uncertainty would grow. I knew deep in my heart that our actions were merely a small piece of what was needed to make actual change in these regions. I mean, it has been 16 years of doing the same things over and over... Doing the same thing while always expecting a different outcome (And being upset when nothing changes). Oh, the insanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring this trip, I was working with a young Afghan man that I had met in 2004. I hired him back then to work with my team during that rotation. Over the those few months we became terrific friends through the many trials and tribulations, we faced on a day to day basis. We stayed in touch from then on. Over the years since that first trip, Hikmat (Hik) had become a very successful businessman. Although he had become very successful, he had never forgotten his roots. Hik would do whatever possible to help better the lives of his people. It was through Hik\u0027s actions that a seed that had been planted early on began to take root. Teaming up in Kandahar, we were able to drastically change the lives of many families in the harshest of districts in the Kandahar province. It was during this time that I realized that to make an actual change; you need a very complex and complicated mixture of both war and peace. A true balance between violence and benevolence.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I parted ways with my military career after 11 years two months.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I have helped refugee\u0027s fleeing the instability of a collapsing government in Yemen. I have built villages in Nepal following the massive earthquake in 2015. From Libya to Iraq, I have worked with and supported those fighting ISIS on the front lines. All of this and more is just the beginning. I plan to continue to travel the world in hopes of changing it... if even for only a brief moment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say all of that to say this... I am starting this page to focus on my passion for helping others. As you know, art comes in many forms. My art is helping others. With your support, I can focus solely on providing humanitarian aid around the world. What I offer in return is an inside look at the world I live in and what can be accomplished via some drive and support. Here are just a few of the projects for which I am working:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- The \u0027Bago\u0027:\u003c/strong\u003e A restoration project with a twist. I am restoring (with a few upgrades, wink wink) a 1972 Winnebago. Once restored, I will take off on an epic journey of Benevolence. Friends and volunteers will join me on a trip from Texas to Argentina, helping people and organizations the entire trip. A grand adventure with the sole mission of helping others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Knitta Nation: \u003c/strong\u003eI have teamed up with a former teammate and his knitting company, Warrior Woven. He flew me out to his families place in Colorado and taught me how to knit. I will take this skill around the world with me, hosting knitting seminars for widows of fallen host nation soldiers and refugees just trying to live life. We will then help establish legitimate\u00a0businesses for them, provide business counsel through volunteers, and pay them US market prices for their work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Raise the Black: \u003c/strong\u003eRaise the Black is an ongoing project that raises money for the families of fallen ISOF soldiers. We design, make, and sell unique merchandise and apparel\u00a0to accomplish this goal. It ties directly in with the knitting project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Desolate My Arse: \u003c/strong\u003eA project that will team liked minded individuals\u00a0and their\u00a0patented equipment to rebuild war-torn countries. The machinery repurposes demolished concrete for repurposing, allowing for places like Mosul to restore at a remarkably reduced cost. It will also help to\u00a0prevent the massive amounts of the ruble in these countries from just being pushed to the side and left as a constant reminder of the atrocities they faced.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Expedition Humanity: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is the culmination of everything that I am and everything that I have done. This project\u00a0aims to create the first ever, Global Humanitarian Adventure Race. Think of the \u0027Amazing Race\u0027 but with an actual purpose other than ratings. The gest, teams made up of people from all over the world will compete in an adventure race to win the grand prize of a large grant for the region they are competing. The teams will go to villages all over the world and be judged on the amount of benevolence they provide at each location. They will then be given points. The higher the points, the more help they get at the physical\u00a0and mental challenge at the end of each phase. (If they are tasked to cross a river, their points will determine how much gear they will be provided to cross that river, for an example). There is way more to this, but I will not bore you. Just know, if you ask, I will talk your ear off. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine. These projects and goals take immense time and effort. It is not the time and effort you can find on your off time. This is why I need your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo all of my loyal supporters, my friends, my family, and my dedicated followers. Thank you\u00a0for the support in getting me to this point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those who just learned about me and my purpose, I am asking you to help me break free to be part of the light that this world so desperately needs. If you can spare anything, please do so. I invite you along for the journey as you will be taking part in the next chapter of my heart and soul\u0027s only desire, to make this world a better place...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarmest regards,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBryan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInstagram: @the_bearded_bryan\u003cbr\u003eFacebook:\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/theworldismycountryfoundation\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/thebeardedbryan\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWeb: \u003ca href=\"http://www.wimcf.org\"\u003ewww.wimcf.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
