    "summary": "During the long hiatus between Crazy Ex-Girlfriend seasons, or when the show eventually leaves the airwaves, new content can really fill the gap. Before I was a podcaster, I didn\u0027t understand why they asked for donations on a regular basis. Now I know that most podcasters, myself included, have a monthly bill from their podcast hosting service. The longer the episodes, and the more there are, the higher that bill becomes! Anything we can do to offset those costs would be a huge help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome podcasters have to take their early shows offline because they can\u0027t afford to host them all - my aim is to keep the entire archive up as I go along. Even $1/month relieves a lot of the burden, believe it or not. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a new podcast and I\u0027ll be working on growing my listener base for a bit, but once I\u0027ve built up an audience I plan to roll out more reward tiers here so that everyone who donates will get additional perks and benefits back in return. If you have any suggestions for the kinds of rewards you\u0027d like to see, feel free to message at \u003ca href=\"mailto:paisley.podcasts@gmail.com\"\u003epaisley.podcasts@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e. I have some fun ideas and would love to hear your thoughts! Thanks very much."
