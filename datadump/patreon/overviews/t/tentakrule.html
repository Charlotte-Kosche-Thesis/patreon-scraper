That\u0027s been a goal of mine for a very long while. At the moment, however, I don\u0027t have the willpower or motivation to keep up the hustle that a self-sufficient artistic career requires. Plus, I have financial responsibilities that obligate me to continue working at a minimum wage retail job, so I don\u0027t really have the time to fully dedicate myself to my artistic endeavours. By supporting me, you\u0027ll not only be giving me the drive to create on a regular basis, but you\u0027ll also be present for any improvements I have because of that routine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(155, 187, 89);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI plan to start making finished pieces to post\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0(in whatever form they take, as long as I\u0027m able to polish it to a point where I\u0027m okay with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bowiesothereye.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epublishing it online\u003c/a\u003e), progress shots and maybe process videos of those pieces, and I\u0027ll also post any sketches, studies, or ideas that didn\u0027t make it to the final cut of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bowiesothereye.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy art blog\u003c/a\u003e (and there are a lot of them). Oh, and I\u0027ll be streaming regularly. Like, at least 3 times a week for 2-4 hours per stream, over on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/AstroDrawsThings\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy Picarto.tv channel\u003c/a\u003e. But with actual finished art (the stuff you\u0027ll be supporting the completion of), my goal is to create projects for myself on a weekly and bi-weekly basis, and to use the time I set for myself to thoroughly put together a decent piece of work. These might be original pieces or fanart, and they could be in any medium, and they might be nsfw in nature. I just need something big (4-6 hours for the weekly and 8-10 hours for the biweekly) to work on to better develop my self-management skills. I\u0027ll ONLY be accepting your patronage for those pieces, but you\u0027ll also see other (less polished) content between those.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eSo these projects will produce 3 finished pieces a month.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e One during the single-week project and another at the end of the two-week one. After that, I\u0027ll set two new projects for myself, and the cycle will start up again. I really want to get used to drawing challenging things more frequently, and really build up the willpower and stamina to invest myself into working on something for multiple sessions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eSo if that sounds like a rad deal to you, consider kicking me a few bucks!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[\u003ca href=\"http://tentakrule.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etumblr blog\u003c/a\u003e] [\u003ca href=\"http://bowiesothereye.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eart blog\u003c/a\u003e] [\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/tentakrule\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e]"
