FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW TO ENTER ***\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis\n tier is only for those who are dedicated to villainy in the worst \nway... just like us. You\u0027ve followed the path of evil, been seduced to a\n life of menace by the two monsters of Midway City, learned from The \nRogues, and been all over \nthe map in your pursuit of terror. It\u0027s all been fun and games up to \nthis point, but it\u0027s time to take your leave of Midway City and bring \nthis into the real world. After all - you love The Rogues because \nthey\u0027re real life super-villains, and you\u0027re ready to join the ranks. \nAre you ready to realize your full potential?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this tier, \nFreakuency and Fugitive Color will bring you to the vile streets of a \nreal life Midway City - Detroit, MI! You\u0027ll be brought out to The Rogues\n lair, where we\u0027ll have an elaborate heist set up for you with special \nappearances from some your other favorite villains, heroes, and callers.\n It will be a night not to be forgotten. And if the horrors we have \nplanned for you weren\u0027t enough to be permanently scarred into your \nbrain, we\u0027ll have the entire escapade filmed and edited for you to \nrelive again and again. We\u0027ll even set you up in our lair and have you \nfilm your own confessional detailing your pursuit of villainy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s\n the catch - the only way to become a real-life villain is to actually \nfollow the path. Click here to e-mail us and tell us that you intend to \nwalk in the footsteps of a villain before starting. You\u0027ll then go \nthrough the Patreon tiers month-to-month, upgrading each step of the \nway, in order to experience the events as they unfold. You can cancel at\n any time if you get cold feet and lock in a specific tier instead - but\n if you have what it takes, you\u0027ll be rewarded not only with a criminal \nchance of a lifetime, but you\u0027ll also get exclusives artifacts at each \ntier that are ONLY acquired by building to this grand finale. SO top \nsecret, in fact, that we can\u0027t even tell you about it. Rest assured, \nwe\u0027ll make sure that each step of the way, it doesn\u0027t just SAY you\u0027ve \nexperienced that month\u0027s events, but you\u0027ll live through them. After you\n reach the \u003cstrong\u003eBlood Brother\u003c/strong\u003e tier, we\u0027ll unlock the final tier just for \nyou to claim, and we\u0027ll make the necessary arrangements.",
