    "summary": "Welcome to the Princess University! This is the official Patreon fan page for the one and only Kibbler girls. If you\u0027ve been following along with these girls\u0027 incredible story you\u0027ll know just how far they\u0027ve come in the last 6 months. If you haven\u0027t been with us since the beginning, please watch the video to learn more about their incredible journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Kibbler girls have come from living in a world of absolute poverty in Memphis, TN; having no toys, shoes, or real opportunities to now being moved into a new home and given a new community of loving caring people to help them secure a future. They have been given a new sense of hope and encouragement to know that whatever they aspire to be when they grow up is truly possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so that\u0027s why we\u0027ve created this Patreon page for them. This is the Princess University\u003cbr\u003e!!\u00a0If you are new to Patreon, what this website allows us to do is unbelievable!! Unlike one time donation platforms, Patreon allows you to become monthly \"patrons\" for the girls and give them a reoccurring donation of $1 a month. In exchange for this donation, you become a member of their exclusive fan club and will receive a monthly update from them. This update will include custom made videos of them playing and laughing and telling you all about what\u0027s happening in their lives, pictures of them together, beautiful artwork, school grades and so much more. And this is content that will not be released anywhere else: only to The Princess University patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur hope and prayer is that we can reach 1,000 members. We believe that with this many members, by the time the oldest girl starts college in 8 years, we\u0027ll have enough to assist them all with a higher education. What that means for you is you\u0027ll be getting updates from them all the way from elementary to middle to high school!! The month to month donations will only ever be for $1 a month and can be stopped at anytime. And, we have set up a trust fund so that all the money raised can only be used for their college educations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have seen just how impactful the love a few thousand people in the city of Memphis has been to change the lives of these girls forever, and we are so excited to see that same love shape their future . The Princess University will be the greatest investment you will ever make. You will be investing in the dreams of the four most wonderful girls we\u0027ve ever seen. Thank you so much for everything you\u0027ve done to make all this possible for them. We love you all so much!! God bless!!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
