So, when a publisher signs him to a lucrative contract,\nhe knows exactly what he\u0027s going to do: go and see every single country in the\nworld. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0027Why?\u0027 one of his friends asks him at his farewell in Sydney, Australia. \u0027Is it\njust so that you can say you\u0027ve done something crazy?\u0027 \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nBut that\u0027s not it at all. Instead, what Damon really wants is to \n\t\u003c/em\u003elearn. \u003cem\u003eHe\ndreams of immersing himself in cultures he\u0027d previously never known existed,\nand observing how other communities live. He dreams of trying all the dishes\nhis mum never would\u0027ve imagined cooking for him growing up - like grilled\nsnake, wasp crackers, fruit bat soup and deep-fried tarantulas. He dreams of\nbeing taught history from protestors, war veterans and voters who lived it, and\nof understanding how it\u0027s shaped them and their nations into who they are\ntoday. He dreams of going scuba-diving, jungle-trekking, ocean-cruising,\nmountain climbing and glacier-hiking; and being a curious young writer, he\ndreams of endlessly people-watching, and of talking to as many locals as he can\nfrom as many walks of life as possible, so that he can understand what makes\nthem similar, what makes them different, and what they each think about when\nthey\u0027re falling asleep at night.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, with an open heart and ready for anything, Damon bids his friends and\nfamily goodbye, and boards a plane to Rio de Janeiro. And, over the next\nfive-and-three-quarter years - from Brazil to Ukraine, Guatemala to Sudan,\nRussia to Antarctica and everywhere in between - Damon discovers more about the\nworld, its people - and himself - than he ever thought possible.\n\t\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy am I writing this book?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWriting a novel where a character travels to\nevery country in the world is, as you can imagine, an \n\u003cem\u003eenormous \u003c/em\u003eundertaking.\nBut, I am dedicated to doing it, because I wholeheartedly believe that this is\na very, very important book to write. In particular, I have three main reasons\nfor doing so:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eTo tell the most\neye-opening story you\u0027ve ever read.\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e No novel has ever taken a\nreader to every country on earth, and by introducing you to so many radically\ndifferent cultures and people, it\u0027s my hope that you\u0027ll finish reading this\nbook feeling that it\u0027s broadened your horizons more than any other you\u0027ve read.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo share with you\neverything I\u0027ve learned during my travels about how to be happy.\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e The places\nI\u0027ve visited, the people I\u0027ve met and the experiences I\u0027ve had have taught me\nmore than I ever thought possible about happy living - and, I\u0027ll weave all of\nthose insights throughout the course of this story so that by the time you\u0027ve\nfinished reading it, you would\u0027ve learned many new approaches, philosophies and\nperspectives that you can implement to live a happier life yourself.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo promote cultural\nacceptance.\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e I believe that the more we\u0027re introduced to other people and\ncultures, the more we tend to understand and accept them, and therefore, the\nless hate and prejudice there\u0027s likely to exist in the world.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow have I been writing this story?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile this book is a work of fiction, it\u0027s very\nheavily based on my own life and experiences. Luckily, my previous two books\nsold well enough that I\u0027ve been able to travel extensively - including non-stop\nfor the last 18 months while I\u0027ve been doing the research for this story - and\nI\u0027ll continue travelling to visit the countries that I haven\u0027t yet been to. I\u0027m\nalso collaborating with locals from (almost) every country in the world, to\nensure that the finished product is as rich and authentic as it can be. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhen will it be finished?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs at the beginning of October, 2017, I\u0027ve done\nmy research for almost half of the novel, and I\u0027ve written about 5% of it. It\u0027s\nhard to know exactly when it will be completed, but working full-time, I anticipate\nit will be finished within the next five years - so by the end of 2022. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBut, illness and circumstances have set me back ...\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI was on track to completing this book by the\nend of 2022 like I said, however most unfortunately, the cost of Facebook\nadvertisements have risen dramatically this year, and since they were the\ndriving force behind the sale of my first two books after launch, my income has\ndried up in 2017. Because this novel won\u0027t be finished until the end of 2022,\nthat means that I won\u0027t receive any income from my writing until then - and\nwhile I\u0027ve been living off my savings for the last nine months, I don\u0027t have\nanywhere near five years\u0027 worth of savings to continue supporting myself. This\nfinancial stress has contributed to me developing an anxiety condition, and as\na result, I\u0027ve returned to my hometown Sydney to get treatment, and to figure\nout how to feasibly continue writing this story. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow you can help me finish this book (and what you\u0027ll get right now for doing so)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been in Australia for about three weeks\nnow, and in that time, I\u0027ve tried to get myself back on track by beginning\ntreatment for my anxiety, setting up an online side-business, and I\u0027ve also\narranged to start teaching English next month over Skype. Something else I\u0027ve\ndone to try and stabilise my income and allow me to continue writing this novel\nhas been to set up this Patreon page, where fans of travel literature can\nsponsor me their pocket-change, and in return receive: \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor $1/month:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eA digital copy of my book when it\u0027s released, and instant\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u00a0access to my \"library\" of best travel stories.\u003c/strong\u003e This \"reward\" unlocks access to all of my travel stories currently published on Patreon, and also includes access to all future travel stories (published monthly).
