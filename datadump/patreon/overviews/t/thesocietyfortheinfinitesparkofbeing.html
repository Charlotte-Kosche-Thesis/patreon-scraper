    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eYou are much, much more than they said you were!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Society for The Infinite Spark of Being began as a blog where I shared things that inspired my spiritual seeking. I imagined folks out there having the same disconnected feelings toward the spiritual beliefs that were handed down to them that I had as a teenager. That feeling that there was something else to this story that they were being told.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter some time I began writing about my experiences with different teachers and practices as well as the insights I was getting through them. The hope was to encourage others to seek out teachers and to explore outside of the systems they were raised in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike most people, ideas and words find association with images in the mind. For me as the mind got more and more still and quieted down concepts and phrases would come into my awareness and along with them these geometric patterns and symbols.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist it interested me to recreate them and share them. Over time a bit of a language began to develop. I started to incorporate other more well known and not so well known symbols into the pieces. Always with the hopes that these things would flip a switch that turned on a light that would then remind the viewer that they were much more than the system or even their upbringing says they are. I wanted them to know that they are \u003cstrong\u003ewild infinite.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter some time the writing picked back up but this time I wanted to distill things down. I don\u0027t want to teach as much as I want to share with these writings. I want you the viewer, the reader to feel love and feel hope and know that this is all alright. All of this will be ok and that there is much more to it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ebooks, art and recorded interviews with spiritual teachers\u003c/strong\u003e I hope to flip the switch for some and to encourage other seekers to keep seeking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy reason for taking The Society for The Infinite Spark of Being to Patreon is the hope of earning the money to grow this project further. I would like to dedicate more time to it. This year I released the first book through Blurb. I am already working toward a second edition with ever more art and writing that will be released through Balboa Press. I have always believed that art and wisdom should be accessible\u00a0to\u00a0everyone so all I can offer you is my honesty and truth as I understand it at this point in my life. This will simply be a way for people to help someone that is doing their best to turn the light on for others.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo learn more about The Infinite Spark of Being\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.theinfinitesparkofbeing.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClick Here\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther Ways of Following The Society for The Infinite Spark of Being:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/theinfinitespark\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://theinfinitesparkofbeing.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInstagram-\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theinfinitesparkofbeing/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@theinfinitesparkofbeing\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter- @TheSprkofBeing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
