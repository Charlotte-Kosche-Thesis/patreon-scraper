    "summary": "TeNaK Talk is a LIVE video teaching platform regarding \u00a0ALL things from a TaNaKh perspective. Our guests are teachers of various topics related to the Hebrew AND Christian Bibles. We do not believe in OR support the teachings from the new testament. All teachings about the new testament are from the Counter-Missionary standpoint and guest speakers are a mixed group of teachers, authors, ex-Preachers etc...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Teachings from the weekly Torah Parsha are presented by Orthodox Rabbi\u0027s and teachers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHebrew classes are also available on a weekly schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal for TeNaK Talk is to eventually be in the studio full time with a much heavier supply of resources for the viewers...which is the reason for the monthly goal. The money will be used for supplimenting my current income as well as studio fees and expenses, including rent, internet, phones etc...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(FYI - we currently have close to 3500 subscribers to the YouTube Channel. If EVERYone donated only $2.75 per month, the monthly support would be surpassed.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS. If you prefer, there is a PayPal button on the website. You can set it up as a one-time donation OR reoccurring. PayPal doesn\u0027t keep as much back as Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for reading and considering \u0026lt;3"
