But there\u0027s a ton of material we\u0027re constantly working on or in our vaults. Stuff that\u0027s created with no intention of ever \"officially\" releasing. Cover songs, acoustic versions of album tracks, demo ideas... all of these are things we do to spread our wings as musicians and songwriters. \u003cstrong\u003eBut what we don\u0027t have is an official outlet to make that stuff available to you.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eSo consider this fan club our way to make that happen!\u003c/em\u003e With the basic $2 Pledge, as a Dollyrots VIP member, you\u0027ll receive at least one unreleased track per month. \u003cstrong\u003eOne vintage demo or non-album track from our vaults, brand new unreleased single, or B-side.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0You never know, some of these songs might end up morphing into album tracks in the future and you\u0027ll get to hear em at their inception!

We\u0027re VERY lucky to be able to create music for a living but rely on our fans to make it happen. At every turn our fans have given us the opportunity to really dig in and put together the best possible albums and keep this band prolific and productive.

We\u0027ll also be able to\u00a0invest a little more into our home studio setup \u003cstrong\u003ewhich will come back to you in the form of even more awesome music \u0026amp; media.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0As a Patron you will become totally integral to this entire process for the life of this band, not just during an album project. Your support in exchange for regular, consistent, and awesome Dollyrots media, ALWAYS the kind you\u0027ll love.
