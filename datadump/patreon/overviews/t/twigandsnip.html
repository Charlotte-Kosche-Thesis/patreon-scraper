    "summary": "Since I was very young, one of my favorite things to do has\nbeen walking around outside looking at nature, daydreaming about the inner\nlives of creatures and plants. I remember long hours spent in the backyard with\nmy little sister exploring, eating weeds, gathering flowers, playing elaborate\ngames of pretend, and talking with trees.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGrowing up I began studying Fiber Arts; weaving, basketry,\nsewing, knitting, embroidery, etc.  There is something about creating an\nobject that can be empowered with well worn care in our every day lives that\nhas always drawn my imagination.  I think it was because of this yearning\nto craft in a more folk style that I ultimately left my college art studies to\npursue something outside of the Gallery Artwork mold. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor years I studied Ayurveda, Permaculture, and Wild Botanical Medicine. \nI also rescued a puppy and made a commitment to her to be outside exploring\nevery day (We have almost every day for 11 years since).  During this time\nI learned how to see and feel in Nature again, how to listen and gather plants\nfrom my environment. To feel the wonder and ease of just walking beneath the\ntrees and it began to spark my urge to create again with the beauty I found\nthere. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nComing to the Pacific Northwest I fell deeply in love with\nthe land and began experimenting with creating my own plant dyes.  I began\ncreating in earnest again, crafting huge Nature Wheels from gathered plants and\ndyed yarns. I soon finished my Fine Arts degree, and began studying Shamanism\nwhich had always called to me.  Spirituality was the missing link for me\nfor many years.  Shamanism began to put words to the vague feelings I\u0027d\nhad my whole life.  Learning about the spirit that flows through\neverything enabled me to move forward with my craft in a conscious way. \nFusing the medicine of spirit and art together to reveal the magic in nature\nand in myself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of my current projects you can find updates and tutorials on include\ncrafting trips to gather materials for smudge wands and incense, dyeing silk\nfloss for embroidered spirit offerings, eco-printing canvas to sew tarot bags,\nweaving meditation and journeying shawls, coiling nests with found fibers for\naltars, custom tea blends and ritual ideas for the seasons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions allow me a stability in my life from month to month to focus on creating and planning more projects and grander adventures to share with you.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me on this \njourney! Become a Patron and reconnect with Nature, as I share my \nexplorations and discoveries alongside my pup, Pinto. Learn about \ndifferent plants and all the varied medicines they can offer us through \nthe physical, ritual, and art craft. I\u0027ll show you methods for \nsustainable gathering, plant dye tutorials, gardening, weaving, walking \nmeditations, herbal tea recipes, and more! I\u0027ll keep you abreast of new \nprojects and crafts, as I\u0027m continually exploring new ideas. Let me help\n you find your way to this beautiful place of wonderment, intuition, and\n ease. \u003cbr\u003e"
