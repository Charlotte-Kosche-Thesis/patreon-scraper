However, it is a very time consuming process and it is hard to balance what I love and what I need to do to keep a roof over my head. Especially when I live miles from the nearest town with viable jobs (if there are any at all that I am qualified for). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more that I am able to supplement my income with my writing, the more time I can actually spend writing. Meaning less time spent job hunting or traveling. This also means lowering my stress levels, which is directly linked to my writing mojo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, perhaps you are\u00a0looking to redirect my focus and get an update for one of my existing stories. Or maybe you want something entirely new. Then again, perhaps you just want to help out a writer who\u0027s work you enjoy. Whatever your reason, any and all\u00a0donations will be greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
