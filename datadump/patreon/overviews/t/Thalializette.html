    "summary": "Hi everybody!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe name is Thalia, i stream games on Twitch 3 times a week with a schedule and make Youtube videos when i can! So far i have been doing this since 2013, and it has made me very happy. I have gotten to know some of the most incredible people because of it and i am very thankful for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently i am living in South Korea, Busan. I will be staying here for one year with a working holiday visa because my boyfriend lives here. In august 2018 i will go back home in Belgium where i will have to find a job again so i can go afford my own place. My boyfriend will be coming with me to my homeplace which i can not wait for! Ofcourse it will not be that easy job related but i believe we can make it through someway. At the moment i stream in KST times and try to keep it at a reasonable time so EU ppl can still watch too just like before. Once i will be back home, i will stream in CET again which will make things somewhat easier for the subs ^^. I have been taking a break from Youtube for now to focus more on Twitch, i simply also enjoy streaming a lot more at the moment so i am doing what i am enjoying most now. I will be back on Youtube when i feel like making a video again, for sure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been wanting to make a patreon page for a while, simply for people to be able to support me. I have always felt guilty \u0027asking\u0027 for money, although i don\u0027t want it to come off that way at all.\u00a0 As most of my subscribers know, i do have a job but it\u0027s not full time. I did have the chance to go full time. But because i enjoy Youtube/Twitch way more than my job, i made the choice not to so i can put more time into my videos and the things i love. Ofcourse, i would need better equipment, i have already invested a lot of money into it, but it would be nice if i could make the quality of my videos/streams even better and review more merchandise, do giveaways to people who support me here and on Twitch/Youtube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat means the most to me is your support through all social media which i really appreciate. It makes my day to see people react and comment to the content i make with a big passion. It makes me happy. That\u0027s why i want to continue making videos and grow more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance if you do so \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
