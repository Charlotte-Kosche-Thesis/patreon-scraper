    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m LC Brown, creator of The Heroine\u0027s Journey podcast.\nIt\u0027s a show that highlights female protagonists and women\u0027s stories across geek\npop culture, including books, TV, film, comics, video games, and more. You can\nlisten to it at \u003ca href=\"http://www.hjcast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.hjcast.com\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe reason behind the show is simple: I got tired of podcasts that overlooked women.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost podcasts these days are produced by and for straight,\nwhite men. That\u2019s fine, if you happen to \u003cem\u003ebe \u003c/em\u003ea straight,\nwhite man. But I\u2019m not. As it turns out, neither are many of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I came up with The Heroine\u0027s Journey. The goal is to\nshine a spotlight on positive, interesting and/or complex portrayals of women\nin genre fiction, and on the creators who are doing it right. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a show by women, about women, for women \u2013 a space\nwhere we can come together and chat about the characters we like and the ones we\nhate, and know that the conversation will always revolve around us and our\nperspectives, whatever those might be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut here\u0027s the thing. The Heroine\u0027s Journey is a labor of\nlove: As much as I enjoy doing it \u2013 especially engaging with fans \u2013 there\u0027s a\nlot of hard work that goes into making each episode as great as it can be. And\nwhile I never intended to make any money from THJ, many of you have asked that\nI start a Patreon so you can help me keep the lights on. I decided it sounded\nlike a good idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you like what you hear, I hope that you\u0027ll consider\nbecoming a Patron to help support the show. As a bonus, I\u0027ve also put together\na couple of extras for those of you who do contribute. You can check them out\nbelow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, I\u0027d like to give a huge thank you to all my\nlisteners. You\u0027ve been wonderful, and made this journey worth taking. I\ncouldn\u0027t have done any of this without you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003e\nLC\u003cbr\u003e"
