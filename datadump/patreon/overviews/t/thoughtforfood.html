    "summary": "Hey! THANK YOU for taking the time to check out our Patreon page. We\u0027re Jackson and Aaron, and we are the two weirdos behind the Thought For Food Podcast. Our primary goal is to make living a healthy, compassionate and adventurous plant-based lifestyle simple and practical for everyone. No dogma, no drama, just #science. Our focus is a weekly (sometimes more) podcast where we discuss key topics like the role of protein or iron in plant-based diets, and talk with academics, athletes and entrepreneurs about what it means to live well. We discuss in depth complicated scientific topics to make evidence-based nutrition entertaining and approachable in a fun and educational way. We also make awesome videos to showcase this adventurous lifestyle we believe in (such as the one from Jackson\u0027s trip to Europe above).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re unbelievably grateful for everyone who listens to TFF and those who have enjoyed our over 100+ podcast episodes and videos. We desperately want to continue bringing you the plant based information, entertainment and fun you have come to expect, but we need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf the quality, consistency, entertainment, and variety of Thought For Food has been useful or valuable in your life, then we\u2019d like you to consider investing in the podcast, by becoming a voluntary supporter here on Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt requires an insane amount of time to plan, research, schedule, script, edit, publish, and market each episode of the podcast, and it\u0027s just the two of us. By joining our Patreon community, you\u0027ll allow us to spend more time on the process and more energy into creating the quality content you deserve. Because this is bigger than us, it\u0027s bigger than you. It\u0027s about stimulating a movement and shifting the paradigm of nutrition and lifestyle towards compassion, health, and sustainability. We\u0027re in this together, so by pledging just \u003cstrong\u003e$5 or more per month\u003c/strong\u003e (the cost of an almond milk latte, c\u0027mon), you\u0027ll be part of this movement of keeping TFF alive and growing. You\u0027ll also be allowing the pod to stay free and out in the world so more people can discover the show and become evidence-based warriors and change the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does that actually look like?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBetter content: \u003c/strong\u003ethink more frequent What\u0027s The Deal episodes, expansion of the Plant-Based Parenting Series, more time to schedule and interview epic guests, and increased production value.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore resources: \u003c/strong\u003ewe want to expand the learning beyond the podcast in the form of podcast transcriptions, cheat sheets, books, and group coaching.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore merch: \u003c/strong\u003ethe initial line of TFF gear was a big success, but we simply don\u0027t have the budget to make large orders or expand to multiple products (hoodies, anyone?). Having the support on Patreon would allow us to invest in creating even more cool stuff.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommunity: \u003c/strong\u003ea huge piece of TFF is creating community, and we want to extend that into the real world. Live podcast tours, TFF Camp, events; the options are endless. Having monetary support would allow us to dedicate our time and fund stuff like this.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIn return, you\u0027ll be rewarded with an even better show, an upgraded TFF experience, and some special rewards like exclusive episodes, a chance to be on the show (!!), and even access to being a part of the process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started TFF to do something different and make an impact. First and foremost we do the show every week for you, the listener. But we\u0027ve realized that if we\u0027re going to turn TFF into something even greater, now is the moment to do it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you say? Should we do it? Are you with us? Let\u0027s do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGo eat some plants, take epic dumps, and let\u0027s do some epic shit together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Jackson and Aaron\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://tfflifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ThoughtForFood-8.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
