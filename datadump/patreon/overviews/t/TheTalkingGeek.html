    "summary": "Four years ago, we were just a group of young scrappy geeks with a lot to say. So we thought why not say it into a microphone. So we started, The Talking Geek. We\u00a0review movies, talk video games, troll your favorite, and debated over who was a better superhero Batman or Superman... (still debating). Our group saved their nickels and dimes to purchase equipment for this new little monster we created but we weren\u2019t yet satisfied. We had a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e more to say\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have now several more segments to target each one of your geeky needs with many more ideas in mind for the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to \u003cem\u003efully\u003c/em\u003e invest ourselves in bringing you not only the same content you\u2019ve come to love, but new and exciting projects that provoke and inspire. Our content has always been free to access and we fully intend to keep it that way. BUT! We do need some help along the way to keep it going. To be able to dedicate more time to producing content... to making it possible to purchase better equipment so we can continue to create top-quality, professional sounding (is that even a term??)  multi-media content. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYour dollar goes a long, long way.\u003c/em\u003e Your contribution helps us not want to stab ourselves in the eye every-time we have a podcast or video to edit and stay up until the wee hours of the morning only to have to wake up and go to our day job. You can help us acquire equipment that will allow us to keep our hosts audible (or loud) at all times since some have no microphone etiquette and forget that they are not at a superbowl game. (Our ears\u2026 our ears\u2026 they bleed during the editing process. Help our ears not bleed\u2026 err um\u2026 Help our ears not rupture from older equipment that refuses to cooperate with our vision... why mixer? why???). \u00a0Ahem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(OMG we have SO many ideas pouring out of our heads...)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe thank you from the bottom of our hearts, for being with us through the years, supporting our madness and helping our network grow. Let\u2019s work together to bring out more content and grow our audiences! You can do it! (enter cheerleaders here\u2026 hello?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi."
