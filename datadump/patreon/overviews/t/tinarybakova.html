In particular, I am a certified artist, seamstress and makeup artist. So it was only a matter of time before my actor qualities and my obsession with fantasy world crossed paths, I was pretty much destined to become a cosplayer at some point. Cosplay fascinated me, I fell in love with this activity because of the unique varieties of opportunities for creativity. I am expire and exited with all the stages of cosplay work: I love to do the costumes and makeup, performing at events and festivals, and of course take part in the filming and shootings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn each of my work, I try to do something difficult and interesting, set myself the unusual task. For example, my first famous project (Cosplay Red Sonja), I shoting together with a live bear. I was dressed only in a bikini armor, and posed under snowfall - an amazing experience!\u003cbr\u003e In another cosplay elf Tauriel I was wondering quite another - to make detailed and realistic costume, so I threw all my forces to study \"The Hobbit\" artbook and search for ideal materials.\u003cimg src=\" https://pp.vk.me/c604618/v604618972/1449a/4ID9mrqnwyA.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFaster, higher, stronger\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e I would like to do more cosplay, which is why your support is so important for me. Without the possibility of donations on Patreon I still can be creative, but with your help, I can do it faster, better then ever.And the main thing - I would have opportunity to buy best materials and rent animals. If you can\u0027t be my patron in any case, I am so appreciative for you visiting my Patreon to check it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Also you can follow me on Facebook\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tinacosplay/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFan Page\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003eAnd if you do decide to become my patron - it\u0027s just \u003cstrong\u003esuper awesome\u003c/strong\u003e!
