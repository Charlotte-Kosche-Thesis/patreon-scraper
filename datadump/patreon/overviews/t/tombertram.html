I suffered severe anxiety and needed therapy for 18 months. Music is what truly helped me, it gave me an escape and allowed me to let out my emotions. More importantly other peoples music (such as John Mayer) helped, with them singing about their own anxieties I knew I wasn\u0027t alone. As Tony Robbins says \"The secret to living is giving\" and this is the best way I know I can give., because when someone puts them headphones on I want them to go to a good place. Please join me on my Patreon to help me to make music and reach more people to help them. It will truly make a difference to many people\u0027s lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get (as well as helping others)!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will do regular (at least once a month) online shows for just the people who sign up! In this live stream show I will take requests, answer questions and it will be a very relaxed hang out where we can have fun,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow am I billed?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will be billed per creation I make. So overtime I upload a new video or song. I will do this a maximum of 3 times per week to give you a guideline on what you can donate per creation. So if you sign up to give 5 (of your currency) per creation then you will spend a maximum of 15 per week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you and lets help the world xo"
