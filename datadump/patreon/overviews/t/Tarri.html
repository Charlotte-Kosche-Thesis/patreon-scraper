Personally! Hi! :D\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you? What is this place?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat, my friend, is an excellent question.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am Tarri.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI rule this place with \n\u003cdel\u003ean iron fist\u003c/del\u003e much love and friend things. Things that are friend. Friendly friends~\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you want?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdel\u003eYour eternal soul\u003c/del\u003e I want to tell you a little of myself, and the purpose of this place. I am the \u003cdel\u003epurest incarnation of doom and despair\u003c/del\u003e an innocent little fluffball who loves to come up with stories, and draw.\u003cbr\u003e\nBut more to the point. As an artist, I want to share what I do with you, and the rest of the world. Call it like some kind of self-driven mission.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut here is the real kicker: it takes time to create stories and art. And while I am not entirely comfortable with the notion of producing my creative work for money, I find myself needing to ask.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet me explain.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to produce all of my work for everyone to enjoy. To do this, it requires a decent chunk of time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately for me, and for every other creator like myself, I am also bound to a world run on money, which means in order to survive, I need money for the necessities of life. This is why we all need to go out and get jobs and such.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the creative artist, this is a problem, and in fact, many artists end up failing in their ambitions because they need a job in order to earn money to survive - they are unable to work to their full potential, and those we produce the works for, you, are likely never get to enjoy them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that is what if comes down to. Time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI launched my own Patreon page so that I might appeal to each and every one of you. In order to continue creating for each and every one of you, I need time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe more time I have dedicated to my art, my comics, my stories, the more I can produce for you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI honestly believe that any and all creative work should be for everyone to enjoy - heck, even getting paid for work I do feels weird and wrong.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo while yes, I am asking for your financial support in my work, for me, you will be giving me time. And to me, that is an incredibly valuable gift.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd in return, I can gift my work to the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow that I have gotten that out of the way, let me tell you of some of my work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eStories - Comics and stuff\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have had a thing for writing stories and drawing as far back as I can remember - to be honest, I was coming up with stories before I even realised I loved doing it! Imagine you are in the middle of writing a story about dragons, not knowing you loved writing, then suddenly realising you do... okay, to be honest I question my attention span to my own brain...\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I want more than anything in the world (besides immortality) is to get my stories out there. This is either in comic form, or novel form - I have plans for both!\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMore specifically to this point in time, I have two current projects.
