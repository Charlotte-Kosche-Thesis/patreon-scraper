    "summary": "On January 1st, 2015 I started an epic journey to gain traction as a creator on the Youtube platform and to feed my creative hunger. Since then I have gained the support of over 17,000 individuals and created over 500 edited pieces of content. To improve my abilities I went to college for graphic design and video editing which gave me a perspective into the professional world, and have continued on a weekly basis to refine my abilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day I\u0027d like to reach a point where creating videos can be my life and my career; to show the world I have what it takes to succeed in my works and thrive solely on my creations. With youtube ads being at a seemingly all time low, its difficult to be able to make this my career without having to focus more on day to day jobs. I want to thank at the bottom of my heart to anyone who supports the channel by watching, or monetarily by supporting me on patreon - you are making someones dreams and efforts come to life and that is something that a price tag really can\u0027t be put on. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know there are alot of creators worthy of patreon support so I understand theres alot of people who need support, but I do put in alot of effort and hours of time each week to entertain or inform my growing audience and would be utterly thankful for support. I\u0027d like to put more focus onto the community and videos over my day to day job - this is a growing career to me and something I am so passionate about. Thank you once again to all those who see my spark and support me, you really are kind hearted and awesome!\u00a0"
