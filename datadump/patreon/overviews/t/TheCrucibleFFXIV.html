    "summary": "The Crucible is an in-character, in-game FFXIV tabloid born from a series of bad ideas each spinning more and more out of control. This is a passion project that we started because it amused the two of us, but as we began to introduce it to the community we realized that we had found a niche to fill, and so we\u0027ve doubled down on pouring our hearts and soul into this trash rag.\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re turning to patreon because we want to maximize the quality of our product, and we truly believe in it. As of right now it costs us $60 a month to run the tabloid, and to alleviate that financial burden would free us up to experiment more with different features or maybe even bring on new staffers with different talents.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your interest in The Crucible, we hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoy making it."
