This private collection of ill repute has been given new meaning by its visitors, and has become a base of artistic operation providing solidarity and inspiration for many weirdos throughout the years.  Through hosting tours of its halls, The Manor hopes to further influence the world into containing more wonder; whether through creations of its own or ones it may have sparked within others.  Our philosophy is that life is too short to conform to normality; yet there is no reason to shame those who do.  We can not all live amongst the stars, but with Trundle Manor at least you can always visit.\u003cbr\u003e",
