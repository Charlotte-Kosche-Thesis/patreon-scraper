Writing is currently a passion, one that has driven me to attend Sacred Heart University where I graduated with a B.A. in English with a focus on Creative Writing. It is my passion, for writing and story telling, that I one day hope to turn into a career. Patreon is the first step in that direction.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\tUp until now, I have never attempted to chase the aforementioned dream. I have worked hard as the manager of a landscaping crew, the manager of a restaurant, and most recently a Marketing Manager in the health industry. I strive away in my cubicle, helping Doctors and Dentists reach their full marketing potential\u2026 I in some way help them in their own dream goals. As I help these successful people fulfill their dreams, my own dream falls by the wayside, and that is why I believe Patreon is a great way to begin chasing this dream. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\t\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon with a purpose.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\tWe are all chasing dreams of some sort, this patreon page is to help me begin to realize mine. The greatest way to chase a dream is to be confident, this page is to prove to myself that I can do this. I want to prove to myself that not only is my writing enjoyable to create, but that it is also enjoyable for others to read. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you will get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\tBy supporting this Patreon you will effectively be pushing me to further chase my dream. You will be showing me that I should further prioritize more time for writing and creating, and maybe less time tinkering away in a cubicle. I currently have two different stories that I work on in my free time. Becoming a supporter of this Patreon will gain you access, in digital format,  to the first chapter of both of these stories. I hope to grow a community of support for each story and hope to have you, the supporters, Depending on your level of support, help decide which story gets a new chapter first.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Stories\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eSix Till Noon\u003c/u\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a childhood trauma, in which six strangers change a young boys life forever, he must overcome trails of faith, unjust law, and moral ambiguities. Follow along as the protagonist braves the wild west in search of justice and redemption. In his journey for revenge, will he find fulfillment or will his lust for revenge be the one thing standing in his way?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eThe Glorious Mr. Crown\u003c/u\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn shadow of his fathers footsteps, Morally unrighteous Mr. Crown could not care less about getting the job done. Crown\u2019s lackadaisical approach puts the legacy his father built hunting down legendary monsters and myths as risk. Is it enough to push Crown into completing his duty as heir? Or we he continue to live by his own rules, risking the lives of innocents and revealing secrets of his antiquated society?\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\tThis Patreon is about chasing a dream, gaining confidence, and sharing with people what I believe are two great adventures\u2026 and maybe some pictures of the snoring English bulldog. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\tI hope you enjoy! \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e"
