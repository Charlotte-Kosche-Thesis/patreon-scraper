Unfortunately, Spenser\u0027s too busy being a badass and doing Spenser shit, so Toph and Scar are helping him reach that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery week, we upload a new episode to our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQSgvvZtwk6a55WWNL8weJw?view_as=subscriber\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e channel. Sometimes we fly out guests to give us a challenge (since Scar and Toph are way too good at Smash and would win for free by themselves). If you become a patron, you can watch all four episodes in a batch hot-off-the-press, weeks before those episodes become available on YouTube, and you gain access to primo subscriber-only content. And some other goodies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSmashladder\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAnther\u0027s Ladder, aka Smashladder, is an online ranking ladder and netplay lobby for Super Smash Bros. Melee. Many aspiring Melee players have leveled up by finding netplay opponents via Smashladder, such as Syrox and the elusive PaNdOrA\u0027s FoX. You can find more info on how to set up netplay and join the online SSBM community \u003ca href=\"http://www.smashladder.com\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo each and every one of you. Even if you watch the YouTube episode with Adblock enabled, even if you freeze glitch us in netplay matches, even if you\u0027re Atrioc. All of your support helps pay for the hours of therapy we require at this point from dealing with the F***ING LAG. And lastly: we\u0027re new to this platform and this whole Patreon thing is a work in progress, so if you have any advice, please hit us up on Twitter with your comments and criticism. We appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e"
