I have a strong passion for making videos as I do drawing and being social. Artistically, I severely look up to three specific artists: Sakimi Chan, Vexstacy, and Mike Inel. I\u0027m not just envious to them, i\u0027m inspired by them!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course i\u0027m still making videos, but this is a way for you guys to help support the things that I want to do. Some of the projects i\u0027m working on include my very own webcomic \"Lakos Petra.\" It features Anthro characters acting as Gods And Goddesses over mankind. Until a terrible person comes forth... Find out more here on Patreon!! And with the help of Babylon and DaddySenpai, I\u0027m aiming for this story to be my most prized possession!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course this is just scratching the surface on the things that I wish to do, and with your help, I can get one step closer to reaching my goals! All in all, I want to be able to devote as much of my time to you guys that I possibly can. And as more and more of you support me, I will be able to do just that. I\u0027ll be able to make more videos, do more art, and just give back to you guys for giving so much to me!"
