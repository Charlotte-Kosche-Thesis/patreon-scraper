Where you can find everything, well, Vesper and gang related. I am very pleased that you have found your way here. Those of you who have no clue what The Vespidian is and the shenanigans that it entails let me give you a little introduction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e A little warning there is profuse profanity, sexual innuendo, some rather questionable morals, detailed torture, gay and lesbian characters, fictitious drug use and prostitution. If any of the above offends you, then well this story is not for you and I recommend you move on. Proceed at your own peril, this is not a kid\u0027s story and is aimed for young adults and up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day, deprived of the internet Vesper ventures out from her parent\u0027s basement into the outside world. Only for things to go horribly awry when she is exposed to a glowing mystery goo and her life changes forever. She gains super strength, endurance, speed, and even regeneration! What could possibly go wrong? Well... everything really. Vesper mutates into a monstrous wasp creature, though her mind remains somewhat intact. She struggles to suppress her new instincts, cravings for meat, and hold onto her crumbling humanity. No longer human Vesper  joins the ranks of the other extraordinary people known collectively as Supers. The so-called Heroes and Villains.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus starts her adventures through the mysterious, dangerous, dark, fantastical, silly, lewd, and at times downright insane world of Supers. Will she claw her way out as the Hero Bronson City needs or will she give in to her darker half and become the Villain that makes it bleed?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect anybody to go crazy and pledge large amounts for my story, happy with just the exposure and if you feel generous the starting pledge is $1 and gives you early access to my Beta Book page to give feed back and help me out with stuff in advance, if you so choose or you can just wait for me to post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://royalroadl.com/fiction/6773\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://royalroadl.com/fiction/6773\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this story last year on new years day and now we are on Arc 7 of roughly 30 planned. Once the main story is finished I plan to side branch out into a Story about Molotov and even a spin off about the Moon Sailors!\u003c/div\u003e"
