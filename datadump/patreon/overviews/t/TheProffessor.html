Frontend itself is an easy to use tool that allows you to select exactly which mods you would like to use instead of having to download an \"all-in-one\" type of mod pack, then deal with what you\u0027re given. It automatically updates mod files when Nexon updates the game itself, and contains various other utilities, such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022FIONA - \"Frontend Interactive Operations \u0026amp; Navigations Assistant\" - An AI which serves as a helper to explain what certain mods do in the game and troubleshoot common issues when things don\u0027t go as planned.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022Nova -\u00a0alternate mod injection technique; creates a\u00a0package file of the selected mods\u00a0that matches Mabi\u0027s file system, so they\u0027re read by the game without the need for a security bypass\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022PMG Viewer\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022PMG Editor\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022MabiUnpack - for opening Mabi\u0027s game data files (this is\u00a0how you get the original files if you were to make a mod yourself)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022MabiTimer - contains timers for Price and Rua (NPC\u0027s with varing accessibility), Part-time Jobs, dungeon orbs, time until transformations become available again, and a list of the daily effects (which vary based on the real-life day of the week).

Most of them are cosmetic edits, such as changing one model to another, changing sounds, creating or enabling hidden UI features, and so on.\u00a0A large number\u00a0of them remove unnecessary clutter from the game or fixes issues\u00a0that cause a large amount of lag for many people. For many, the game is downright unplayable without mods to keep things stable.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nAbout the Game Itself\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mabinogi is an MMORPG with a lot of interesting secondary elements. It\u0027s not always grind and level as most games in that genre are (although levels certainly don\u0027t hurt...lol). There are a number of life skill aspects to it as well. One that drew me into it was the music system. You can write music scripts and play them ingame with friends. It\u0027s quite interesting getting a whole group of folks together to jam.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nThe Current Situation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the past few years, I have had increasingly larger living expenses, leading to larger debts, and sadly even my basic bills are dangerously close to lapsing. All of this has lead to working several jobs to try to make ends meet, leaving me with\u00a0little to no\u00a0time for program development. I still update the mods themselves when Nexon patches the game, as that usually doesn\u0027t take too long, but features and fixes to the occasional curveball they throw at us are\u00a0at a standstill. Because\u00a0of having some new stuff halfway coded in when these things happen,\u00a0I am\u00a0blocked\u00a0from being able to release any fixes for stuff that Nexon breaks until the feature is complete.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It has come to my attention that this campaign\u00a0will be necessary to keep things running in the long term. So that\u0027s what this page is about, I\u0027d like to ask you to give me the means to continue adding new features and content to a program that has made Mabi playable for so many people who otherwise would not be able to because of lag or various rendering issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You guys have no idea all the cool features I\u0027ve designed in my head, but simply have no time to put in code...lol\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nFuture Endeavors\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even if this campaign fizzles out, I\u0027ll still continue my work, albeit at the pace dictated by my life circumstances. I want to give everyone a chance who has the means to support me to do so, whether it be financially, or even just a message of good will and appreciation for the project. Every bit helps, and a little bit goes a long way.\nI have many various other projects and ideas as well that are not directly Frontend related. Frontend will be top priority, but should the donations reach the goals, the Special Projects will start becoming available. Every bit of support adds up rather quickly, and is immensely appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFor Those In Doubt\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I realize that everyone has a right to choose how they spend their money, and I really appreciate any support you can give. Please keep in mind that in the unlikely event that\u00a0circumstances go horribly wrong, I will not hesitate to shut down the campaign. I will not\u00a0siphon\u00a0away\u00a0anyone\u0027s money like so many other\u00a0people would.\u00a0For those that are willing to donate, but are not sure if they can afford it, please be reasonable. I do not wish to burden anyone. If you donate, and then down the road need to cancel, that is perfectly acceptable.\nAlso, I know there are some unrealistic milestone goals set. These are a bit for comedic effect, but are also there just in case we do reach those levels. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would like to put up a video at some point to better explain things to those that are not part of the MabiMods community, but I felt that I needed to begin the campaign at this point because of my finances reaching a critical point. Also, based on feedback, suggestions, etc., some of the information in this page might be adjusted, so I apologize ahead of time if things get a bit confusing while we get everything optimized.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just the fact that\u00a0you\u0027re reading this shows a measure of interest, and I really appreciate your time and consideration to this campaign. If you have any comments or feedback on the specifics of the rewards or goals, feel free to let me know. All I ask is that you\u00a0be nice about it. I look forward to getting back on my feet and innovating new tools and technologies for the Mabinogi community once more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nLinks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMabiMods Forum: \n\u003ca href=\"https://mabimods.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://mabimods.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYoutube Channel: \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/MabiProffessor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/MabiProffessor\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMabinogi Game Page: \n\u003ca href=\"http://mabinogi.nexon.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://mabinogi.nexon.net/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
