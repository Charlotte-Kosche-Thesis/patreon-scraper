    "summary": "$500 per flash fiction story? Yeah, that\u0027s a huge goal, but why start small?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spent years trying to figure myself out creatively. Now I know I want to write. The next step is figuring out how to write successfully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was five, I doodled to my heart\u0027s content. I drew video game levels, imaginary monsters, and for some reason, lots and lots of giraffes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was ten, I discovered papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. I filled my whole room with gigantic sculptures of birds, trees, and mountains (with little trees!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was fifteen, I discovered oil painting. I created dozens of of lush landscapes--farmer fields, calm rivers, and ominous towers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was twenty, I gained a cult following around the world for my short, humorous, and downright strange stop-motion animations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was twenty-five, I started writing a novel. It\u0027s been a massive project and it\u0027s still in the works. It\u0027s been tough working on just one thing, so I\u0027ve expanded to short stories and flash fiction (even selling a few).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m twenty-seven now and I\u0027ve discovered that writing is my thing. There\u0027s nothing quite like spewing out absolutely anything I want onto a piece of paper. It comes alive! When I write, I go into a different world--any world of my choosing. I create magic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write all the time, nearly every day now. I just can\u0027t stop. There are countless ideas in my brain all pushing to get out. The only limit I\u0027ve found is that there\u0027s not enough time to write everything I want to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write at my little desk in my little apartment in mid-town Toronto. I don\u0027t even keep the lights on. The whole outside world disappears when the words spill out of my head and onto a computer screen. It\u0027s all I want to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come into play. I want to know that what I\u0027m writing is something you want to read. I want to know that I\u0027m writing for someone. I want to know that there\u0027s support behind my writing. I want to be a successful writer, so I\u0027m starting here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look at some of my work and see if you like it! Hopefully you\u0027ll help me create more! Thanks so much for your support :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Terry\u003cbr\u003e"
