    "summary": "I have been a treatment-free beekeeper since 2003.\u00a0 In those years I have gathered a lot of information and gained invaluable experience in how to keep bees treatment-free.\u00a0 Furthermore, I have seen how conventional beekeeping practices are damaging to the bee population and how new beekeepers are often pressured into keeping bees in conventional ways.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/groups/treatmentfreebeekeepers/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTreatment-Free Beekeepers Facebook Group\u003c/a\u003e is a project I started as a protected space for treatment-free beekeepers to gather and discuss methods for beekeeping as well as successes and failures, all within a space where they will never be criticized or berated for their choice not to dump pesticides into their hives. \u00a0It is the only such space on the internet that I am aware of, and has become wildly popular. \u00a0When I started it, I expected a couple hundred members who would have lots of fun but limited reach. \u00a0Now it has over 20,000 members and is the third largest beekeeping group on Facebook. \u00a0But because it is so large, it requires a lot of time and energy to maintain and moderate. \u00a0Your patronage will support the continued availability and high quality of this group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tfb.podbean.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTreatment-Free Beekeeping Podcast\u003c/a\u003e to help provide information for beekeepers who wish to keep bees in less artificial and medicated ways and to promote treatment-free beekeeping as the only sustainable way to keep the bees healthy and productive for the long term.\u00a0 Our pollinators support the production of so much of our food, it\u0027s important that we support their long term well-being. \u00a0On the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tfb.podbean.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTreatment-Free Beekeeping Podcast\u003c/a\u003e, I interview interesting beekeepers with experience in answering questions many new beekeepers have, and I interview new beekeepers with questions many have but might be too timid to ask.\u00a0 Many people have found the podcast a valuable resource in helping them understand hive dynamics, beekeeping practices, and the natural world.\u00a0 By becoming a patron, you are assuring that this flow of information continues to provide the help so many beekeepers need. \u00a0Your support will be used to pay for recording equipment, website and podcast file hosting, as well as costs to communicate with guests from around the world.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://forum.tfbees.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTreatment-Free Beekeeping Forum\u003c/a\u003e is provided for beekeepers who may not like Facebook or like the format and style of a web-based forum. \u00a0It continues to grow and needs watching and watering. \u00a0Your support will also pay for web hosting fees and high speed access for users.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://parkerbees.com\"\u003eMy website\u003c/a\u003e is something I\u0027ve put together to show people who are curious exactly how treatment free beekeeping can be done. \u00a0It includes many examples of how to build equipment, queen breeding tutorials, methods to follow, and opinions about what things one should do or avoid doing. \u00a0I also maintain a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://parkerbees.com/map.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emap of treatment free bee and equipment suppliers\u003c/a\u003e for the benefit of everyone looking for such things. \u00a0Your support will help with website hosting fees and the continuous updates that I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you so much for helping me promote treatment-free beekeeping which promotes the integral health and well being of honeybee populations which in turn bring so many benefits to the natural world that surrounds us. \u00a0Your support brings this information and education to the world on a continuing basis.\u003cbr\u003e"
