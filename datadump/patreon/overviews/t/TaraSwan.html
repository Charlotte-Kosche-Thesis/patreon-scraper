Within their body language, facial expressions, art pieces, and designs. \u00a0And because of this, I truly find portraiture and natural landscapes to be my life. \u00a0The people themselves and the nature around the inspirations for all my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can truly say that photography saved my life. \u00a0All through my adolescence when schools and educational systems began to take childhood and mold it into something society could work with, I was left out. \u00a0I was the student that was so different than most that I was the lone partner on a project, the last student to be called on a team, the sad kid that sat in a library behind a book. \u00a0So when in sophomore year, my classmates began answering the question what they wanted to be when they grew up, I was giving up. \u00a0I was letting go of hope because all I had to support me was the care my family and love the few close friends gave me. \u00a0And even they had no idea what I was to be when I got older; asking the same question that society had been wondering about ever since I walked into my school years. \u00a0Until art came into my life.\u003cbr\u003eWhen I entered the art school that picked me up out of the normal, I found a life I wanted and a spark was lit. \u00a0The chance to create and make and express the pain I had been holding for so god damn long. \u00a0Photography and design allowed me to create storylines in the details and the freedom to decide for ME.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, I still create and share pain. \u00a0But I am now free to express other emotions that well up inside me. \u00a0Awe, wonder, love, happiness, courage, strength, fear, anger, hurt, life...\u003cbr\u003eAll of it.\u003cbr\u003eAnd to share it with you..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Explore away -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTara Swan\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
