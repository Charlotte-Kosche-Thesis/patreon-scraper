    "summary": "America\nis a nation in crisis. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen\nI returned to the U.S. in 2010 after nearly 30 years abroad as a\ncorrespondent, I would not have said this. We seemed to be a nation\nin trouble then. Now our troubles have turned into crises. My focus\nis on two of the most urgent of these: Our conduct abroad is ever\nmore at odds with 21st\ncentury realities. Our press has abandoned its responsibilities and\nso abandoned us. Our leadership fails us in such matters: Our foreign\npolicy endangers and isolates us, and we are awash in mis\u2013 and\ndisinformation.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\nneed a new narrative, a new accounting of ourselves, a public\ndiscourse we can make sense of. This is the necessary basis for all\nof the new thinking we have to do and all the alternative policies we\nmust imagine and then realize. A lot of people seemed to realize this\nwhen I first came home eight years ago. Those then eager for \u201ca new\nstory\u201d now seem on the way to desperate for one. I count these the\nfirst post-exceptionalist Americans. It is not too soon to think in\nsuch terms. If we have a future worth working toward, it lies in\ntheir thinking. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\nshare their thinking. My task is to address a community in need of\naddress so that we can think together. All that I write is dedicated\nto this purpose. I bring to it three decades of living and working\nabroad and an understanding of the perspectives of others. I consider\nthis understanding essential 21st\ncentury equipment and apply it in every commentary I write. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis\nis the simplest explanation I have of what the work is all about. And\nI need your support to keep the work going. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\nstepped out of what we call \u201cmainstream media\u201d on my return to\nAmerica. It seemed the only useful alternative: Little that needs to\nget done will get done within the frame of corporate media. I\nunderstood the risks and took them. I assumed on the basis of what I\nsaw and heard that I would find a receptive readership that would\nhelp sustain the work. I have, and it is growing. I come to Patreon\nto find you and to ask that you join me and others who already have.\nWeekly columns of commentary, a blog, podcasts, teleconferences, and\nyour collaboration as the work progresses: These are what I offer\nyou. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eA\nfew years ago I published my fifth book, \u003cem\u003eTime\nNo Longer: Americans After the American Century\u003c/em\u003e.\nIn it I identified the problems we faced\u2014flinching from them is the\nvery worst step to take\u2014but expressed optimism that we can advance\nbeyond our predicaments providing we free ourselves from nostalgia, a\nnative insecurity, a presumption of innocence, and altogether an\nexceptionalist narrative that leaves us more isolated from others by\nthe day. I hold to this optimism\u2014even in the face of much contrary\nevidence, I now have to add. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eToo\nmany of my readers, colleagues, friends, and acquaintances are\ncapable of thinking anew for me to step back from this basic\nconviction. This nation was founded on the assumption that people are\ncapable of great change\u2014departures from what had been\u2014and it\nproved the point. Can we not prove this again? Can we not find new\nways of being and conducting ourselves, new policies and frameworks?\nCan we not restore our public discourse from the dilapidated state\nour press has let is lapse into? \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThere\nwould be no reason to write if I did not think so in each case. As I\nconcluded in a recent column, \u201cThe future, by definition, will take\nwhatever shape we in the present choose to give it. This we call\nhistory. The making of history is up to us.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePlease\njoin me and my first patrons with whatever contribution you can\nmanage. Patreon makes this easy. It will make other things easy, too.\nI want to work with readers, many of whom have ideas as good or\nbetter than mine. We can develop our thinking together as I share my\nwork while it progresses. I am now working on my sixth book. I will\nwelcome the input of those who support the project as it proceeds.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe\nwork itself is the best I can offer supporters. But I have structured\na rewards program to convey my thanks to committed patrons. You will\nfind these expressions of gratitude on the right-hand side of this\npage. I have tried to keep them simple.\u003cbr\u003e"
