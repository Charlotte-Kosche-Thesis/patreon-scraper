    "summary": "The Wake Up is an eduational/opinion based magazine that focuses on civil and social issues that occur around the country. The Wake Up\u0027s goal is to enlighten individuals to the happenings in our country concerning many issues such as police brutality, privilege, racism, voter suppression, substance abuse, among other important topics. \u003cbr\u003eWe serve as an alternative to mainstream media; our goal is to bring to light the subjects and topics that mainstream media purposely keeps under wraps, in order to keep its readers in the dark.\u003cbr\u003eThis magazine is a non profit magazine and has been solely paid for by myself. A lot goes into making a magazine and I would be nothing without all of my voluntary contributors, but printing a publication and shipping them costs a good bit of money. I can only do so much by myself as a single parent. With your financial help, I can create more issues at a faster and more consistent pace.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlease help me and let\u0027s make this magazine a big deal!"

     "about": "My name is Deanna Holbrook. I work as a special education paraprofessional with high school and middle school students that have autism. I\u0027m a single parent of three amazing little men.\u00a0For quite some time now, I have felt compelled to do something about the civil and social injustices that occur in our country. Especially lately, it seems these injustices occur more and more frequently, which has prompted me to take immediate action. Unfortunately, there is a bigger perspective that we, as a whole and as a society, need to obtain. It is time to open our eyes and wake up. That is the primary purpose of The Wake Up. I have been looking for a platform to commit myself to, so that I can make a difference in the world around me. No matter how big or small the difference may be, my goal is to bring attention to what is happening in the world around us and how we can make that world a better place for us and most importantly, our children. After all, they are our hope for the future, and as a parent myself, I know I would like to see my children grow up in a more positive societal environment.",
