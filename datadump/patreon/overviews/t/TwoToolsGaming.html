Firstly I want to say thank you for being on this website \u0026amp; even considering pressing the nice, friendly, shiny button over there that means you want to give us money. You are a dead-set \u003cem\u003eLegend\u003c/em\u003e \u0026amp; I ain\u0027t telling no Porky Pie\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly I want to say that there is absolutely no \u003cem\u003eexpectation\u003c/em\u003e of you pressing that button either. Every Let\u0027s Play we make for the foreseeable future is going up on that there YouTube for freebies, so lets dig in to what exactly this Patreon thingy is actually for, yeah?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo Tools Gaming currently consists of two average Blokes, Aj \u0026amp; Benny. By day they both work as Tradesmen in Australia. Also by day - just not the days they\u0027re doing the official paid, wage slave thingy - they play games badly \u0026amp; loudly. So they figured they may as well record it, edit it \u0026amp; bung it up on the internet, seeing as they were doing it anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe long \u0026amp; the short of it is this, we are currently doing this as a kind of hobby. We do see the potential for this to become more than that, but to do so we need your support. Anybody who becomes our Patron, no matter how small the pledge, is telling us that they want to see us do more of this kind of thing, that they want to see our skills grow \u0026amp; just that they like what we are doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo Thanks again Legend, we\u0027ll see you in the next Episode.\u003cbr\u003e"
