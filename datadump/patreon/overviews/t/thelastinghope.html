We have some really big plans for the future and we are asking you to be a part of it all. This site is going to give you access to exclusive TLH content that no one else will get to see.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis site works like a monthly subscription service. You can offer to donate the amount of your choosing per month in exchange for exclusive content and music that will only be released through this page. We will be doing weekly video updates on this site to keep all of you posted on what we are up to. We look at this service as a chance for our fans to take the place of our label.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe old music model looks something like this: get signed, get a giant loan from a label, make an album, tour the album, never make enough to pay your label back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this new model, our fans can decide when we make music. You may not realize this, but we have nearly 30 songs in the demo process that we have no problem releasing to our most dedicated and trusted fans. We plan on letting you all vote on which song we should bring to Nashville to fully produce. This support system will enable us to fully focus on creating art in a way to reach people in different ways for Christ. We are very excited to start this journey and we hope that you are with us!"

The band is uniquely formed by four young and very talented men: Logan Oakes on lead vocals and guitar, Craig Banister on guitar and vocals, Tanner Marling on bass, and Braxton Comer on drums. These men have been traveling the country since 2010 sharing the hope that is found in Jesus Christ. They have had the privilege to share the stage with artists: TobyMac, Mandisa, MercyMe, Sanctus Real, 7eventh Time Down, Ryan Stevenson, Carrollton, Jason Gray, Disciple, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, and Manic Drive, among others.",
