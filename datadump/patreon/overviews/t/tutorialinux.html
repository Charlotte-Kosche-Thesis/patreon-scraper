    "summary": "Hey! I\u0027ve spent the last few years creating free video courses and tutorials on subjects like Linux and Unix System Administration, Web Services, Programming/Scripting/Automation, and Security. With your support, I can spend a lot more time creating great content and putting it out there so others can learn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo accomplish that, I\u0027m focusing on creating courses that take you through\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003epractical, hands-on tech projects\u003c/strong\u003e. These courses teach you the \u003cem\u003etheory \u003c/em\u003eyou need to understand, and then help you turn that knowledge into \u003cem\u003epractical skills\u003c/em\u003e immediately, with projects that are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFun to work through\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInherently useful\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSomething you can talk about in tech interviews\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...as a side benefit, I\u0027m making sure that these courses explain the \u003cem\u003etheoretical knowledge\u003c/em\u003e that you need to become a professional, along with instilling \u003cem\u003eproper sysadmin habits and mindsets\u003c/em\u003e, *\u003cstrong\u003ein a way that is not horrifically boring\u003c/strong\u003e* (!!!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I doing all this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI first began making these tutorial videos to help a friend get started with System Administration. He\u0027s the kind of person who doesn\u0027t learn well from dry, theoretical books and manuals, so having everything explained in video format got him learning very quickly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce my friend got his first sysadmin job, I realized that *\u003cstrong\u003eway\u003c/strong\u003e* more people than I\u0027d expected had found the videos useful. I also enjoyed teaching more than I thought I would -- so I\u0027ve kept going!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most important point is this: You can enjoy a really satisfying career as a sysadmin or developer, \u003cstrong\u003eeven if you\u0027re starting later in life, or you don\u0027t have a college degree\u003c/strong\u003e. Take me, for example -- I\u00a0started out working as a landscaper. Tech is not as scary (or as complicated) as some people make it sound; if you have interest and motivation, you can learn the basics fairly quickly and get yourself into an extremely fun, challenging, and profitable career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to help as many people as possible to do exactly that.\u003cbr\u003e"
