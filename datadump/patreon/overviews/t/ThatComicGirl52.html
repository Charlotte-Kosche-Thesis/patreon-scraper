As I\u0027m sure many of you have noticed, I have not been updating my story as often as I wish to. Between trying to work out my financial struggles and dealing with my own personal health issues, I haven\u0027t had much time to write. I would love to spend more time writing, and I believe having a patreon will help make that wish come true.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support my fanfiction through this venue, then great! Thank you so much! You are amazing, and have my eternal gratitude. If you don\u0027t, then that\u0027s fine too. I completely understand. But if you do choose not to, then you will also be missing out on some great rewards. So before you decide, take a moment to check out some of my awesome rewards. Again, thank you a bunch, and I hope you continue to enjoy my fic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
