This here is my PATREON page. Now that might sound big and scary or mean nothing to you but this short description should clear a few things up. Patreon is a platform for fans to make monthly donations in support of their favourite creators. It helps these creators invest in their work and ultimately improve it for the better - making the content more enjoyable and reach a broader goal. For me, that goal is making documentary series and growing TYF into something bigger and better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 63, 63);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003eFAQs\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 63, 63);\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 63, 63);\"\u003e\u003cu\u003eWho is The Young Filmmaker?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThe man behind the lens is me, Luther Clayton. I created TYF when I was just 12 years old, creating short films and videos of my adventures in nature. Over the period of 3 years, it has grown into a community of positive and adventurous people from all over the world, willing to learn and try new things. I now reach over 17,000 people - it is just incredible! \u003cbr\u003eNow, I publish content promoting creativity and curiosity that people can apply to their everyday lives. TYF is not about me, it\u0027s for the benefit of my viewers. I want to teach people worldwide things that they would otherwise not know about. And video is a powerful way to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this Patreon\u00a0Platform serve me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eAs well as helping me to build my business, create more content and develop a stronger community, this page offers you rewards in return for your generous donations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThey can be seen to the right of this post if you are interested.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhere does my donation go?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eSo with creating things and building a business, there are obvious expenses that need to be covered. But firstly I would like to inform you that \u003cstrong\u003eevery donation goes back into TYF in some shape or form\u003c/strong\u003e. Whether it is a direct investment in camera equipment (batteries, storage space, cameras), travel expenses when on trips away, costs for building websites etc. or donations that are placed into saving for when I need them in the future, the pledge is always put back into TYF and the business.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA large sum of all the donations as a whole usually goes into the production of one of my documentary series known as \"\u003cstrong\u003eThe\u00a0Adventure Diaries\u003c/strong\u003e\". A series is roughly made every year - the first one was a great success and is available to watch FOR FREE here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.theyoungfilmmaker.com/filmmaking\"\u003ehttps://www.theyoungfilmmaker.com/filmmaking\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more and more I make these documentaries, the more I learn. And your donations are a huge part of making it possible and helping me develop myself as a filmmaker. Travel costs a lot guys. And so does camera mishaps/storage space! If you want to learn more about the Adventure Diary series, there is a page on my website here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.theyoungfilmmaker.com/filmmaking\"\u003ehttps://www.theyoungfilmmaker.com/filmmaking\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eLastly, whenever I have anything I want to discuss, I\u0027ll turn to you, the Patrons for your input. You are the ones that believe my content is worth something and you are the ones investing your time into them. If I have ideas or topics that I want to discuss, you\u0027\u0027ll be the ones that can help to bring them to fruition :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay Humble, Stay positive and Go \u003cstrong\u003ebecome a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
