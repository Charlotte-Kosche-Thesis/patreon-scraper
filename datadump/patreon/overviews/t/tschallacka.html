So for every year I reach this goal I will make the partron requested mod you ask for ;-)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy this insane high amount you ask? Well 42% would be taxes and then dividing the remainder over 12 months and converting to euro\u0027s would mean\u00a0 i\u0027d have 1700 ish euro\u0027s for spending money which isn\u0027t that much because fixed costs for housing and food and kids and gas,water electricty is total roughly 1600 a month. I still wouldn\u0027t be able to afford a car, but that is okay ;-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf everyone who uses my mods would donate 1-10 dollars a month we could get to this amount fairly fast though, and I\u0027d be able to provide you heaps of great content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil that glorious day that I can \"Live to create content for you\" I\u0027ll be happy to provide what I can do in the very sparse time after my day job.\u003cbr\u003e",
