    "summary": "Thanks to my family and late mother and father I am living a dream of riding in New Zealand. My content and idea are based on a walk on a beach in Port Dover some 20 years ago. I was walking with my then girlfriend Lasha and she was explaining the Butterfly Effect to me. I am a deep thinker, always have been, and as she was explaining the marvels of cause and effect I looked down and saw a plastic ring from a drink bottle. As I reached down to pick it up I said \"have you ever heard of the elephant effect?\" Her eyes widened to the new terminology, (that I just made up) and said \"No, whats the elephant effect?\"\u003cbr\u003eI replied, \"Its when a duck walks up to this plastic ring and puts its head through it and strangles itself\" you know the rest.\u003cbr\u003eWe have a responsibility to keep this rubbish contained. Ever since then I have been riding around picking up peoples garbage.\u003cbr\u003eNow that Im here in New Zealand riding around on my fat bike I thought that I could create some content cleaning up as I went along. I may save the odd duck hear and there. I do not expect anything in return, though it would help go toward bike maintenance. If people are going to throw it out I\u0027ll pick it up."

     "about": "Im currently here in Wellington New Zealand. I am creating videos that address a colossal problem that is getting exponentially \u00a0worse! My word what can we do! We could keep talking about it or we can do something about it. I\u0027m riding around on my electric fat bike and can not believe how much garbage is lying around. Plastic, glass, aluminum. I am addressing this problem in reverse and I hope my actions illustrate that this is the only way to change the mindset of young people to one day finally make it second nature to refuse single use plastic, refrain from littering, and to pick up rubbish that has inadvertently entered the landscape. You can help by making a small donation per creation, telling a friend about my project, sharing my sites on social media, and picking up a plastic bottle each day. I\u0027m sure you can find one. Thanks Joseph",
