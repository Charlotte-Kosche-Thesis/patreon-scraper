    "summary": "Hi there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Andrew Hitz and I am the host of The Entrepreneurial Musician, a weekly podcast\u00a0that explores the tools needed to succeed as an entrepreneur in today\u0027s music business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been asked by some listeners how they can best support the show and as a result I have set up this Patreon page. There are a number of ongoing costs associated with making the podcast including hosting, website fees/maintenance, producing, marketing and equipment upgrades as the show grows.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are a fan of TEM and feel like helping this one-man operation keep things going, it sure would be helpful. TEM is a labor of love and I\u0027m happy to spend the hours I do every week putting the show together. But if you feel like you get a lot of value out of the show and would like to return the favor with a small, ongoing donation, it would mean an awful lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donation will also help enable me to spend more time improving the podcast as well as increase my marketing budget, therefor reaching a larger audience and empowering more musicians with the skills needed to get their art noticed in today\u0027s unbelievably crowded marketplace. (All of the stuff that none of us was taught in school!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, thank you for taking the time to read this and \u003cstrong\u003ethank you for listening\u003c/strong\u003e. As I try to say regularly on the show, our time and attention are the most precious gifts we can give anyone, so for that I am filled with gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndrew Hitz\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.andrewhitz.com/tem\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.andrewhitz.com/tem\u003c/a\u003e"
