This comic is her pride and joy and has been in the making for the past thirteen years. Every aspect of the comic is completed individually by Jac - research, design, storyboarding, writing, inking, colour, and publication. The story is set in modern times, tying in with historical events from\n cultures around the world, with much added imagination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA 13-page \"Issue Zero\" teaser is complete and will be released digitally on June 22nd, 2018, exclusively to Patreon backers. For those interested in sketches and concept art, a behind-the-scenes art book will be released at the same time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting this campaign will fund the creation and publication of Volume One, an eighty-page tome telling the first arc of The Elements. Our goal is to release it in December of 2018. Funding will allow Jac to take fewer commissions, and therefore free up more time, and provide funding for up-front self-publication costs. This comic is truly a labour of love and we hope that you enjoy it. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e~*~*~*~*~*~*~\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story focuses on the eight elemental powers - human vessels empowered by the elemental gods of Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Power, Thunder, Light, and Dark. These vessels were created by the gods to fight the oncoming war against Heaven and Earth, Order and Chaos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDemons have risen against the gods to wipe out humanity. Lead by a follower of Chaos, they vow to snuff out humanity for good. The Gods (Order) have appointed elemental vessels to protect humanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCerridwen, the elemental vessel of Fire, takes the main lead in this story. Fire is an impulsive and dangerous element that can smolder and suddenly burst; fire can also bring courage, compassion, and protection. This complexity is true to the character of Cerridwen - she can be obstinate and heady, and absolutely not subtle. Fire is seen as the force burning inside us, giving us iron willpower to fight for our goals, empowering us the determination to do it with all of our self, resulting in honor and dignity without backstabbing and cowardice. However, fire cannot always be controlled, as Cerridwen knows. Her focus is solely on her mission, no matter what the consequences would be...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/n6qQPS/preview.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
