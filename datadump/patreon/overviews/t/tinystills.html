    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Kailynn. I\u0027m the front lady of Tiny Stills. I play many instruments, write songs, and make videos and I want to make awesome stuff for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLets get real for a second- Everything in internetland is free, right? Your favorite band\u0027s music? Free. Your favorite TV show? Free. My music? Definitely free. Its really easy to enjoy great things for no cost, but that doesn\u0027t decrease the value of the art we consume, which is where Patreon comes in (cue superhero-esque entrance music)... Patreon is an amazing website that allows content creators like me (musician) to continue making art (music) with the support of awesome people like you who value it and want me to continue putting songs in your ears.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW IT WORKS:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon account is set up on \u003cstrong\u003ea per creation basis\u003c/strong\u003e. That means you\u0027ll only be charged when I release content, AND you can set a maximum amount you\u0027d like to donate per month. You\u0027ll never get charged more than you want, AND you\u0027ll still get access to all the cool stuff I\u0027m going to make. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon works like a continuous Kickstarter campaign. It allows me to put more time and energy into every project that I make whether that involves getting props or new instruments to make cool videos and sometimes it\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ebuys me some time to write a new song for you\u003c/strong\u003e. Every little bit helps when it comes to being able to make music and I wouldn\u0027t be able to do what I do without your loyalty and support! I\u0027m so incredibly thankful to be able to make music for a living, and in this day in age I wouldn\u0027t be able to do that without platforms like Kickstarter and Patreon. So please, if you like what I do, please show your support by donating to my Patreon!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Kind of Creation are you making?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI make lots of things! I can make a video (see: youtube) for an original song, or a cover song. I could make an acoustic video. I could make a lyric sheet and send it to your inbox! (see: my handmade lyric booklet) I could do a collaboration with a friend. I just want to be writing and making music and I want to make it cool fun and personal! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a per creation basis? Whats stopping you from doing a MILLION projects a month? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know there will be some months that I won\u0027t be able to make content for Patreon and others where I will (knock on wood) have time and energies and the ability to make more than one rad video or song for you guys! I would LOVE to do a million projects a month- but that won\u0027t happen. Also, you can set a cap per month so you\u0027re never giving me more than what you\u0027d like to. Also, its possible some months I won\u0027t even get to make creations for you because I will be on tour or recording or writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what exactly am I paying for? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the tier you select, you\u0027re going to get access to those particular rewards. If you max out for that month, you\u0027ll still get all the things I\u0027ll release, so DON\u0027T WORRY! Just pick something that you like and you want to see more of from me and we can go from there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan I change how much I give you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes. Anytime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have more questions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThats cool! Its not a question but\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e@tinystills me on the twitter machine and lets figure it out!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
