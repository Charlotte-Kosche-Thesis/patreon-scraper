    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m a multi-media artist, working with both digital and traditional art, and have for years been chipping away at multiple personal projects. My hope with restarting this Patreon is to put more emphasis on completing some of these projects, which include but are not limited to several comic projects and pixel games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tend to create things with a slice-of-life feel that is mixed with heavier fantasy. Magical creatures and stories about empathy and connecting relationships.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I\u0027m in a more settled situation, I can focus much more on actually accomplishing these goals and hopefully providing more entertaining media to people. I will be sharing my progress as it is made and patrons will get to have some behind-the-scenes involvement as I get closer to finishing what I have drafted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLive art streams, early demo versions of the mini-games, and aggregate sketch journals are all things I hope to share with you on top of the stories I\u0027ll be making. So, here\u0027s to a better year of art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eLivestreams will be held on Saturdays at 4pm Pacific time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0[\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/TratserDrawsThings\"\u003ehere is the channel!\u003c/a\u003e]\u003cbr\u003e- Current projects are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- Moondrops Pixel Game\u003cbr\u003e- Open for Interpretation Comic [long term goal]\u003cbr\u003e- Pursuant Ferine rpg [long term goal]\u003cbr\u003e- Mini webcomics [some original, some fan content]\u003c/div\u003e"
