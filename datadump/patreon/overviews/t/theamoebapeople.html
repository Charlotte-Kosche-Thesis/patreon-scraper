    "summary": "Help us Make THE FOSSIL RECORD! (And awesome science music videos to accompany it!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur quirky science songs and videos have been used in science classrooms around the world, from elementary school classes all the way up through college graduate courses. We\u0027ve performed for PBS\u0027s TED Talks: Education Revolution, we\u0027ve played at the largest gathering of scientists in the country (the ACS national conference), and have been featured in EOS, the official magazine of the American Geophysical Union. Our songs and videos have been played at events hosted by The Planetary Society, The National Science Teachers Association, and even the Lyme Regis Fossil Festival in England. On top of all that, we\u0027re the official house band of the Columbia Memorial Space Center, the only post of its kind in the country.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we don\u0027t have the backing of a record label or a production company, which means we pay for everything ourselves. Our new album, without a doubt our best yet, is going to cost a decent chunk of change to do right. We not only want to get this album out there in more places than ever before, we also want to make amazing videos to go along with songs like \"Girl Talk\" about Marie Tharpe and the discovery of the rift valley at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean, \"Rocking the Mesozoic,\" our epic dinosaur tune, plus \"Volcano!\", \"Let\u0027s Glaciate\" and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe really feel this album will help propel us to our ultimate goal: to create a musical science tv show. Imagine \"The Monkeys\" meets \"Cosmos.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d also like to use Patreon to help gauge interest in things like which video we should shoot next. We get emails all the time from working scientists, graduate students and teachers asking us to write songs about a variety of scientific topics. The amount of songs and ideas we have in the works is plentiful, but if people show their interest based on what they would like to fund, that can help guide decisions about which videos to shoot next and which songs to record.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo help us make the greatest science album of all time! The Fossil Record!!! Thanks so much for considering us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnward!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
