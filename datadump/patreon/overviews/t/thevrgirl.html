    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eFirst off, I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you soooooooo much for taking the time to visit my Patreon page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Hi! My name is Laura Hall. Two\u00a0years ago I started the Virtual Reality Girl and started promoting virtual reality (VR). I did not think this would be a permanent thing, it kind of just happened. I think that the creators, developers and everyone that is working so hard on this emerging technology are the true rock stars, and my mission is to introduce the world to their awesomeness. Virtual reality  faces many issues on its path to mass adoption. Industry professionals know the doors that can and will be opened with this technology,   but what about everyone else? When I try to explain to someone outside of the industry what VR is they don\u0027t get it. They never do until I get them in a headset. The reaction of someone trying VR for the first time is priceless. This is what I see from their reaction: I see all the hard work and effort paying off that the developers put into creating the content that is being viewed. I see someone walking away with a good experience,  I see them telling a friend and sharing that with them. This has become my life. I invest so much time into this. What I am doing is economically, well, stupid. So I make my living doing freelance jobs while doing as many interviews, and popups as possible. My dream is to introduce as many people as I can to virtual reality full time and being a part of VR going mainstream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me here you are not only making my life way less stressful but you actually help me cover more ground and I am able to share VR with more people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I am \u00a0doing and consider buying some stranger over the internet the equivalent of a coffee, I would very much appreciate it. If 1% of my followers would do this, I could do this full time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of my financial situation I will continue doing this whatever happens.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is about frequency and quality. The more you support us the more I am able to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I can promise you is that I\u00a0will do the best I can and invest as much time and love into this as possible without being irresponsible. Thank you for your ongoing support, it really is a huge deal for\u003cbr\u003eme and I very much appreciate it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat i will do with your money: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently I have three jobs: The Virtual Reality Girl, being a mother and my \"real\" freelance jobs. By supporting me on Patreon you give me the opportunity to take less freelance jobs and focus more on helping this industry going mainstream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can invest more time in the videos, \u00a0blog content, interviews, Pop-Up theaters, Pop-Up gaming, and The Virtual Reality Girl.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut in order to devote the necessary time to this work\u2014and to expand the range of what I can do in this medium\u2014this must become a reliable source of income. Now, you can sponsor The Virtual Reality Girl directly through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for all your support! I appreciate it more than you can imagine and it really helps us out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I get 100 Patreons I will focus more on building my brand on Patreon. You can find my work here Facebook.com/vrspaces!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBe sure to follow me on Facebook! I do a lot of giveaways and you don\u0027t want to miss your chance to win some amazing prizes!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
