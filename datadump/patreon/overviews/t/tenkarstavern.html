In that time, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Tavern\u003c/strong\u003e has become more than just a blog, it\u0027s become a thriving community and a news hub of sorts for events in the OSR corner of the gaming universe. Oh, and of course a place to find the latest gaming related \u003cstrong\u003eKickstarters\u003c/strong\u003e - the good, the bad and the downright ugly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ATp7_IiVegw/VOS8lh_9g1I/AAAAAAAAYHM/V5Hnf6AEdgs/s490/tenkarstavern.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe secret to the moderate success of \u003cstrong\u003eThe Tavern\u003c/strong\u003e is its community. It\u0027s that community that drove me to organize \u003cstrong\u003eAppreciation Days\u003c/strong\u003e for \u003cstrong\u003eBasic Fantasy Roleplaying\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eSwords \u0026amp; Wizardry\u003c/strong\u003e back in 2013 (with the S\u0026amp;W Appreciation Day having over 130 participating blogs) as well as \u003cstrong\u003eThe 12 Days of OSR Christmas\u003c/strong\u003e in 2013 and 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a lot that I\u0027d like to accomplish at \u003cstrong\u003eThe Tavern\u003c/strong\u003e for its community, but much of it is time intensive. As it is, I average 2 1/2 posts a day and 10 to 15 hours a week preparing those posts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Tavern\u003c/strong\u003e will always be a free blog and the community will always be open to all.\u00a0To accomplish things like new gaming content, videos and online gaming conventions more time and resources will be necessary. This is where you come in. A pledge of $1.50 a month will put us well on course to accomplish these goals.\u003cbr\u003e"
