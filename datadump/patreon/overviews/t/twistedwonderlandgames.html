I\u0027ve also spent time as a tabletop game developer and editor. I specialize in narration based \ngames, primarily visual novels. Expect both weird and feels type games from\n me. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour patronage will help me supplement time off from my day job to be able to work on my games. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons will get access to my games before I release them, as well as text \u0026amp; photo updates. Once my games are released, you can play them on itch.io \n\u003ca href=\"http://athenahollow.itch.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://athenahollow.itch.io/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe next big game I\u0027m working on is based on coping with the harsh realities of someone in your care being diagnosed with a terminal illness. While I work on that, I plan on doing smaller games to help mitigate the mental health toll of a game of this subject matter.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne of those smaller games is in progress right now: Apugalypse. You\u0027ll play Sushi the Pug in New York City. Suddenly giant mech show up and start tearing the city apart. As Sushi realizes what is going on, she tries to figure out the best way to help. You choose which people to help and how, and that determines how effective those people are at stopping the mech. Expect as much weird \u0026amp; silly as my first game, Betrothed, along with multiple endings. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have released my first game already. It is a visual novel called \n\"Betrothed\" that is about a woman whose parents sold her to the devil in\n order to pay off her school debt. \n\u003ca href=\"http://athenahollow.itch.io/betrothed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can play it for free on itch.io\u003c/a\u003e, and if you enjoy it, please share it and/or donate.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
