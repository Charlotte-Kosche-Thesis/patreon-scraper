We want to bring something special to the podcast airwaves, and create a safe space for questions, issues and topics of a problematic nature. We want to help bring some knowledge to some people who might not feel brave enough to ask the questions that plague them. We think we\u0027re going to have a good time while we\u0027re at it, too, because we\u0027re going to bring a whole lot of Real Housewives, Southern Charm and other programming that brings these societal issues right to the forfront - and right under our noses the whole time!\u00a0",
