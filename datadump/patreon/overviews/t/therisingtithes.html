My name is Brandon O\u0027Brien. I am a spoken word poet, writer, and writing facilitator from Trinidad and Tobago. I really love writing, and I\u0027ve been wanting to share some of that work exclusively online in a serial format and hopefully give people stories which keep them engaged and entertained throughout their run.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eI\u0027ve wanted to write a long serial story on my blog for quite some time, but eventually it becomes hard to keep it up while also not making a steady income. I would also want this project to be sustainable in its own and be able to pay for itself; when my other work allows me to eat a little while the other is not even being noticed, it gets hard to motivate yourself to continue.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eIn the old days, poets and playwrights had wealthy benefactors who would finance their artistic work so they could say that they were the ones whose finances empowered the greats to make legendary work, some of which stands the test of time to this day. Nowadays, it\u0027s easier for the man on the street to make that same investment in artists they have faith in - to say that they support art that they think can change the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eI want to make the kind of work you can have such faith in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhich is what I plan on doing, starting \u003cem\u003esoon\u003c/em\u003e. (Other obligations, and difficulties setting up my Patreon which I still haven\u0027t fully solved, have made me push this back more times than I would like, but I don\u0027t plan on taking much longer than \u003cstrong\u003eQ1 2017\u003c/strong\u003e, at which point the entire content of at least two serials will already be complete.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to make something that is not only good and keeps people\u0027s attention, or proves that serial short stories on the internet are things that people can enjoy, but tries really hard to put more diverse characters that readers can enjoy and be proud of online for people to find and share. I want to make characters that other people say are inspiring/cool/funny/badass and pass around to their friends as examples of diverse characters done right in stories. (I want to at least have a fan base that has no problem calling me out if I ever do that wrong.) I want to tell stories that are fun and engaging while also being critical, inspiring, and powerful. I want to make something meaningful and fun, and show that all that can happen with words in the digital space.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd that will be this. \u003cdel\u003eIt\u0027s supposed to have a name, and when I figure it out, I\u0027ll tell you\u003c/del\u003e. \u003cdel\u003eI think I have one.\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0I do have one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s \u003cem\u003eThe Panoptic Channel\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want a sample of my first serial, \u003cem\u003eThe Swan and The Snake\u003c/em\u003e, you can read Season One\u0027s prologue and the first chapter\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thepanopticchannel.atavist.com/the-swan-and-the-snake\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to support me in that attempt, please be willing to give a little to keep the project alive and even help it grow into something bigger as time goes by. But also be willing to \u003cstrong\u003eshare your attention\u003c/strong\u003e most of all - what the project will want more than anything is for you all to \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eread it, comment, like, and share\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, so more people can see what it\u0027s all about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eThe transmission will be open on this \u003cem\u003epanoptic channel\u003c/em\u003e soon\u003c/span\u003e.

Why give you \u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e money?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nMy only answer is because this is what I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to compel you with any sob story, although truth be told writing is what I am doing to sustain myself right now. Mostly because it is what I want to do with the rest of my life, and I want to be able to provide some of the myriad things I have in mind for people to see whenever they want. Plus, I want that to be the source of income that fuels me while also attempting to get a novel and a collection of poetry published through the usual mainstream channels; and if I\u0027m being honest, I want to get out of a less-than-ideal living situation as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I want to do what I love as recompense. I want to give people something, and be busy doing so all the time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI imagine a few people may think that\u0027s not worth it. If they want free work, they could read fanfic (and you \u003cem\u003etotally \u003c/em\u003eshould). And if I wanted to eat and write at the same time, I should \u0027get a day job, hippie/millennial/whatever-other-euphemism-people-use-these-days!\u0027.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut when I first decided to try moving to Patreon, I just wanted to be empowered to give people some neat stories in a format I really enjoy. To work hard at building a series of worlds people would like coming back to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to make oodles of money - in fact, I\u0027d also want some of this money to be used paying other creators on collaborative projects. Most of my money will probably be invested into trying to upgrade my living situation, and even then I\u0027d want it to be reasonable and transparent, and I\u0027d want to be sure about making that leap in the first place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI just want to give you guys the gift of these stories, and to be able to keep giving it as long as I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to receive that gift, I\u0027d appreciate it."

     "description": "I have a lot of series I want to work on here, and my initial plan was to give them in arcs - like television seasons - cutting off at the height of one to introduce you to a new world with new characters, conflicts, and stakes. That way, I get a chance to develop multiple projects while keeping their processes fresh enough to do newer, cooler stuff, and you get something new and cool to read to cleanse your palate before coming back to the other stories you love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow I imagined this working was that you\u0027d get one series at a time. Close one season of one show, open with another season of something new. But I would love to give you as much as possible as often as possible, if you\u0027re up for it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we meet this goal, I\u0027ll fire up a second serial as soon as possible for your consumption. That means two \u0027episodes\u0027 a fortnight, one of each (or adversely, one episode a week of alternating serials). That means that when their seasons close, they will get replaced with two new stories. That means increasing the amount of work I can get to you.",

A portion of it will go directly to paying for a creative collaborator on one of the project\u0027s series or seasons. Maybe a serial gets to turn into a webcomic now, thanks to the help of a seasoned artist? Or I get to crank out a new series co-authored with a talented fellow writer? I\u0027d love to see what can come of this with your help, and I\u0027d love even more to be able to pay that person directly for their involvement as a result.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first project I want to work on like this is actually a fiction podcast, so for the sake of transparency while a lot of this will go into getting equipment, I also want to be able to pay for voice actors.",
