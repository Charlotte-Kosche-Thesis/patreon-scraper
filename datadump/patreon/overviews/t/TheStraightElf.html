    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m the Straight Elf and you can find my profile where I\u0027ve posted most of my work at \u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2850031/The-Straight-Elf.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.fanfiction.net/u/2850031/The-Straight-Elf.\u003c/a\u003e I\u0027m a writer in my free time, though real life likes to get in the way of that. To date I\u0027ve written several stories and posted them on fanfiction.net and my most successful (and favorite) story is Traveler for the Pokemon archive with over 4,000 reviews and nearly a million words! It\u0027s honestly the thing in my life I\u0027m most proud of and I love expanding it even further. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest I mostly made this page on the recommendation of several friends I\u0027ve made over the years I\u0027ve been on Fanfiction. I\u0027ve had some minor troubles with my finances (just part of being a broke college student) and they figured giving any of my fans the chance to donate if they wished might help me out there and give me more time to devote to writing! You aren\u0027t supporting any one story of mine or anything like that, you\u0027re supporting me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing I\u0027d like to clarify is that I\u0027ll never withhold updates or anything like that if I don\u0027t receive donations! I love writing Traveler and doing something like that would be against everything I believe in as a writer (plus that would be incredibly illegal). I do this because I enjoy it, not because I want money. Any donations I receive are incredibly appreciated but I never want anyone to feel like they have to donate! If you want to support me as a writer and have the means to do so then I really appreciate it! And if not then I still encourage your support of my work - I wouldn\u0027t be the person I am today without all of your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for getting through my rambling and thanks for supporting me! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: For people who aren\u0027t familiar with Patreon, it isn\u0027t like Kickstarter where you just donate once off. With Patreon it\u0027s basically a subscription with smaller recurring sums. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9/14/2017: I\u0027m not dead! The ball is rolling on Traveler and I can\u0027t wait to keep writing!\u003cbr\u003e"
