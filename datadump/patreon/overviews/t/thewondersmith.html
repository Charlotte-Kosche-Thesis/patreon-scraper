I do experience-based events all over the Pacific Northwest and share them through the medium of surprise - you never know where I will pop up next! Sometimes I hide my invitations in the woods to be discovered by lucky hikers, sometimes I tuck them into books for people looking for answers, sometimes I have a niche community of people apply to attend... and each time, the event is completely free to them (It is important to me that the events are a gift.) I crowd-fund through patreon to raise funds for the cost of doing these curiosity-fueled experiences full of wild flavor, hand-crafted art, and carefully curated ceremony. I also share everyday magic through my blog, thewondersmith.com/blog.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI use this page to fund the costs of my events. Your contribution helps me share the magic!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eAs a patron, you get to be part of that process of wonder. See the rewards to the right side of this page and pick the perfect one to fit your budget and your tastes!\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eProcess: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nEach of my events starts with the question of what I want the event to be about; child-like wonder and surprise? Ultimate relaxation? Excited discovery? Using that as a springboard, I design the events to be immersive, part installation and part dinner party. Sometimes I build the environments myself and sometimes I hold the event somewhere unique (like in the back of a brewery or in the burned woods.) I hope to showcase the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest so I forage my ingredients, prepare the food myself, create the dishes to hold the food, and design a ceremony (not tied to any religion or spirituality; I want everyone to be welcome) to give more meaning to the event.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePurpose:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nSo what is the purpose of these events, exactly? To introduce more wonder into the world. It\u0027s my goal to allow adults the opportunity to flirt with the edges of their comfort zone and relax their grown-up inhibitions; for their eyes to light up with play or fill up with relief. \u00a0I carefully design multi-sensory experiences - often with components of food or drink as part of the ceremony. Each event follows a structure inspired by a narrative: guests are called to adventure through discovered invitations; cross a threshold into a new realm when they arrive; and, through storytelling, ritual, and sensory design, are taken on a journey they won\u0027t soon forget. I hope to leave each person who attends one of these events with a profound and memorable experience.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0Help me bring a little more wonder into this world.
