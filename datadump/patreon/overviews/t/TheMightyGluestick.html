    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page, thank you so much for stopping by and considering to support The Mighty Gluestick channel. I have over one hundred and thirty monster ecology videos currently uploaded, and release at least one video per week, most of which will be 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons monster ecology episodes, or Monsterology episodes where I discuss specific types of monsters or special environments. I have started a new, mid week video upload on a new playlist titled Mighty Gluestick Explores, where I will concentrate more on specific locations than on the creatures that live there, taking viewers on a journey of discovery as I convey information sourced from publications and verified articles on the internet. The channel has grown a lot over the last year, and it is a very rewarding experience, considering three years of effort have gone into this catalog of information, freely available to everyone, however, I simply could not do this without you.\u003cbr\u003eI have invested in getting better equipment over the time I have been making videos for Youtube, and am always looking at ways to up skill and improve, to better suit what my subscribers want to see. I try to respond to as many comments on my videos as I can, particularly questions people have about monsters and locations. Currently, my computer is fairly old, it is running Windows Vista and I could do with an upgrade, but otherwise, I don\u0027t need a lot to make the videos as they are now. Further funding would go toward better graphics and unique music on the episodes, some professional editing software and such. Mainly, your support would just make me extremely happy and humbled that I could bring something to you that you gain such enjoyment out of, or provides some inspiration for your games."
