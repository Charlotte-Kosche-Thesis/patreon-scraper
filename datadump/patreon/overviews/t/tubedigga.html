     "about": "I am a professionally trained sound designer, music producer and voice over artist. I studied sound art and design at a top London university and obtained a First Class qualification in the subject. I have worked on many high profile advertising campaigns, either as a sound designer, music producer or a voice over artist. I worked for 8 years at a major console games company but left shortly before my daughter was born so i could spend more time with her in her early years, and to break free from the rat-race and focus on my creative passions. I started my Tubedigga channel in late October 2017 so I could share my technical and creative skills with the world.",
