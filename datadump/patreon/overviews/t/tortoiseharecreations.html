    "summary": "What is Patreon? It\u0027s essentially a tip jar for creative types that does two things: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. It allows you access to extra stuff in my patron-only stream - and I do mean extra stuff, stuff that I can\u0027t or don\u0027t share elsewhere. Art that Facebook deprioritizes or blocks? Fine by Patreon. Raw .psd files that I have never shared? No problem. High-resolution downloads of art, access to stock art, access to the polls that guide my next projects, exclusive discount coupons and sales, first peeks at projects under wraps?! - Patrons get all KINDS of stuff! All tiers have the chance to win original art once per quarter, and higher tiers get enrolled in the Print-of-the-Quarter club. Plus, you get to feel really good about supporting an independent creator, and bask in my appreciation, which I\u0027ve been told is as warm as the sun. Check out the tiers below to figure out which one is right for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. It gives creators a monthly stipend of funds that they can count on, instead of the natural ebb-and-flow of sporadic commissions, freelance work, and convention income. Because of this, they can be a little more free to create even more personal content than they could before. It\u0027s a net-positive service for everyone involved. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking out my page, and I hope you join the family! Pledge, and then click on \"Activity\" to see everything in the patron-only stream! - Indi\u003cbr\u003e"

While some client work will continue to be done, I would be able to scale back on it and focus on things the Patrons want to see more than whoring myself out to the larger art world. ;) That means more stock art, more novel writing, a much faster turnaround on SotA comics and other comic projects that have fallen by the wayside due to time constraints, including Dissolution.",
