If you haven\u0027t, then thank you, for you are a generous soul for even considering giving us money without hearing what we intend to do with it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur podcast, \u003cstrong\u003eYCDTOTI\u003c/strong\u003e is \u003cem\u003eBlerd \u003c/em\u003e(Black Nerd) Media, the Black Nerd Perspective from a Generation X slant. For a very long time, there hasn\u0027t been a platform that made note of the existence or the contribution of Blerds to the Nerd Zeitgeist. To be a Blerd is being a minority-in-a-minority, but there is a growing community of Nerds Of Color doing what we can to contribute to the conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe YCDTOTI Podcast will be myself, my co-host and producer DXpert, and different guest hosts having nerd-offs and geek-outs, but as it relates to being Black as well. These discussions can go political, religious, philosophical, I\u0027m there and sometimes I can\u0027t tell you how we get into what we get into. But it\u0027s stimulating, it\u0027s honest, and it\u0027s organic. Listen to the first episode, if you don\u0027t believe me. \u003cbr\u003eOur podcast will not only highlight Blerd culture, but attempt to educate the world-at-large about the accomplishments of other Blerds just like us!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s not all. We are also launching our own graphic novel and chapter novel. We will be documenting our process and telling everyone just how we did it. Success leaves fingerprints, and we plan to point \u0027em out like Steve used to do on Blues Clues...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no more important time than now for People Of Color to have spaces where we can celebrate our own and contribute our voices to the world. Science fiction and Fantasy allows us to create the worlds in which we want to live, and Blerds come with the most unique vision and insight on what that future might look like and how we fit into it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first episode is currently on Soundcloud, but we\u0027ll be making special episodes for our Patreon followers, I\u0027ll be offering tutorial videos on writing, my partners DXpert and P. Clip will be doing videos on music production for podcasts, artwork, engineering, It\u0027s going to be a movement, and we can use all the help we can get. Thank you for your consideration, and I will be more specific as to what\u0027s coming soon. And trust me, it\u0027s a LOT!\u003cbr\u003e-TangoMega, Host of \u003cstrong\u003eYou Can\u0027t Do That On The Internet\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
