Though my name carries a strong undertone, my dream is leave a positive effect on the world not through force but through kindness. Therefore, rather than be conqueror of the world, I claim the title of \"Tamer.\" It is my hope that through gentleness, I can encourage conversation, sympathy, and learning in my fellow humans, and give voice to those without words.\u003cbr\u003e",
