    "summary": "If you\u0027d told me a few years ago that I\u0027d regularly be making videos that people actually watch, I\u0027d have never believed it. A lot has happened, and making videos has become a part of my regular routine. Being able to take good, funny, or memorable experiences and share them with a receptive audience is something that I\u0027ve come to truly enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I may enjoy doing it, it\u0027s also something that is very time consuming\u2014and time is something that I\u0027m starting to run short on. A typical Arma video requires a day\n    or two of work, and more elaborate projects can take weeks or months\n    to finish. To give concrete examples of this: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6-DM90oJ_M\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyear in reviews\u003c/a\u003e have generally taken me about 5 weeks of solid work to finish, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzzS3R0Wp5s\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBand of Bulgars\u003c/a\u003e was in the works from December 2013 through May 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point I can only afford to spend a limited time on video creation\u2014far less than I\u0027d like. I\u0027m only able to finish about half of the projects that I\n    start because I\u0027m unable to spend the time needed to see them\n    through. This is frustrating and unfortunate because it means that a lot of great footage never sees the light of day.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n    I would love for this to change, and it can. Your support would free me to spend much more time on video projects each month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n    What would the tangible benefits of supporting me be?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore Arma content, more often\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore special Arma projects along the lines of \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6-DM90oJ_M\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyear in reviews\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgjSZ75sPhk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFlower of Scotland\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore special non-Arma projects such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzzS3R0Wp5s\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBand of Bulgars\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUWYmoUUz74\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePhoton\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTPgbktEnMM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Personal Vietnam\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaCMcVh4S5o\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Next Great Video of the Saint\u0027s Row Franchise\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore frequent non-Arma content like \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KkRC5wVrfc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoylent\u0027s Pants\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_h7p2ZJn0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e10K.2\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdOL8R-otto\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e#ck2things\u003c/a\u003e can be a part of my channel\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf there\u0027s demand, special features like Q\u0026amp;As or opinion\n        pieces would become feasible\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n    There are many projects I\u0027d love to work on but currently don\u0027t have\n    the time for.
