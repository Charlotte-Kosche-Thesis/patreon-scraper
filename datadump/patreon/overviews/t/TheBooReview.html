Through support from fans and patrons we\u0027ve managed to gather some equipment, but jobs and life schedules make planning extended trips that would take longer than a few hours prohibitive at the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis would also allow us to make the content that we love as creators and you love as fans without having to battle with the current state of the YouTube algorithm and deliver the best Boo Review possible!"

Our current situation involves getting us together and then working around others as our \"work space\" is basically the living room/dining room in A. J.\u0027s current living situation. If we hit this goal we will be able to deliver more content and spend more time and creativity on our content.",

This would allow both of us to dedicate full time to creating. There are so many other things you could do with your hard earned money besides support us and our show. We\u0027re shooting for the stars here, but it would be an amazing thing to do this full time. We know the goal is high but it will be split amongst the Boo Crew.",
