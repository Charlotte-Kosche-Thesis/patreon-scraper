    "summary": "We all started off as actors, all of whom attended AMDA in Los Angeles from 2012-2013. During our time here, we decided to start shooting our own content and form an impromptu production label while our first project, \u003cem\u003eTrapped,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0was in production.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAfter that, we became serious about our goals and ideas as professional digital media creators, and our YouTube channel began. Since we all fit the label of \"starving artist,\" our productions have been slow up until this point. However, with several new ideas and a renewed sense of purpose, we\u0027re moving forward with a ton of projects in 2014.\u003cbr\u003eThe reason we need your help is simple: we have the tools to create our own videos, but need the support and love of a community to help our work reach professional heights. If you don\u0027t want to donate, that is absolutely fine. We only ask that you watch, and listen, to our work, and decide for yourself. We want to continue to make free content, because we love doing this.\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003eJAR, Traveling Milk Productions\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: We are not making money off of copyright songs in our trailers. That music is used strictly artistically and will never garner us profit in any way.\u003cbr\u003e"
