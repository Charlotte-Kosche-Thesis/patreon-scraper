    "summary": "Hey there! My name is Thaylia and I am a singer-songwriter-producer. I have always loved music but growing up I never had any music lessons and it wasn\u0027t until the age of 23 I picked up an instrument for the very first time. However, for many years I lived a life where I attempted to dim my life due to painful events from childhood that I didn\u2019t want to remember. As a result\u00a0I battled with addictions to substances from the age of 14 which had a massive impact on the choices I made in my adult life.\u00a0My addictions took me away from my passions and this has resulted in lost years and time but music is what inspired me to make a different choice to create a better life for myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, I am 4 years completely sober and during this time I have given it my all musically. I\u00a0have recently graduated with a Bachelor of Music (Composition \u0026amp; Music Production) and\u00a0I have worked hard and not expected any handouts or anyone to do the work for me with my music endeavours. As a self managed artist I act as my own label and currently do all of the behind the scenes work for my releases. This includes recording, production, mixing, creating single and EP artwork, media releases for publicity, organising radio and online distribution, social media postings, booking shows and producing my own music video\u2019s. I also facilitate music workshops and music lessons for children, create cover music videos and vlogs on my YouTube channel on different topics that may assist those who have had similar struggles to me.\u00a0I have self financed my music and invested countless hours to developing my songwriting, production and performance skills while trying to maintain a job just so that I can eat and pay my rent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving to maintain a job has impacted on my passions and I have not been able to completely engage them in the way that I want to, I want to be completely engaged in my passions 100% of the time without having to worry about where my next meal is coming from. I want to SOAR with my passions, I want to be engulfed in my passions daily and I want my passions to take me all over the world. I want to have fun!\u00a0My creative drive today is fueled by my desire to live a life that is 100% truthful and loving to who I am, to live a life that honors my personality and nature that will allow me to continuously learn and develop not just as a musician but as a person.\u00a0I do not desire fame or glory but this does not mean I do not want to be successful. Success to me means being able to acquire the means to be fully self sustainable in my passions and doing what I love on a daily basis, success means being able to have the means to assist and help others to follow their dreams and passions even if it\u2019s just one person. I want to be able to share what I gain with others and give back to the community and world even. I always dream of being able to create enough abundance that I might be able to share it with those who need it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn an industry that can be quite selfish, narcissistic and forceful in the way that music is marketed, creating teaches me about love, as I am always endeavouring to find new ways to be able to do what I am passionate about that is not only loving to myself but also loving to others that will not be intrusive or forceful and that will be of benefit to all. As a result I do not engage in forced marketing tactics with my music, I simply make it available on as many platforms as I can for people to be able to access and enjoy free of charge or by choosing to pay.\u00a0I also offer my music services free of charge as a gift and will only accept payments when and if it is offered to me. If you have the means to and would like to express your gratitude you can set up recurring donations via my Patreon page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone will have access to all my creations for free whether you donate or not because\u00a0I believe in offering everything up for free and making everything I create available for all to see with no exclusivity. I believe in just offering you gifts for free without any expectation in return, therefore it is completely up to your desire if you want to donate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy next project and goal is to release and EP and tour and your donations will pay for this along with other expenses such as rent, food; bills and insurances, various music business running expenses, personal/music related equipment \u0026amp; software, and personal items \u0026amp; clothes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and support.\u003cbr\u003eThaylia X\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://eepurl.com/b55nBb\"\u003eSubscribe to Newsletter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.thayliamusic.com/\"\u003ewww.thayliamusic.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/thayliamusic\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/thayliamusic\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ThayliaAcoustic\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Thaylia-618176788351951/?ref=bookmarks\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.onepagelink.com/thaylia\"\u003eEPK\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
