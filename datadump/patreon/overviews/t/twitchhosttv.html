I work on this site solo and out of my own pocket as a way to give back. If you want to help, have a look at Green man Gaming or if you\u0027re feeling extra generous  drop a few coins in the donation jar. Feel free to check out my personal twitch  account\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/iampanzer\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIampanzer\u003c/a\u003e , my personal \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/AngryPanzer\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IampanzerDotCom/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e page and home page \u003ca href=\"http://www.iampanzer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.iampanzer.com\u003c/a\u003e.

On twitter we getting over 2,500 notifications a day and hundreds of messages. \u00a0This is so amazing the support is great, this site takes hours a day to run which is ok while everyone is so appreciative and getting involved we will keep going. Now Patreon, the site, advertising, management systems are not cheap and we want to try expand with the community we are building. Also from there we want to be \u00a0able to start sponsoring small streamers, giving away prizes such as games, steam keys, steam cash, twitch turbo time and even hardware like microphones and web cams. How good would that be?! So everything from this will go straight back into the website or used for competitions like above mentioned.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs our community grows we hope so do your brands and streams!
