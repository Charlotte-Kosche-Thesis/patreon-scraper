This is the place where you support me making my videos and singles and whatever else I make between the albums. \u00a0And that is about the coolest thing ever. It\u0027s a CREATIVE REVOLUTION, which I love. You\u0027re now my record label. You\u0027re my backer. You\u0027re a country station. You are the wind... OK, I\u0027ll calm down.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you don\u0027t know, I\u0027m an indie rock singer/songwriter, actor, producer, artist person. \u00a0I\u0027ve released two full length albums: PENNSYLVANIA (2010) \u00a0and LOVE NEVER DIES (2015). \u00a0LOVE NEVER DIES got radio play all over the country and got some reviews you can check out on my website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.annestott.com\"\u003ewww.annestott.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make VIDEOS for every song on my albums. I want to release SINGLES between the albums. I also write other things besides music and do the occasional art project. \u00a0So... anything might happen here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is where cool YOU and the cool people at PATREON come in. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHere on Patreon, you can pledge to support my creative endeavors at various levels PER THING I make (each video, single, art installation). Cool right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, you will get the ALL ACCESS VIP BACKSTAGE PASS to what I\u0027m creating with a first look/experience of whatever I\u0027ve made. \u00a0It\u0027s sort of like a modern day fan club except you don\u0027t just mail in a check and wait three months before getting the newsletter and a button. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYOU help create the thing itself and then get the instant advance view of it. Like, when you see my video posted on Youtube or FB you can say to yourself, \"I helped make that.\" AND you got the behind the scenes peak. And maybe a button too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpcoming projects include:\u003cbr\u003eNot For Long Motherfucker: an anti-Trump pro resistance single and video\u003cbr\u003eScream Along with Billy: Never Washed  a documentary about one of my favorite music acts.\u003cbr\u003eGreatness was a Woman: a photo and written word installation about how Euro-American pre-occupation with greatness often coincides with the marginalization of women\u0027s stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are the two videos that have already been made:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BPRI5-yR7WI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sL0wnvI87I\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImportant things for you to know:\u003cbr\u003eYOU ONLY PAY WHEN I DELIVER.\u003cbr\u003eYou can set a limit on how much money will be charged per month. \u003cbr\u003eI would be shocked and stunned if I make more than one video/single every two months, but you hold the reins on how much you pay. \u003cbr\u003eYou can back out at anytime. \u003cbr\u003eYou can be fickle and find some other artist to support. \u003cbr\u003eYou can decide you don\u0027t like the work or just change your mind. \u003cbr\u003eWhatever YOU want. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, we will BUILD THIS REVOLUTION TOGETHER. \u00a0If I\u0027m contemplating activating your Patreon support for something way out there, I will get your feedback before doing it. Again, this is the all access backstage pass. \u00a0And you\u0027ve got a vote!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor all the talk about the music industry dying, the relationships artists and patrons are having on this site proves that art and music lovers will pay for what they love. \u00a0And that warms my heart. Truly. \u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU for stopping by. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make some music and art together. \u003cbr\u003e"
