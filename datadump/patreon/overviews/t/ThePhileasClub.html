So we would get episodes with people from France, Saudi Arabia, the US, Thailand, Sweden, Israel, South Africa, etc. Sometimes we would get a different perspective on big news items we all know about but hadn\u0027t quite thought of in that way, and sometimes we\u0027d learn that a thing we had never heard about was a major topic in a huge part of the world...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is it cool?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI honestly loved this show.\u00a0I loved the concept, which I think is really cool, and is something that can only really be done on the Internet (and possibly only in a Podcast form). I also think it is an important show. I think it deserves to exist, and I even look at it as our small part in trying to build a world with more understanding, where people enjoy talking to one another instead of shouting at one another.\u003cbr\u003eWe didn\u0027t always agree of course. In fact we often strongly disagreed, which was great! That was even the point: how can you form an opinion when you never hear what other people think? Discussions and disagreements were key.\u003cbr\u003eBut my ultimate goal was to maintain a friendly atmosphere and to build a *fun* show. I really believe that if a show is dull or boring, people just won\u0027t listen, and it\u0027ll be a waste of everyone\u0027s time. What would be the point of doing that? And oh boy did we have fun...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... Rational conversations and healthy debates, with people from all around the world, who can\u0027t agree on the most sensitive topics, and still manage to have fun and make friends. It doesn\u0027t seem like that would be possible, would it? Yet we managed to pull it off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGreat! Now what?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would *love* to do it again. Actually, I will start doing it again no matter what. But if you think the concept is interesting, and you think this show should exist, I\u0027d like to solicit your help. If you have a few bucks to spare, please consider supporting the show and becoming my boss.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS1: When considering how much you want to commit to, please keep in mind that the first goal would add another type of episode to the mix. These could happen once a quarter to once a month, so do take into account the fact that you could be looking at two episodes a month, and plan accordingly. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS2: Oh, and remember that if you become a patron, you also enter the very exclusive Distinguished Gentlemen and Ladies Society!\u00a0More on that in the silly rewards section. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
