    "summary": "What\u0027s patreon? If this is your first time on this\nwebsite, Patreon is kind of a play on the word patron, as in \u003cem\u003epatron \u003c/em\u003e(or supporter) \u003cem\u003eof the arts\u003c/em\u003e. Unless you have the backing\nof a large corporation\u0026#8212;writers, photographers, musicians, and artists of all\nkinds cannot make a living doing what they do best: creating. But that is\nchanging with sites like Patreon and people like you! People, rather than large\ncorporations, can choose who or what to support! My current goal is to prove\nthrough my photography that ghosts are real, that there really is an afterlife,\nand that the paranormal is the new norm. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy first book, \u003cem\u003eHaunted\nHistoric Colonial Williamsburg Virginia with Breakthrough Ghost Photography\u003c/em\u003e\nhas been a moderate success, but after the publisher and Amazon take their cut,\nthere is little left for the author. Without the advertising budget of one of\nthe major publishers, the only way I can get the word out is through my meager\nefforts at social media and word of mouth by YOU! I also need help in expanding\nmy para-photography outside of Colonial Williamsburg. I am interested in taking\nmy photography on the road to some of the nation\u0026#8217;s (and yes if possible the\nworld\u0026#8217;s) most haunted sites to see what I can capture with my techniques and\nmodified cameras. Keep this in mind: Unlike what you see on the paranormal TV\nshows, experience has taught me that going to a haunted site just one time and\nspending the night is not the end all\u0026#8212;sometimes you have to visit a site\nmultiple times before the ghosts will reveal themselves. I have several\nexamples of that in my book. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy camera has been modified, but I also have further\nmodifications to my camera\u0026#8217;s electronics that I would like to do that may get\neven better results. These ideas will need funds for research, development, and\nequipment to make this a reality, as well as developing new software to\nproperly process the photos. I am out to prove once and for all that there is\nan afterlife, and the only window of possibility that the world wants is visual\nproof through advanced technology. LET\u0026#8217;S DO THIS!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy Background: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have my bachelor\u0026#8217;s and master\u0026#8217;s degrees (cum laude) from\nthe College of William and Mary while working full time, and during my tenure\nthere I was encouraged by my professors to pursue a writing career and a PhD. I\nput off the PhD in order to start writing, and I have completed several books,\nincluding a novel, a series of guitar instruction books on advanced lead guitar\nand chord construction, and a children\u0026#8217;s book on fun and educational\nactivities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago among my writing, photography, and music activities\nI took up a part time job giving historical tours in Colonial Williamsburg,\nwhich included ghost tours in the evening (I wanted to delve deeper into the\narea\u0026#8217;s history, and this seemed like the perfect way). I was a skeptic about\nghosts, so to me the ghost tours were just evening entertainment. Every once in\na while on my tours someone would take a photo of a house or building that\nwould have a paranormal anomaly in it\u0026#8212;something that none of us saw with the\nnaked eye. I was a fine art and event photographer at the time, so it got me to\nthinking\u0026#8212;if some random person could take a photo with just a cellphone camera\nand capture the paranormal\u0026#8212;what could I do with my professional equipment? So\nbegan my paranormal quest; and I began to experiment with different cameras,\ntechniques, and modifications until I came upon the perfect scenario to\ncapturing ghosts of all sizes, shapes, and colors. My first book took more than\n2 years and over 10,000 photographs to complete; my second book is complete as\nI work on my third, with over 5 years and closing in on 20,000 photographs. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince I began as a skeptic, I know what a skeptic wants to\nsee: visual proof. So I have kept a separate file of completely untouched,\nunmodified photographs of some of my best captures. I one day hope they can be\nexamined by a bona fide photographic expert to determine that they are real\ncaptures of paranormal anomalies\u0026#8212;and not something engineered in Photoshop. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy fanbase has been very enthusiastic and supportive, particularly those that\nhave seen some of my captures in the review screen of my camera\u0026#8212;before they\nwere ever downloaded to a computer.  In the near future I want to\n\u0026#8220;go-live\u0026#8221; on Facebook during some of my photo-shoots to give everyone that same\nexperience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a new revolution in the arts; now rather than\nfinding a small handful of rich patrons to fund a career, artists can now get\nthousands of people to donate in small increments. In return you can become a\npart of the process, and get firsthand information of any new progress or\nshocking new discovery. Be a part of this non-corporate underground, because\nunlike politics, this brings real change to the art world. You are a part of\nthe decision-making process, so help support the books, the photography, the\nmusic, and the art that speaks to you\u0026#8212;and not the art that is shoved down your\nthroat by the corporate driven media. They believe that if they inundate you\nwith enough commercials, billboards, spam, and ads you will buy what they want\nyou to buy. Will you support what they want\u0026#8212;or what you want? Be a part of the\nnew \u003cem\u003efan-based underground\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBesides the basics for survival, I need your support to help to pay for upgrades\nand maintenance of my present technology, for research and development of new\ntechnology (which in and of itself is an expensive but necessary undertaking), for\nthe gas, food, and lodging when I travel to new sites, and to help pay for vehicle\nmaintenance and repair.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI appreciate each and every person who is a part of my team,\nno matter what you contribute. I try to listen and respond to every comment and\nsuggestion as quickly as possible, because you are helping me to uncover one of\nthe greatest mysteries of life: DEATH! So above all, from the bottom of my\nheart, I want to respond to all of your help with a heartfelt \u0026#8220;THANK YOU!\u0026#8221; \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
