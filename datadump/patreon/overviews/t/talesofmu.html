    "summary": "MU is Magisterius University, a college in the Imperial Republic of Magisteria, a major nation set in a world that is my conception of what a typical D\u0026amp;D-influenced swords-and-sorcery world would be like, after four or five centuries of history are allowed to pass without the typical social stasis tropes seen in such worlds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn other words: if the typical fantasy world is \"medieval fantasy\", what would one of those worlds look like if it reached the modern age? That\u0027s the first question that Tales of MU seeks to answer, the idea that was the seed for the story for me. The result\u00a0is a sprawling serial story that blends fantasy and reality, my lived reality and the realities I observe around me with many inner ones. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started writing it when I was processing a lot of stuff that I went through both during my time as a college student and the years following that, hence the setting and the often emotionally fraught drama that pervades the pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my goals in writing it has been to explore what a story can be when it doesn\u0027t have to fit between a pair of covers or up on a shelf. Thus, Tales of MU\u00a0is less a novel or series of novels and more like a webcomic without any pictures. As such, it doesn\u0027t always follow the expected rules of storytelling. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite or maybe because it breaks the mold, it is one of the longest-running and most successful crowdfunded fiction stories on the web. Comprising millions of words of text and hundreds of chapters, Tales of MU features a cast of queer characters in mature (and immature) situations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a writer with disabilities and an occasionally complicated living situation, I have not always been able to keep the update schedule I would like. Now that I\u0027m in a position to give this series the attention that it deserves, I\u0027m launching a Patreon campaign for Tales of MU to make it easier than ever for you the reader to support the story in a way that is fair and accountable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou pledge any amount you like, whatever you think a chapter of the story is worth. When I post an update, your pledges are tallied. If I keep updating, I get paid. If I don\u0027t, I don\u0027t. Either way, the tallied pledges are processed at the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e"
