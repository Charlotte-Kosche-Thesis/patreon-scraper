There is simply nothing else like us out there! We use native caterpillars as a resource to bring people into the world of local, backyard natural history. Our underlying goal is to spark curiosity and encourage exploration and discovery. We surprise people about their own natural heritage every day -- our audience will never look at their \"old familiar places\" the same way again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt every opportunity, The Caterpillar Lab celebrates the intersection of art, science, education, and natural history study.  We encourage growth within each of these areas, and especially across them.  Our outreach involves exhibit production, educational programs, educational resources, video production, photography, dance choreography, and original and collaborative research.  We are always looking for new ways to interact with caterpillars and broaden our audience!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of our outreach events are over-the-top, jaw dropping, and inspirational.  Our lab in Keene is open to the public and we enjoy every opportunity to invite visitors in for a behind-the-scenes experience.  We reach tens of thousands of people directly and millions of people across the world through our thriving Facebook page. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWe are a passionate organization, doing one-of-a-kind work that IS ONLY POSSIBLE with your help. Without your patronage, there could be no The Caterpillar Lab.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMission Statement:  The Caterpillar Lab fosters greater appreciation and care for the complexity and beauty of our local natural history through live caterpillar educational programs, research initiatives, and photography and film projects. We believe that an increased awareness of one\u2019s local environment is the foundation on which healthy and responsible attitudes towards the broader natural systems of this world is built.\u003cbr\u003e"
