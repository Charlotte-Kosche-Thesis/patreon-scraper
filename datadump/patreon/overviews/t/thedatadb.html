In that time we have created 5 different websites to provide free online metadata (with our easy to use JSON API\u0027s) to various Open-Source projects and apps and even businesses. We believe data API\u0027s should be free and open at point of use!\u003cbr\u003eThe website API\u0027s we provide data and artwork for include: Music (www.theaudiodb.com) Sports (www.thesportsdb.com) TV Logos (www.thelogodb.com) Recipes (www.themealdb.com) and Cocktails (www.thecocktaildb.com).\u003cbr\u003eIt costs money to run the servers, we\u0027ve had a few donations in our history but its never been enough to cover our running costs, let alone the costs of adding new features or launching full new websites. Historically we have done it out of our own pockets for the the love of spreading data and seeing awesome new services launched.\u003cbr\u003eThe more of you that support TheDataDB sites, the more time and money we will invest in the sites and the more new features and services we will provide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e"
