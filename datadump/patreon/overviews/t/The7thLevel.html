    "summary": "I\u0027ve been making youtube videos about gaming for over seven years now. I\u0027ve written reviews for Diehardgamefan.com, and before that, I wrote for my own website for over 4 years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been playing video games since I was three years old, almost as long as home gaming has existed. I\u0027ve lived through every console generation and through PC gaming\u0027s evolution over the past 30+ years. I eat, sleep, and breathe gaming, as does my son.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve written books, written for popular websites, but I am not a journalist. I\u0027m a gamer, like you. I work a regular job, like you. I don\u0027t get review copies from publishers, I buy everything on my own dime. This means that, up until now, I\u0027ve only been able to review what I\u0027ve been able to afford. And being a single dad with a full time job and all the responsibilities that go with it, what I can afford is not what it once was.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do the reviews I want to do, and to do them at both the quality AND quantity that I want to do them, I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not looking to get rich. I\u0027m not looking to supplement my income. What I want to do, is be YOUR employee, in the job of reviewing games. All I\u0027m asking for is a dollar a month. If you want to do more, that is up to you, and I appreciate it, but a buck a month is all I\u0027m requesting. All funds earned will go towards buying games for review, and new video production equipment and software as needed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are no tiers, and there is only one perk. \u00a0Starting in February 2017, Patrons will be invited once a month to a private skype chat where they can see and interact with me live.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo reach the point I want my content to get to, what I\u0027m hoping for is 500.00 a month. So 500 people contributing a dollar a month. That will cover any new releases during a given month, with the rest going towards improved equipment, software, and trips to conventions like Retropalooza.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, should I ever reach a point of success where I garner the interest of publishers, I will NEVER accept review copies that have any strings attached, I will NEVER take money or perks in exchange for positive press of any kind, I will NOT accept invitations to game release events or pressers that provide free transportation/hotel stay/swag of any kind in exchange for positive press. You, my viewers and patrons, are and always will be the only ones who have my ear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not looking to make game reviews my career. I already have a career. Gaming is my passion. It\u0027s a 30+ year long love affair with a medium that has given me so many moments of sheer happiness that I cannot even quantify them. I want to celebrate those moments, and make news ones, and I want to bring you all along for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e"

In addition, I\u0027ve been wanting to take a more active role in the retro community for a long time, and that includes attending the cons and getting to interact with other retro youtube content creators. I won\u0027t have the time to attend them all, so I want to start off with just one: Retropalooza, held in Texas every year by the Game Chasers.",
