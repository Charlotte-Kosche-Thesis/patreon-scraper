How will you keep yourself active and engaged when you\u0027re finally getting your Universal Basic Income? We are Bob and Dawn, explorers of the rapidly approaching future. Our idea is that \u003cstrong\u003ehumans will create more fun.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve been creating human powered vehicles for decades. Dawn has been making art, music, and parties. Together we build and race human powered contraptions known as Kinetic Sculptures. This isn\u0027t a normal DIY channel; we\u0027re sharing the \"before the how to\" part, the part of the process that is exploration and invention. It\u0027s the exploration hopefully each of us will get to do at some point in our lives. Sure, there will be some plans and probably the opportunity to buy one of our finished projects, but mostly \u003cstrong\u003ewe want you to use your mind and your muscles to do great things to feed your spirit\u003c/strong\u003e. Play music. Dance. Ride a bike. Have a crazy foot race. Be inclusive and find ways for everyone to collaborate. You\u2019ll be glad you did.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRight now we are setting a goal to meet Elon Musk. We\u0027ll be doing all our normal builds and failures, but at each step we will be conducting a guerilla campaign to get on his radar so we can challenge him to a race. Will it happen? If it does, you could be on the guest list!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pzrYIF3ab5k\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for coming here. Your curiosity is awesome. When you become our Patron you join an \u003cstrong\u003eamazing community of solutionists and visionaries\u003c/strong\u003e - many of whom we\u0027ll visit in the coming months. We hope we can show you a couple of fun and rewarding things to do while you\u0027re here! We dream of inventing and building human-powered contraptions and creating or participating in wacky races or events. We\u0027re glad you\u0027re here, and hope to play alongside you soon!"

We\u0027ll do amazing things, and create basic how-tos so those of our patrons who are nominally skilled can copy our work or change the recipe and make their own creations. Plansets and formulas for duplicating our work will be available. Patrons will get first dibs on buying our projects at reduced rates!
