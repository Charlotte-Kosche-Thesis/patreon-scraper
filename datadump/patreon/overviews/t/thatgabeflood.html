    "summary": "Hey there, neighbors! Gabriel here. If you\u0027re seeing this page, odds are you know me from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Gabriel-Flood\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy writings on Quora\u003c/a\u003e; regardless, \u003cstrong\u003eI want to thank you for taking the time to look into how you could help me to continue building the new life I\u0027ve dreamed of\u003c/strong\u003e ever since I received my cancer diagnosis four years back and everything went into a metaphorical tailspin. Stumbling onto the distressing probability of my lifelong presence upon the autism spectrum directly thereafter at age 29 only pounded more critical shells through my craft\u0027s hull.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so I fell, landing with a resounding life \u003cem\u003ecrash\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0that, at the time, I had to admit I fully deserved for my lifelong ignorance of true self, my slowly-developed and unwanted selfishness of survival and spirit, and my desperate-denial-\u003cem\u003earrogance\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0throughout.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s taken me \u003cem\u003eyears\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to even crawl back to having a sense of who I truly am again, and begin the long process of developing new faith in the dreams of who I might be able to become... what works, great and small, I might be able to accomplish from within my new, more complete self-understanding. I have risen back to my knees, and then shakingly to my feet with great amounts of help from only very few steadfast people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am an aspie, a high-functioning autistic, and \u003cem\u003eI want to be useful to my community\u003c/em\u003e, to my \u003cem\u003esociety\u003c/em\u003e again.\u003c/strong\u003e But to do that, I\u0027ve got a long road ahead of me. My anxiety and social difficulties don\u0027t allow me to sustainably work a normal 9-5 job, much less one in *shudders* ...retail (the field in which all of my pre-cancer work experience lay, only highlighting how dangerously unwise one\u0027s choices can be when one doesn\u0027t yet know he is in fact abnormally-brained). Combine that with my now four-years-running of no work experience, barely surviving and falling more and more behind on my leftover medical bills... and you\u0027ve got my current situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut I\u0027m not about to give up. I want to keep on creating new work and content for you guys, and for anybody else out there who could be benefited.\u003c/strong\u003e I can harness my full ability, eloquence, and work ethic from here in my own space, in ways I cannot within the more typical daily grind surrounded by overwhelming others. I can build a better kind of life, and become useful to others once more. \u003cem\u003eI can become something greater than I ever dreamed possible before\u003c/em\u003e, in my old life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the long and short of things now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eI want to \u003cem\u003ekeep on writing\u003c/em\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e using my signature style and indefatigable sense of humor, honesty, and hope to discuss the tough topics of my own personal journey in a way that is consistently refreshing and, ideally, \u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003ehelpful to others\u003c/em\u003e. This means continuing my existing writings in free-to-view spaces, while also branching out into creating new, higher-quality content and collections available for sale in digital markets. My greatest aspiration project right now is a \u003cem\u003ecompilation memoir book about my cancer experience\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(codename: \u003cstrong\u003eDefiance\u003c/strong\u003e), as an undiagnosed, high-functioning autistic young man.

While my overall outlook still remains positive on sheer willpower for now, I dream of the day when I might learn that it \u003cem\u003edoesn\u0027t have to always be this hard just to get out of bed every single day\u003c/em\u003e. Until I can afford sessions with professionals to explore what medical and psychological options may exist to add handholds to my circumstances where few currently exist, however, I am trapped in an uphill battle that is, over time, creating a slow-burn net loss in energy and will. I want out of this particular whirlpool.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to expand into public speaking at venues all around the United States,\u003c/strong\u003e honing my talents at oration (and facing head-on my aspie social fears ever more in the process!) and continuing to bring my unique point of view on the many ways simple aspects of the \u003cem\u003ephilosophy of perspective\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0can benefit a life, be it everyday or facing great, unprecedented crisis. I have already begun generating and exploring opportunities at local universities near where I live, and would love the resources to expand my search and my reach alongside my ambition in this arena.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to be able to afford my own place to live again, \u003c/strong\u003eto have a safe space from which to continue working\u00a0on new ways to reach out and speak to, or on behalf of, others wherever I could be of beneficial use. I dream of little more than just having a writer\u0027s space all my own.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to be able to pay off my sizable lingering debts (educational and now, thanks to cancer, medical)\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0so I can move forward into this new life with my head held that much higher, free of their substantial weight around my neck.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I could use your support, neighbor. \u003cstrong\u003eAny amount you wished to provide to assist me in getting back onto my feet and into this new multimedia career, moving bravely forward into the ominous unknown, will literally make the difference of my lifetime.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for taking the time to visit me here, and to hear out my goals and dreams.
