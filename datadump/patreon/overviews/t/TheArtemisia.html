Let me tell you a bit about myself.\u003c/strong\u003e A\u00a0writer / composer / actor / lecturer, I have written 8 books, 6 already published in 12 different languages. I have recorded 3 albums and 2 professional music videos, and lectured or performed around the world.

Release\u00a0date is May 21, 2018 from JKP/Hachette. \u003c/strong\u003eThe search for love is really the search for self, but this book touches on so many things--feminism, ageism, sexism, orgasms, gender politics, what it means to be a man, a woman, a sensitive, thinking creature who really likes sex and is tired of being in love with the \u003cem\u003eidea\u003c/em\u003e of love. Thanks to my supporters, I had the courage to finish the book and present it to my publisher who signed it. I think it might be the first book of its kind--a sexually explicit memoir written from the perspective of a woman on the autism spectrum.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#2: \u003c/strong\u003eDYING STAR--The Book \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e the Play. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe book\u003c/em\u003e has just been completed and YOU CAN READ IT HERE. It has been sent off to my publisher JKP but they may not publish it--it is a departure from my other works--in which case I will search for another or self-publish. It is the prequel to \u003cem\u003eSex\u003c/em\u003e, a sort of fairy-tale romance gone Grimm, and I think it is my most powerful work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe play\u003c/em\u003e was a one-act, one woman show that debuted in Athens Greece Sept 22 2017 and was a success. Now, I want to perform it in other venues with hyper titles and I may even adapt it to a 2-person full length play.
