From research and writing to post production, I do it all!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe crimes\ncovered in my show range from the seemingly innocent granny who poisons her\nvictims to the serial killer who conned the state of Wisconsin. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003eIt was my\nbackground in public speaking and the survival of an attempted carjacking that\nlead me into the world of true crime podcasting. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe first time I had a gun\npointed at me, I was six years old. Our car had died on the side of the I-635\nhighway in Dallas. My mother\u2019s boyfriend had gone to get gas while we waited in\nthe car. While we waited, two men walked up to our car, and placed the muzzle\nof a gun up to my mother\u2019s head. The other man pointed his gun at my brothers\nand I. Thankfully, we survived the incident and the only thing lost that night\nwas my mother\u2019s gold jewelry. But it was an experience that had forever changed\nme.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003eAs a survivor, I wanted to share\nmy story, along with the stories of others who\u2019ve found themselves in\nunfortunate circumstances. This is the primary reason that the concept for True\nCrime Fan Club was born.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to offer perks to those who choose to donate. I personally, love when hosts interact with their listeners, so I have tried to gear my \u0027perks\u0027 towards that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a lot of work to do but, with your help....I know it will be successful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any ideas for additional perks - please, let me know! I\u0027m open to ideas!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOK, on to the show.... \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe show is on Twitter at @tcfcpod, on Instagram at @tcfc_podcast,\nand Facebook at True Crime Fan Club Podcast \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
