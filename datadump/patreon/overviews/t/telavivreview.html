At the Tel Aviv Review, we love to bring guests who represent a variety of perspectives on the serious work being done in and about our region. We aren\u2019t exclusively restricted to the Middle East; rather, we cast our net wide for cutting-edge research and literature on global issues, to put our own into perspective. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Tel Aviv Review is the only Israeli podcast that offers in-depth insight into ideas and culture, with a broad political range and no limitation on the variety of topics. We like everything! But we need your help. We don\u2019t want to limit access to our show and, more importantly, we\u2019d like the show to survive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution will make all the difference. Believe us, we\u2019re not in it for the money. But we do have production and professional costs. \u003cstrong\u003eBehind every 25-30 minute episode are hours of reading and preparation work. In addition to studio recording time, each episode\u0027s audio is meticulously edited, mixed, and mastered. This alone takes a couple hours. All in all, we invest a great deal of time into making each episode but we know the final result is worth these efforts. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s why we\u2019re launching this appeal and asking you - yes, you! - to sign up to donate very modest sums of money, so modest you\u2019ll be embarrassed if you don\u2019t."
