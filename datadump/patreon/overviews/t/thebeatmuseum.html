That certainly isn\u2019t any secret. These days,\nthe question seems to be \u201cWho gets to remain in San Francisco?\u201d The short\nanswer is anyone who can afford it. If you\u2019re an individual\nmaking a lot of money, or if you\u2019re a tech startup flush with venture capital, you get to stay. But\nfor artists and arts organizations the situation is dire, and the prospect of\ncompeting for survival with wealthy, profit-driven businesses is hardly a\ncompetition at all.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nA better question\nis, what about institutions that aren\u2019t big moneymakers, but nonetheless make\nSan Francisco the unique, wonderful place it is?\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Beat Museum\nhas operated on an extremely tight budget since the day we opened, and we\u2019re\nproud to have accomplished a lot with very little. Since the beginning, our\nchoice has been between running the Beat Museum on a shoestring budget, or not running\nit at all. We choose to do it anyway.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nOurs is a labor\nof love, and we couldn\u2019t do this without the support and enthusiasm of our\ncommunity. So many people have donated or placed on loan with us important Beat\nGeneration artifacts, knowing we\u2019ll be trusted caretakers and provide a safe\nplace for the public to enjoy these pieces of history.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile being a bare-bones operation has been both challenging and rewarding, it nonetheless\nlimits our ability to fulfill our purpose\u2014to tell the story of the Beat\nGeneration.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently, it\u2019s\nwhat we sell in our gift shop that keeps our doors open, meaning there\u2019s very\nlittle certainty to our finances throughout the year, due to a number of\nvariables. For example, tourism to San Francisco was down 4% in 2017, and we\u2019ve\nfelt the effects of the downturn. Because of this, we often have to make tough\nchoices at the end of each month.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nCan we pay all our bills on time, or do we need\nto buy additional inventory to sell in our gift shop? Is there enough money to both host\nan event and build a new exhibit, or do we need to choose one over the other?\nSometimes things have to wait, and admittedly, much of our energy and focus is\ndevoted simply to staying afloat.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u2019s how you can help: By becoming a patron of the Beat Museum, you\u2019ll be allowing us to\nfocus on what matters\u2014making your experience of the Beat Generation the best it\ncan be. Once a month, for less than the cost of a cup of coffee, a beer, or a\ngallon of gas, you can help us build better exhibits, display many of the items\ncurrently waiting in our archives, host more free public literary events, and\nfurther spread the spirit of the Beat Generation.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u2019ve already done a lot with just a little. Your support can help us do so much more!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPlease become a Patron today. Thank You!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch3 style=\"color: #953734;\"\u003eWhy the Beats \u0026amp; The Beat Museum Matter\u003c/h3\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Beat Generation was a group of artistic intellectuals who became famous in post-WWII America. Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs were the most well known of the group but there were dozens of other writers, poets and artists between New York and San Francisco who identified as Beats. Most of the core group were friends of Allen Ginsberg and in the 1950s their informal themes seemed to be tolerance, compassion and having the courage to live an authentic life.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery generation has its nonconformists, but the Beat Generation was the first group of nonconformists to have the benefit of radio and television. The Transcendentelist writers of the 1800s,  Emerson, Whitman, Thoreau had the printed word only. The Beat Generation had electronic communication that went around the world. Because of this their influence was far reaching as their values were passed on to the next generation who became the Hippies of the 1960s.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nJust a few of the icons of the 1960s who were influenced by the Beats in the early days were Bob Dylan and The Beatles,  and because of the extended reach of these rock stars it can be said the message of The Beats went around the world.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nThe dissenters of the past such as the Beats and Hippies stood up for what they believed in and challenged the dominant paradigms of their day. The world needs this same spirit of the Beats today in an America that is still struggling with freedom of speech, racism, diversity, inclusion, terrorism and war. This is why it is so important for The Beat Museum to remain a viable institution in a fast changing world.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
