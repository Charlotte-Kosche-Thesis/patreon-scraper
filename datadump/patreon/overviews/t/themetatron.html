Let\u0027s stretch it then :D I will soon add new things I\u0027m planning to do with the extra funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe donations from Patreon, which I receive from all of you, are entirely dedicated to the development of my channel, of the sort of videos I make, and also are the base budget I use for professional video production.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHitting This goal would allow me to not only improve both image and audio quality, investing on new recording equipment, but it also allows many ideas I have in mind to come true, such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Exploring and filming all the Greek temples, medieval churches and castles and Roman sites we have here in Sicily, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Recruiting people as extras for making more entertaining videos\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0Buying armour and weapons to review and also make historical re-enactment videos with.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this clearly has a cost, so every little bit helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish to thank all those who believe in the potential of the Metatron\u0027s channel, and help me make sure this dream comes true.",
