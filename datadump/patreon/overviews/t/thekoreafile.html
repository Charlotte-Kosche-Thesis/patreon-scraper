    "summary": "Support THE KOREA FILE, a monthly podcast of\u00a0conversations with leading academics, journalists and musicians from around the peninsula and the world.\u00a0 This show is designed to share the history, culture and indie music of this (little-understood, much-loved) country!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2014, each of the show\u0027s 68 episodes have been released across a variety of online platforms free of charge to broaden awareness of Korea, its history and its people. But it takes a lot of work to track down interviews, research, edit and produce. My goal is to PROFESSIONALIZE this podcast and turn it into a SUSTAINABLE INITIATIVE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s how your financial contribution helps spread the word:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\u00a0goal is to create a base of listeners who can help keep this podcast going for the LONG TERM. With a contribution level of $500/month, I\u0027ll be able to turn this podcast into a PART-TIME JOB and move to a twice-a-month and eventually a weekly production schedule.\u00a0 How great would that be?\u00a0\u00a0For just the price of a TOM-AND-TOM\u0027S LATTE, you can be part of taking The Korea File to the next level!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons get perks: a contribution of just $4/month gives you access to BONUS CONTENT like extended interviews and subscriber-only links.  For $10/month you\u0027ll receive access to bonus content and be able to WRITE IN QUESTIONS for upcoming episodes. For $15/month you\u0027ll also receive a special BONUS GIFT like a book or a kitschy trinket! Even a monthly $1 donation helps, and whatever you can contribute will go a long way towards allowing this podcast to continue long-term.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s my background: in six years on the peninsula, I explored Ansan (\u002706-\u002707), Gimhae (\u002707-\u002708), Suwon (\u002708-\u002709), Seoul (\u002709-\u002711) and Jeju Island (\u002714-\u002715) on a day-to-day basis.\u00a0 I\u0027ve also traveled extensively all around the country.\u00a0 Since coming back to North America, The Korea File has been produced in collaboration with The Nam Center for Korean Studies at the University of Michigan, the Michigan Korean Weekly newspaper and with MiAsian magazine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my work elsewhere, most prominently as the podcasting department coordinator at Ricochet Media, Canada\u0027s leading bilingual leftist journalism outlet, where I also host the National Campus and Community Radio Association award-winning \u0027Unpacking the News\u0027, voted Best in Podcasting 2017.\u00a0 I\u0027m also the Executive Producer of \u0027Well Reds\u0027, Canada\u0027s leading leftist literary review.\u00a0 You can also find me at Jeju Weekly magazine (jejuweekly.com), at the Fair Observer website (fairobserver.com) and with the Detroit Journalism Cooperative (detroitjournalism.org).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading!\u00a0 Your support is helping keep The Korea File podcast on the air.\u003cbr\u003e"
