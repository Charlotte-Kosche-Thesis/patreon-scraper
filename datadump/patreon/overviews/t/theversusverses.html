    "summary": "Hi! I\u2019m Peter. Welcome to my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you know who I am, great! If you don\u2019t, I\u2019m an artist,\nwriter, filmmaker, musician, and voice actor currently based in Raleigh, North\nCarolina. I work on a lot of projects in nearly every genre and style \u2013 I just\nlove to create.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat am I about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGetting that paper.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNo, wait.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy goal, as an artist, is to create work that entertains,\nbut also moves. Work with energy and comedy, but work that makes you think as\nwell. I want to make flash AND substance. I want people to have a good time,\nfeel something, and come away from the things I create \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m an intersectional feminist. I believe that all should be\ngiven equal opportunity no matter their gender identity, race, sexuality, or\nreligion, and I want my work to reflect that. My dream is to open a media\nproduction company to amplify the work and voices of those less fortunate and\nthose with less opportunity to succeed than I.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy favorite music is typically a blend between melody and\naggression. I think that sums up what I make pretty well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat am I working on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m currently writing a romantic comedy script about two\nindependent filmmakers called \u003cem\u003eUnderground\u003c/em\u003e.\nI\u2019m also working on editing my first feature film as a director, \u003cem\u003eYou\u2019re So Dead!\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(which is what my cover image is of); creating a podcast\ncalled \u003cem\u003eTil Death\u003c/em\u003e; and writing and\nrecording songs every once in a while for a concept album about anxiety and the\nend of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat have I done before?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA lot of scripts, first of all. I received the NCSU Creative\nArtist Award for the play \u003cem\u003eGirl in Space\u003c/em\u003e,\nand followed it up with another short play, \u003cem\u003eAtlantic\u003c/em\u003e.\nFilm-wise, I wrote the script for \u003cem\u003eYou\u2019re\nSo Dead!\u003c/em\u003e, as well as quite a few other unproduced films \u2013 from crime\ncomedies to sci-fi to horror to action. I also write short stories for\nr/nosleep, including \u201cI\u2019m cutting a song from my upcoming album.\u201d, which was\nthe top story on the page for a while. I also wrote and directed a short film called \u003cem\u003eLockout\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0that placed in the top 16 finals for NCSU Campus MovieFest 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://theatre.arts.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2017/06/GIRLinSPACE-Web.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPremiering in March 2018 at NCSU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve released two albums under the name AKLF, \u003cem\u003eI Want Revenge\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eBANG\u003c/em\u003e. I composed and produced the theme song to the Horror Honeys\u2019 \u003cem\u003eSteam Room\u003c/em\u003e podcast, and I\u2019m composing\nand performing the original score for \u003cem\u003eYou\u2019re\nSo Dead!\u003c/em\u003e as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nVoice acting-wise, I currently perform as Kennedy Lacey on \u003cem\u003eDeath at a Low Price\u003c/em\u003e, which was an\nAudioverse Award finalist in 2017. I\u2019ve also appeared on \u003cem\u003eJim Robbie and the Wanderers\u003c/em\u003e as Lucas and Artrax, \u003cem\u003eTo Whom it May Concern\u003c/em\u003e as another\ncharacter named Lucas, and \u003cem\u003eInkwyrm\u003c/em\u003e as\nMr. Waters. In the future, I\u2019ll be performing on \u003cem\u003eThe Six Disappearances of Ella McCray\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Blood Crow Stories\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe\nLavender Ladies,\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eEyeris\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhy should you support me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecause I\u2019m nice?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nArt is not a lucrative profession when you\u0027re at my level. It entirely depends on\nthe audience, and I put so much into what I do. So, to that end, any support\nyou can throw my way would be much appreciated. I\u2019ll use it to find new ways to\ndistribute my work, improve my resources, and hopefully create better things\nfor you to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat do you get for your support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMore art, mostly.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve only got three tiers active right now, but hopefully\nyou\u2019ll like what I\u2019m offering. Access to my music catalog, previews of scripts\nin progress, old and bad scripts, voice acting bloopers, and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks for visiting my page, and I hope you can support. I appreciate you reading this far, at the very least, and I\u0027m looking forward to sharing more art with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
