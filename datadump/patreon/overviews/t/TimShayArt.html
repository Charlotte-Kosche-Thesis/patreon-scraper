    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://i622.photobucket.com/albums/tt306/10stroke/Jayne%20WIP%20Process.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello all. Ok, I always find it awkward writing about myself, but, I kinda think I\u0027m an ok guy and a moderately decent artist, so, here goes. I have been drawing as long as I could grasp a pencil. I live in Southern California with my wife and 4 kids and draw every chance I get. I started working professionally in about \u002708 working on sketch card projects for various licenses such as The Walking Dead, Dexter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Marvel Comics sets and myriad others. The sketch card work opened the door to many other art opportunities that have kept me drawing like a mad man.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a fondness for all things horror, and really enjoy drawing monsters, demons, and try to make something beautiful of a subject that normally is not beautiful. I try to make my work as emotive as possible and capture the vibe of the image I\u0027m working on. I work in various mediums including graphite, markers, colored pencils, and also India ink etchings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first official book cover work was for Cameron \"Morat\" Mouat for his book \"The Road to Fero City (Volume 1)\", which is an amazing book, so doing the cover was a great opportunity for me. My second cover project was for Caliber Comics\u0027 \"HP Lovecraft Early Stories\" in 2015. That was one of my proudest achievements since I\u0027m a Lovecraft fan, and also working with the amazing Gary Reed (Rest In Peace) was always a pleasure. Prior to Gary\u0027s passing, I was lucky enough to work with him on several \"Deadworld\" projects, including a sketch card project, three pieces in his \"Voices of the Deadworld\" graphic novel, and I contributed art for 2 labels for the \"Deadworld Zombie Soda\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, even though I draw a lot, being the sole provider for a large family of Shays and trying to make ends meet with the petty funds art usually generates means that often times I cannot afford things like graphite, ink, markers, etching tools, and the like, and it\u0027s difficult to continue to try to produce artistic stuff for the Earth. And, personally, I feel that Earth needs my art...because as they say, \"Earth without ART is just EH\". \u00a0Your support of me as an artist not only helps me create, but helps me take care of things that need taken care of, like, helping my little humans survive. So thanks for even considering helping a poor lad like myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I appreciate you who took the time to read this and appreciate even more anyone who chooses to support me and my meager works. Thanks a ton!!!"

I would like to have the flexibility to continue to tackle these artistic endeavors. But, the Shay Foundation (aka, my wallet) just cannot accommodate much artistic ventures at the present time. To have enough stability as an artist to provide for my family better while continuing to create the art I love so much would be a dream come true.
