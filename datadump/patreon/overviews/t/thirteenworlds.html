    "summary": "A little over a decade ago, I had an idea that I quickly realized could be turned into a rather large series of books to tell an epic story. I didn\u2019t have the courage then, despite friends and family telling me to pursue my dream. And, to be honest, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. At least, not at the time. The idea was far too raw, too basic. If I\u2019d attempted to tell it then, it would have fallen far short of the mark I feel it deserves. And it probably still will fall short, but I have confidence that I can at least come much closer than I would have back then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you all for the support, and joining me in this journey. I don\u2019t have all the answers as to where this will end, or if it ever will. But the joy will be in the experience, as any good journey is. And it is you that makes it possible. Sincerely and truly, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as a content warning goes; while I would not consider this work to be adult, I would rate it (at best guess) probably high PG-13 to low R for violence and themes. Nothing styalized or glorified, but violence nonetheless. Sex will be hinted at, but not detailed. Language... well, I\u2019ve never truly felt comfortable with strong language in writing unless truly necessary for a scene."
