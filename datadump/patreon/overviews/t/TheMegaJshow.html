I love a good angry review as much as the next person, but I wanted to celebrate what\u0027s great, interesting and fun about the games we love in a more positive way, making a fool of myself along the way!

Fancy.) These episodes tend to have some kind of unusual theme or setup framing the actual game-talk. Some might even have little storylines! \u003cstrong\u003eOscar-worthy\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\nThese full-sized episodes are released roughly once a month, since they\u0027re pretty time-consuming.

Mini episodes are short commentaries and scenes on any little pieces of games I want to talk about, varying from sharing memories about a game, pointing out something interesting, weird, or often overlooked, or just basically saying \"\u003cstrong\u003eLook at this thing! This thing is cool. This is a thing what I like.\u003c/strong\u003e\" I even have some ongoing series of Mini episodes planned, alongside the regular \u0027random game thing I want to talk about\u0027 episodes, so there\u0027s plenty of variety!\u003cbr\u003e\nMini episodes are much quicker to fully create since they\u0027re far simpler (though occasionally, I can\u0027t resist throwing in some fun little edits or scenes) and so are released much more regularly- usually at least once a week. Mini episodes tend to land in the 2-7 minutes range in length, depending on the content.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will occasionally be \u003cstrong\u003eother types\u003c/strong\u003e of videos too- usually videogame-related, but occasionally just some other fun, nerdy thing I want to share with you and have some fun with!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope to expand the show as I go- improved video quality, audio, green-screens, new types of videos, etc., so quality is likely to increase over time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAny and all support is super-super appreciated, you lovely awesome person, you! Your support goes directly into improving my recording setup, and keeping my content interesting. I\u0027m trying to do this stuff properly, so supporting me on Patreon ensures that the show keeps going, and that you keep getting a steady stream of content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you, you cool, cool people!\u003cbr\u003e"
