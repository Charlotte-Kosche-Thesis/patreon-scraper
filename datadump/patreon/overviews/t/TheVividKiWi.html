Thanks for taking the time to check out my content along with supporting it in any way possible! Ever since I first started creating content a decade ago I\u2019ve always loved to produce the content I\u2019m truly passionate about.

It\u2019s really discouraging to have to go through the trials and tribulations of Youtube\u2019s constant ongoing updates as they work to fix errors in the system such as their automatic detection bots. Whether it\u2019s a monetization issue or an advertiser-friendly issue, it\u2019s always nice having other platforms such as Patreon to help sustain the wonderful support from fans. It can really help out small creators in the long run, and I\u2019m looking forward to continuously improving my own Patreon to it\u2019s fullest potential!"
