    "summary": "Welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making YouTube videos as Nathan\u0027s Car Care in 2016 as a way to help others figure out what is wrong with their car and fix it themselves, no previous mechanic experience needed. I also make videos on routine car maintenance as well as vehicle mods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, I re-branded the channel to The Nate Take to give me more options for uploads, as changes to YouTube in late 2017 and early 2018 further reduced and restricted my channel. Now you can expect videos on many topics, such as woodworking, tool restoration, farming, car care, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that you have found my videos to be helpful. I enjoy making them, so there is nothing that can make me happier than knowing that they helped you out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what will I do with your pledges?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncrease the Production Value:\u003c/strong\u003e Running a YouTube channel, especially one like mine, is not free. All expense has been covered by myself. Whether it is the tools and parts needed in the video or video equipment and software. Pledges help to not only make things easier on me, but also increase the quality of the episodes much quicker.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIncrease the Frequency:\u003c/strong\u003e Working a full time job while trying to make videos on a weekly basis means that everything has to be done on days off and nights. Until I can justify this channel financially, I can not make as many videos as I would like.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFund Projects for More Interesting Content\u003c/strong\u003e I got some big ideas for different projects I can work on. By donating to this page, I can pursue those projects sooner than I will be able to on my own.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have found my content helpful in any way, and you want to help this channel out, this is the page you are looking for. Whether you decide to become one of my Patreons or not, I want to thank you for your support. If it wasn\u0027t for people like you, I wouldn\u0027t be here making videos! THANKS!!"
