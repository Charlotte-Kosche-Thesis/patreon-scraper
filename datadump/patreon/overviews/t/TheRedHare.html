I\u0027m The Red Hare from PoenaCullei and I\u0027m currently making a demo, with a great team behind me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, no matter how small, it will help us achieve our goals sooner. To thank you for your pledges, I hereby pledge to you to keep you up to date with the project. I will take on board your suggestions and feedback, and discuss with you aspects of the project; for I believe you all to be as much apart of this project as all of us here. All income received from Patreon is shared between the members of the team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eParricide\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are creating a game under the title of \"Parricide\". It is a mix of different elements; the first being a VN. The other element of the game is the game play \nitself. The game play is 2D and inspired by the Sengoku Rance style. These \ncharacters would be linked to characters within the VN, and characters \nwould be unlocked from each area (from the second aspect of the game) or\n after each map. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe focus is on war, and the nature of it. By\n taking inspiration from WW2 across Europe, we have developed our own \nmap and countries, with an alternative twist on the elements that both \nlead up and events that took place, whilst adding our own spin. This \ngame features a heavy military theme throughout, with minor historical \nchanges to give us a more open platform to work upon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\n adult element is 18/21+ including mature themes throughout; including \ndeath, sex, gay sex and other mature themes. In order to reach our \ngoals, we are writing two versions of events/scenes. One will be PG-13, \nsuitable and aimed for a Steam release; whilst the other very much an \nadults only version, which would be available for free in the form of a \npatch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are currently working on the demo version (Chapter 0) of the game, in order to gain further feedback and funding before working on the full (Chapter 1) game itself. The demo will not be a simple alpha updated each month with a new cg, instead we aim to release a full demo (\u0026gt;50k words) which would be fully playable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
