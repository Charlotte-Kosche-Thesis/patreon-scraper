It\u0027s coming a little bit unexpectedly, but I wasn\u0027t really expecting to enjoy drawing nudes and pinups so much either! :D\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I want most is to be able to not only keep drawing what I do as a hobby, but make it a full time job and be able to expand into other types of products, namely dating sims(both sfw and very much not ;D), comics, and animations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach person who contributes, whether it\u0027s one dollar or fifty, helps me to keep going a little further than I could\u0027ve before.
