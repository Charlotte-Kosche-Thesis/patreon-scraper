Our favourite quote goes, \"We travel not to escape life, but for life not to escape us.\" \u003cbr\u003eThis move certainly was not easy by any means. In fact, we both sacrificed many things back home to make this a possibility. Tokyo is a very vibrant and exciting place. Thus, we have created our channel as a way to log our memories while being able to share many of our experiences with you all. Our Patreon page is created for the purpose of accepting support for the ones who wish and want to give a little extra. We will most definitely use every bit of your love and support towards making better videos for you all to enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you from the bottom of our hearts,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThomas \u0026amp; Tracey\u003cbr\u003e"
