At this level you\u0027re seriously contributing to my ability to schedule and travel to perform interviews for my upcoming documentary series \"The Future of Freedom\". I\u0027m funding this project with a micro-budget, and as I make the film I\u0027m releasing the interviews in their entirety; this way the audience gets to see much more than just the finished film, and I get to make films I couldn\u0027t normally afford. It\u0027s a win/win for everyone and is much easier to manage in parts than as one big project.\u003cbr\u003e",
