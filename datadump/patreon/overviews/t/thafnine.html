Maybe you\u0027ve actually watched till the end of my videos or I\u0027ve tweeted it out in the middle of the night and you\u0027ve actually looked at the links that I post instead of muting it. Well, this is my Patreon. It\u0027s a barren land at the moment, but all the better to have a face to face conversation with you, somewhere in the middle of nowhere... just you and I, although I\u0027m pre-typing this because I won\u0027t have a chance to actually talk to you... unless you click the PLEDGE BUTTON if I\u0027ve worded it correctly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo why have I made a Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell please consult this screenshot of a Premiere Pro document I have on my PC. Take a good look at it. This is not a fabrication of the effort that goes into the production of a video, this is only 3 minutes of a 25 minute video I have to edit (or have edited, depending on when I post this) and this took around 5 hours to do. No joke. \u003cstrong\u003eEditing is hard.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0And it\u0027s what I have to do as well as design for a living until I leave college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/V9OOlJP.png\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money that\u0027s made from Patreon goes to the bills I have to pay monthly. Because corporations are getting a tad bit greedier and have forced to extorting money from young impressionable students and designers such as I, I\u0027m forced to pay obscene amounts of money each month in order to continue doing what I do best, which isn\u0027t procrastinating and leaving work until the very last nanosecond.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut what will you get if you pledged?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Q28FlL4.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see this? This render? You want to know how I made it? Do you want to try and make a version like that for yourself but don\u0027t know why because you suck at working in a 3D environment? Do you want to feel patronised? If you answered yes to all of these questions, this Patreon\u0027s not for you. If you answered yes to more than 65% of these questions, then this Patreon is indeed for you and you will get what you asked for. Mostly. As in I can\u0027t rely on my internet connection to upload everything, but I\u0027ll TRY and give you everything. You can also talk to me and potentially get some 1 on 1 tutorials and the best of the best who never rest will receive lessons at my behest so pledge to this nest so I can afford at least a vest lest and complete my quest. That took a lot longer to think of than I would like to admit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think the intro video (that should be there soon) will probably give you a bit more of an insight into the type of stuff I do and need from you guys in order to continue doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheers\u003cbr\u003e- Thaf\u003cbr\u003e"
