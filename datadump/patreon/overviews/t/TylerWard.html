My goal is to create ART WITH PURPOSE. There is a lot of preparation, conversation, journaling, writing, recording, editing, mixing, (insert that stress emoji here), etc...AND...Throw an extra 10/30 hours due to my overly obsessive perfectionist nature (insert a professor with glasses emoji).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALSO...as much as I love creating, I\u0027m not a fan on finding the resources to do so. And that can make things a liiiiiiitttttttllleeeeee difficult. It makes this little cowboy (at heart) from Colorado feel slightly overwhelmed and a little stressed out. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT thanks to Patreon we have a solution! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYOU are the solution! Without you, I\u0027m back home, living in my dad\u0027s basement, folding mom\u0027s laundry. \u00a0Soooooo...I need your support, your patronage, YOU, so that I can continue share more art with you.\u00a0When I\u2019m inspired, I like to create, and \u00a0you guys make it possible!

So...your support helps me wear all the hats. I\u0027m kind of like the CEO and the Janitor of the Tyler Ward Music business.\u00a0One day, I will find another Tyler Ward to help me with everything...and that\u0027s gonna be awesome, and then hopefully you guys can help support that guy too. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) You support will help grow my career as a social media artist. Growth takes investment and risk. \u00a0You\u0027ve now become my investor. That\u0027s\u00a0rad. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3) Your support will allow me to mentor young artists and help them become self-sustaining brands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are in this together! \u00a0So whether you\u0027re backing me for a dollar or $1,000,000,000.00 (yep - one billion) I am so thankful you\u0027re here!!! Every patron who\u0027s supporting me is valuable to me and to this community, YOU\u0027RE who I\u0027m creating for, and I\u2019m so glad you found me here. We are a family :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALSO...don\u0027t forget, you will get cool things in return...scroll down to see what you get :) We can always change, adjust or add  anything to these tiers. We can keep tweaking this thing as we go.
