    "summary": "Hello everyone, and welcome to The Critical Order\u0027s Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jesse Lab and I am the sole writer for The Critical Order. I started off writing the Critical Order on a whim back in October of 2013. I was a person with opinion and loved to share my ideas, thoughts, and beliefs on all forms of media. I went to college for a degree in History, Theatre, and Education, but over time I began to focus a lot of media studies independently.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, what was once originally a fun little hobby became something much more. I went from posting whenever to having a weekly schedule. I went from barely scraping a dozen readers together to hundreds per post. I won\u0027t say that it\u0027s an incredible success, but it\u0027s a small community that I\u0027m at least very proud of. I truly believe that people want to hear honest opinions about movies, games, and shows that they\u0027re interested in and are willing to read an article as long as it\u0027s entertaining, well written, and is thought provoking. I aim to make every article I write have that level of quality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut you might be asking \u003cstrong\u003e\"Jesse, what do you even talk about on your site???\"\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I\u0027m glad you ask!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy primary form of reviews come from \u003cstrong\u003eMOVIE REVIEWS\u003c/strong\u003e. I review anywhere between 30-40 movies in a year, all of which release on Mondays. On Thursdays you can find my \u003cstrong\u003eVIDEO GAME REVIEWS\u003c/strong\u003e, where I review new video games after I have completed them. On the first Sunday of January, April, July, and October I have \u003cstrong\u003eANIME REVIEWS\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ewhere I look at 4-6 shows that were streaming in the past three months and discuss them. I also occasionally do \u003cstrong\u003eTOP 10\u0027s\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and \u003cstrong\u003eRETROSPECTIVES \u003c/strong\u003eof franchises of genres that I find interesting, whether it\u0027s looking back at the history of \u003cem\u003eStar Wars \u003c/em\u003eor talking about my 10 favorite movies of last year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVery infrequently I will update an ongoing retrospective that I write called \u003cstrong\u003eONE PIECE: UNLIMITED RETROSPECTIVE\u003c/strong\u003e, a massive look back at the history, stories, characters, and my own personal experiences with the \u003cem\u003eOne Piece \u003c/em\u003efranchise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you may be asking yourself \u003cstrong\u003e\"Jesse, if I do donate to your Patreon, what will my money be used for???\" \u003c/strong\u003eIn short, money break down like this. As of right now, all of the money donate will be saved up to create an official site that is not connected to Blogger. I have been working on Blogger for years, but I feel like I have reached a point where I should expand to new territories. \u003cstrong\u003eAll of the money donated to The Critical Order will be spent on creating a new website, ideally professionally, to house all past, present, and future site content.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Once the site has been created, all donations from then on will be used to help alleviate the costs of creating reviews. That means movie tickets, game costs, streaming subscription services so I don\u0027t have to pirate content, and securing resources for retrospectives and Top 10\u0027s. In an ideal months, this is how much I would spend for the site.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$50 - $100\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for the latest video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$20 - $40 \u003c/strong\u003eto see the latest movies\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$10 \u003c/strong\u003efor subscription services like Crunchyroll\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$10 - $20 \u003c/strong\u003efor securing physical or digital copies of retrospective materials\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow again you may be asking yourself, \"\u003cstrong\u003eJesse, I think I want to donate, but what will I get in return???\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTo be quite honest, I don\u0027t have much to offer back in return. I can offer you my thanks, but that may not be enough for some people. While I\u0027m still working on ideas for backer rewards, and I would love to come up with some community specific rewards, I can offer a handful of things right now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you donate \u003cstrong\u003e$1\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to The Critical Order, you will receive access to seasonal voting and access to reviews a day early. Reviews will come out on Sunday on Patreon and you can access them a full day before anyone else. You\u0027ll also be able to decide every three months what I will watch for a week. It will usually be between three options and you will have access to voting for at least a month to decide what I\u0027m going to watch.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you truly believe in me and want to donate anything more than \u003cstrong\u003e$1, \u003c/strong\u003eI can really only offer one thing; my thanks. It\u0027s your money and I believe that you should pay for something that you really do believe in. You should be able to donate however much you want to support whoever you want. A \u003cstrong\u003e$1 \u003c/strong\u003edonation has as much value to me as a \u003cstrong\u003e$10\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003edonation. \u003cstrong\u003ePayments will be monthly\u003c/strong\u003e, but if you truly do want to support me as a content creator or a friend, I have a special tier for \u003cstrong\u003e$25\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0a month where you will directly decide one thing I have to review once every three months. If you care about me that much, it\u0027s the least I can do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that that all explained enough to you and if you\u0027re still not convinced, I have links below to some of my favorite reviews of last year, 2017. Give them a look, and please consider donating. It would mean the world to me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thecriticalorder.blogspot.com/2017/03/nintendo-switch-review.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNintendo Switch Review\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thecriticalorder.blogspot.com/2017/08/the-dark-tower-review.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Dark Tower Review\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thecriticalorder.blogspot.com/2017/08/sonic-mania-review.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSonic Mania Review\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thecriticalorder.blogspot.com/2017/10/the-top-20-comic-book-villains-10-1.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Top 20 Comic Book Villains: 10-1\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thecriticalorder.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-top-10-best-movies-of-2017.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Top 10 Best Movies of 2017\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
