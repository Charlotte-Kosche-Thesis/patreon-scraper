We are not simply satisfied with consuming media without understanding what makes it tick. We are dedicated to curiosity and criticism, as well as education and evaluation. We make video essays primarily on music but have no reservations against moving into other facets of pop-culture. We are inspired to educate our viewers by allowing them to be able to view pop culture with an inquisitive and discerning eye. In a world of first-listen reviews and click-bait criticism, our aim is not to make sweeping, broad opinions or endorsements, but simply to illuminate and enlighten. Of course there is rarely any critical work that will not have some sort of bias, but no specific kind of agenda will be our main focus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrimarily, The Most Unruly writes and creates Video Essays/Mini Documentaries currently about the craft and inspirations of popular music artists. We do plan in the future to cover other mediums of pop culture as well, but for now it\u0027s all about the music. A \u00a0couple examples include the latest video\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/RCv2rf7KvVg\"\u003e\"Kanye West: The Making of Yeezus\"\u003c/a\u003e and one of our earlier entries\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/4fqjLrcHfQI\"\u003e\"Kendrick Lamar: Blackberries and White Lies\"\u003c/a\u003e The former is an analysis of the staging of Kanye\u0027s live concert tours, while the latter delves into the artistic philosphical argument of \"artists who copy\" vs \"artists who steal.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do you need our money??\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m only able to produce so much with the little amount of free time/resources that I have. Your pledges will help me make doing this thing full time even more feasible. I will be able to use the money to invest in the many resources that it takes to keep something like this running. I currently do this all by myself. I write it, narrate it, source footage and photos, edit it, and handle all social media. I have a consultant who helps me during the editing process, but other than that, it is all me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is intensive research as well as editing, motion graphics, audio recording that goes into these video essays and I would love to get you guys the best products possible. The research is the most important aspect of all of this, and your donations will allow me to free up time to truly commit to diving head first into thouroughly researching and writing these videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your pledges I can also allocate money to investing in higher production value, such as more original motion graphics/animation/footage in order to really make these videos come alive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you post?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDepends on the subject... typically twice a week. But patrons will only be charged TWICE a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can we help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating! You will receive many thanks from me and may even get your name in the credits depending on how much you donate. There will be download links available for those who pledge $3 and above. Those who pledge the $30 and $40 pledges will also get a Noisy Images official T-Shirt as a sign of grattitude.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso! For those who cannot simply afford to pledge, I completely understand. However, if you know anyone who would be interested in donating, please feel free to share this along with them! Every little bit helps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you to those who have pledged, those who consider pledging and those who just love to watch! Much love to you all!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember to visit the blog for occasional updates at noisyimages.com"
