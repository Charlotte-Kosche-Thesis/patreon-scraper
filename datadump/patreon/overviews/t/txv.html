    "summary": "...realtime so that the rough edges that you see, the unfinished bits, are as part of the narrative, part of the story itself, or maybe clues to the end. \u00a0since we have already begun freely i will continue this story for free and in a freely associative but focused manner from beginning to the very end of it, so please do not be afraid to begin for fear that i will leave you hanging on the edge of your seat outside of a paywall. \u00a0i will not do that. \u00a0that is not the way this story ends. \u00a0not if i get to have any say about it. \u00a0so at least there\u0027s that. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003etwo things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003efirst, from your perspective,\u00a0as you read the story from the beginning to end, you might find that it does become, as things do, reshaped by the medium in terms of form, so you might have to skip over pages that are \"hidden\" in this way as you scroll past. \u00a0it will benefit the narrative not to clutter it up with unrelated topics, at the very least, probably. \u00a0 those might be other stories, or just notes to myself, or other ideas and side projects or some such type of wonderful thing (and i encourage you to get involved in that way at some point) but those bits have nothing to do with this narrative, so don\u0027t worry about it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003esecond, a simple note that since the \u003cem\u003emedium\u003c/em\u003e we are dealing with here is not a book, and yet we must start at the beginning (otherwise things won\u0027t make sense), note that the first page, page one, is the very very bottom of all the pages as they scroll, so that to go from page one to page two to page three we will not be scrolling down, we will be scrolling up. \u00a0that is the nature of this particular narrative for now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ealso:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eblogs are nice but this is not a blog. \u00a0or at least i am trying to build a thing that is a bit different than that. \u00a0a blog is your favorite show where you tune to see the latest adventures, and one watches the episodes in any order. \u00a0this is (or will be) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"like a mini-series that comes to a conclusion eventually but is long enough that you might not want to binge watch all of the episodes at once. \u00a0?\"\u003cbr\u003e\"longer than a short story and shorter than a novel?\"; \u00a0\"longer? \u00a0shorter?\"\u003cbr\u003eand such.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eadditionally, the blog as we know it, even in its most noble state, is the sort of thing which exists within the realms of the cult of personality, so to speak, which is all well and good, but that is a bit of a different thing than what it means to tell the tale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003elastly, before we begin (even though we already have begun), i will tell you why i am doing this here in this way and not elsewhere in some other way, which on the one hand is self evident and of self- reference. \u00a0without getting into it all here, i will say that i find myself in a place at the end of things, in a way, a place somewhat darker and more lonely than any i have ever seen or heard of, and i found at some point that i was utterly without hope and completely alone. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei write to you from that place now. \u00a0the quiet is nice. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand except for the sounds of distant fireworks and the noises that the wild field mouse makes as she climbs around things in the kitchen and plops down to the floor and the ghosts which are really just the noises of the house settling, or at least i tell myself that even though it is not true, for the moment it is at that level of quiet which is occupied only by the whirring white noise of a very quiet refrigerator and a couple ticking clocks. \u00a0it is the middle of the night. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand i am writing to you my dear reader and you do not exist. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003enot yet, not here, not now, and maybe never. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei am, then, imagining that there is a future where you do exist, that is, a future where my efforts here are not completely futile, and because of the nature of this particular platform in the virtual space i can equally imagine there would be theoretically the possibility that i might actually see the end of it before i run out of steam, from its alpha to its omega so to speak. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[i return to this later and wonder if it is too dark. \u00a0it probably is. \u00a0i make a note of it then, or make a note to myself that my mood has changed or at least is somewhat variable though the situation really has not changed. \u00a0i ran an errand on my bike in the evening and it is of the early summer just past the halfweek containing the longest day, the solstice, and all of that -- but the evening was cool and there were plenty of jackrabbits along the trail. \u00a0and as for the solstice, the clock i have been building which indicates sunrise and sunset and the various levels of twilight for the entire annum, it is generally correct to form and so i see the concept is accurate but the implementation itself will require one additional set of, well whatever it is not yet finished.]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eanyway, as far as readership and all that, i am not yet so far gone as to think that any of these outcomes are really probable so much, but sid quo pro it is at least possible, and where there is that possibility, i will occupy then, for the moment, since after a certain extent, to be utterly without hope is similar to being without air. \u00a0it is fatal. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand so for that Patreon, \u003cem\u003efor that\u003c/em\u003e, i will say thank you. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eother than that, the situation that i found myself in, that would prompt me to this attempt, was that i had a vision of a sort, a vision of all of space and time folding out in all directions and all chronologies and such, and as to the exact nature of the shape of it, that is, the actual morphology across multiple dimensions and all that. \u00a0and whereas one might expect that such a vision can occur from time to time as a result of complete inebriation or moldy bread, but then fade away as if a dream upon waking, the nature of this particular vision seemed to grip me with an unshakable hold so that it remained with me in such a way that as i went about my daily routine it simply did not leave, and i continued to study it as i ran errands and ate and even as i slept so that i would go to sleep and then seem to wake up right where i had left off, detailing it in a sort of mathematical way, and even though it was a vision as to the very fundamental nature of reality at the same time actual reality took a step back from me and i found that i was being absent-minded in every way so that i would be looking for the sunglasses that were perched on top of my head or utterly unable to find the coffee that i had just set down a minute ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eit got so bad that at one point i went to take a hot shower and then realized that i could not since they had shut of my gas and then upon reflection i remembered helping the nice lady around to the back of the house myself so that she could find the meter since the back forty is all overgrown with bushes and trees and tall grass so that she never would have found it otherwise. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei had just put it out of my mind, then to have to deal with it when i would have to deal with, and later i commenced upon the lengthy and involved ritual that is the voice mail and robot voices and estimated wait times and distorted elevator music and the process of negotiations and account numbers and all that to correct the situation and was bothered by exactly none of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei was bothered by exactly none of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eit was at that point i began to question my sanity. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[this is not the end point but this is the work in progress and so i must stop here for a bit and attend to other important matters like sleep. \u00a0so far so good. \u00a0]\u003cbr\u003e[i return to this later and note that excessive drama may in fact trivialize a thing more than to make it, um, to communicate. \u00a0might add or subtract more later. \u00a0or move things around. \u00a0or whatever.]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ecertainly then i will at least posit this, of all the fictions which there are to ponder which are also all of current events cooling to history as distorted by perspective and the retelling of it always from the perspective of those with agendas, and also of all the fictions which exist to entertain in one way or another, or even the petty dramas which are the nature of survival which immediately become not as fictions but perhaps distorted one way or another from a person\u0027s perspective, i do think there is something to be said for the actual pondering of how it is that all of space and time are laid out, from the actual perspective of what it is like to be a person existing in it, and the nature of the observer to the experiment, and all this nonsense. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[he scrolls down and might edit page one some more, or later...]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[
