    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTritonic Games is allegedly a studio, but in practice \"employs\" a grand total of one person: me, Ziz Fishman. (We-as-in-royal-we are looking to fix that, but, y\u0027know, money.) I\u0027m a bitter, pretentious, insufferable jerk who makes games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so, like: describe that shit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m developing a narrative-driven JRPG built around combining a challenging, tactical battle system with intricate worldbuilding, and complex character-driven storytelling. The goal is to build an experimental, progressive take on the genre that blends a rich setting, smart storytelling, and expressive mechanics into a compelling, unforgettable experience.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the current juncture I don\u0027t want to go into an excess of detail because I\u0027d rather save that for a more \"proper\" unveiling, but let\u0027s at least get an elevator pitch out of the way right now:\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlayers take on the role of Jeanne, a coarse but highly capable young hunter who finds herself drawn into an unwinding conspiracy with implications far beyond her imagining, both for the uneasy peace that exists in the aftermath of a brutal, destructive 200-Year War, and for the larger course of human history. Players will be tasked with exploring devious dungeons, mastering an intricate combat system in order to hold their own against merciless foes, and utilizing potent mechanized weapons platforms born of the synthesis of magic and cutting-edge technology to seek out the truth and forge a path forward.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m fond of the genre and want to do something really cool within that framework; toward that end, this project is drawing on influences as distinct as The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, Mother 3, Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne, and The World Ends With You. (There\u0027s also more than a bit of Pok\u00e9mon going on in the battle system, if I\u0027m honest.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, but shouldn\u0027t you have screenshots or jiffs or something?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eProbably, but my art skills ain\u0027t great, which means that front is in fact lagging just a bit. But, uh, watch this space, anyway. (Long-term my aim is to bring someone onboard to help square that particular circle.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, how does this work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAight, so let\u0027s start with what my goals are: I want to a) do this full-time and b) have the ability to hire some help and take off some of the truly dizzying pile of hats I\u0027m wearing right now, and I\u0027m accepting funding toward that end. My goal is to be capable of dedicating as much of my time as possible toward the end of making this happen... but, obviously, if I just try and do that without lining up some funding I will get very little work done on account of the fact that I will have stopped doing anything to produce money for important work-enabling things like food. That\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get in turn? Weekly devlogs every Sunday, first off, which are admittedly a bare-minimum sort of thing. Additionally: this is a very worldbuilding-intensive sort of project, so I\u0027m going to try to provide micro-fiction and in-universe datafiles and things to help you get a feel for the world I\u0027m building. I\u0027m aiming to start providing those weekly alongside the devlogs starting September 10. (Right now I\u0027m still compiling a bunch of notes into a more useful form, sorry!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso coming, albeit on a slightly hazy timetable, is a preview build demonstrating the battle system and allowing you to get a feel for some early gameplay. This is still well down the road, but I want to get it out there as soon as I can do that and feel satisfied that it at least roughly captures what I\u0027m doing at scale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re contributed any amount at all prior to a formal announcement, you get this for free... whenever it launches. If you\u0027re jumping on board this early you \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e in for the long haul and I\u0027m not gonna try to get you coming and going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally: it goes without saying that you\u0027ll be afforded a place in the credits. I can\u0027t do this without you and I\u0027m cognizant of that fact, so the least I can do is pay you the thanks you\u0027re owed.\u003cbr\u003e"
