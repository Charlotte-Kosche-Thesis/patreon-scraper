My name is Zachary and I am looking to create my own little clothing store! :D\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eMy story\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nThe main reason I ever wanted to start up my own little shop is because I wanted to give a better quality of clothing to my friends and family, making marvelous costumes and clothes. However over the past few years I have found keeping a job and managing bills to be very difficult as I deal with a chronic illness known as Crohns Disease. Its made my life incredibly difficult but I won\u0027t ever give up my dreams! But unfortunately I cannot do this alone, I need your help! I need loving supporters like you to help my dream become a reality.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe second main reason is because of my loving friends. They showed me how amazing the world can be, and its really impacted my life in the best of ways \u0026lt;3 So to all of my friends, I say thank you! Its why I am going to try new things and venues! I am going to create and focus more on my own fashions and designs. I want to bring a world of pure fun and imagination back to the stressful lives of us adults! Thus I will be making toon and kid themed clothes, toys and projects that all ages can enjoy!\u00a0\u00a0Not to mention wondrous projects you guys want to see! I really look forward to serving the wonderful community we can build here!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eCheck out my new store!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheToddlingTailor\"\u003ehttps://www.etsy.com/shop/TheToddlingTailor\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCheck out my Redbubble for new designs!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/people/toddling-tailor?asc=u\"\u003ehttps://www.redbubble.com/people/toddling-tailor?a...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eCheck out my new Website!\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thetoddlingtailor.wixsite.com/website\"\u003ehttps://thetoddlingtailor.wixsite.com/website\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 220, 219);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(229, 185, 183);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eWhy do I need a Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a good opportunity for those who want to support the struggling creators you love.
