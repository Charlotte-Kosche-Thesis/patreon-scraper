    "summary": "So first up \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e. Thank you so much for considering this, and for believing in it enough to be a part of it. You\u0027re legends just for being here, and I truly cannot say how much that means to me. So instead, I promise to show you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Peekay Gunn: genderqueer, 26 and mixed race. I started The Rhetorical because I love writing. I think that a well placed word can make or break someone\u0027s day. Stories, poetry, essays, reviews, all have the chance to shape our world and I\u0027m really glad you\u0027ve decided to be a part of that. This is a journey for me, and being able to do what I love and also give value to someone else is brilliant.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon? Well in all honesty, it\u0027s because I like the freedom. I think there\u0027s value in what I do and I want to do more of it. I want to be able to produce things that make people laugh, or cry or think \"Damn, where do I find me a person like that?\". All of that takes time and money, and right now I work a full time job. That means that at the moment this is what I can post: \u003cbr\u003eA new piece of flash fiction or poetry weekly. A new part of The Dog monthly and a new non fiction post monthly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0want to work towards doing this full time, towards posting more content and more frequently, towards building a community and going on this journey together. I\u0027d like to make the dog\u0027s dream of 24/7 access to me come true while giving something back to you legends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo again, thank you!"
