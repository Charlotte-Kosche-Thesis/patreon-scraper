I am a amateur 3D artist designing and creating Giantess Content for everyone who has a passion for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started out a long time ago, but really, I have only been doing it as a hobby because I have a real job and I don\u0027t really have time to spend time on creating content. I am creating this patreon page in hopes that anyone who likes and support my work will support me financially. By doing so, I will have a lot of stress relieved from working all the time and I can focus on designing more content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eWhat to expect when supporting me:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am just going to be honest and say that I am not as great as other 3D Giantess artists out there who has their work masterfully crafted because I am more of a fast worker. Most of the content I produce comes straight from the 3D program without any post processing work or touch-ups whatsoever. All of the dialogue within my comics come from the top of my head and I improvise with what I have as I move to create one picture to the next. This is why you may find grammar errors, plot holes, things that are trying to be explained but end up way too complexed, and probably dialogues that do not make sense. Sorry, I am not really not that good in English.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to say, depending on the financial support I receive on here, I may have to balance my workload from creating comics to working in real life because I still need to put food on the table, pay bills, etc... So at any given time, I may go on a short hiatus that can last from a few days to a few months. If this happens, I want to apologize in advanced and you may withdraw your support from me if you want. But if you don\u0027t, I want to say that I really appreciate it and it could help me to getting back on creating comics for you all faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all the being said, I still have a passion to produce giantess content to the best of my ability even though it might not be as great and awesome as some other artists I\u0027ve seen, but all of my creations will always be FREE for the foreseeable future. Again, this page is simply for donations to support me financially and is completely optional. I thank you for the time you took for reading this. Please, as always, enjoy my work!"
