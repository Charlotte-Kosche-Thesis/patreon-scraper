Bringing characters and stories to life is my passion, through written and visual mediums alike. To me, video games are a phenomenal means of delivering an impactful and memorable storytelling experience. So I\u2019m heading into game development! I have specialized in digital art for over a decade, and pursued a degree in video game art and animation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo what are you doing?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently part of a small team that is working to develop our very first indie game. I\u2019m the artist and coauthor of the project: Sojourn of the Songless. We are in the preproduction phase, so my goal is to share a fair amount of its artistic development from the very start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is the game about?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a story that starts with tragedy. A cataclysmic event, an entire world doomed. Our protagonist\u2019s journey begins after his demise. Name and identity lost in death, he is now known only as the \u201cSongless\u201d. When the Songless awakens in the afterlife, he finds he has not \u201creturned to the stars\u201d as his people believe. Instead, our protagonist is before the Vestibule of Hell, and he is not alone. Pursued by the twisted remains of the humans that once lived alongside him, the only choice is to press onward\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMore about the Songless:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Songless is a \u201cdaemon\u201d, a race of beings that are neither mortal, nor infernal, nor divine. This particular species is my personal twist on familiar concepts. They are inspired by the daemons and muses (with just a dash of incubi) of classical mythology. I will be posting much more about them in the days to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow does Patreon fit into all of this?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating a game is always a considerable endeavor, especially when the development team is small. Patreon is an awesome means of garnering support for this project. Your patronage will give me the opportunity to dedicate more of my time towards its development from an artistic and storytelling standpoint. That is a pretty exciting prospect to me, because the more I create, the more I can share with all of you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all of your interest and support! And be sure to keep checking in \u2013 as everything progresses, reward contributions from the rest of the team will also become available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eReward Notes\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e* All discounts are applied after cost of item/shipping/credit card fees are deducted. Store front is not currently available, but will be accessible in the coming months.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Patreon Exclusive art will not be made available for free online viewership.
