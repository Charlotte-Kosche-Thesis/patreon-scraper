    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s up everyone this is TheGameViruss also known as The G-G-G-G-G-Viruss.\u003c/strong\u003e I have created this Patreon page as a option for my fans who have consumed and enjoyed tons of my content to give a little back and show their support towards this free entertainment i have been providing since August 9th 2010. A lot of my most dedicated fans have expressed willingness to donate money to me for the work i have put into my channel and the hours of entertainment i have given them throughout the years. In no way do i do this hobby of let\u0027s playing soley for monetary gain but i feel a little financial support from my viewers might help me out a tad bit and also help them get to see particular playthroughs of games they want a little faster than if they just waited for me to purchase it on my own. I have spent loads of money on this channel in hopes of bettering the quality of content my viewers receive, whether it be from buying new capturing cards, new microphones, new computers and equipment or games purchased solely for the purpose of playing for and on my YouTube channel. I will continue to spend what money I can in order to bring you better quality video and audio and more of what you guys want as far as game playthroughs are concerned. However, sometimes games or projects i want to bring to you guys and games you request to see me play have to be postponed or shelved because I don\u0027t have sufficient funds. The plan is to always do my best to deliver my subscribers what they want to see from me. Even if you decide not to pledge ill still try to bring you guys those games and that quality you want to the best of my abilities, unfortunately it might take a little longer than my fans would prefer. At the end of the day all i really want is your viewership and participation on my gaming channel, that is whats most essential and gratifying to me. However, I do see the benefits and advantages to having a donate option available. If there are games you specifically want to see me play that are hard to find, expensive, or not really on my radar pledge to this Patreon to make it easier for those desires to come to reality. If I have ever inspired you to make your own channel or if my viewers and fans want to donate just to show your love and appreciation for what i do and the hard work i put into my channel, that is welcome aswell. Don\u0027t worry, I will never charge for a video. my content will always be free. AIl I request is a monthly donation of whatever you can spare. I wholeheartedly thank you for all of your support and love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheGameViruss."
