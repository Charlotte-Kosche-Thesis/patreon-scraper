    "summary": "Hello friends,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other day I was joking around about how I would totally abuse Patreon to monetize my terrible Batman vs Superman hot takes, but then some people were like \"Do iiiiiit!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first response was to actually create a a semi-serious Patreon page and make a big old joke out of it. Then a few people actually made a pledge, which means MAYBE I should take this a little more seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, let\u0027s talk shop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I have to offer?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you are reading this, there is a good chance that you are already following me on Twitter.\u003cbr\u003eWhat I am trying to be there is just a tiny drop of sunshine in the angry mob. With my Twitter activity I have made some amazing and interesting friends and was able to dip my toe in the \"Gaming Industry\" pool, which has been an amazing experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Twitter lead to some writing, my writing led to some industry events and all of that led to me going \"I wish I could hang out with these people all the time and record the conversations and call it a podcast\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s what I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout a month ago I started \"The Hashcast\" and it has been a lot of fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow here is what I want this show to be and hopefully with your support, I can actually up the production levels a little to make it a better experience for everyone involved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHalf the episodes, I want to hang out with my friends and talk about cool stuff. This could be video game related, movies, comic books anything that I think you\u0027ll find interesting.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve done a few of those and I believe they made for some jolly episodes which will hopefully keep you company on a boring drive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the other half, I want to use my network of industry experts and make them available to you as well. When I have interesting people on the show, I want to pick their brains on your behalf.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you interested in getting into PR? I\u0027ll try to get one of the PR people on the show and ask them about their career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to know about the challenges of professional voice acting? Let\u0027s get some of them online and ask them exactly that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think that is worth a listen and want to drop me $1 I\u0027ll gladly use that support to make it a better show for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mean, I am already doing the show, but if I can recover some of the cost that would make everything easier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be transparent about that; If add all costs together I am probably looking at about $800-900 a year in hosting fees, licencing and subscription services to do what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet there be no mistake though, I\u0027m already gladly spending that because I like doing this, but as I said, it will make everything a whole lot more comfortable!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGiving Back\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are willing to pledge to this project of mine, I am willing to pledge something as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the $256 goal, 10% of all my Patreon income will go to charity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that amount of money, I would be very well covered and there is no need for me to just keep that all to myself. I already have some charities in mind, but perhaps i\u0027ll one day let the audience pick from a short list for some of that participation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, none of the above should mean you HAVE to throw anything my way.\u003cbr\u003eThe show will always be available for free to anyone as long as I can afford it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust listening and engaging is already the kind of support that makes this worth it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for checking me out and I am looking forward to providing you with some entertainment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWout\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
