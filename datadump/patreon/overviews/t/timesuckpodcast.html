    "summary": "Hello Timesucker! Why are we here? Why do the Secret Suck at all? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, because it\u0027s important to me to keep this podcast truly independent and a monthly subscriber base is the only way to do that. With a monthly subscription base, Timesuck is not beholden to any podcast network - I invested my own money in hosting, equipment, and even leased an office and built out a studio to produce this show the way I want to without any outside oversight - and I want to keep Timesuck independent. Although some episodes of Timesuck are sponsored and hopefully sponsors continue to support Timesuck, I never want to be\u003cem\u003e dependent\u003c/em\u003e on sponsors. Being dependent on corporate income can easily lead to compromise. A subscription base allows me to hire the support I need to keep the show going, turn down work that would take my focus away from Timesuck, actually pay my bills with Timesuck which allows me to continue to focus on and improve the show you already like, and keep the integrity of Timesuck alive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, a weekly subscriber base, for whatever reason, pleases the FUCK out of Nimrod. It is Nimrod\u0027s will. And Nimrod\u0027s will must be followed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you and I hope you love the Secret Suck! Space Lizards unite!\u00a0"

A $5 monthly pledge gets you 20% off of all Timesuck merch (you get a discount code) and access to other, exclusive merch only available to Space Lizards. You also get a new weekly podcast, the Secret Suck, where Space Lizards can send in voice messages to be heard on the podcast and monitor the movements of \u00a0the man who fears Space Lizards like no one has before or since. Who is this man? Listen to the Secret Suck and find out. The Secret Suck is full of secrets! Also, twice a month you get to vote for what some of the next month\u0027s Timesuck topics should be. As a Space Lizard, you control the fate of the Suck! AND, you get a new standup album currently only available to Space Lizards - Feel the Heat. Just under 45 minutes of previously unreleased standup recorded in Portland, OR in late 2017. \u00a0So much content for $5 a month! And most importantly, if at least 2,000 Timesuckers sign up, you will be guaranteeing that the show is here to stay. $10,000 a month will cover employee costs, additional operating expenses, continued app and web development, etc. Thank you for supporting Timesuck!!!!\u00a0",
