    "summary": "In case you haven\u2019t heard of us, The Penumbra Podcast is a\ntwice-monthly series of free audio dramas that present genres you know in ways you might not expect. Our main series follows Juno Steel, a wise-cracking, depressive, bisexual\nPrivate Eye in Hyperion City, Mars... but alternating with that series are\none-shot short stories encompassing genres like horror, Western, and fantasy. In the worlds brought to you by The Penumbra, you\u0027ll meet a diverse cast of characters, like a crafty genderqueer bandit, a talkative disabled knight who uses a horse instead of a wheelchair, and an uptight but effortlessly cool lesbian agent of the space FBI. We believe that everyone deserves to see themselves represented in stories, and we\u0027re doing our part to make that happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u2019ve loved bringing you all of our creepy, clever, queer,\nand crazy stories so far with The Penumbra, and with your help we know that we\ncan bring you even higher-quality episodes from a cast and crew more dedicated\nthan ever.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have three essential goals for the money we gain from\nthis campaign, centering on The Penumbra\u2019s core values. Those goals are: to\n\u003cstrong\u003eimprove\u003c/strong\u003e what we already make, to \u003cstrong\u003eexpand\u003c/strong\u003e our offerings, and to \u003cstrong\u003esupport \u003c/strong\u003ethe beautiful artists that put\nthis little show of ours together.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eImprove\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRight now, the materials we have to make The Penumbra are\nfunctional\u2026 but that\u2019s about it. We record in the dining room of a creaky old\napartment with a few entry-level microphones and all of our mixing is done\nwith free audio-editing software. It works. But we know we can do better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHigh on our list of priorities are:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSpecialized microphones and other materials for\nuse in recording our own sound effects.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImproved software for mixing our episodes and\nmusic.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImproved recording equipment and (perhaps) time\nrented out in a recording studio, in order to bring the best sound quality we\ncan possibly manage.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eExpand\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\u2019re an ambitious bunch of dreamers at The Penumbra, and\nthere are so many ways in which we can make our production bigger and better than\never!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere are some ways we hope to expand:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake Season Two longer and stronger and better than ever, featuring two mainline series (Juno Steel and Second Citadel).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCommission more original music to accompany our episodes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLook into ways to expand our audience, find\nsponsors, and make The Penumbra self-sustainable.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHire more staff or pay existing staff to create episode transcripts for us.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay our actors, creative team, and management team for the many hours they put into creating this show.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(At a big, big, big, big stretch): Release episodes on an accelerated schedule.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSupport\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSupporting our artists is \u003cu\u003ethe\u003c/u\u003e core value of The\nPenumbra. When Sophie and Kevin first started this project, this was one of the\nfoundational thoughts \u2013 before Juno Steel, before our genres, before we were\neven settled on the idea of a podcast, there was this: we want to pay our artists.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt The Penumbra, we believe the extent to which American\nculture expects artists to produce art\u00a0\u003cem\u003efor free\u003c/em\u003e is unacceptable. We want to fight this cultural tide, and\nyou can help us do it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy default, you receive episodes of The Penumbra\nfor free, and there is no shame in that! We\u2019ve settled on this model as the\nmost effective way to reach the widest audience. But if you\u2019ve listened for a\nwhile and you enjoy what you\u2019ve heard \u2013 if the performances charm you, if the\nwriting grabs you, if the sound design creates a world you can really dive into,\nor if you find yourself humming our music from time to time \u2013 please consider\nsupporting the people who make that art. If you think our artists are worth your time, we hope you will\nask yourself how much money that time is worth. Thanks!"
