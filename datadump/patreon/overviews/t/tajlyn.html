Fans pay a few bucks per month OR per post you release, and then you get paid every month, or every time you release something new. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor patrons\u003c/strong\u003e, Patreon is a way to join your favorite creator\u0027s community and pay them for making the stuff you love. Instead of literally throwing money at your screen (trust us, that doesn\u2019t work), you can now pay a few bucks per month or per post that a creator makes.  For example, if you pay $2 per video, and the creator releases 3 videos in February, then your card gets charged a total of $6 that month.  This means the creator gets paid regularly (every time she releases something new), and you become a bonafide, real-life patron of the arts.  That\u2019s right--Imagine you, in a long frilly white wig, painted on a 10-foot canvas on the wall of a Victorian mansion.  And imagine your favorite creators making a living doing what they do best\u2026 because of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget, there\u0027s an easy way to set a monthly maximum for yourself when you\u0027re entering your payment info.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; More of your questions answered:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?
