This requires directors, editors, equipment, casts, locations and many other aspects of production.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way for you to help contribute money toward these goals by pledging a \"tip\" for each Youtube video I upload on my channel, \"TayZonday.\" The starting amount is $1 per video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease don\u0027t give money if you have no money.
