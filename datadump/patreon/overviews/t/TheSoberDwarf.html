It has given me this opportunity to follow my passion through the support of amazing people, it improves the show\u0027s quality, and it allows me to remain entirely independent of any network or company that might want to alter the vision of the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore importantly, Patreon allows me an easy way to interact, communicate and reward those who want to support the show. I\u0027m incredibly thankful for all of my fans and I take every opportunity to show my appreciation, and this allows me to directly communicate and get input with those who are most passionate about the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Am I Supporting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eYou are directly supporting my long-form videos about game design. These videos are not just a segment of gameplay with a voiceover, but highly researched, highly produced documentaries that attempt to tell the story I want to tell. These videos take anywhere from 80 - 150+ hours to create from the moment of conception to day it hits youtube. I hold myself to a high standard when creating these videos. Your support goes for equipment, research, and otherwise improving the videos and otherwise keeping the channel running.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon is on a per video basis because it helps keep the channel accountable. Initially, I could only create one video per month (if that), and I didn\u0027t want Patreon to charge and give nothing in return. Now that I\u0027m working on this channel full-time, I can usually make one or two videos a month. You will never be charged for any video that I consider too easy to make, which includes announcements, video trailers, behind-the-scenes videos, commentaries, streams, podcast-style videos, outtakes or other \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/PHkHcOeCCAs\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elow-effort videos\u003c/a\u003e. If you are concerned with the possibility of the channel uploading a flood of content (or otherwise only wish to contribute monthly), Patreon allows you to set a limit to how many times you will contribute per month, and doing so will not reduce your rewards in any way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t contribute, don\u0027t worry. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy content has been and will always be free.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e This is not a paywall to my channel\u0027s content. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is for people who want to help me grow the channel.
