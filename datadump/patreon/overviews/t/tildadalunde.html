    "summary": "Welcome to my world! Thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Tilda and I\u0027m an artist from Sweden who works mostly in the fields of sculpture and writing. For me\u00a0art is a negotiation with reality; a way of understanding, but\nalso the realisation that  understanding always brings up more\nquestions. My work starts as a way of questioning the world of today\nand where we humans fit into it. I often let historical events and\nscientific theories form a base when I investigate what is, and what\ncould have been.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\nwant to tell stories by presenting fragments. When these fragments are combined into a whole inside of an observer, I like to think that this is the creation of the finished artwork. And it only exists there, inside that particular observer. \u003cbr\u003eI\nuse a variety of materials and techniques, but my way of working\nalways originates from exploring, rather than inventing meaning. I often use a technique I call slow-extreme investigations, where I put myself in a situation that gives me no choice but to formulate my experience, either in words or in objects. One example of this was when I spent 10 days in total darkness and wrote about the amazingness and boredom of that kind of isolation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere on Patreon you can support my work and follow my process closely in the work-diary I keep for my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo see more of what I\u0027ve done, take a look at \u003ca href=\"http://www.tildadalunde.se\"\u003ewww.tildadalunde.se\u003c/a\u003e and www.minnesbeta.wordpress.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks for making it possible to be an artist!\u003cbr\u003eTilda\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://payload467.cargocollective.com/1/15/491228/11656192/IMG_8155_800.JPG\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
