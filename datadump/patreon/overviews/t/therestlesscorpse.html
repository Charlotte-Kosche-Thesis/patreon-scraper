    "summary": "I am a gamer, a YouTuber, a musician and an insomniac. If you\u0027re here, you probably already know that, and you probably already know that almost 100% of my free time is devoted to my channel. The dream is to be able to create content full time, and while the channel is growing, sometimes you need just that little bit more to make that dream come true. There are so many games out there I want to play on the channel, but I have to keep a roof over my head and food on the table. Becoming a patron means you support that dream of mine, and you enjoy my content enough to help me realize that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook, I\u0027m not a huge Youtuber. I\u0027m not crankin\u0027 out millions of views per video per day. There\u0027s really no reason to pledge money to me, other than to help me out. And you know what? If you don\u0027t wanna, that\u0027s cool, you aren\u0027t gonna be missing anything. You\u0027ll still see everything I record, edit and upload, but I can honestly say that I absolutely appreciate each and every person that chooses to support me and this channel. So thank you. Mostly, their pledge tiers are devoid of \"rewards\" because I just couldn\u0027t bring myself to promise some lofty things that I wasn\u0027t sure I could deliver. I don\u0027t do this full time, and if I promise a bunch of things, and you pledge based on that promise, and I don\u0027t deliver, I\u0027m the asshole, y\u0027know?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m gonna be honest, if I were you, I wouldn\u0027t pledge past Tier 1. That\u0027s a dollar a month, and it may not seem like much, but if enough of you awesome individuals decide to help out, it adds up. I\u0027m leaving the $5 and $10 tiers up for now because there are people still in those tiers, but I won\u0027t hold it against ya if you take my advice and just move it down to tier 1. I appreciate you either way.\u003cbr\u003e"
