    "summary": "My name is Josh and I have a very serious problem\u2026 I\u2019m addicted to starting new things. Books, TV shows, video games - no matter the medium I just can\u2019t seem to stop myself from abandoning stories in favor of starting new ones. Sometimes I don\u2019t even get through entire movies before I want to start watching something else. It\u2019s almost never a comment on quality, instead it\u2019s more of a comment on me. There\u2019s just some aspect of those early moments with something new that completely enthralls me. Meeting new characters, discovering new worlds, learning brand new ways of thinking, a new story always brings with it dozens of new experiences, and I just can\u2019t get enough. \u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s intimidating and awe-inspiring to think about how many pieces of art are out there. No matter how many books we read, paintings we see, songs we listen to, or movies we watch, there will always be thousands - millions, that we will never even know exist. It can be an oppressive thought, but it can also be an exciting one. The world is full of stories that are dying to be told; pieces of art that people have lovingly, meticulously created, but no matter how hard we try we will never be able to consume everything that we\u2019ve produced. I think that one thought is what really makes me so eager to start new things. I just want to see as much as I can while I have the chance. \u003cbr\u003eTo really experience anything though, I would first have to finish it, and that is why I started this project. The idea was basically to adapt the 50 in 52 challenge, where a person sets out to read 50 books in one year. For my version though, I wanted to expand the scope\u2026 by a lot. Starting on January 1st, 2017 I set out to finish 52 books, and 52 videogames in a single year. At first, it was just going to be a personal thing to help me finally get a handle on finishing what I start, but as the weeks went on I started seeing themes popping up and being shared in the strangest ways. That\u2019s why I decided to start sharing the experience with you.\u003cbr\u003eI think that all art is interconnected, and that if we just look a little harder we will be able to see themes that run through all mediums. Hopefully by taking the time to really examine everything I consume I will be able to gain a better understanding of these connections and the place of art in our lives.\u003cbr\u003e"
