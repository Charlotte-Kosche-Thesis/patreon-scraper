I created the YouTube channel Tripleinc. in 2016 where I dedicate my videos to everything fragrance - reviews, top 10\u0027s, interviews, Vlogs and much more! I\u0027m very passionate about perfumery and am driven to share my discoveries and experiences with fellow fragheads and casual wearers alike! I try to put a unique spin on my content by filming outdoors and incorporating a fun/fast paced cinematic touch within each video.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to create informative, entertaining fragrance related content and to grow the fragrance community beyond our wildest dreams - and I want YOU to come along for the journey! Throughout my current college classes and part-time jobs, I\u0027ve invested a ton of time and my own money into fragrance reviewing, BUT it\u0027s time to take things to the NEXT LEVEL and it can all be possible with your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eHOW I\u0027LL USE YOUR DONATIONS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s no secret - fragrance reviewing ain\u0027t cheap. I\u0027m always looking for new ways to step up my content and give you all the best finished product I possibly can - this includes the purchases of professional filming equipment + software and the ability to be constantly trying and testing new fragrances as to better equip myself with the knowledge and experience to improve my videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a student who is still currently paying his way through college, so every small donation helps me get one step closer to my degree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of everything else, the current YouTube \"adpocalypse\" has finally made it\u0027s way to smaller Youtube channels, even those of fragrance reviewers... many of my recent videos have been demonetized by YouTube claiming they are \"not advertiser friendly\" which really hurts me, this is a portion of my income that has been needlessly and unreasonably stripped.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon now gives me the chance to not only continue making fragrance videos, but to take my content to the next level through YOUR viewership, support \u0026amp; monetary donations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ll be using your donations to invest in more professional filming equipment + software as to be constantly be improving the quality of my videos \u0026amp; to continue trying and testing new fragrances for reviews.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTaking my channel to the next level - I want to increase the number of videos I\u0027m producing as well as discover new and unique locations to film ( I need a little extra spare change to cover travel expenses and make a few loose ends meet)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn all honesty some of your donations will go towards my college tuition as I continue to inch closer to my degree.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eONE LAST THING\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat would a community be without communication? If there is any different direction you want my channel to go in, ideas you thing I should embrace, new offerings or suggestions - don\u0027t hesitate to let me know!
