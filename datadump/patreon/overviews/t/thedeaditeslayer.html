    "summary": "Hey deadites! This page was created to help keep thedeaditeslayer.com costs covered and to make the site even better. I have a lot of plans for bringing exclusive interviews and more exciting contests to reward Evil Dead fans for their massive awesomeness. However, this means more expenses to cover the site. The Deadite Slayer is non profit and after four years of running it, all it has ever covered was the free media passes to a couple of conventions. \u00a0These actually resulted in two interviews published on the website. You might be surprised however to learn that I have sunk \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehundreds\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/em\u003eof dollars of my own cash into it over all of this time. But why?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInterviews often include costs which depend on the situation. This could be costs for software, transportation, long distance calls, etc. Unfortunately not all cast and crew members are able or willing to give an interview over email which costs nothing but a little bit of my time. Not all interviewees are willing to do them for free either. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is the hosting costs which are not much. However much like materials purchased to be scanned for new content, these little costs add up over time so this is very appreciated as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen there\u0027s the annual contest.\u00a0The prizes of the previous contests have been decent but I want to give out even better prizes. Sure it\u0027s nice to bring home two Pop! Vinyls or a limited edition Bruce Campbell signed print, but I want to give out something that\u0027ll get fans more excited to participate. This October in particular will be very exciting when Ash vs Evil Dead season 2 is right around the corner. I have a lot of plans then which will be revealed in the near future but it might not happen without the proper funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is one stretch goal if I ever am surprised to get way more than I expect. This will incorporate a few events over livestream which in turn requires some expensive equipment. If I can get enough, this new addition to the site will be quite rewarding. I assure you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll donations will go in a separate account that will be used solely for the website itself. As a person who works a full time job on the side and often does overtime just to cover my own living expenses, it\u0027s still unfortunate that I can\u0027t cover these ambitious plans on my own. Any support is appreciated and it will make the website more rewarding for the followers. Even if this is a total flop and very little is donated, it will still go towards at least something. No donations will be wasted. I sincerely hope to be able to put in something new at least so I appreciate any donation from the fans at all. To quote the upcoming Canadian made documentary on the fans, hail to the deadites!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo learn on how to get in contact for the website, you can visit the contact page over at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thedeaditeslayer.com/FAQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://thedeaditeslayer.com/c\u003c/a\u003eontact"
