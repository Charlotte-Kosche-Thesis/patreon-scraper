I have been vegan for a couple of years now for 2 years and\u00a0 will be 3 years in July 2016. My formal training was in Graphic Design, and later on web design. I am also a passionate photographer and spend a great deal photographing animals.\u00a0 However as I grew spiritually and found myself I find my calling in being active and helping animals. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy I need your support is as a graphic designer and photographer I can use my talents to put material together however to get these materials printed and at homes I need your support.\u00a0 Your donations will help me to reach out to my personal street, start right at home, and build from my community to the rest of my city(surrounding cities), and also with my facebook page reach various other people around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso a way you can help me that does not cost a thing is to like my pages and to help keep it growing. I am committed to helping this world become a better place. Your likes, comments, and donations will help me to reach others and to leave this world a better place when I leave.\u003cbr\u003e"

They became addicting and have since then going twice a year to help out with massive spay and neuter clinics. That got me learning and becoming more aware which I actively sought out to learn about animal cruelty pages and it got me on the road and finally going vegan in July 2013.\u00a0 I have grown up on a mostly vegetarian diet but I did not realize how harmful even being a vegetarian is.\u00a0 I do not however discourage others for making the steps to reduce the impact by choosing vegetarian by to help spread why vegan is really the answer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an individual activist trying to tackle and help spread awareness I am here reaching out in hopes I might get some support to help me use my natural given talents and spread out a message that you don\u0027t find when you turn on the tv or radio. Thankfully silk commercials have opened the doors to non dairy beverages but we still have a ways to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also actively and spend a great deal of time with my photography which you can visit and if you\u0027d like to give me a like which costs nothing and would be so wonderful of you here is the link \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/palsilluminatedphotography/\"\u003ePAL\u0027S illuminated Photography \u003c/a\u003e(PAL\u0027S standing for Paws, Animals, Liberation).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support! \u003cbr\u003eUnited in love, compassion and our planet.\u003cbr\u003eBlessings.\u003cbr\u003e",
