    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page, I am sure you have many questions. I hope I can answer them all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Are You?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI am known as Tantus Narivan Dracovin online, Lord and Emperor of the Dracovin Empire, or you can call me by my real name, Matt. In my offline life, I am a former Math Student, got my associate\u0027s degree but not my bachelor\u0027s, who does a number of odd jobs here and there. Online, I make videos for The Dracovin Empire YouTube Channel daily and stream almost daily on the Twitch Channel of the same name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you do online?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWell, the videos that I make on YouTube are meant to be instructional in tabletop games. I make ones that inform you how to play various roleplaying games from Dungeons and Dragons, to Pathfinder and World of Darkness games like Vampire the Masquerade. I also do a number of videos talking about specific subjects related to those games, like races in Pathfinder and the Clans in Vampire. Other Videos I make are on collectable card games like Magic the Gathering, talking about its history and some of the lore of the game.\u00a0 I also stream on Twitch. There I run a number of D\u0026amp;D games each week, have a few shows where I discuss tabletop games, and a few streams where I play a few video games some with my online friends. A good example is one of my longest running series, Fallout: New Vegas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eI don\u0027t earn a lot of money with my normal jobs, and neither of the channels I run provides a steady pay check. This doesn\u0027t mean I have a need in my normal life, no, but it means I have very little money to throw into improving the channel.\u00a0 So here is a way those of you who love my content and want to see more, and bigger and better things, can support me to do just that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does the money do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThis money would allow me to improve all aspects of the channel.\u00a0 From art for the new shows, to updates in the look of old ones, I would look to channel and background art, new equipment for recording, supplies for the games I talk about and run, and the ability to travel, meeting you and others in the tabletop world. I want the channel to grow in leaps and bounds, and this is a way you can help me speed this up, where I could not do it alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does supporting you get me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eFirst off, and most important, you get my thanks. A thousand time over, my thanks.\u00a0 Supporting me means I am doing the right thing and you enjoy all my work. Second, you get access to a number of interesting rewards. From playing games with me, to joining my RPG streams, and even joining me at a convention.\u00a0 Take a look at all the rewards, and decide what can both help me out, and is appealing to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything Else?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eJust one more thing for me to say, Thank You again. Just by visiting here, it means you wish to help me out.\u00a0 If you can\u0027t support me here, and still want to help me, subscribing to my Youtube or my twitch can also help.\u00a0 However you wish to show your support, I thank you a thousand times for it.\u00a0 Thank you for helping me to grow the Empire\u003cbr\u003e"
