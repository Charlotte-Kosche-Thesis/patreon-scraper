On their own, the\u00a0stories are pretty entertaining. But when you read the stories over time, certain themes start\u00a0to emerge, and suddenly you realize there\u0027s a bigger picture. A \u003cstrong\u003ereally\u003c/strong\u003e big picture: a new\u00a0understanding of humanity begins to emerge. Yes, \u003cem\u003eTrue\u003c/em\u003e is entertaining, but it\u0027s also truly\u00a0thought-provoking. Both the fragility and the power of the individual becomes clearer. And\u00a0you\u0027ll realize that some stories only look amusing -- and you\u0027ll realize you\u0027re actually angry!\u00a0But it\u0027s anger with a purpose: you\u0027ll see you have the power to stand up and demand change.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s why so many subscribers say they\u0027ll subscribe for life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s smart, it\u0027s funny, it\u0027s thought-provoking. It\u0027s an independent voice appealing the the\u00a0highest common denominator, unlike mega-media \"social\" and corporate sites trying to\u00a0dictate what you should think.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSo... What\u0027s Premium?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach week\u0027s column consists of 10 or more odd stories, each with its own \"slug\" (title) and \"tagline\" (comment). There are two versions: a \"Premium\" (paid) edition with all of the stories (a minimum of 10), and a free edition with five stories. But it doesn\u0027t stop there: each issue -- whether Premium or free -- also includes a Headline of the Week; Randy\u0027s \"Author\u0027s Notes\" section that discusses one of the issues raised in more detail, notes updates or corrections, and/or letters from readers; the extremely popular \"Honorary Unsubscribe\" (a brief obituary of someone interesting who perhaps even had a huge impact on your life -- yet you may never have heard of them); and various other features. Even the free newsletter has a huge amount of entertaining and thought-provoking material You can check out the most recent free issue and less time on marketing and business: a concentration on more content. Whether you want to just say thanks for the free edition or wish to promote your business on every page of True \u0027s web site, you can help This is True stay online to provide its Thought-Provoking Entertainment for years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYes, Our goal is audacious, but then, so are the benefits if we hit it: \u003cstrong\u003eeveryone gets Premium!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s right, this has the potential for everyone to get the full newsletter on the \"pay what you want\" basis that\u0027s behind Patreon in the first place. And wouldn\u0027t that be awesome-sauce!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nNote:\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon will charge you immediately for this month. Subsequent charges should come on the first of each month.
