    "summary": "A huge welcome to The Wishing Shed Patreon site. For those of you who don\u0027t know me, my name is Rachel Austin, I am an artist, sculptor, writer and creator of \u0027The Wishing Shed\u0027. Four years ago I taught myself how to sculpt with wool and began making needle felted miniature animals, which went from being a hobby into a full time job. In my spare time I love to write short stories, it is such a great passion of mine and although I feel lucky to be able to earn a modest living doing my art, ultimately my dream is to get my stories published and available to the public. I work from my little green shed at the end of my garden, inspired by animals and nature around me. I have been writing numerous stories, which sadly, with work and other commitments I have never had time to illustrate and publish. I was always told by my father to follow my dreams and my heart and so I decided it\u0027s about time to push myself and do what I love to do the most no matter what obstacles get in the way. I would like to illustrate this first story using my needle felt creations set in 3D scenes. \u00a0Using needle felt scenes as illustrations may be a bit of a challenge but I am so passionate about both needle felting and writing, I felt that this story was the perfect opportunity to combine the two. Publishing this book will hopefully be the start of something big with many more books to follow. As a supporter/patreon of The Wishing Shed you will be helping my dream become a reality and in return I will thank you with some great patreon only rewards. For starters you will have exclusive access to photos, videos, original sketches and updates on the progress of the book. The story I have chosen to illustrate first is one very close to my heart, a simple and yet moving tale of friendship and learning the importance of kindness. Even though this is a children\u0027s book, the magical illustrations I will be creating will make the book enjoyable for everyone. I won\u0027t be publicly releasing details about this book until towards the end of its completion but all of my patreons will recieve updates from the start and will know exciting details about the book before anyone else! Including exclusive access to artwork and sketches. I would be very grateful if you could take a look at my reward levels as any support you give means the world to me. I am hoping to release the book in 2017 in time for Christmas and the more support received the more I will be able to work and concentrate on the artwork for the book to get it completed sooner :) When you step inside The Wishing Shed you will find it is full of magic and wonder. With a massive heartfelt thank you I would like to say how much I appreciate you being part of this new venture, Rachel xxx"
