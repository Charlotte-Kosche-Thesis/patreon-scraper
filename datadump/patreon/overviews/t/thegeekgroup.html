You may have seen me before along with my partner in crime, Steven.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe make videos, and a lot of them.

If you\u0027re reading this, you probably already know that, and are interested in helping. To which we say thanks, and welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003eSo why are we seeking awesome Patrons?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s three things we\u0027re attempting to do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Make TGG\u0027s videos more self-sustaining so we can slowly grow operations. We want to do more videos, more often. To do this we need to start growing our team beyond just Steve and myself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Create a more collaborative platform to get those who love our videos more directly involved with what we do here. This means things like trading ideas, giving suggestions, problem-solving, and (if you\u0027re REALLY motivated) being a part of our research team that will help plan future videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) Get rid of YouTube ads. They\u0027re not fun, and we consider them a necessary evil for us at best. Overall they detract from what we\u0027re trying to do, which is create content that gets people curious about science and technology. We\u0027d rather better ways to do what we do without relying on the YT monetization system. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003eHow the money will get used\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re looking to start with an initial monthly goal of $2,000. Our equipment needs are taken care of for a long time, so we\u0027re mainly focusing on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) New employees: We\u0027d like a bigger team, starting with one extra staff working with me and Steven each, to give our production flow a much needed kick into a higher gear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Us:\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eSteven and I need things like food. Working with a solid baseline budget (vs. nebulous ad revenue) lets us focus on making more and better content stress free. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) Video-specific expenses: This would include special excursions, equipment upkeep, and other production costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003eWhat does your patronage get you?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore of our videos, plus access to them a day early! You\u0027ll also get behind-the-scenes goodies in our Patreon feed, some of which allow you to also have a hand in future developments. This will include production vlogs, special livestreams of some of the work we do, and anything else fun we can think to put there. There\u0027s also the feel-good fuzzy feelings that come with helping to make our channel better for everyone by eliminating YT ads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s what there is to it. Thank you so much for any support you can offer, should you choose to, and thank you for reading!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Elizabeth\u003cbr\u003e"
