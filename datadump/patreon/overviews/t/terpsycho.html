I am Terpsycho. The Woman. The Myth. The Legend. Well... okay not yet. But someday... right now I am more like Joxer the Mighty... but there is a Xena Warrior Princess/Wonder Woman of Arts on the horizon and I aim to become it! For now, I am a humble purveyor of written words and doodled sketchies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I am here to do just that. To create the things and hopefully give some people joy. They say if you\u0027re good at something, never do it for free. I don\u0027t wholeheartedly agree with that. I will be creating for my own pleasure without payment... but it\u0027s the sharing with the world that comes at a price.
