    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello and welcome! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks so much for checking out our patreon page :)\nYou can find us on YouTube where we make fun public prank videos. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs many of you may or may not know, we decided to finally pursue our YouTube channel full-time. We are very passionate about the content we create and strongly believe we can make it into something great that will be able to support us financially. Back in March of 2017 we both decided we would quit our jobs and give YouTube everything we got with enough money saved up to last us a year. Unfortunately, our timing for this decision did not come at the best time considering the YouTube ad boycott. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBasically,\u00a0 YouTube is facing a full scale advertising boycott due to an ad being played on an offensive video. This has greatly impacted the amount of money creators are able to make on YouTube due to the massive drop in ads being displayed on videos. YouTube has been very quiet about this issue, making it very scary for YouTube creators not knowing if this is going to be improved anytime soon or even at all.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://ibb.co/dRO1dy\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/f7gXkd/revenue_example_for_patreon.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is why we decided to start a patreon page. If you\u0027re someone who loves our videos and wants to help us continue \ndoing what we love to do, you can pledge any amount you\u0027re comfortable \nwith. If you decide to pledge, please know that we\nare extremely grateful and that your support means everything to us.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get from your monthly pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe thought it would be a great idea to give back to all of you awesome people by giving you exclusive content you will only find for pledging on our patreon.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA lot of work goes into our videos. One 3 minute prank can take up to 2 weeks to film because we don\u0027t stop until we get the best reactions for you all to watch. In this time, we get a lot of extra footage. With a pledge of at least $2, you will get access to watch our deleted scenes/extras from our videos that don\u0027t make it into the final cut.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re not in the position to become a patron, no worries at all! Please know that watching, sharing, commenting and liking our videos shows us tremendous support. Thank you again, and we look forward to\n producing many more amazing videos for you all in the future!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf you prefer to make a one time donation you can click this link here:\u003c/strong\u003e paypal.me/thebuttingheads\u003cbr\u003e"
