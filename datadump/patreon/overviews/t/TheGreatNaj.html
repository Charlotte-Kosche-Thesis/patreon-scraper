    "summary": "If you\u0027re looking at this page you likely know me from either VentureKraft or TitanCraft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re from VentureKraft:\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you know me now I\u0027m the new owner of VK. Before that though, while I was a manager on OmniKraft, I joined TangoTek\u0027s patreon and patreon server. (Tango is a member of Hermitcraft if you haven\u0027t heard of him and is my favorite MC youtube video person dood.) I ended up becoming a moderator on there as well (equivalent to our server Managers) and before Omni\u0027s closing took on the role of lead Moderator. I helped Tango and the other mods out getting the patreon server set up after it was starting to die out and worked hard to revive it again. I didn\u0027t step down when I became owner of VentureKraft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re from TitanCraft:\u003cbr\u003eOriginally I was a staff member of a server called OmniKraft. I got all my moderating experience from there and I love them. They\u0027re family to me. When I took the role as lead mod for TC things were fine with Omni, but soon after the owner decided to close it. Other staff and myself decided to keep the community alive and start up VentureKraft to give the community a place to keep playing together. I ended up stepping up as owner. Obviously, I didn\u0027t step down with TC once that happened.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo both:\u003cbr\u003eMost of my personal time is spent dealing with server management for one of the two servers. I don\u0027t get paid for it, I do it because I love helping people. I would never dream of taking any of VentureKraft\u0027s donations for personal use and I could never ask Tango to pay me when he has his own family to support. But, realistically, I need to start making money again. I quit my job a while back for personal reasons which is why I had so much free time to help with both servers but I plan on getting a job again soon. It will be hard to split my time between servers and manage a job, so my thoughts are if patreon works out well maybe I\u0027d be lucky enough to only work part time at my job and have enough time to split between the servers too while having spare time to keep myself sane.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuick about me:\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m 21, meaning I have no idea what I\u0027m doing with life lol I studied art for years and went to an arts high school, got accepted to arts college to study animation but withdrew when I realized I was struggling with depression and anxiety. I\u0027ve had it since middle school but only diagnosed and treated for a couple years now, so while I am better now I still struggle to function sometimes. Recently decided college isn\u0027t for me, I\u0027ve never been good in school and it seems like a waste of time and money for me to go back right now. So currently the majority of my time is spent with these servers, but I am going to be getting a job soon. I just got a car so I can get a better job farther away without relying on the janky public busses that are never on time, but I need the job to pay for the car too lol I don\u0027t have any idea what I want to do for a career anymore but I have plenty of skills to get me somewhere. I love cooking and baking, all forms of art, animation, video games, technology, and cosplay/sewing. I haven\u0027t cosplayed much since my peak of depression but I want to get back into it and start making my own clothes and maybe go into some sort of clothing design. (Self taught sewing since I was very little, make my own cosplays from scratch, including making my own patterns.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m glad theres no character limit on this because as you can see I tend to ramble a lot. But honestly, I don\u0027t expect a lot from patreon, just anything is immensely appreciated when I lose my mind trying to keep things working for two separate servers AND have a life. I don\u0027t expect a lot, I don\u0027t want to push for people to donate. Just if you appreciate the time and work I put into one of the servers you play on enough to donate some little amount, every penny would be appreciated.\u00a0"
