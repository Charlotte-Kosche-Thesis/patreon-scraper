I have a passion for writing that I find every time I punch the keys to release my words. I\u0027m attempting to do something others think is impossible and unattainable, but I refuse to listen with intent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI choose positivity and I fight everyday to see a world I know is possible. I refuse to live a life that doesn\u0027t give me the passion to fight for my dreams. I fight with conviction and a belief that life can be beautiful if you choose to see positive outcomes. I have a story to tell and I will not let my ink fade when it can inspire just one person.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can see my dreams in every color that surrounds my life and I choose to let my passion guide my vision. I found this platform only after I told myself that I was going to find direction to accomplish my goals. My direction is clear because I had the courage to dream bigger and embrace my passion, and my purpose. If you are ready to experience freedom then join my journey toward fulfillment. I have a key that will unlock your deepest desires and it\u0027s not the only copy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have the power to choose and you have everything you need to succeed. I will experience every dream I can conceive in my mind and this is your opportunity to watch it happen from the ground floor. I am strong enough to ask for help and I am ready to inspire generations to follow their dreams. Join me and experience my journey from fear to fulfillment. I am so grateful for your support. You are appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have attached the preface to my first book to give you a glimpse into my mind and my way of thinking. Thanks again!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e101 Quotes That Will Change Your Life by Topher Pike\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePreface\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou do not know my\nname because my story has yet to be written. As an unknown but inspired writer,\nI am going to say little about my previous story in this book, because this\nis my first chapter. I will not write the story of my past because the belief I\nhave in my future is so clear that I can only see what is possible and already here.\nI have learned things about myself since I have chosen to open my eyes to a new\nway of thinking, and I\u2019m stronger today than I was yesterday.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe\nonly thing that scares me in life is not taking action when I\u2019m scared.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter\nintense soul-searching, I now have a different perspective on life and have finally\nfound a purpose. I am grateful for my life today, but I am also grateful for the\nlife I can see tomorrow. I am only writing this book because I can finally\nhear the voice that I have been afraid to free. I believe this voice needs to be\nheard by anyone with a dream for something unbelievable and unimaginative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you have a dream\nthat you have been afraid to unleash, I\u2019m here to tell you it\u2019s possible. It\u2019s possible\nto get anything you want in life, and this book will be my example\u2014an example for\nthose who decide their fears are not real and reality is the fantasy they choose\nto believe. A place where fears are only a part of yesterday\u2019s circumstances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI now\nlive in a world where the image I see brings me the excitement I need to fulfill\nmy dreams of a better life for my family. This book is the first chapter\nin a life I always imagined was possible. This book will astonish any reader who\nbelieves his or her life has already been written. Today I can clearly hear my future\nknocking because I finally have the courage to open the door.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have found a key\nto unlock my deepest dreams and desires, and I\u2019m here to tell you that it\u2019s not\nthe only copy. Tomorrow I will be a best-selling author with a clearer vision for\nmy next chapter. If you believe in a higher power than yourself, you are on the\nright frequency. If you don\u2019t believe your perfect life is possible, you need to\nread this book.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eLuck\nis an illusion only seen by those who seek mediocrity.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt will not be an\neasy journey toward the life you always imagined was possible. Every day will be\na fight to let go of your doubts and truly capture your vison of perfection. You\nmay only see it in your mind, but make sure you see it every day. See it as if you\ncannot see any other possible outcome. I hope this book will give you strength to\nrise above normality and create a path that only you can see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNobody else can change the way\nyou think or the way you live, but your mind and body together can change the way\nyou see the world. I hope you can feel the power in my words and use your thoughts\nto inspire a new way of thinking. My story starts today, and I\u2019m inviting\nyou to become a character in the first chapter of my journey. Join me and experience\nthe power and joy of freeing your mind and releasing your dreams. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI understand that the power I have been given is the greatest gift I will\never receive, and I believe it\u2019s my duty to give something back. This book is my\nfirst mass production. I believe that life can be everything you imagine if you\nbelieve in yourself and believe in the goals and vision you have put forth. I see\nthe strength in the belief in my dreams and finally understand how to embrace their\npower and reality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe choice is yours in how you embrace the words I have written in this book.\nI believe you have the power to create your future, but only you can believe it\u2019s\npossible. Use my words to inspire your belief that you can capture the key to a\ndoor only you can open.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eYesterday\nwill become today when you do not see a vision for tomorrow.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI will become a successful author,\nand once this happens, you will have no choice but to believe in my way of thinking.\nWhat dream are you afraid to unlock? If you believe in my words, share my book with\nanyone who has forgotten to fight for their dreams. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFantasy will soon become reality when you believe your\ndreams are real. The words you read in this book have given me the strength to see\na world that already exists. It exists not only in my mind but in every step I take\ntoward positivity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.topherpike.com/Crush_Season_One-26.jpg\"\u003e"
