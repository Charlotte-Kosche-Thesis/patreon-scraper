    "summary": "I am creating my own Patreon because I no longer want to depend on another fanbase to get by, you see, I get paid in YouTube ad revenue, which mainly used to come from the Game Grumps animations, but I desperately want to expand my content. Make reviews, opinion vids, original cartoons, retrospectives, etc., but I can\u0027t really do that because all that stuff isn\u0027t as popular as the GG animations, and if I focus on that other stuff, I start losing money (which isn\u0027t a lot to begin with because of the whole \"animators get shafted when it comes to YT money\", thing).\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0So if my Patreon becomes successful, I will be able to focus on other material, rather than just rely on the \"Game Grumps Crutch\", which has helped me SO MUCH along the way, but I feel like I finally have the energy to pursue new and intriguing things. I\u0027ll create shit based on how much it impassions me and what I genuinely like, rather than create something so often that it becomes tedious and an excuse to just pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0I want there to be dedication and quality in my work, and I can give you guys all that, if you help me out. And trust me, it will definitely not go unnoticed."
