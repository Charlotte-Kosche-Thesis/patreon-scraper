    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://silverglass.dk/grunnetandgrumble.jpg\"\u003eI bid you welcome\nto The Fantasy Food Patreon site, created by the freelance fantasy artist\nSophie Grunnet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Fantasy Food Journal is a series of satire recipes, illustrated tales and\nmagical beast designs which are all set in a humoristic fantasy universe. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe fictional\ncreators of the journal are called Grunnet and Grumble - a witchy food critic\nand a famous ogre masterchef.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou will like this\nproject if you appreciate the fantasy genre, tons of artwork, food and weird\nhumor with a slightly dark twist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first couple of pages are on the house, so\nyou can see what \u003cbr\u003eThe Fantasy Food Journal is all about!\u003cbr\u003e\nHead over to my website to have your first glimpse into our journey:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://silverglass.dk/patreon.htm\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Fantasy Food Journal - the beginning\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e**All\nart and text are copyrighted by Sophie Grunnet - please show respect and ask if\nyou intent to use any of it.\u003cstrong\u003e**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://silverglass.dk/border.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere will be a new entry every week. Every week you will get new artwork!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt can either be\none of Grumble\u2019s guides and stories (\u003cem\u003eif\nyou try them out, it\u2019s your own responsibility\u003c/em\u003e) or Grunnet will write about\nher studies of magical creatures, food related myths and spells.\u003cbr\u003eAnd don\u2019t forget,\nshe will also be bringing you reviews of all the up and coming culinarian\nhotspots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have loved\nfantasy all my life and I have been drawing all my life as well. After many\nyears of freelance work I have finally decided to do my own thing.\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are many talented and inspiring artists here on Patreon and I therefore\nfelt the need to come up with something special to stand out. I therefore have\npicked the theme of combining food with fantasy, because the possibilities are\nendless and who doesn\u2019t like food?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://silverglass.dk/lobster.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo be honest, then I\u2019m a\nhorrible cook myself, so all of this will be super goofy and dorky - but\nhopefully entertaining!\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m not a writer, my weapon of choice will always be illustrating - especially\ntraditional art. So this is a journey for me to create this project and try out\nnew platforms. Hopefully the two medias can support each other, so my passion\nfor the fantasy and storytelling can shine through.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u2019s my lifelong dream to make a 100% living out of my art, and I really hope\nthis could be a great step for me.\u003cbr\u003e\nI will work very hard to entertain you and bring you good art material, as long\nit can bring me a little closer to my goal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAll support is very much appreciated, even if you just share and like my stuff\naround online!\u003cbr\u003eRemember, you can\nedit your pledge at any time. If you want to pledge $15 for one month then\nlower it for the subsequent months, that is completely fine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCan\u2019t wait to take the adventure with you.\u003cbr\u003e\nBon Appetite.\u003cbr\u003e"
