My sets can usually be purchased individually\u00a0for an average of $15 to $20. I make new sets so often that people would actually save more money through patreon\u00a0rather than buying them separately. Since this is a hobby that I would like to really pursue and expand on, I hope that Patreon could help me to afford bigger projects and attend more and even out-of-state cons.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe height=\"480\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1alkEQ9WFOadHmJsCiDUxGvLEmPVDnRZZ/preview\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n \u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWhat\u0027s In It For You?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eCurrently, the only thing I can exchange in return are lewds and cosplay tutorials.
