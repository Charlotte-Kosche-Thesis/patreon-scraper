    "summary": "Hey everybody!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jovan C. Alford and I am the founder and editor in charge at TotalSportsLive.com. Some of you, who are checking out this Patreon page may know me, while others of you may not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who do not know me or about Total Sports Live, here is a quick synopsis on the history of TSL. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHistory of TSL\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTotal Sports Live was created on November 6, 2011 as a basic site on Blogger. When I say it was basic, it was not what you see today. There was no cool drop down boxes, widgets, or high quality pictures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, I came up with the idea because people were telling me that I should give it a try since I knew a lot about sports. Also, at the time, I was beginning to host my own sports radio show at La Salle University on their student run radio station WEXP. It was the best of both world as I got to talk and write about not only Philadelphia sports but anything else happening in the sports world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the early years of TSL, I prided myself making sure the site stayed up to date with news, game previews, and recaps. However, as time wore and I got comfortable with writing I decided to bring on a few staff members. The inaugural class of writers I had with me was Matt Brown, Noel Claudio, Pat Andrews, Darryl Simmons, and Ryan Rush. (I\u0027m sorry in advanced if I missed anybody).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving those guys contributing to the site whenever they could, helped open my eyes to what the future could become for Total Sports Live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the years continued, TSL grew and through that I was able to bring on more talented writers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThankfully, Matt has stayed on board and been a big help. He is an integral part to our site, being our editor, leading our Eagles coverage, and being a credential media member covering Temple University football.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNevertheless, I knew that if I wanted to have faithful people like Matt, I felt like they should be rewarded for their hard work. But as I found out, that would be hard as ad monetization is not always your best friend. You can produce quality content, but if someone has an ad blocker on their web browser, you are missing out on clicks and potential revenue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we using Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a few months now, I have been battling back and forth internally, if I should pursue this for Total Sports Live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, a couple of days ago, I saw a friend of mines, who is doing a Patreon for his tennis coverage tweet out some things regarding sports journalism and how is it being consumed among other things. When I read his tweets, it made me feel comfortable to know that I was doing the right thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what TSL\u0027s Patreon is for!\u003c/strong\u003e It is to help us continue to produce quality sports content along with podcasts for our readers/listeners but also to continue on the legacy we are building. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis site would not be where it is today, without the countless efforts and work from Matt, Adio Royster, Alex McKeon, Angela Montoni, Kayleigh Jackson, Kevin O\u0027Connor Jr., and others. These guys and girls are the true MVPs of TSL. I want to be able to help them continue to get media credentials plus help them career wise as well. But I also want to reward them with a little bit of \"lunch money.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry, despite having Patreon, TotalSportsLive.com will not be behind a paywall so you still will be able to access our content for free. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for checking out our Patreon page and continuing to support us at TSL. If you cannot donate, it is okay because as long as you continue to share, like, or retweet our stories and listen to podcasts, you are helping us immensely by just giving us a chance.\u003cbr\u003e"
