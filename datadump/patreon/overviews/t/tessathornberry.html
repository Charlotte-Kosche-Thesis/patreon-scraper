In return for you being my patron here, I\u0027ll share patron-only progress pics, reference images, or thoughts on why a piece or body of work was inspired or made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can cap your patronage per month if you don\u0027t want to pay per artwork. \u00a0I plan on making a series of rabbit postcards between September-November and calling each batch of 4-6 one \"artwork.\" Keep watching here or on my FaceBook\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TessaThornberryArtist\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/TessaThornberryArtist\u003c/a\u003e to be mailed one at random.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove and thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTessa Thornberry"

I use a lot of mythology, symbolism, color, and movement in my 2-D paintings and drawings, and my most prolific studio time is currently while on the BART\u00a0train in the SF Bay Area, where I often do my own thing, but also do portraits of people \u00a0at their request when the mood strikes.\u00a0I have an art degree from UC Davis, and have also studied different art techniques from various mentors and friends.",
