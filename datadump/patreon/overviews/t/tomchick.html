    "summary": "My first paid review was for US Navy Fighters in 1994.  It was a flight sim.  Things have changed a lot.  Flight sims are as rare as paid reviews.  Actually, that\u0027s not quite true, because I played a flight sim in 2017 (IL-2 Sturmovik, while testing VR support). \u00a0But I haven\u0027t written a paid review -- or any kind of article -- since around 2010 (UPDATE: I was paid to write\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://folks.pillpack.com/1847/say-someone-cancer/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e!).  In the years since then, I tried to make a living running a site called Quarter to Three. That didn\u0027t really work. \u00a0The site was losing 80% of its income to ad blockers.  So it\u0027s now an ad-free site with no means for income. \u00a0If you enjoy the site, and if you appreciate what I do, I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting me here.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what are you getting if you contribute to this campaign? \u00a0A few things, including supporting the community at Quarter to Three, my podcasting, streaming, and occasional videos. \u00a0But my own priority is on written reviews. \u00a0Not the usual reviews.  As you may know if you\u0027ve read stuff I\u0027ve written, I feel very strongly about what a review should and shouldn\u0027t be. \u00a0So if you\u0027ll bear with me, I\u0027m about to hold forth at length. \u00a0Ahem. \u00a0Here goes...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA review is a carefully articulated expression of a person\u0027s experience with a piece of entertainment.\u003c/strong\u003e  Preferably by someone who knows the medium well.  In my case, that\u0027s mostly videogames.  And preferably by someone who uses his own medium well.  In my case, that\u0027s mostly writing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSorry for the boldface up there, but that\u0027s 99% of it.  At this point, I hope you get a sense for whether my writing is worth your support.  But if you want to know more, well, get comfortable.  I\u0027ve got a lot more to say!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy reviews are not recommendations and they aren\u0027t intended to be a measure of quality.  They are snapshots in time of my experience with something.  There is a date and a byline at the top of every review for a reason.  I hope you can infer from a review whether you\u0027ll like something, but I can\u0027t possibly know what you\u0027ll like or won\u0027t like.  I can\u0027t possibly know whether something is worth your time or money.  That\u0027s a fool\u0027s errand.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA review should contain some insight and not just be a checklist of features followed by an arbitrary declaration of whether it was \"fun\".  I consider it a point of pride that you won\u0027t find the word \"fun\" in my reviews.  Not because I hate fun.  There\u0027s always a better way to articulate that idea when you\u0027re trying to talk about something on a level deeper than an informal conversation.  There\u0027s always a better way to express something to someone who might not share my idea of fun.  Calling something fun is as lazy as calling it boring.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe reviews should be critiques instead of just buyers\u0027 guides or consumer reports.  We can get to the interesting parts if we just skip past the description of how it plays, or a count of how many levels it has, or a list of what weapons are included.  You\u0027re not reading what I\u0027ve written for a list of features broken down into bullet points.  You can read that stuff anywhere else on the internet.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI don\u0027t believe a review should grade a game.  I am not a teacher and the people who make games are not my students.  On the contrary, they know much more than I do about making games.  It\u0027s silly for me to presume to tell them what to do, and it\u0027s just as silly for me to grade them on their efforts as if they were taking a pop quiz.  It\u0027s even sillier to break down their work into component parts and stick numbers on the graphics, sound, gameplay, and fun factor as if I were evaluating a toaster.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI do, however, like ratings!  Ratings are simply a measure of how much I like something.  There\u0027s no reason to confine that measure to the 7-9 zone that comes from people thinking of ratings as if they were grading papers.  Why do some people still behave as if they\u0027re in grade school?  Why do some people who\u0027ve never made a game presume to grade the work of professional game designers?  But in terms of having to distill my opinion down to a number, as a thought exercise,  as shorthand for my experience, I like ratings.  I like aggregates.  I enjoy seeing how a game is doing overall.  Data can be fun!  Yep, fun.  This isn\u0027t a review of data, so I can say that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA review is based on the game at the time it is played.  A review shouldn\u0027t be based on potential.  It shouldn\u0027t assume the developer will patch it or provide DLC or deliver great stuff with their season\u0027s pass.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nReviews don\u0027t have to be rushed launch day events.  The relevance of a discussion shouldn\u0027t be tied to a game\u0027s release date.  Yet most sites need to have a review up the day a game comes out, if not earlier, because that\u0027s when it drives the most traffic.  And as that date passes, the game becomes less relevant.  Guess who benefits from that?  The publishers.  They wouldn\u0027t have it any other way.  Coverage and marketing go hand-in-hand, and most sites are total suckers for it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA review should be of value to you, the reader, long after you\u0027ve played a game, whether you simply dabbled in it or sank dozens of hours into it, whether you hate or love it or don\u0027t even particularly care about it.  A review, or any kind of coverage, can be relevant and interesting long after a game has come out.  I would love to be free of the expectations publishers create with release dates.  I would love to write about Bioshock 2, Red Dead Redemption, or Civilization IV instead of something coming out next week.  I would love to not care at all about what titles drive traffic.  I would love Quarter to Three to be supported by Patreon, which doesn\u0027t care about traffic, instead of advertising, which only cares about traffic.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nReviews must be willing to be negative about big releases and positive about small releases.  I will use a five-star rating as freely as I use a one-star rating.  There is nothing sacred about either end of the spectrum.  The extremes don\u0027t mean perfect or broken.  They are simply an indication of how much I like something.  A Halo should be able to get one star, just as a Gone Home should be able to get five stars.  The inverse is true.  But there are no points for production values or marketing budgets.  There is no cap based on public awareness or genre.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI see no distinction between reviewing and criticism.  Criticism is intended to make things better, to highlight what works and why it works, to put entertainment into a larger context, to compare it to other entertainment.  It should come from a place of respect for the medium and the people working in it.  Smug self-satisfied takedowns are not criticism and they certainly don\u0027t come from a place of respect.  It\u0027s easy to exaggerate how bad something is for dramatic or humorous effect.  But ridiculing something just to be funny isn\u0027t the same as articulating a defensible opinion.  Too many writers do this.  Too many sites carelessly sling ridicule at games that can be safely dismissed and used as whipping boys to show that you sometimes range outside the usual 7-9 ratings system.  That will never happen at Quarter to Three.  A review is not ridicule.  Although a review should be entertaining, that is never the primary goal.  The primary goal of a review is to provoke thought, to provide a different perspective, to discuss it more deeply than whether it looks good or how long it is or whether it\u0027s fun.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll that stuff is the \"why?\" of Quarter to Three.  That\u0027s a lot of what I have to offer at the site.  But you might also have other questions!  Let me try to answer them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQuarter to Three is an odd bird.  Much of our traffic comes from a small forum community, recently integrated into the front page instead of hiding behind it.  We\u0027re a group of people, some of whom have known each other for years.  There are some incredibly smart people in there and they do an amazing job keeping the place civil, lively, and welcoming.  \u003ca href=\"https://forum.quartertothree.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eI invite you to join us.\u003c/a\u003e  The rest of our traffic is for the front page, which consists of news snippets of interest, sometimes links to videos, reviews of videogames and boardgames, and too infrequent game diaries (game diaries are basically written Let\u0027s Plays, so it\u0027s no surprise they\u0027ve been largely supplanted by Let\u0027s Plays).  We also cover movies sometimes, and television, and even the occasional book. \u00a0Our movie podcast has been going steadily every Sunday night since 2009.  I wish I could say the same about our games podcast, which falls in and out of a regular schedule. On\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/qt3\"\u003ethe site\u0027s Twitter account\u003c/a\u003e, I try to Tweet things more interesting than what I\u0027m eating for lunch.  I\u0027ve got\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/quartertothreevideos\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea YouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/tomchick\"\u003ea Twitch channel\u003c/a\u003e.  Every other weeknight (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) at 6pm Pacific, I livestream for an hour or so, with Wednesday consisting of viewer requests.  All of this is under the banner of Quarter to Three.  Quarter to Three is all of this.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhen?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQuarter to Three was started by me and Mark Asher in, uh, 1999-ish as part of cnet\u0027s family of sponsored web sites.  Our timing was impeccable, because cnet canceled the program shortly after we started the site.  The internet bubble was popping.  So we kept it going as best we could.  Since it wasn\u0027t a viable way to make a living -- I was freelancing back then -- Mark moved on to a job in the real world.  In 2008, I got a job running what was supposed to be a gaming site for the Sci Fi Channel, but it never got the support to be anything more than a one-man blog.  With the horrible name Fidgit.  It wasn\u0027t nearly as bad as some of the other possible names floated while we were setting up the site.  I could have been the editor of mrgamerman.com, thumbgamer.com, or scifiplaya.com.  When Fidgit was shut down in 2010, I had two options: return to freelancing, or make a go of running Quarter to Three full time.  I made the latter choice.  It\u0027s what I\u0027ve been doing ever since and I haven\u0027t regretted that choice for a second.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen Fidgit was shut down, I was happy to step away from the daily slog for content.  Sometimes I simply didn\u0027t have much to say, but it was my job to find something to say anyway.  I don\u0027t miss that one bit.  But some of what I wrote was meaningful.  Worth writing and I hope worth reading.  However, when the Sci Fi Channel (redubbed Syfy by that point) closed Fidgit, they didn\u0027t even archive it.  Every single thing I\u0027d written for the last few years instantly vanished.  That\u0027s also the case with many of the things I\u0027ve written for websites and magazines that are no longer around.  But since I write solely for Quarter to Three, which has been the repository for all my work since 2010, I can be assured it will never vanish.  Short of me, you know, accidentally deleting it by pressing the wrong button in WordPress or something.  I try to keep my fingers away from buttons I don\u0027t understand.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nQuarter to Three is no longer based on advertising. \u00a0It is based entirely on your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, the internet.  But I live in Los Angeles if that matters.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause I\u0027m my own editor, I don\u0027t have to write about things that are popular.  I can cover smaller independent games with as much enthusiasm as I want.  I can be openly critical of larger profile AAA games. I can jump on a bandwagon or let it drive on by without me.  I can simply decide a game isn\u0027t worth writing about.  I can miss deadlines, because I don\u0027t have any. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSince I\u0027ve run Quarter to Three full time, I exist almost entirely outside the bubble of marketing and PR.  And I wouldn\u0027t have it any other way.  I don\u0027t go to press junkets or get preview builds or jockey for exclusive coverage.  I watch or ignore E3 -- mostly the latter -- from the comfort of my home.  I don\u0027t even read previews.  I am just a guy who picks up a game that looks interesting and plays it, just like you.  I am not a games journalist and that suits me just fine.  My site is a place where me and my contributors write about things we find interesting.  Enthusiasm is never manufactured.  It is never set up by PR or publishers.  It is entirely ours.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI sometimes hear that I\u0027m a contrarian, that my reviews are too harsh, or that someone never agrees with my opinion.  I find all of those hard to believe.  The contrarian accusation implies that I choose to feel a certain way because it\u0027s the opposite of how others feel.  It implies that what I write isn\u0027t genuine, but is instead contrived based on other opinions.  Given that I never read reviews before I write about a game, and that I\u0027m terrible at following social media, and that reddit is too confusing for me and NeoGAF is too busy for me, I\u0027m usually unaware of these other opinions.  In other words, I\u0027m too oblivious to be contrarian.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs for my reviews being too harsh, that\u0027s a matter of opinion and the inverse is just as possible.  I will accept that I can be too harsh so long as you also acknowledge that I can be too forgiving.  My opinions can go either way.  Furthermore, your judgment of whether they\u0027re harsh or forgiving is entirely subjective.  Much like the opinion you\u0027re judging.  You might find something I\u0027ve said too harsh and that\u0027s fine.  I\u0027m sure I\u0027d feel the same way about some of the things you say.  But it makes no sense to suggest all of my reviews are characterized by harshness.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd as much as I appreciate the sentiment behind supportive comments like \"I rarely agree with Tom Chick, but \u0026lt;insert approving comment here\u0026gt;\", that strikes me as absurd.  I\u0027ve reviewed hundreds of games and movies on Quarter to Three.  I\u0027ve reviewed hundreds more for other publications and sites.  Although I hope there\u0027s some unique value in how I express my opinion, I\u0027ll bet you dollars to donuts the majority of my opinions aren\u0027t very different from the conventional wisdom.  I loved Grand Theft Auto V.  I hated EA\u0027s online SimCity.  I gushed over Mario Kart 8, Diablo III, Arkham Knight, and Gone Home.  I was disappointed by Gearbox\u0027s Aliens game, Rome II, Sid Meier\u0027s Beyond Earth, and Resident Evil 6.  There is nothing special about the degree of my enthusiasm or disappointment with these games.  There is no reason to dismiss my overall perspective as if I\u0027m some sort of consistent outlier.  For the most part, I\u0027m a lot like you.  And like you, I feel more strongly about some games than others.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t you have a conflict of interest?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFair question!  Even though I\u0027d rather you didn\u0027t call me a games journalist, there is some justified concern these days about ethics in games journalism.  So I should tell you that I have written reviews for publishers.  These are called \"mock reviews\" because they\u0027re not \"real\" in that they\u0027re not for public consumption.  They are strictly for internal use to get a sense of how the press might react to a game.  Sort of an early finger held up to the wind.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have done this very rarely and only three times since 2014.  Frankly, I don\u0027t anticipate doing it much at all, given that it\u0027s become a cottage industry.  Several former games journalists have started companies that offer this as a service to publishers or they advertise their services as professional consultants.  But for me, the process was no different from writing any other review.  Of course, I have recused myself from an official public review for those titles.  I haven\u0027t, however, recused myself from freely talking about the games in question.  The latest games I\u0027ve written mock reviews for are The Sims 4, Battlefield I, and Final Fantasy XV (hated it, kinda liked it, hate it).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI wrote the manual for Galactic Civilizations II and provided input during the development of Ashes of the Singularity.  The guy who runs Stardock, the company that published those games, is a good friend of mine.  I consulted with Chris Park at Arcen Games, who I also consider a friend.  He hired me to help him brainstorm for the name of an upcoming game. When it comes out, I\u0027ll recuse myself from reviewing it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally, I am friends with a guy who does a lot of voiceover in videogames.  Yuri Lowenthal was one of the Princes of Persia and the credits of JRPGs are lousy with his name.  I am also friends with a woman who was an artist for a popular franchise and now works for a really cool developer that makes a game whose name rhymes with Trey, but I\u0027ll refrain from naming her so as not to out her to her coworkers, many of whom probably don\u0027t like me for things I\u0027ve written about their work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere.  You now know the sum total of all my potential conflicts of interest.  I will update this section if it develops."
