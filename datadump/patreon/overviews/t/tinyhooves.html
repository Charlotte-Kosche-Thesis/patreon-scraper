Values Everyone\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHR is dedicated to the rescue and rehabilitation of \nfarm animals, and inspiring the change in the human and animal bond. We \npromise to provide shelter, care, and rehabilitation for abused, \nneglected, abandoned, and unwanted small breed farm animals,\n including ones that can no longer be cared for by their owners.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\n\nAs you can imagine, caring for our 100+ residents requires both time and \nmoney. While our Board of Directors and dedicated volunteers attend to \nthe physical needs of the animals, THR is seeking out \ncompassionate individuals who are looking for ways to\n financially support our rescue friends. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEach month, we spend roughly $1,000 on food for the animals. This number \ndoes not include the cost of winter bedding, yearly veterinary care, or \nproperty rental fees. Nor does it include the cost of fencing repairs, \nshelter building supplies, or animal grooming\n tools. Our operating costs soar even higher when one of our residents \nrequire emergency medical care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt THR, we are well aware that money can\u0027t buy happiness.\n For us, happiness is found in the joy of watching a formerly abused \nanimal frolic with her herd in the summer sun. Witnessing the birth of \nan animal and knowing it will never be sold for\n consumption or monetary gain. Scratching the belly of a creature and \nseeing unadulterated love and gratitude in their eyes. However, we \nalso know that none of these magical moments would be possible without \nthe generosity and financial support of people like\n you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhether you are an individual who would like to make a one-time \ndonation dedicated to the care of our residents, or you are interested \nin making a long-term investment in the rescue, we would be most \nappreciative of your aid.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFind Us Online:\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.tinyhooves.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.tinyhooves.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook:\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tinyhoovesrescue\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/tinyhoovesrescue\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
