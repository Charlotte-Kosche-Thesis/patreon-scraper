We\u0027ve been creating short form sketch comedy for years in lieu of examining our friendship. But more importantly \u003cstrong\u003ewe\u0027ve been creating the Team Tiger Awesome show\u003c/strong\u003e a podcast experience for audio lovers that\u0027s passed 69 hour long episodes over the last year and a half. Which means we\u0027re proper grown boys and can\u0027t snicker at the number 69 anymore and we should probably all grow mustaches so people know we\u0027re adults when we try to rent cars.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a true fan and #Titten you may know we dabble in: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMovies!\u003c/strong\u003e - creating the sequels Hollywood is too scared to make! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePop culture!\u003c/strong\u003e - Tournaments, remember when the Starbucks Holiday Cup almost won?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eErotica!!!\u003c/strong\u003e- Can anyone forget when Wolverine made love to K.I.T.T. in a powdered wig on the deck of a doomed ship?\u003cbr\u003eand if you\u0027re not a #Titten... we should explain the fans named themselves.
