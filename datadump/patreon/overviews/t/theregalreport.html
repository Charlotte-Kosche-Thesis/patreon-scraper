    "summary": "First and foremost, I want to thank you if you\u0027ve even found your way to this page. It means you\u0027ve put some effort into looking for a way to support what I\u0027m doing, and that means more to me than any of these words I\u0027m typing can really express. Now, the question becomes: what am I doing? Well, let\u0027s dig into that...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Regal Report was originally created in 2015 on YouTube as an outlet for me to express my interests in music, mobile tech, video games and more. At the time, I was primarily known simply as an up-and-coming hip-hop artist out of the DC area, featured on sites such as 2DopeBoyz, HipHopDX, XXL, and Complex, along with appearances on platforms such as Sway In The Morning, MTV Jams, and more. Everybody raps, though, especially in this day and age. So what makes you more than that? What makes you more than just another young Black person that grew up in lower middle-class status standing behind a microphone, putting words together? It\u0027s your interests. Your morals. Your passions. Your beliefs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this platform was born as a way to bring light to the mind of Rob Regal, not just the music. As an artist, writer, music fan/critic, tech geek, battle rap enthusiast, and content creator, the plan is to consistently provide my outlook on life to the culture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that you believe in my creativity, even just the validity of my opinions in these topics, to want to support me as I write these articles and create these videos for you.\u003cbr\u003e"
