    "summary": "How\u0027s it going, everyone? I\u0027m TVaria SailorPeace, and welcome to my Patreon page. I am an aspiring voice actress and video editor, and I wish to make this into a job. You will find a lot of my content on YouTube, but you will find me on VidMe and Twitter as well. For those who haven\u0027t seen my work yet, feel free to check it out here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/animewwelover999\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/animewwelover999\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also create some bracelets on Etsy, and I am trying to get some sold. I have some listings already up and running, but I would like to create more and expand more on the selections that I have presented. Feel free to check out my bracelets here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/SailorPeaceBracelets\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.etsy.com/shop/SailorPeaceBracelets\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll reward info will be seen in the Rewards Panel. Remember, every dollar counts, and if you cannot donate, feel free to help spread the word. Once I can hit a good amount, I\u0027ll be able to upgrade, replace, or receive some of the necessary stuff that is needed to make recording and video editing a lot more professional. I will also be able to get more supplies for making bracelets. However if a very large amount total is possible from all pledges, then I may as well be one step closer to developing a physical business for the bracelets as well as a small studio for my own recording. Currently, my bracelet business and video editing all take place in my home, but it is enough to get as much as I can get done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease keep in mind that I use Sony Movie Studio Platinum in order to get some editing done. If you wish for my editing help, please take that into consideration. Also note that if you put in a request for a bracelet, I will try to message you with my email, Skype, and/or Discord so that way we can communicate how you would like your bracelet to be. The amount of time it will take to make the bracelet will depending on the materials and how you like it (and don\u0027t worry about size too much unless it needs to be bigger or smaller...I make bracelets stretch).\u003cbr\u003e"
