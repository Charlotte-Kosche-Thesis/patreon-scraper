    "summary": "We are The Wizard and the Wyld, and we want to tell you a bedtime story. In fact, we want to tell you lots of bedtime stories - stories full of wonder, magic, discovery, and hope - but we need your help to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do we do it? Well, we believe that stories have the power to change lives. Stories help us to understand the world we live in, and who we are. A story can inspire learning and ignite creativity. When we are down, a story can give us hope, when we feel alone, a story can give us belonging, when we feel scared, they can give us courage and strength. At the end of the day, a story can help us sleep peacefully through the night, bringing dreams of magic and wonder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an artist and poet, and as parents of a young son, we know how important stories are. As world-renowned gaming and learning experts, we know the power of video games to engage children in their own discovery. Which is why we like to bring the two together. Our stories are a creative collaboration between digital technology, traditional storytelling, poetry, and music, where you can be part of the story, not just the reader.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the last thing you want when you are immersed in a story is a big old advert popping up and trying to sell you something. Which is why we are here, asking for your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe have been telling stories for a long time now. Our early stories were Minecraft parodies of our son\u2019s favourite bedtime tales, which we made for him to enjoy. We thought maybe other people would enjoy them too. Since then, \u201c\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gtU6q5dsaE\u0026amp;t=32s\"\u003eWe\u2019re Going on a Ghast Hunt\u003c/a\u003e\u201d and \u201c\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXMX1W9VsfE\"\u003eWhen Stampy Came to Tea\u003c/a\u003e\u201d have been viewed over 1.6 million times. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/pXMX1W9VsfE/maxresdefault.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eLater on our storytelling journey, we made some very different videos. \u201c\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M91KUQ7sUDo\u0026amp;t=2s\"\u003eMy Mother\u2019s House\u003c/a\u003e\u201d is a poetry and Minecraft collaboration that tells the story of a daughter caring for her mother as she faces terminal cancer, and \u201c\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3E479s9MiE\"\u003eOpen the Door\u003c/a\u003e\u201d, is a musical collaboration with The Bookshop Band, inspired by a story about a father connecting with his autistic son through the game world of Minecraft.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/F3E479s9MiE/maxresdefault.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to keep telling stories. We need support to give us the time and resources to do this on a regular basis. By being a patron to us here, you will enable us to create regular stories for people to enjoy online. In return, you will be able to get those stories first, completely free from adverts and social influencers. What\u2019s more, you will be able to find out more about where the stories come from, how we made them, and who we are as artists, and as parents.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThrough our stories, we aim to bring a little bit of magic, hope, and love into the worlds of those who share them. We want you to be part of that. Together, we can make this world a better place, one tale at a time.\u003cbr\u003e"
