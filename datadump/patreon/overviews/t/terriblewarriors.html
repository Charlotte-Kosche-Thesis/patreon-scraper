Putting together enough content to release\na new chapter every Monday and Thursday from players all across Canada is no\neasy task. Each campaign usually means organizing a marathon five-hour recording\nsession every single month. It means hours of prep work, working out schedules (there are none of us who work full-time for the podcast and we each have our own conflicting work schedules and commitments), booking\nstudio time, editing and producing the show to sound appealing to our\nlisteners and meeting the quality that we have come to expect of ourselves, and to constantly and consistently be on the lookout for new games and settings. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is an understatement when we say that it takes a significant amount of resources and sacrifice to\nkeep this show rolling. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow we love doing this show. We\u2019ve been playing almost non-stop since our first\ngame in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.terriblewarriors.com/video-game-expendables\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOctober of 2012\u003c/a\u003e and we have no plan on ending. But we know we can do\nbetter. We know we can provide a unique and entertaining show, with newer and better games,\nwith the quality we\u2019ve come to expect of ourselves, and inviting new friends\nand special guests to join us in our games.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have never charged a fee to listen to our show (and never will!) and the\nreality of audio podcasting in Canada makes advertising untenable and\nunrealistic. So we\u2019re approaching our community of listeners and players to\nconsider supporting us so that we can continue to grow. With whatever support\nyou think suitable we\u2019ll be able to help cover the costs of running the show,\npay artists for their contributions, pay for music licenses for use in the\nprogram, and bring a better variety of games and contributors into our studio. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou might be asking, \u201cWill the show be going behind a paywall?\u201d so let us be as clear as we can. \u003cstrong\u003eThe show will always be\navailable for free forever.\u003c/strong\u003e We have no plans to gate our adventures. We may\nproduce additional content that will be available to Patreon subscribers, such as our old debriefings that we cut from the format for scheduling reasons,\u00a0but any rewards will be supplementary. Our supporters will be supporting a free\npodcast that everyone can access because they want this show to grow as much as we do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are over 20 of us plus other artists\nand creatives we include for various projects, with your support we\u0027ll be able to compensate people for their time and hard work in more than just a pizza lunch and exposure. We\u0027re already thankful that\nyou\u0027ve even read this far. Our goal is make more\ncontent and pay the people who work on this program. We believe this platform is the best way to achieve that goal and\nkeep intact the reasons why you enjoy the\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.terriblewarriors.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTerrible Warriors.\u003c/a\u003e"
