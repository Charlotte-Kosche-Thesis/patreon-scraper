Through the use of music isolation, you get an exact idea of how impactful the music is, much in the same way a composer would while scoring the film. During key moments in the movie, sound effects and dialogue are removed and the music is left in place, there is no better way to feel it\u0027s impact.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/eYrAWa/why.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few reasons. First and foremost, I\u0027m obsessed with movie scores and the incredible emotion they bring to the films. I know I am not the only one, but creating the content to showcase these effectively is sometimes challenging and time consuming. I also believe this content should be presented in the best technical way possible, with sharp picture and clear sound (I even offer true Ultra-wide 21:9 aspect ratio content).\u003cstrong\u003e Finally I believe this content should be free of cost and distractions.\u003c/strong\u003e Advertisements distract from the videos and money limits the audience, and I think everybody should have access to and enjoy these great scores. \u00a0Additionally, the complex fair use aspect of these videos means it\u0027s next to impossible to monetize anyways, as copyright holders have final say, regardless of the legal use.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/kvJPra/whatare.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my videos and you want this channel to continue, Patreon is the perfect companion. \u003cstrong\u003eIt literally inspires me to work harder and better to constantly improve and craft a great experience.\u003c/strong\u003e If you support me, every single dollar means the world, and I feel indebted to making sure you feel rewarded for your support.
