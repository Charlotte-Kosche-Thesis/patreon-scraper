The dream had been lived!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt took me a good year or so to get used to being back in \u0027normality\u0027, to be honest that was the hardest part of the whole trip, I just hadn\u0027t given it a thought as to how I\u0027d cope or what it would be like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d blogged and vlogged my whole trip, and if I was to be honest I really missed the interaction I\u0027d had with people on various social media platforms, and I REALLY missed making videos. So, in October 2016 I decided I\u0027d start the YouTube vids up again for no other reason than I\u0027d missed it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe whole mantra behind TeapotOne is 3 words - \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"LIVE YOUR LIFE\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. My mum said them to me which in turn spurred me one to do the trip. I\u0027ll forever be grateful to her for that, and I try to live by them every day. Now I can\u0027t go gallivanting around all over the place every day, I have a job, a family, committments, just like you. But I try to make sure that I make the absolute most of any time I do get to LIVE MY LIFE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m no different to you, I work full-time to help keep a roof over our \nheads, food on the table, and a wee bit left to put in the tank so I can\n get out on the bike and meet as many of you as possible. I\u0027ve worked \nhard to build up a solid reputation as someone who doesn\u0027t sell out, I \npoint blank refuse to take on sponsorship deals and say something is \ngood when it\u0027s not, or have my vids sponsored by a particular company or\n product. That\u0027s just not me. I love to explore new roads and places on \nthe bike, meet new people and \nexperience different places and what they have to offer - who doesn\u0027t \nright! It makes great content for the videos, keeps things exciting and \nnew, and makes me improve in my production skills and quality each and \nevery time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with your faith and help on here, I\u0027ll be able to cut down on the overtime at work (which pays for the fuel, trips, gadgets, kit I use and review on the channel) and spend more time out on the bike coming to meet you and other interesting people around the UK, EUROPE, and hopefully all over the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether we can show everyone what we have to offer and that life is for living, just get out there and LIVE IT!\u003cbr\u003e",
