    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hello, I\u0027m Jonathan, and I like working on animations. animations I\u0027ve been making are on my channel, TheAnimatedDrawings (TAD for short). TAD is my first channel where I experiment with flash animations and try my hand at making little animation skits, horror stories, and a few things I do out of sheer boredom. Animations called TAD Bits are the animation skit aspect where I animate skits I made that are short and sweet. I also tried my hand at animating something darker with my animated horror stories, made using audio from horror story narration channels like \"Mr. Nightmare\". Another thing that I\u0027m debating that I\u0027ll host on either TAD or it\u0027s own separate\u00a0channel is a project that\u0027s called \u003cem\u003eThe YouTube Community\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The YouTube Community (TYC for short) is a series that\u0027s taking a bit of a bigger step than the other projects that I\u0027ve worked on. TYC is going to be an ongoing series that centers around what goes on behind the curtains of YouTube\u0027s Headquarters. If I could describe the idea using comparisons I would say it\u0027s sort of like the show \u003cem\u003eThe Office\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0but instead of it centering around a paper company, it centers around the company of YouTube. The YouTube HQ\u00a0would have main characters that vary in personality and effect that company\u0027s work. In real life YouTube makes decisions that are very questionable like implementing\u00a0a terrible copyright system, demonetizing videos on it\u0027s platform that seem completely normal, seemingly supporting certain creators that make bad decisions but so happen to make a lot of subscribers, thus, a lot of money for the company, and the list goes on. The series would show the characters behind the company reacting to the backlash and show their reasoning behind those bad decisions in a fun, entertaining way. I also have more ideas to this story like having other companies get in the way of YouTube like Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and so on, and ideas for actual YouTubers to have parts in the show. This story is still in the works and I still need voice actors, composers, background artists, and so on since this all so far is just a one person project. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Patreon would be a big help in paying for production of TYC since so far I\u0027m still a pretty small creator, I need to meet a certain quota a month to get payed through adsense, and I need 4,000 hours of viewer watch-time a year. I would absolutely love to show everyone my shows and creations but for that to be possible, I need more time and money. I don\u0027t want to sound greedy but money is very big factor in any project, and if there isn\u0027t enough, the project would completely collapse. So in order to make my ideas happen I am asking everyone who is interested to donate to this Patreon and help me make this show, and other upcoming shows a reality.\u003cbr\u003e"
