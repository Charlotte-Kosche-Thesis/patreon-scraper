It was originally inspired as a way for me to hold my own pain and wounding from a challenging childhood, a sick mother, and the death of my mother. From there\u2026I knew that other people could benefit from this stripping down, being vulnerable, finding HOME, and, in turn, feeling FREE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel honored to bring this project to the world. I feel honored every time someone trusts me to photograph them in The Nest. And, I feel honored by the lives that this project has touched and changed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mission with this project is to get as many people in The Nest as a way to show that when we strip it all down\u2026.we are all the same, we all have wounding, and have all come the same place no matter where we were born, the color of our skin, who we choose to love, and who we pray to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease, feel free to reach out, as I love connecting with new people.
