Inspired by that, I taught myself how to program to make some little games for my friends and family throughout the 1980\u0027s. \u00a0Then, after going to school and graduating with a degree in English (of all things!) I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to have been making Games professionally since 1995.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making videos primarily as a way to express my thoughts regarding topics such as sexism in Video Games and video game development. \u00a0I also have some other eclectic interests, such as the rise of Artificial Intelligence, the dangers of Identity Politics and Social Justice, and the development of positive, science-based, alternatives to religion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to make this Patreon page in response to requests from some of my subscribers. \u00a0I\u0027m not looking to get rich here - or even necessarily do this as a full-time gig. \u00a0But I absolutely appreciate any support that you may want to give for the videos that I do produce as it\u0027ll help me to improve my equipment and make higher quality productions in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you, and Game On, my friends!"
