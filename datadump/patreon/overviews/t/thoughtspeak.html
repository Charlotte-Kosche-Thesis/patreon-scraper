    "summary": "Welcome to Thought-Speak: A podcast dedicated to the discussion and review of one of the 90\u0027s most popular serialized book series, Animorphs. Written by husband-wife duo K.A. Applegate (and a slew of ghostwriters), the series ran from 1996 to 2001 and \u0027acquired\u0027 the hearts of millions of young readers around the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour hosts Mitchell and Coleman have committed themselves to reading and reviewing every book in the series, from The Invasion to The Beginning and every book inbetween. The completed podcast archive will have 60+ episodes and feature extended interviews with the series authors, and as many special guest hosts as we are able to arrange.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe welcome listeners to follow along from book to book and take part in the discussions. Our goal is to renew interest in the series and discuss how the books could best be adapted into a more visual format, like television episodes or movies. It is our belief that it is only a matter of time until a production company gets the film/TV rights to Animorphs, and we want to do our part in vocalizing the fans perspective on how to get the most out of that inevitable adaptation."
