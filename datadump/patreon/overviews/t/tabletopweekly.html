    "summary": "I love making videos about Tabletop Gaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether it\u0027s How To guide on playing a new game, Dungeon Master advice for new D\u0026amp;D players, sitting down for a 3-hour boardgaming session with my friends, an intense game of Warhammer or Warmachine or just talking about the latest news from the hobbies I enjoy so much, I love making content for Tabletop Weekly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I want to do it full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore content. More regular uploads. Better equipment. Bigger projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy what I do on YouTube or Twitch, and you\u0027d like to help me make *more* cool stuff and give you guys a little something back for your amazing generosity, then I would be very grateful for your patronage. If you just want to watch my stuff, or can\u0027t afford a Patreon or Twitch sub, then please don\u0027t worry - Just watching and sharing my content is enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut for those of you who do donate, subscribe, patreon(?) or otherwise support me, you have my deepest thanks and gratitude. It\u0027s because of you guys that I can keep doing this and keep growing Tabletop Weekly into something that helps brings tabletop gamers together and introduce MORE people to this amazing hobby of ours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eBut Mark, you also take Twitch Donations and run ads on YouTube why do you need Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFair question and I want to be transparent about this, even if it isn\u0027t the \"clever\" move.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAd revenue on YouTube is not what it used to be (or what people think it is, especially for small channels like me) and being part of the Yogscast means a solid percentage of my ad revenue goes to fund them. So, to be blunt, I don\u0027t make that much off of Ad Revenue right now, if any at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIF that were to change and I become the next overnight YouTube sensation and I can support myself off Ad Revenue then I\u0027ll stop using Patreon as I agree it\u0027s a bit greedy to do both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith regards to Twitch, I think Twitch is a very different thing as not everybody likes Livestreams or can watch them, likewise the Donations allow people to donate specific one-off ammounts of any value. Subscribers also get emotes and other benefits within the Twitch system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be frank, I want to ensure I have multiple ways of earning money so I can keep doing this AND offer different options and ways for people to offer their support as not everything works for everyone. Buying a t-shirt, donating on Twitch, or supporting a Patreon are different ways of doing the same thing; supporting me making the stuff I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that explains my thought process well, and you are all cool with it. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
