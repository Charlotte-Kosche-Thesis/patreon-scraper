    "summary": "The Billfold has been sharing personal stories about personal finance since 2012. We\u0027ve looked at why the latte factor doesn\u0027t work, interviewed dozens of people about their saving and spending habits, and asked ourselves how Harry Potter would do money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve also built a community. Our readers have shared their thoughts, learned from each others\u0027 perspectives, and created one of the best comment sections on the internet. (Seriously.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we\u0027re asking our community to help us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to do a lot with The Billfold in 2018: feature more writers, bring back some of our best contributors, start a podcast, have even more conversations about how to manage our money in an ever-changing world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut \u2014 on the subject of an ever-changing world \u2014 we\u0027re no longer earning enough from ad revenue to fund the site. It\u0027s not just us; you might have noticed other websites downsizing or shutting down in the past few months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t want to shut The Billfold down, and we don\u0027t want to put it behind a paywall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we\u0027re asking for your support to keep The Billfold going. We\u0027ve launched a Patreon to help fund our site as we move into 2018. With Patreon, you can make a monthly contribution based on your budget (and shift that contribution up or down as your budget changes). We also have goals that we\u0027re hoping we can achieve together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we\u0027re a personal finance site, we know exactly what these kinds of monthly contributions are worth. We hope that you\u0027ll be as excited about growing The Billfold as we are \u2014 and yes, you\u0027ll still be able to read the site even if you don\u0027t participate in the Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support \u2014 both now, and for the past five years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
