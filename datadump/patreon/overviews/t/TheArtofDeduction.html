    "summary": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The art of deduction, it is not just the name of my YouTube channel, it isn\u0027t simply a fancy skill set either, popularized by the famous Sherlock Holmes. Nor is it merely the art that has become my obsession over the past 3 years. No, it is bigger than that, it is bigger than I am. It is the epitome of common sense, the height of logical reasoning in the face of illogical situations, and the embodiment of cause and effect. It is bigger than any one person, and such a vast field that no man or woman could ever achieve full mastery over it. From a drop of water a clever man could infer the possibility of an Atlantic, from a grain of sand a Sahara, likewise from a tan-line a person\u0027s recent vacation, and from a person\u0027s visage, their true intent. The process of reasoning backwards, determining the cause, or causes, of an observable effect. The possible applications of this are virtually limitless. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The driving force behind my pursuit is my desire to be able to see the truth behind the facade. The world is run by lies and corruption, from the highest level of government, to the average person on the street, everyone lies, and whats more we base our lives upon lies. Being polite to a person, when in reality you absolutely despise them, and were it not for certain constraining circumstances, you would refuse to associate with them and avoid them at all costs, is a lie of a sort. Is doing such necessarily a bad thing? No, depending on the circumstances one has to trade practicality for stability, but this does go to prove my point that even those things which we equate to being noble, are based in falsehood. Even asking someone how there day is going as you pass by is a pointless exchange when you have no genuine interest in how they are doing. Why am I saying all this? Because before you can see the truth other people hide, you have to acknowledge, intimately, the truth within yourself, and while that might sound mystical, it is entirely rational. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What am I getting at with all of this? My purpose is twofold. I am simply illustrating a point, of how practical this skill is to anyone; in a world run on lies, it is highly advantageous to be able to see through those lies. Furthermore, to show that my ideals, my goals, my dreams, are utterly unattainable. I wish for a world governed by the truth, a world where corruption is the anomaly rather than the norm, a world devoid of crime, where justice rules. Terribly idealistic, awfully dramatic, and painfully unattainable, isn\u0027t it? However while utterly unattainable, not meaningless. Aim higher than you can hit, and you will hit higher than you ever thought you could. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Save for a few ideals, and absolutes, I am governed by practicality, as such it is a habit of mine to evaluate situations consider every possibility, and formulate plans accordingly, I know what I intend to use this skill for, and how I will use it, with the end goal of leaving this world in a better place than where I left it. However despite the potential change, that one man can usher in, there is a limit. This is the reason that I continue to grow my channel, and introduce more and more people into deduction, as well as giving those seeking training a place where they can learn. With the calculated assumption that people out there will be able to use this skill for admirable reasons as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To you who have come to my Patreon, I can only assume that you have at the very least a desire, and at the most the intent, to contribute to my channel with your funds, and for that I thank you. I wanted you to know exactly what you are contributing to, hence this philosophical rabbit hole that I have lead you down. Know that if you become my Patron, the money that you donate, will go to funding my YouTube channel, by providing the necessary funds for me to purchase better equipment and software that will enable me to be able to produce better content more efficiently, which goes towards giving you as my viewer more, and better videos detailing how you can improve your deductive prowess. If you chose to become my Patron, I promise you that your investment will not go to waste.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"

In these sessions I will essentially teach a video class on deduction, beginning with the core basics of developing your mindset properly, to being able to preform complex deductions. I will be using the experience I have and the methodology I have developed for the last 4 years to teach you how to be an advanced practitioner of deduction. I will keep my lessons concise and entertaining, and afterwards you will have the floor to ask me questions bring up your deduction experiences and build off of the other members of the class. This experience is something I would have loved to have when I was starting out, and I would love to be able to help you develop your skills in deduction.\u00a0",
