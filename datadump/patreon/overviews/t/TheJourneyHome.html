They find themselves somewhere they don\u2019t really belong and the extraordinary odds they have to overcome in order to make it home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this journey, they encounter monsters and magic and a wizard who lives in magic bubble because he\u2019s allergic to everything and all kinds of fun stuff. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I\u2019ve told you about the comic, let me tell you about how you can help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon you help me out by pledging money each month that I create new content for the comic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will help me pay some bills, upgrade my software/equipment\u2026 who knows maybe I\u2019ll afford a cat but most importantly allow me to spend more time creating for you and less time wasting my life doing something I\u2019m not passionate about.\u003cbr\u003eBelow are different levels that you can pledge and with each level you get something out of it too. Bonus content, patreon exclusives, personal images. All kinds of stuff! It\u2019s kinda like Kickstarter but an on going Kickstarter and cooler. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe comic will be put up on it\u2019s own website for free for anyone but without pledging you won\u2019t get all the neat stuff that comes along with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you take a look at all the pledge options and find one that best fits you. Whatever little bit will help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much you guys!"
