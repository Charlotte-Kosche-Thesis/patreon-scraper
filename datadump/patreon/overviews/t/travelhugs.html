We\u2019re Dan and Dee, but you probably knew that already :) In case you don\u0027t know us, or what we are doing, we\u2019ve made the video above to bring you up to speed.\u003cbr\u003e\n2018 is shaping up to be a massive year of travel for us, with adventure, new beginnings, \u0026amp; loads of uncertainty (in the best possible way!).\u003cbr\u003e\nIt has been said the key to fulfilment is to find something you love and do that everyday. \u003cbr\u003e\nWe love traveling and sharing our experiences, but like many we found \u201cwork and commitment\u201d got in the way.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe recognised every decision we make in life is a choice and we\u2019ve chosen to get out and explore this big beautiful world while we\u2019re still young enough to take advantage of everything she offers.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019ll upload all our adventures to YouTube - free for everyone to enjoy, so you don\u2019t have to contribute on Patreon to follow along...\u003cbr\u003e\nBecoming a Patron is a choice and there\u2019s no obligation to assist in any way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe love Patreon because nothing here is an obligation. Most importantly - we\u2019re not looking for a hand out and truly believe in the model of fair exchange. We want to inspire you with our travel videos and exploits. We aim to bring you experiences of something new and different that perhaps you haven\u0027t experienced yourself. If we can do that and entertain you, and you feel drawn to, you may consider contributing a few dollars (or many dollars!) to help us bring it all to you.\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of the costs incidental to our video productions include obviously the camera, editing equipment and software, drone, storage hard drives, mobile internet, and website hosting. This stuff\u2019s not cheap and surprisingly (to us at least) it can cost over $20 just to upload 1 high definition video to the World Wide Web in some areas. We do everything related to the production of the videos ourselves but as we grow we\u2019d love to outsource parts of this as well so we can concentrate more on bringing the best content to you. It all adds up of course and we want to be able to continue for as long as we\u2019re able. The fact is it costs money though so Patreon and its contributors could just be the tipping point between us having a finite period that we can do this, or being able to continue indefinitely. Whether you can (or want to) help or not, we are grateful that you are even here and considering it!

She starts every day with meditation and loves yoga.\u003cbr\u003e\nDan grew up cycling and sees nothing at all wrong with pedalling 100km before breakfast. He loves exploring someplace new - on or off the bike. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSome people are calling us brave, some crazy - We just know we are called to this, and have to do it now while we can: in great health and while it\u0027s just the 2 of us.\u003cbr\u003e\nTo the people who say we are lucky, well yes we are - but we all are!\u003cbr\u003e\nWe all prioritise everything in life and focus on the creation and attainment of those things.
