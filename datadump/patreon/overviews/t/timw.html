    "summary": "(\u003ca href=\"http://wip.warpdoor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWarp Door is here\u003c/a\u003e!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHi everyone! I\u0027m Tim.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been writing about indie games for nearly a decade now, and much of that time were spent on running and contributing articles for \n\u003ca href=\"http://indiegames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIndieGames.com\u003c/a\u003e (as Editor-in-Chief). Starting with the very first article in December 2007, I wrote about indie games until the end of 2011 before reluctantly taking on a non-writing job to make ends meet. This meant leaving behind what I love doing the most: finding new indie games to write about \u0026amp; helping to discover up-and-coming indie game developers who will become future inspirations to many.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOwing much to the persuasion from \n\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnPolson\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJohn Polson\u003c/a\u003e (ex-IndieGames.com EIC), \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/simoncarless\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSimon Carless\u003c/a\u003e and many more friends, I have returned to help run (and write occasionally on) IndieGames.com since November 2013. But during that time away I\u0027ve never stopped playing indie games (see \u003ca href=\"http://www.matthewwegner.com/igs-2013-soapbox-talk/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAddendum: IGF Entry Stats\u003c/a\u003e, final paragraph), and I\u0027m just happy that over the years many developers who I have become close friends with have also found success with their games. But this doesn\u0027t mean there won\u0027t be new developers and more success stories to be found. So here I am, back again, doing all I can to help indie game developers everywhere spread the word about their games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe reason why I\u0027ve created this Patreon page and asked for your help is because I don\u0027t make enough from writing about indie games to cover even my most basic expenses (food twice daily, electricity, water, internet, medical bills and family support). I encountered this problem two years ago when I had to leave my position on IndieGames.com for a non-writing job elsewhere, and I may have to take another long hiatus (possibly even a permanent one) from writing if I\u0027m still in the same situation in a couple of months from now. I\u0027m willing to give new funding models a shot, and if I\u0027m successful with this it will also serve as a strong encouragement for other editors to write about indie games full-time without having any financial worries in the back of their minds.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow you can help: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m only asking for a small donation of $1 or $2 every month, which comes up to around $12 - $25 per year for one year\u0027s worth of indie games articles (all free to read). The posts I write are extremely short (roughly three or four paragraphs long), but I do write about hundreds of indie games every year. Since the objective of these articles are only to highlight the indie games that you should look out for, I wouldn\u0027t expect more than ten or twenty dollars\u0027 worth of pledges per year from any single person.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI do welcome any extra pledges (thanks!) but I would also ask that you consider spending it on buying an indie game from one of your favorite developers to support them instead. Without sustainable income, many of our favorite developers could quit making the games they love and go back to their boring day jobs. Let us help in any way we can to prevent that from happening!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I will do in return for your pledges:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs mentioned above, I will keep searching all corners of the internet for new indie games to write about. Every article that I write will be accessible to everyone always, and will be posted up on \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.freeindiegam.es/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFreeIndieGam.es\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://indiegames.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIndieGames.com\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://wip.warpdoor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWarp Door\u003c/a\u003e. I will also be writing additional articles and features during the year, such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003einterviews with developers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emore advice on how to get press coverage for your games\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehow to prepare and run your own Patreon campaign for indie game developers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the new site, Warp Door: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf the second goal is achieved, I will collaborate with \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/cpriestman\"\u003eChris Priestman\u003c/a\u003e\non starting a new site that features articles about our favorite games (which will also \ndefinitely include indie games) called \n\u003ca href=\"http://wip.warpdoor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWarp Door\u003c/a\u003e.

We\u0027re hoping to do \nsomething different with Warp Door: the entire site will be \nfully-Patreon funded by the community, meaning that there will never be \nany ads on the site to distract or annoy our readers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour \npledges have helped us start up the new site, and if we can keep this up\n we should be able to pay future contributors, editors and new writers \nto write for the site in no time at all. And it\u0027s going to be awesome. :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Chris Priestman\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cbr\u003e\nFirst and foremost, you can read more about Warp Door over at Chris Priestman\u0027s \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/cpriestman\"\u003ePatreon page\u003c/a\u003e, and you can choose to support him there as well. Both of us will pool our resources (Patreon funds + effort + time) to get Warp Door up and running, then write on it as regularly as we possibly can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOutside of my hardworking friends and colleagues at IndieGames.com, Chris is one of the most diligent person I\u0027ve ever known who\u0027s doing excellent work at helping new indie developers get attention. His record speaks for itself (Game Tunnel, Indie Game Mag, IndieStatik\u0027s ex-EIC), and I believe that with your support he will go on to do even greater things for the indie game development community.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAn important note about your pledges: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMuch as I appreciate everyone\u0027s pledges, do note that you can \u003cem\u003ecancel any on-going pledge whenever you want\u003c/em\u003e.\n If the milestone goals are not achieved for any particular month, I can\n always scale back and budget the costs of running the site accordingly.\nI\u0027m also more than willing to use my own savings (and whatever I make \nfrom writing on other sites) to keep the new site running if no \nmilestone goals are achieved for several months. \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn summary: \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have already witnessed the incredible success that indie game developers have achieved in just the past few years. I believe that it will only keep getting better from here onwards, and I\u0027m happy to be part of the wonderful community who are creating history \u0026amp; building an even brighter future for indie game developers everywhere.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Tim W.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuotes: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\"I think Tim W.\u0027s contribution to indie games has been incredibly important, and I think his absence since the end of 2011 has left a gap.
