    "summary": "Hi there! My name is Dusty but if anyone knows me on the internet it will be through the name Thet. I\u0027ve been making Let\u0027s Play videos since 2009 on my Youtube channel. They started out as very standard commentary videos until I decided to try something different with Let\u0027s Play Dungeons and Dragons: Tower of Doom. I decided to voice all of the dialog in the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuKD2LEgXLc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuKD2LEgXLc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe project was received fairly well, and so I decided to do the same on my next big game project, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky. This ended up becoming a large project that, due to personal issues, had to be rebooted recently. Providing the voices of all of the different characters not only ends up being great fun but also allows me to provide an experience that is unique to many \u00a0other Let\u0027s Plays out there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, fully voiced let\u0027s plays are not only time consuming, but also bring out a lot of my perfectionist side. As such, I have not been able to produce any voiced let\u0027s plays in a long time. I would love nothing more than to be able to return to my craft, and with a little help from Patrons like you, I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also run a streaming show called The Thetstream. As of right now, it has no set schedule. However, being able to interact with my viewers has brought an entire dimension of fun to creating content that I had not previously experienced before. I would love to be able to stream more often, and ideally form a schedule that I can adhere to. With the help of Patrons like you, I can become a reliable source of live gaming entertainment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love nothing more than to entertain you.\u00a0Right now, it may seem that my projects are too ambitious. I am confident, however, with the backing of good people who want good entertainment, that I can deliver. With the help of Patrons like you, Thet can provide many avenues of entertainment for years to come!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will my money be spent?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA fair question! All money collected through Patreon will first be reinvested into Thet\u0027s different channels by order of importance to being able to make and deliver content. The order of importance is detailed below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComputer Upgrades \u003c/strong\u003e-- A more powerful computer means I can produce higher quality videos and allows me to play more\u00a0demanding games at high quality.
