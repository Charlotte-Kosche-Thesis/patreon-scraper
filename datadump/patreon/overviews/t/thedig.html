We talk to left-wing scholars and activists about history, criminal justice, immigration and more.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/\"\u003eJacobin\u003c/a\u003e is a leading voice of the American left, offering socialist perspectives on politics, economics, and culture. The Dig is doing the same in audio form. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show is hosted by journalist\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/DanielDenvir\"\u003eDaniel Denvir\u003c/a\u003e, who writes about criminal justice, immigration and politics. He is a writer in residence at Harvard Law\u0027s Fair Punishment Project and is currently working on a book about immigration politics for Verso.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have roughly 15,000 unique downloads each show and counting. If we keep adding patrons at the current rate, we\u0027ll hit 1,000 total supporters soon. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need your support so we can keep this thing alive. Past guests include Glenn Greenwald, Sarah Jaffe, Naomi Klein, Matt Bruenig, Barbara and Karen Fields, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, Sarah Jones, Mark Blyth, Stephanie Coontz, Diane Ravitch and Khalil Gibran Muhammad.\u00a0If you have an idea for a guest, email the host at danielDOTdenvirATgmailDOTcom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere does the money go? Good question! It will be split between Daniel Denvir, producer Alex Lewis, payments for music and overhead. We\u0027re also looking into investing in improving guest audio. Please note: patron rewards will typically be sent no sooner than three months after support is initiated. Sometimes, people drop their support early, which is totally cool, but in that case we lose money if we send the reward too soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComplete archives\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.blubrry.com/thedig/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eare here\u003c/a\u003e.
