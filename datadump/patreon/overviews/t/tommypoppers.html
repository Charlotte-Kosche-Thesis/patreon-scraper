    "summary": "The genesis of Tommy Poppers was a classic midlife crisis; a queer \nmenopause (AKA\u00a0 \u0027the manopause\u0027?). After a life-changing experience which left him hospitalised, he began a metamorphosis which has had a profound effect on every aspect of his life. \u003cbr\u003eHe became sober and committed to education and sharing ideas. \u003cbr\u003eHe became a creative community organiser and an LGBTQI activist which led him to becoming a Director of Margate Pride CIC. \u003cbr\u003eHe has continued to perform in a variety of clubs, bars, theatres and galleries. \u003cbr\u003eTwo years ago, he wrote a collection of dark, intimate songs which were produced by the Animal Farm studios in London.\u003cbr\u003eHis debut solo album has inspired a number of projects in Europe and SE Asia which have resulted in several music videos and a show \u0027The Cosmic Dilation\u0027 which dealt with themes of abusive relationships, recovery and retribution.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTommy Poppers is an independent artist committed to benefiting the whole community, and he values the time of all the artists, musicians, performers and crews involved in producing their work - he doesn\u0027t rely on the labour of \u0027unpaid interns\u0027.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHe has recently written a brand new collection of songs which he hopes to record for his second solo album later this year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHe is currently in talks to produce a rock and roll musical film with Spinning head productions in Thailand, and he looks forward to building a creative model that is focused on the product, the people involved - and not just the profits.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eJohn Waters is his hero.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
