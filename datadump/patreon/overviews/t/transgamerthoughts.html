Both series strive to remain insightful but also positive. My goal is to make videogame criticism fun, engaging, and something we can all enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to allow more focus and improve quality, I\u0027m asking for help from you! For roughly half a year, I\u0027ve been dealing with the expenses that come from video production: license fees, equipment, games, and more. With your help, I not only intend to offset those costs but upgrade to ensure that I can deliver high quality, worthwhile criticism to you and other Patrons! The goal is to release on video a month, either a \u003cem\u003eMinicrit\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eLet\u0027s Remember \u003c/em\u003eepisode. This campaign will ensure a tight timetable and active feedback with fans to ensure that you are getting my best work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll expenses will go towards videos. The more freedom I have on the financial end, the more tools I will have at my disposal to cover a wide range of games and topics while also examining them in a substantial and meaningful manner. Funds from this Patreon will only go towards the aforementioned video series; critical Let\u0027s Plays and work at my own site\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://transgamerthoughts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTransGamerThoughts\u003c/a\u003e will be unaffected by this campaign.
