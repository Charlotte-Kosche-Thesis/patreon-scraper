    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eWe help young people rebel against low expectations.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHey there! My name is Brett Harris.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy twin brother and I started TheRebelution.com when we were 16-years-old, because we believed the teen years are NOT a vacation from responsibility, but rather the launching pad of life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery month nearly 50,000 Christian teens, parents, and youth workers visit our website looking for challenging content written for teens, by teens.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We\u0027re On Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDespite our high traffic, we\u2019ve never accepted advertising \u2014 mainly because we find most content aimed at teenagers to be either condescending or juvenile.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(Which is the opposite of our content\u2026)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut as the website grows we\u2019ve realized three important things:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e1) We want TheReb to go on for a long time.\u003c/strong\u003e I once made the mistake of joking (on April Fool\u2019s Day) that the website was shutting down \u2014 and made a bunch of people cry. I realized that many teens have nowhere else to go to find serious Christian community and a real challenge.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e2) There\u2019s a LOT more we can (and should) do. \u003c/strong\u003eThe online landscape is rapidly changing, our website is out-of-date, and our social media presence is sorely lacking. Despite our success, we could be reaching a lot more teens with the \u201cdo hard things\u201d message.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e3) We need to make TheReb self-sustaining for this to work.\u003c/strong\u003e We\u2019ve stuck around for many years with a rotating crew of amazing part-time volunteers. But that is not sustainable. If this website is going to go on for a long time, it has to be able to support itself and pay for at least one full-time employee.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe first step in this direction has been to create our own paid products \u2014 like \n\u003cem\u003eDo Hard Things University\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eDo Hard Things Conference Videos\u003c/em\u003e, and the \u003cem\u003eYoung Writers Workshop\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGod has blessed these projects and so far they\u2019ve been able to cover our expenses and kept me from needing to walk away from TheReb to get a regular job. Whoohoo!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNevertheless, revenue from paid products is not sufficient to add another full-time employee \u2014 which we desperately need.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThat leaves us with two options:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOption A: Advertising\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOption B: Donations\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019ve already decided against using ads, so that makes the decision pretty clear. Raising support from our readers is the obvious way to go for two reasons:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eFirst, many of you have already asked about making a donation to support our work.\u003c/strong\u003e Maybe you received a scholarship to one of our paid programs during a difficult financial season for your family, but things are better now and you want to make up the difference. So far there hasn\u2019t been a simple way to handle that. But Patreon makes it easy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eSecond, being supported by our readers (even partially) would be an unbelievable honor.\u003c/strong\u003e It would touch us deeply and provide a level of accountability to improve the website that no other funding source could provide.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe way Patreon works is a reader can donate whatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. So anything, from $1/month up, is hugely helpful to the cause.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u2019ll Use the Money For\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur biggest need is for a full-time employee whose sole focus is on making TheRebelution.com better \u2014 better content, better editorial support, better social media presence, better comment moderation, better web design, etc.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nChristopher Witmer\u003c/strong\u003e (our new editor-in-chief) is available and willing to put his full attention on growing and strengthening the site. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://therebelution.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_1093-2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut like any young man, Christopher needs to make a living. Even though he\u2019s willing to work for free, it would only be a matter of time before he\u2019d have to divide his attention between his volunteer work with us and generating real income somewhere else.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat is not a recipe for long-term growth or sustainability.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOur initial goal is $500/month. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u2019s the bare minimum Christopher would need to start dedicating part-time hours to The Rebelution platform.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOur next goal is $1,000/month. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat would allow Christopher to work 20 hours per week, without needing to find another part-time job in the next few months.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOur target goal is $2,000/month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat will allow Christopher to devote full-time hours to the website \u2014 a level of focused attention TheReb hasn\u2019t enjoyed in almost ten years.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat may seem like a lot of money, but if each of our monthly readers gave just 5 cents, we\u2019d exceed our target goal.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You So Much\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u2019re still reading this, it\u2019s probably because TheReb has played an important role in your life (or the life of someone you love).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf that\u2019s the case, we\u2019d be honored if you\u2019d help us keep going. Even a $1/month contribution would make a huge difference.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd we\u2019ve got some neat reward levels as \u201cthank you\u201d for your support.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJust click the orange \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cBecome A Patron\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e button to get started.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
