    "summary": "For starters, I would like to thank you for visiting my Patreon. Whether you are able to donate at this time or not, knowing you are interested in my journey means the world to me. When I began spinning rope dart a year ago, I knew I wanted to get into performing, but had no idea how far things would go. Since building my own rope dart from supplies I had lying around, I have since joined the GLOvation performance company, performed at numerous events, and starred in a music video. To continue honing my craft, however, I need the ability to have access to more festivals and events. This is where you can come in, and help make my dream a reality. This summer, my partner and I are attempting to travel the United States and Canada so we may both perform and, more importantly, grow as performers. While we have some gigs lined up, the main issue will come with the daily expenses such as food, as well as saving to hopefully purchase a small bus before we leave. While I am incredibly grateful to those who have already said they would throw me a few bucks, I wanted a way to give something back to those helping my dream become a reality, hence this Patreon. Thank you in advance for considering becoming a patron, and for being all around awesome.\u00a0 \u00a0 -Tempest"
