    "summary": "Hi. I have been writing a book since 2013 and anyone who knows me knows how hard I been working at this, I truly have been giving it my all. You all know there\u0027s three things that my world is centered around #1 GOD #2 my family #3 this book. That has been my life, even before I started actually writing the book, it was always my dream to be a writer. I love music yes, but my dream was never to be a \"singer\" the way some people may think. I love music, but music is only my hobby, writing is my passion, it is what keeps me up at night, it is what keeps me dreaming. I love sharing my heart with people and there\u00a0is no better way to do that then through writing. You all know the battles I\u0027ve overcome so you know I\u0027m a fighter and I will keep fighting and pushing through those barriers and fight for this book, till one of two things happen. One the book comes into existence and gets published, or two the LORD calls me home. Those are my options, so my point is. I will never give this dream up, nothing will stop me! So come be a part in making my dream come true. Because I\u0027m not stopping for anyone or anything. This book will happen. I believe it and now I need you to believe it with me \u2764\ufe0f"

But I promise to pick two of my patrons and send them a painting that I take time to not only hand paint but that also has meaning to me. Usually when I paint pictures I mostly do landscapes and I mostly take pictures I find in books or on the web, and then turn them into art, but these two paintings I promise to do differently. I promise to take the time to pray and see what the Lord wants me to paint and then paint. Now like I said that will be some thing new for me so it may not come out as perfect as my other pieces have but it will be from the heart and I promise to make it as beautiful as I can \u2764\ufe0f",

     "description": "As you all know my writing career started with THE-BOOK-OF-ROO. My website that I personally designed and run. I love it, I love interviewing different artists and sharing my heart on that site. But sadly that cost money too and right now I kind of feel like I\u0027m at a standstill with it. I see so much potential for that site and I have so many dreams for it. But again everything I want to do for it I cannot do on my own and I\u0027d like to hire a professional website designer to help me get the site to look, feel and most Importantly run the way I envisioned it to run. I\u0027d like to turn it into either a Ezine (online magazine) or podcast, but truthfully I can see it as a Ezine more than a podcast. But doing all this cost money and again is money I do not have. As you all know I\u0027m disabled (cannot walk) so I like to think of you all as my arms and legs and right now I need you all more then ever. I need you to hold me up and move me forward. I am counting on you all to make these dreams possible. So what do you say, can we do this??",
