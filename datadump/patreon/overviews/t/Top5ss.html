It\u2019s almost a guarantee you will find something you like and given the amount of research and effort we put into our videos, you will want to come back for more. Our goal has always been to educate and entertain at the same time and this has led us down a path far greater than just Top5 style videos. Exploring historical and abandoned place whilst educating on the location? We do it. In-depth TV quality documentaries solely on Serial Killers? We do that too. It\u2019s called MurderousMinds. Like we said we really do have something for everyone, and with our unbiased approach to topics and through research you really can \u201csit back and enjoy\" the videos. BUT there is more\u2026.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWe also have a secondary channel, focusing solely on UFO sightings, the search for alien life and government conspiracies. If your looking for a channel on news you won\u2019t find anywhere else and discussions on things most news channels don\u2019t talk about, you\u2019ve come to the right place. \u003cbr\u003eCheck out the trailer for that channel:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0Tw9ehf2wk\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0Tw9ehf2wk\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY BECOME A PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking videos for two channels, running a website, a podcast (it\u2019s coming), exploring locations and everything in between is expensive. You have researchers, music producers, editors, writers, designers etc. Viewers can watch as many videos as they want on our channels without paying a penny because we run ads, however as you will read below Youtube isn\u2019t what it used to be. With the Patreon money we can keep up the high quality and professionalism people have come to love and continue bringing you better content. Plus you get rewards! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(141, 179, 226);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eLET\u0027S TALK ABOUT THE \u0027AD-APOCALYPSE\u0027...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am sure you are aware of Youtube\u0027s \"Ad-apocalypse\", which had quite a significant impact on many horror and crime channels. If you\u0027ve been watching Top5s for a while you will know we always approach all topics with an unbiased perspective and with the utmost respect. Regardless, YouTube very rarely takes this into consideration and we have had to tone down the content on specific videos to try and avoid demonetization, the MurderousMinds documentaries in fact get demonetized straight away. With the help of Patreon, the fact Youtube may demonetize our videos doesn\u0027t matter since we have the support of Patreons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTop5s\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
