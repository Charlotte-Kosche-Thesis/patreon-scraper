I\u0027m a writer. Putting words onto paper - digital or analogue - is what I do every day.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI blog, write poetry, and have several novels and longer works that I\u0027m going to self-publish. Unless, of course, one of the big houses finds my work, loves it, and makes me a deal that I can\u0027t refuse (without all the mess of horse head bedmates and late night visits, ideally).\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOn my blogs I write multi-part critiques of video games and books (\u003ca href=\"http://goboxbox.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGoing Box by Box\u003c/a\u003e), translate the Old English epic \u003cem\u003eBeowulf \u003c/em\u003e(\u003ca href=\"http://bloggersbeowulf.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eA Blogger\u0027s Beowulf\u003c/a\u003e),\u00a0and write poetry and movie reviews (\u003ca href=\"http://glarkly.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eA Glass Darkly\u003c/a\u003e). Outside of my blogs, I write and short science fiction and pseudo-literary and heroic fantasy novels. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hold\u00a0a master\u0027s degree in English and so I\u0027m well-versed in the rules of fiction and non-fiction writing. I follow these rules. And I break these rules. My aim to is to do both in ways that people find new and compelling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut knowing about these rules and all of the theories that people have come up with about how and why they work doesn\u0027t pay the bills. This is where great patrons such as yourself come in. As contributors to this Patreon campaign you will be giving me the most valuable resource of all: time.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more successful this Patreon campaign is, the more time I can spend working on my writing rather than a day job. In a way, this campaign is kind of like an advance that you, my readers, are paying me instead of a publisher.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo. As a patron, what will you be supporting? \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Blogs-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been updating my video game and book blog\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://goboxbox.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGoing Box By Box\u003c/a\u003e (home of multi-part book and video game critiques) almost every day since I started it back in January of 2012. Currently I\u0027m updating this blog a little less often as I establish myself as a freelance editor. Thankfully, though, I\u0027ve been able to keep up with frequent updates of my Beowulf blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bloggersbeowulf.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eA Blogger\u0027s Beowulf\u003c/a\u003e despite this professional transition. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThese blogging activities are my primary writing activity. They\u0027re the practice that I engage in to keep my basic writing skills sharp and to maintain a writing discipline. As a patron you\u0027ll help to ensure that I can continue my regular practice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what\u0027s all of this practice even for? Well, it\u0027s meant to help me better my writing so that I can make my fiction and poetry as good as it can be so that I can create some truly valuable ebooks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Ebooks-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a supporter of my Patreon campaign you\u0027ll also be supporting my efforts to turn the poetry, short stories, and novels I have (and have ideas for) into ebooks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShort story and poetry collections that I release as ebooks will be published all at once. I\u0027ll gather up 10-15 poems or seven to 10 short stories, format them as epubs and publish them. Right now I\u0027m planning on releasing my novels in a different sort of way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe current plan is to serialize my\u00a0novels (release them in several instalments of at least 10,000 words each). My thinking is that I can release them faster in these smaller pieces (whether I or someone else edits them) and that I can use reader feedback to improve my novels. After I\u0027ve released all of the pieces of a novel I intend to use readers\u0027 suggestions and critiques to make its complete edition the best it can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, as a patron you\u0027ll get some pretty swank deals on all of these ebooks. I\u0027m planning on selling them through Kobo, Amazon, and via my blogs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first of these ebooks will be a novel called \u003cem\u003eHeading East, Looking West\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHeading East, Looking West\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHeading East, Looking West\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0is an ex-pat novel about a twenty-something who leaves his ho-hum life in Canada to teach English in South Korea. It\u0027s definitely inspired by my own experience teaching in South Korea, but is also definitely a fictional account.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to sell each serialized part of Heading East, Looking West for $2. There will be five parts. The complete novel will sell for $7.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePoetry Collections\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFollowing that novel, I\u0027ll be releasing some poetry collections. These collections will consist of 10 to 15 poems gathered around a particular theme. They\u0027ll sell for $7, but I will definitely make them available for less for Patrons. \u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSimilar to these collections are two epic poems that I have drafted and waiting for editing. One is about a night in the life of a dishwasher, and the other is about the education and training of mythological and folkloric creatures. I will release these two pieces in their entirety and they I\u0027ll likely sell them for $10 \u00a0or less.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShort Story Collections\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe deal here will be similar to my poetry collections. I\u0027ll gather together a handful of short stories (none running longer than 10,000 words) and sell each collection for $10. Again, Patrons will get some sweet deals on these.\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n-Novels (aka the Grand Fantastical Scheme)-\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a lad I grew up reading fantasy and science fiction novels and playing video games. Somehow, \u003cem\u003eThe Lord of The Rings\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Golden Compass\u003c/em\u003e didn\u0027t leave as much of an impression on me as Super NES RPGs did, however. In particular, playing a game called \u003cem\u003eTales of Phantasia\u003c/em\u003e helped me to realize that I wanted to create my own extensive worlds, my own memorable characters, and my own intricate stories. (It also inspired me to use RPG Maker to create my own RPGs, but that\u0027s not what this campaign is about.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs such, my ambition is to create a fantasy series that covers a whole world and that world\u0027s history - from its earliest days until its end. \u00a0Writing this series is my ultimate goal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlready I have most of the starting point for this universe (a five-book series about the rebirth of the world) written. But it needs extensive work to become a unified and fully coherent whole. Once this campaign surpasses the $1500 mark I\u0027ll have the financial stability needed to seriously start into this extensive work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTl;dr\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn short, if you choose to support my campaign, you\u0027ll be giving me the gift of time. You\u0027ll also be helping me to fulfil my lifelong dream of being a writer and of bringing ripping yarns to as many people as possible. I\u0027ll be doing this with blogs, poetry, short stories, and novels."
