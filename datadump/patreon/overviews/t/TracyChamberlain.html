My name is Tracy Chamberlain. I am a singer/songwriter based out of Buck County, PA.\u00a0 I have been doing music for about 15 years. My grandfather taught me \nthe basics as a bluegrass country singer/guitarist. Music is such a powerful tool that can take you on a crazy roller-coaster ride. It\u0027s a beautiful thing which is why I became hooked on it and hope to follow in my grandfather\u0027s footsteps!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 My goal is to\u00a0keep performing and creating music for you because you guys encourage me to keep pushing. I have recorded music in Nashville TN which can be found on Spotify, Itunes, and other music platforms. If you are local or visiting come catch a show. My band and I play out just about every weekend. I have been doing weekly music cover videos on Youtube and I love that I am starting to get my little community together. You can be sure that I will post a new current song every Monday and a good old throwback tune on Thursday. Thank you so much for being a fan and supporting my passion.

We now have the internet and live streams so you can watch your favorite artist and get to know them on a more personal level. This is super exciting but it also means we are doing a lot of free shows. I mean we love sharing music and connecting but we the artist still need to put food on the table. Thankfully, Patreon makes it so we can do just that! I can create new music for you and form a better connection with you here. In the rewards you can get sneak peaks into the next cover, pictures unreleased to the public, behind the scene vlogs,\u00a0 hold discussions, and chat with me.

     "about": "I am a full time singer songwriter who started doing covers on youtube. I play out each weekends and love being able to follow my dreams!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eABOUT TRACY CHAMBERLAIN\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"I grew up in a small part of North East Philly. I have always dreamed of following my Grandfather\u0027s footsteps to be a country singer.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Tracy was raised on music by her Grandfather in Homeburgs, PA. Her Grandfather (Slim Chamberlain) was a guitarist/vocalist for a country bluegrass style band. When Tracy was 10 years old, he pushed her to pick up guitar and taught her a few chords. From that moment on music became a way of life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e      Tracy started singing in Sunday Church services at St.Dominic\u0027s, which opened up her love for being on stage.\u003cbr\u003eShe was known for being the quiet kid so this was a shock to many people. She really came out of her shell when she was in Highschool joining a numbers of Choirs and selected groups. She didnt stop at singing she expanded her talents to a handful of production plays and musicals with a group called Summer Stock.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e     Once she was 15 years old she joined a country band as a lead singer. It wasnt until she turned 22 that she decided\u003cbr\u003eto let her songs be heard. She was in a band called Whiskey Chords. They played many shows in Philly and South Street. They even could be heard on The Brotherhood Radio station. They did many interviews and were growing fast but the guitarist of the band was in the military and needed to \u003cbr\u003emove on. Although Tracy was sad to see him go it did open up doors for both of them. She joined a rock band and learned some new tricks. Then she finally put her own band, The Tracy Chamberlain Band together. While in this band she joined side projects such as Dirt Road Anthem, Plays with Fire, and some other smaller recording projects. She was even given the chance to open for Kenny Chesney in 2014. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e      Currently, She is playing out as much as possible and focusing on her original music. Tracy just recorded The Nashville EP in Nashville TN at County Q Productions.\u003cbr\u003eThe EP is released on all online platforms along with the website store. She will be planning a full album \"Red Valley Road\" which will come out 2019. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Its my biggest dream to one day be able to make my Grandfather proud of who I turned out to be. I have been on a mission to make music from the heart and let people hear my\u003cbr\u003estories and know where I came from and just how great my \u003cbr\u003eGrandfather was for inspiring me. I hope you will follow my journey and be a part of this with me.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e                                              Thank you,\u003cbr\u003e                                                  -Tracy\u003c/p\u003e",
