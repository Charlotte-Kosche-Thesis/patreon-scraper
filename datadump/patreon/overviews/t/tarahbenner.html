    "summary": "Hey friends! Thanks for coming!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here, that means you\u0027re probably a member of my Reader Army, or you just like my books and want me to write more. Challenge accepted!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t know me yet, I\u0027m a full-time author who writes dystopian and sci-fi novels for adults. All of my books feature badass heroines and the guys who fight by their side. I use the latest research to build believable versions of the future and create terrifying end-of-world scenarios. Most importantly, I pride myself on writing electric page-turners that keep you reading late into the night!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e SO WHAT IS PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform that makes it easy to pay authors and other creators for their work. It\u0027s basically a subscription content service, but instead of paying every month, you just pay when I release a book. You can gain access to exclusive Patreon content for as little as $1. And for the cost of an e-book \u2014 just $4 \u2014 you automatically receive each new release AND exclusive extras you can\u0027t get anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY AM I ON PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to the support of my amazing readers, I get to write books for a LIVING. Not many writers get to say that. Indie authors like me are always hustlin\u0027 to put out more books, connect with readers, and try new things to boost our visibility, but the publishing world changes constantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted a more direct way to reach my readers. Here are a few reasons why Patreon is great:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Patreon puts more money in my pocket.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eAs an indie author, I keep 35-70% of the list price for my digital titles. (I keep about 15% of the list price on print books and less than \u003cem\u003ehalf a cent per page read \u003c/em\u003ein Kindle Unlimited.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows me to keep 90% of what I make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Patreon means owning your books \u2014 even as technology changes. \u003c/strong\u003eYou know that feeling when you go to watch one of your favorite shows on Netflix only to find that it\u0027s been removed? You should never feel that way about your favorite books. Buying my books directly through Patreon means you\u0027ll own those books forever in whichever format you choose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Patreon means you don\u0027t have to read on Kindle\u003c/strong\u003e. Our society is moving toward a subscription model, which means that many of my readers have enrolled in Kindle Unlimited. I like making my books available in the program, but doing so means I have to be exclusive to Amazon. I don\u0027t want to leave my\u00a0Nook, Apple, and Kobo readers behind, so I am making my new works available through Patreon before enrolling them in Kindle Unlimited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Income security = a lifetime of writing.\u003c/strong\u003e Writing is how I make my living, and I don\u0027t like relying on a single retailer to pay my\u00a0bills. Currently, 93-99% of my income comes from Amazon digital sales. That sort of reliance puts me in a dangerous position if Amazon decides to change their royalty rates or terms of service.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhen will I be charged?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/i\u003eYou will only be charged when I release a new novel under the name Tarah Benner \u2014 usually every four months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eHow will I receive my books?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use BookFunnel for e-book delivery. When I release a new book, I share a link to the BookFunnel page with my Patreon supporters. Just click the link and download the book in the format that works for you (MOBI for Kindle,\u00a0EPUB for other devices). BookFunnel makes it easy to load the book onto your device, and they provide tech support if you have any trouble.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support me as a Super Fan or International Fan, I\u0027ll mail you a signed paperback a few weeks after the e-book goes live on Amazon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow else can I support you and your work?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eSubscribe or buy\u003c/em\u003e. Subscribing as a patron, downloading one of my e-books, or listening to one of my audiobooks is the No. 1 way to show your support.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eReview\u003c/em\u003e. Reviewing my books on Amazon and Goodreads helps other readers discover independent authors, and the sheer number of reviews I accrue helps me qualify for other opportunities such as audiobook licensing and exclusive book promotions.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eShare!\u003c/em\u003e Telling friends and family that you love my books helps me gain more amazing readers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
