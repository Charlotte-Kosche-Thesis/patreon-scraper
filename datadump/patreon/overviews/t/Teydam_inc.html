    "summary": "We are Teydam INC. Our two founding directors are Lincoln Bohn and Billie Faulkner. They created this organization in hopes of preventing some of the crisis we have seen personally. By connecting local artists with the outside world, providing them with the supplies they need, and promoting their creations we can successfully avoid this epidemic of poverty for a few local folks, at least. We are not here to save the world, we are here to help the local community. \u003cem\u003eOur hometown of Manteca, California. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLincoln \u0026amp; Billie have been partners in business, crime, and life for nearly a decade, and this organization is a way for them to channel some of the ideas they have had into reality, they do not own Teydam INC. It is a Non-Profit corporation dedicated to preserving culture \u0026amp; promoting local art, and enriching folks spiritually. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter returning home from hitchhiking across the country and living out of state for years, the founders realized over the last two years that putting plans into motion is not as easy as just coming up with a great idea.\u003cem\u003e It takes need dedication, hard work, committed team members, and above all, \u003cstrong\u003eresources\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we are doing here is not a regular church or religious organization, it is the first of its kind. We invest our time and resources in people and their skills to produce something of value for everyone else. It is a win-win situation for all involved, so that\u0027s what we are focusing on while building our space in the psychical world\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are not looking to just be a tax write off, or another organization in an endless sea that contributes to the status quo. We are here to give people the time and dedication they need to get the services they require, and help them have a stable and healthy life instead of slipping into homelessness, the prison system, and drug addiction, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe sincerely believe your contribution of a few dollars into this organization is one of the best investments you could make right now\u003c/strong\u003e! \u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of a return on your money in terms of $\u003c/em\u003e, you will see a return in a better society, material goods that you will be able to receive a discount rate vs retail on in the future when we open the shop (so that we are not entirely funded on donations), and a society where a few less folks are struggling and don\u2019t have to live on the streets, struggle to find food and shelter, or make ends meet. Our board of directors is not paid, and we do not plan for anyone managing the corporation to be paid any time soon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe recognize there are many other people doing great work around the country, but it does not seem like there is enough people in our area doing this very important work that needs to be done in our area, so this is the solution we are adapting for the current situation we find ourselves in. After running a needs analysis locally, this seemed like the best idea to move forward with. Our vision for organization will to get people connected with the resources they need to get back on their feet and to a financially stable place as well as the education and support to help them stay there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSooooo....\u003c/strong\u003ethis page is set up in the hopes of collecting any donations that people want to give, and to give a place to give out rewards for specific projects, as well as show the progress we are making return so you can see how the money is used and invested. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of right now, we are still in the setup phase. We are having Tax-exemption paperwork being filed, and getting the necessary items taken care of so we are good to go in the future when we get established and can ask for corporate donations in local programs so the good people of Manteca have a way to funnel money into local people, projects, and community service.\u003cbr\u003e"
