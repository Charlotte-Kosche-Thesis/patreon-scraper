Each day we scan through at least 1,500 news pieces, research, and blogs on transportation, urban design, housing, urban issues, policy change, the urban environment, public health and more.\u00a0 We take the most interesting news and share with folks on twitter as well as my 10 year old daily email now called \"The Overhead Wire Daily\" (formerly The Other Side of the Tracks and The Direct Transfer) archived for the last year at \u003ca href=\"http://thedirecttransfer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe OverheadWire . com\u003c/a\u003e  . We also put out a weekly podcast called Talking Headways housed at \u003ca href=\"http://usa.streetsblog.org/category/special-features/podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eStreetsblog USA\u003c/a\u003e, in which we chat with experts and interested parties each week about transportation and urban planning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you know, my former employer and most excellent organization \u003ca href=\"http://reconnectingamerica.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eReconnecting America\u003c/a\u003e disappeared on January 1st, 2014.\u00a0 Since then I\u0027ve started my own consulting firm The Overhead Wire and have been working with a lot of my old colleagues on transportation issues around the country.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Overhead Wire Daily and the \u003ca href=\"http://usa.streetsblog.org/category/special-features/podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTalking Headways Podcast\u003c/a\u003e were somewhat outside of the sphere of that work but what I really enjoy doing more than anything.\u00a0 It\u0027s been a mostly unfunded labor of love for almost a decade but hopefully with your help we can change that and perhaps set a new course for the writers and dreamers of our urban sphere.\u00a0 If this can take off, I\u0027m hoping more of you will follow suit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of my mission with The Overhead Wire is to share information to make cities better places.\u00a0\u00a0 The podcast will still come out each week and the articles will stream daily in tweets and emails that come at 7am ET/4am PT.\u00a0 But there could be a way to keep the lights on and continue the work of collecting information and sharing it without having to always do it as a side project. All we need is your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose of you who have mentioned at conferences\nand work assignments around the country how much the daily email means to you\nhave really kept me going and I really appreciate your support. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEspecially\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e those of you who wrote emails in\nthe dark days of 2014 wondering where we had disappeared to and willed us to\ncome back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo What Are We Trying to Do Here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContinuing The Talking Headways Podcast weekly.\u00a0 I love putting it together and I appreciate the support you give.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e With your help I\u0027ll be able to keep creating the podcast and doing bigger and better things like the Oakland podcast series.\u00a0 We\u0027re hoping to continue telling the stories that matter that keep you informed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for supporting us through and lets continue this into the future!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: This Patreon was originally for The Podcast and the Newsletter.\u00a0 I\u0027ve set up a new \u003ca href=\"https://thedirecttransfer.com/subscriptions/\"\u003eseparate service\u003c/a\u003e for newsletter subscriptions but the podcast support is still here.\u00a0 Folks that signed up to get the newsletter will continue to get it, but any new Patrons will be supporting the Talking Headways podcast alone.\u00a0 Thanks so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
