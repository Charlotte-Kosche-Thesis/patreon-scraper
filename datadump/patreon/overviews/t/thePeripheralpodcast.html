    "summary": "\u00a0The Peripheral Podcast is an interview style podcast covering topics such as addiction, sexual assault, mental illness and alternative lifestyles. I created this podcast after being inspired doing interviews of personal stories on the Generation Why podcast. I hope to avoid using sponsors or advertising to fund my efforts. I know how annoying 10 minutes of ads during a podcast can be so if we can make this ad free it\u0027ll make both of us happy! \u00a0I\u0027m working on getting perks that you can wear or hold in your hand. For now all I can offer is great informative content that I hope will help and inspire all of us to make the world a better place. Thank you for your time and\u00a0patronage. Let\u0027s make The Peripheral awesome!\u00a0"
