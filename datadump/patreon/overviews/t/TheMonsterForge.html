Wearable art is my specialty. I like to make my art wearable so that they may be worn for all to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up, I wanted to be able to draw and make what I saw in the movies, but I soon realized that the stuff in movies isn\u0027t often worn more than once or twice and only for a coupe of hours. I wanted my work to be easy to wear, comfy, and fun to experience. \u003cbr\u003eAfter graduating from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, I made my home here in Baltimore where I work part time with Clockwork Creature Studio, and it is here that I plan to remain so that more monsters and beasts can have homes to reside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo view more of my work, and also works in progress, you may visit this link:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ehttp://kierstinlapatka.tumblr.com/\u003cbr\u003e",
