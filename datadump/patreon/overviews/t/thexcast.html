    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe X-Cast: An X-Files Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is a show all about \u003cem\u003eThe X-Files\u003c/em\u003e, the TV show phenomenon which began in 1993 and has just returned for an all new Season 11.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Tony and I started \u003cstrong\u003eThe X-Cast\u003c/strong\u003e at the end of 2015 after the six-part event series (Season 10) was announced for early 2016. It seemed like the perfect time to create a show all about my favourite piece of entertainment in the world - a TV show I grew up adoring and, like many of us, spent almost a decade waiting to return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE STORY SO FAR...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast began with me going through each episode chronologically, as well as forensically examining Season 10 as it aired, but in the last 18 months or more has evolved into a growing community of fellow X-Philes. We most recently completed the \u0027X-Cast X-Files Podwatch\u0027, where over the space of two months we released daily episodes talking the entire 200+ episode run so far of the series, and we are now continuing to release episodes almost daily as we cover new Season 11 content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from this, we have regular co-hosts tackle certain main episodes of previous seasons; special guests include actors involved with the show such as Dean Haglund, series composer Mark Snow and comics writer Joe Harris;\u00a0we have Roundtable podcasts discussing \u003cem\u003eX-Files\u003c/em\u003e topics, special episodes devoted to \u003cem\u003eX-Files\u003c/em\u003e media beyond the television (books, comics, games etc...); and we have a thriving online community on Twitter \u0026amp; Facebook filled with conversation about the series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we move further into 2018, and the latest stage of \u003cem\u003eThe X-Files\u003c/em\u003e, we\u0027re looking for \u003cstrong\u003eThe X-Cast\u003c/strong\u003e to evolve along with it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where Patreon comes in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where *you* come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT WE WANT TO DO NEXT...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy donating every month, you can help \u003cstrong\u003eThe X-Cast \u003c/strong\u003eexpand in exciting ways. We can pay for hosting, develop a new website, buy new \u0026amp; better audio equipment to enhance the listening experience, potentially entice new guests linked with the show, and launch our intended \u003cem\u003eMillennium\u003c/em\u003e spin-off podcast, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Time Is Now\u003c/strong\u003e, in the way we wish. Not to mention provide you, our backers, with fun and exciting bonus content which makes giving up your hard earned money all the more worthwhile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, while producing \u003cstrong\u003eThe X-Cast\u003c/strong\u003e is a labour of love, the truth is it can be expensive. A break down of our monthly costs is provided below (so you can see clearly where the money goes), but simply if you can help us continue to develop and grow our podcast, you would have the eternal thanks of myself and \u003cstrong\u003eThe X-Cast\u003c/strong\u003e team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading and we look forward to, hopefully, you becoming an illustrious Patron of our show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember... The Truth is in Here...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e--\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur show is hosted on Libsyn, which provides us an excellent base with good analysis, but averages out at around $240/year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterviewing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt times interviews over Skype can cost if calling overseas numbers. Since we began, this has been around $20, but the more we do, the more this may cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSharing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDropbox is an essential tool to store episode files as the editing process takes place. The amount of data necessitates purchasing the 1TB service, which costs around $110/year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShow Prep Materials\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese can be anything from\u003cem\u003e X-Files\u003c/em\u003e books, CD\u0027s, comics and any other paraphernalia bought to cover on the show. So far at least $250 has been spent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon Fees\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo bear in mind that Patreon themselves take a chunk off the top so the amount represented here isn\u0027t what we actually get. The more patrons and the more they support, the more goes in the show."
