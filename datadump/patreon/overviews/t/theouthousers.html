    "summary": "Welcome to the All-New All Different Outhouse Patreon! Just like with any reboot or relaunch, not much has changed; we\u0027ve just streamlined things.\u003ca href=\"http://www.theouthousers.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Outhouse\u003c/a\u003e is a comic book website dedicated to being a fan-driven voice in the comics industry. \u00a0Unlike other sites, we consider ourselves to be a voice for consumers, not giant entertainment corporations. \u00a0Our writers are all fans of comics, and strive to provide news and commentary from a perspective that other fans can understand and relate to. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn average, the Outhouse publishes between 7 to 10 articles a day, and covers a variety of topics, including comics, television, movies, books and more. \u00a0Our article mix includes news, reviews, interviews, satire, podcasts and op/eds. \u00a0We also periodically feature webcomics on our site. \u00a0The site averages about 20,000 pageviews per day, and has had over 1.2 million visitors in 2014.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012, we changed the focus of our front page to make our articles include more snark and satire, in an attempt to change the things we felt were dragging the industry down. \u00a0We believe in taking a stance against racism and sexism in the comic industry, advocating and supporting creators, creator-owned comics, and the readers that make it possible, and providing news and commentary about the comic and entertainment industry that doesn\u0027t take itself too seriously. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, the Outhouse recommitted itself to focusing on small press comics and strives to feature these comics prominently amongst our less positive mainstream comics coverage. \u00a0We\u0027ve also started to focus more on Kickstarter projects, recognizing that crowdfunded comics will continue to be a force in the comic industry. \u00a0We\u0027re hoping to be a more comprehensive comic site that fans of mainstream, alternative and local comics can all enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur site\u0027s costs are currently limited to a $130/mo. server fee. \u00a0Our ability to advertise has been limited by Google Adsense banning the site in 2011 over a forum post, as well as our generally derisive (but honest) coverage of the comic industry\u0027s big players, which are also its biggest advertisers. While we do have advertisers some months, we believe our revenue is far below that of comparably popular sites because we do not play the payola game. If you believe this is important, we appreciate your support in our campaign. Any profits above our costs made from advertising revenue are shared in their entirety with all of our contributors and staff members.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to allow our fans to support independent (and funny) comics journalism, and also to allow small press and independent publisher a lower cost way to advertise on a popular comic book site than we would offer to corporate-backed publishers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s be clear: no matter what the outcome of this Patreon, the Outhouse will continue to be the Outhouse that you love (or love to hate). \u00a0We don\u0027t want anyone to feel like we\u0027re squeezing them, or that The Outhouse will go behind any kind of paywall, or anything like that. If we receive $0/month, our 200,000+ monthly readers can still enjoy our hackneyed mockery and self-referential in-jokes for free. You should contribute only because you want to, and because you want to help us grow to be an even bigger thorn in the side to idiocy in the comics industry than we are now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also want to make it clear that support of our Patreon is not the only way to get your small press or creator owned comic featured on our site. We try to support as many of these as we can, for free, and you are welcome to contact us at press (at) theouthousers (dot) com about that. Contributing to our campaign will guarantee you a feature within a specific time frame, and at some reward levels, give you more control over the content of that article, but we\u0027re also happy to support your project for free within the constraints of our time and abilities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time and support. We hope to continue to be a voice in the comic industry for years to come.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
