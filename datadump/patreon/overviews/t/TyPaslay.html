    "summary": "Around 2 years ago I wrote a novel - inspired by a dream/nightmare - entitled \"Wraith\" about a world facing a terror of unknown origin and responding only with ignorance. Social commentary and theological themes are ever-present, but more than that, I wanted to create a thriller founded on character development rather than straight shock and gore (although you\u0027ll find plenty of that too!). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFlash forward, I feel that the words on the page are only half of the puzzle and now have set out to create a fully fledged comic series. The purpose of this Patreon is multifaceted in nature. First, it\u0027s to provide a deadline driven structure to keep me moving forward. Second, it\u0027s a way to get the comic to those that don\u0027t live near or frequent a comic retailer. It\u0027s a means of getting the story out into the world without waiting for a publisher to do so. Mainly, it\u0027s a means of cutting out the middle man and connecting with those who are genuinely interested in the tale that I have to tell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, the goal is to be able to work on comics/art/writing full time without having to supplement income with a 40+ hr/wk job. Anyone who\u0027s done it knows it can be difficult working a full day and then coming home and feeling energized and inspired enough to work on their craft. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
