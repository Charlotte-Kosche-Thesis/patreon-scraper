    "summary": "Hello and welcome to The On-Call Room! A podcast led by two women who have invested 14 years of their lives following the fictional characters of Grey\u0027s Anatomy. Thank you for joining our Patreon - it\u0027s nice to know that we aren\u0027t alone. Our goal when we began this podcast was to have an excuse to get together, drink wine and talk about life. We weren\u0027t sure if anyone would subscribe to a podcast that had no theme or focus - so after a night of going down the Grey\u0027s Anatomy Youtube rabbit hole we had the idea of using Grey\u0027s as a vehicle for conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlmost a year later - the podcast has grown into a community of passionate Grey\u0027s fans who have just as many opinions as we do. We started in Season 1 Episode 1 and are making our way through the whole series - until Shonda decides she doesn\u0027t want to write it anymore - or everyone dies. Not an avid Grey\u0027s fan? Don\u0027t worry. We still cover an array of topics including but not limited to: Broadway show tunes, fashion of the past and the now, PMS, our sex lives, memes, our drinking habits, boy problems, girl problems, basically all of our problems and the current weather in Michigan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here you are. Browsing our Patreon. Wondering if you should give money to these two beautiful blondes who have invested so much of their time to their fictional friends at Seattle Grace Hospital. The answer is obviously yes. We promise to provide you with weekly laughs, unqualified therapy and the perfect way to escape from your mundane lives (jk jk we love you).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut really - your money goes towards better and more quality audio sounds, microphones, hosting fees, special guests and our wine (just kidding - but not).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo gather your credit cards, pour yourself a glass of wine and decide whether you\u0027re an intern, a resident or an attending.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e(Remember: George is an intern. Bailey is a resident and Dr. Preston Burke is an attending - act accordingly).\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
