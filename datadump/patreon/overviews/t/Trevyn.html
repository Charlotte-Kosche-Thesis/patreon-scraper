    "summary": "Hello. I\u0027m TrevynX and I\u0027m a low level (currently VERY low level) Twitch Streamer. It\u0027s the kind of thing I do when I\u0027m not working, and while the dream is to make this my job, I think we all know the reality of that is currently zero...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut with your help, we can raise the chances of that from 0.0% to 1%!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I stream 3 to 4 nights a week, around 6:30 p.m. PST through usually until 11 p.m. PST. The games I\u0027ve been playing as of this writing (note to self Trevyn, update this next month) are Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, League Of Legends, and others! This tends to switch around each month so I hope I remember to update this to reflect that. I have a small, but very friendly community of friends who watch, and I want that to expand and build upon that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe initial goal of this Patreon is not to become a full time streamer. Like, make no mistake, that would be amazing, but I have to be a realist about this. What I want more than that is a direct line to talk to the people directly supporting me, and to give them a greater voice in the direction my streams head into. After all, I\u0027m just playing games. What I want is for people to come and watch something they want to see, and something we can all be proud of. There are even rewards to enable you to basically have me buy the game you want to see, and then I\u0027ll work out with you when I\u0027ll play it so you can watch or participate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf, somehow, I make enough to live on with just Patreon and the stream, well... Here\u0027s the dream... I wake up at 10 a.m., I stream games from like, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (with a break for food) Mon - Sat. Sunday is for Date Night, and the later nights will still be open for me to do my standard social engagements. Neat, huh? Also, it\u0027ll give you something to mock while you\u0027re trapped at work. Good stuff yeah?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, to make that dream happen, I\u0027ve... I\u0027ve got some money trouble. I\u0027m working to make do, but I\u0027m basically treading water. It\u0027s not enough. So I\u0027ve got to work harder on something, and with my deteriorating mental health, it\u0027s harder and harder to get motivated to move forward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goals I have are going to start modest. This isn\u0027t going to get me to self sustainability for a long long time. But, it\u0027s a dream right?"
