    "summary": "As you may know, Marlin \u2014the firmware that runs a vast number of RepRap and commercial 3D printers\u2014 is fully open source and relies entirely on volunteers to move it forward.\u00a0For a while now, my time has been largely devoted to Marlin \u2013 implementing requested features, following up on issues, supporting users, merging new code, and discussing the future roadmap of the project. From day to day I\u0027ve watched it go from a quiet and fragmented project to a burgeoning bazaar of creativity, and it has kept me invigorated as a coder and a RepRap enthusiast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGiven the rapid pace of innovation in the 3D printing community, just keeping Marlin in step is a full-time job. While I\u0027ve always given\u00a0my time freely and without reservation to projects I\u0027m passionate about, the amount of attention that Marlin requires does strain my limited resources. So, on the advice of trusted friends in the RepRap community, I\u0027ve decided to try community funding through a short term campaign\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/marlin-firmware\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eelsewhere\u003c/a\u003e, and through Patreon for more long-term support of my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \"Patreon wish\" is to be able to focus my attention on Marlin through the next release and beyond, and to be an integral part of bringing it forward as Arduino and 3D printing evolves. When I see the amazing things that personal 3D printing is bringing to the world, I feel certain that there must be many in the world of 3D printing who appreciate the value of the work that goes into Marlin. If you love Marlin as much as I do, I hope you will support my ongoing work as a conscientious developer of this excellent and maturing firmware.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eMarlin Documentation\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the day-to-day development of Marlin, I\u0027ve been writing most of the content for the official Marlin website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://marlinfw.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emarlinfw.org\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0including most of the G-codes, coding standards, contribution guidelines, community standards, etc. There\u0027s still a lot of content to add and update, and it definitely needs some pictorial guides. I intend to fill out these areas over the next several months into 2018, and along with that make several videos about the features and technical workings of Marlin."
