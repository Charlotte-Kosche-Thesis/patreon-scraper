    "summary": "Patreon is simply amazing! \u00a0Compared to certain \"crowdfunding\" outlets that simply raise money for a single campaign, Patreon makes it possible for us to have an on-going fan-driven music label. \u00a0We finally have a way of bringing you new music, videos, and more and it\u0027s truly YOU making it happen. \u00a0We are not on a major label and that\u0027s OK with us because we know the business of music has changed and we understand it\u0027s the FANS (YOU) behind the wheel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an original alternative rock band, everything we do is completely DIY.  From recording \u0026amp; mixing our record, to our on-stage lighting show, to graphic/web design, to video production \u0026amp; editing... everything TLY is entirely of our own design and doing. Any money the band has made from licensing or touring has always gone back into the \"band\". \u00a0That being said, each and every month we have general band operating expenses that come to around 2k. \u00a0It can be tough to raise funds above just our monthly band expenses to pay for touring, merchandise, and video production costs. \u00a0We mention this because we think it\u0027s important for all our Patreons to know that any money you pledge will go DIRECTLY back into the band funds. \u00a0We, the band, will get by on our own, personally, as we always have. \u00a0We do this because we LOVE it and it\u0027s the reason we get out of bed every day. \u00a0You might even say we\u0027re obsessed with it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started our Living Room Sessions, exclusively on YouTube, as a way to expand our video catalog.  Since the beginning of 2015, we\u0027ve released several videos, which included covers by Sam Smith, Sneaker Pimps, Radiohead, Cyndi Lauper, Phantogram, Vance Joy, Fiona Apple, \u0026amp; The Cardigans.  These were videos we filmed, recorded, and edited ourselves in our living room.  With your support, we can continue creating videos frequently and even introduce other musicians and bands into the mix, much like we did with our good friends in R\u00caVE for our Fiona Apple cover.  These videos have been so much fun to make and we want to continue, as a completely \"fan-funded\" experience.  The sky is the limit for us and we thank you helping us take this just a little higher.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support in any amount you can possibly pledge makes recording and touring possible for us. We thank you for being the soul of our music!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome questions I\u0027m sure you have...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow does Patreon Work?\u003cbr\u003eMuch like other \"crowdfunding\" sites, Patreon is designed to help fund our creative works each month. \u00a0You select the amount you\u0027d like to pledge each month and you\u0027ll be charged monthly. \u00a0It\u0027s a lot like a fancy \"fan club\". \u00a0The amount you decide to pledge will come with certain rewards that we\u0027ve promised to provide you with. \u00a0From monthly Google+ hangouts to goody boxes on your doorstep. \u00a0Even at $5/month or more, you\u0027ll NEVER have to pay for any of our digital (MP3s) again. \u00a0As long as you\u0027re a $5+ Patreon of The Last Year, you\u0027ll never have to buy our music on iTunes again. \u00a0You\u0027ll get it all for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs there a certain amount that has to be reached first?\u003cbr\u003eNope. \u00a0Although we\u0027ve created some goals for ourselves, we will continue making videos each month, whether we reach those goals or not. \u00a0Most times, we\u0027ll release several videos and \"things\" per month. \u00a0Unlike Kickstarter, this is an ongoing support system for us and NOT per campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill the funds go to other things related to the band?\u003cbr\u003eHonestly... YES! \u00a0If we\u0027re in a tough spot financially, it\u0027s not uncommon for us to use funds to support our touring expenses (van maintenance, insurance, gas, etc), recording expenses (tracking, mastering, etc), and new merch (someday, we want to release our music on vinyl, for example). \u00a0No matter what, we will always have something new to release or share with you exclusively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat if I want to change or cancel my pledge?\u003cbr\u003eYou may cancel at any time and you\u0027ll no longer be charged your monthly pledge. \u00a0For more information, please visit:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/200359925-Patrons\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/20...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hailing from Baltimore, The Last Year is an alternative rock band. The act stems from an idea of front-girl Niki Barr, on vocals, and Scott Ensign, playing bass and synth. The pair, complemented by drummer, BJ Kerwin, and guitarist, Scott Griffith, approach their music with diverse influences, ranging from the hook heavy hits of The Cars to the spacey, hypnotic sounds of the late 80\u2019s to early 90\u2019s acts, like The Cure and Portishead. The band has managed to mix retro influences with modern appeal and it\u2019s magical. Having toured over 30 countries on three continents, The Last Year is no stranger to the stage. Guided by Barr\u2019s coy, airy, yet powerful melodies and slinky body language, blended with the band\u2019s array of synth growls, driving rhythm and swirling guitar sounds, the show is a spectacle and a must-see.\u003cbr\u003eThe Last Year teamed up with Shanachie Entertainment to release their debut EP, which was described as \u201climitless\u201d with \u201ceverything from buzz saw synth to airy atmospheric ambience to 80s drum sequence loops\u201d. The EP was warmly received by fans and critics alike, especially its lead single \u201cSugar\u201d, a tune that bridges the gap between The Smiths and the infectious, radio-friendly indie rock hooks of bands like Metric; spicing it all up with female leading vocals that wouldn\u2019t feel out of place on a Garbage record.\u003cbr\u003eUnder the previous direction of CO 5 Music, \u201cSugar\u201d was spun at more than 14 radio stations, including SiriusXM\u2019s Alt Nation, WWDC 101, WLUM, KWSS, WWWX and many more, across the U.S. and is continuously being added to alternative and rock stations with each and every performance.\u003cbr\u003eThe band spent 2014 building a national following, supporting acts like Phantogram, Tove Lo, Nico Vega, Paramore, SomeKindaWonderful, Ben Kenney, Semi Precious Weapons, and Neon Hitch. The band will hit the road this spring to play Austin\u2019s legendary SXSW, followed by an extensive tour as supporting act for Sick of Sarah.\u003cbr\u003e",
