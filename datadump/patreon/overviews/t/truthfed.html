    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is ScriptureandProphecy.com? Formally\u00a0known as Truthfed\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cScripture and Prophecy\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e is a podcast dedicated to teaching the scriptures, end times prophecy and leading the remnant back to their \u003cstrong\u003eHebraic Heritage\u003c/strong\u003e.\n Our teachings focus on the full console of Elohim, not just bits and \npeaces from the new convenient books. We believe that all scripture is \ntrue and relevant today and forever.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe believe that we are rapidly approaching what we commonly refer to as \u201cthe end of days\u201d. We believe salvation is found in\u003cstrong\u003e Jesus Christ\u003c/strong\u003e alone, and that there is no other name under heaven, which a man can be saved. \u003cstrong\u003eActs 4:12\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Church is unfortunately a sleep and\n unprepared for what is to come. Our goal is to wake up the remnant of \nElohim and bring them back to the ways of \u003cstrong\u003eYahovah\u003c/strong\u003e. The Church has fallen into apostasy and has forgotten \u003cstrong\u003eYahovah\u2019s\u003c/strong\u003e\n laws and has perverted the grace of Elohim. Come back to righteousness \nand holiness now, before it\u2019s to late. Walk in the ways of \u003cstrong\u003eYahovah\u003c/strong\u003e once again.\u003cbr\u003e\nBelieve upon the name of \u003cstrong\u003eJesus\u003c/strong\u003e, the only begotten son of Elohim. Who died for you and your sins and not your sins only, but the sins of the whole world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a crowd funding platform for independent content creators.  It\u0027s a way to support the creation of regular content via pledges.  Instead of donating to something that has yet to happen, your support comes after the content has been created.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to branch out from being so dependent on the unreliability of Youtube advertising income along with inconsistent donations to support my mission of TRUTH, and delivering Gods word and warning. While I enjoy creating YouTube videos, as a content creator your at the mercy of advertisers, glitches, false flaggers, people using ad-block, and networks laying false copyright claims on videos in order to hijack their revenue. I\u0027m also very greatful to anyone who is willing to make a donation on the website. However, it\u0027s impossible to know how many donations will come in, which makes it impossible to prepare and make future decisions on the direction to take the podcast. Patreon will (hopefully) alleviate the stress of these inconsistencies and frustrations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is a good donation amount? \u003c/strong\u003eEvery little bit adds up and makes a difference. Whether you pledge $1 a month or $100 a month, your contribution matters (GREATLY). Without you this is impossible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
