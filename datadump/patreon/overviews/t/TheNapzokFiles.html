The published goals on this Patreon will always be a balance of business and celebration. Special Q \u0026amp; A episodes, movie commentaries, and other goals that celebrate your involvement are mixed with specific business goals like new branding and podcast imaging, guest appearance fees, and merchandise. The business goals will always be presented with an air of transparency. Your money will be going to great, specific use. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2 - Community Through Connection\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout a doubt one of the more powerful fuels for the growth of The Napzok Files and my work is the building of a community amongst the listeners and supporters. In that spirit, this Patreon page is a place for you to find some friends among the names. Additionally, through this Patreon, a Discord Server has been established and it is exclusive to patrons. There you will not only find several different discussions channels about Napzok Files\u2019 programming, but also channels for you to ask assistance or advice from other supporters, safely share a troubling situation or feeling and get some warm support, have fun with spoiler discussions on movies and TV, debate pro wrestling, and the Daily Discord -- where Monday through Friday I post a special conversation starter for the group to talk about. There is power and comfort in groups -- jump into this one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3 - Gratitude Through Rewards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means a lot to me and my words will often fail to show it. So enter the rewards! There are special monthly shows, weekly episodes, access to the TNF Hotline number, a Q \u0026amp; A, and a Twitter follow! And that\u2019s just currently\u2026 I am always looking to improve and add rewards. Additionally, future support tiers will be introduced that will include merchandise, on-air thank you mentions, and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel like contributing then let\u0027s take this walk of faith together. Check out the support tier that best suits you. (Currently:  $1, $2, $3, $5, $10 and $15.) However, the growth of The Napzok Files will always begin with listeners. So if you\u0027re a listener... relatively new, been here from the start, or joined somewhere along the way... you\u0027ve already done enough!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering.\u003cbr\u003e"
