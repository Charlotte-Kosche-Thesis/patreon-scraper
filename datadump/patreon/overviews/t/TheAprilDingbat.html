I\u0027ve been drawing since I was four, but have been doing it more devotedly since late 2015 early 2016.\u003cbr\u003eHopefully, with my art, I can inspire others and show people my growth over time (this is very visible in my comic, as I started drawing it in early 2016, basically the start of my commitment) just to make a message of how I didn\u0027t start great at art, and how anyone could begin this hobby. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of comics, yes, I have a comic. Although I haven\u0027t really updated it a lot, don\u0027t worry, the planning and script are very ahead (as of writing this, we\u0027re still (visually) on chapter one, but in the script, my partner and I are on chapter 4!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut enough of my yapping, the reason why I\u0027m on Patreon anyways: I wanna make money by not working at a Stop\u0026amp;Shop, dammit! I just wanna do what I love, which is creating art, and I want to portray to you guys what I want to do for a living!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you become a patron or not, thank you for taking the time to listen to my ramblings, and a special friendly punch on the shoulder to the ones who actually decided to donate to me! \u0026gt;wo)b\u003cbr\u003e"
