So it\u0027s super affordable \u0026amp; you still get to enjoy the music, knowing that big online distribution companies aren\u0027t stealing the money that you intended for the artist to recieve!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Continued...\u003cbr\u003eI also want to make this my *priority*, so you will receive any \u0026amp; everything *A WHOLE MONTH* in advance - while everyone else is moping because they don\u0027t know whether the earth is really round, you\u0027ll be jamming out to these tunes, fresh from my studio, or as I like to call it, my noise area, sometimes the noise is pretty, sometimes it\u0027s bloody awful - \u0026amp; If you support me you\u0027ll get to hear both!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really want to connect with the people listening to my music, and to show them how integral they are in a song\u0027s success story. \u00a0The song goes from my brain, to the piano, to the computer, to a compressed mp3 format \u0026amp; then finally to your ears. \u00a0But hopefully, through this you can catch a glimpse of all those individual steps, right from the beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to be patreon exclusive from this point forward, and if I release outside of patreon, I\u0027ll be sure you get everything nice and early along with the extra stuff that nobody else gets to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love \u0026amp; fuzzy stuff \u0026amp; I\u0027ll hope to see you along for the ride!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThea xoxo"
