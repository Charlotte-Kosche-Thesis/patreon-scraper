Thanks**\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of us read erotic stories, fewer of us write them. One of the main reasons is that writing\u00a0 takes time, time which also requires the erotic fire to continually be stoked until the story is finished. There is often little encouragement - rather a lot of negative feedback - in writing erotic stories, and most who do write are not professional authors; rather people who wish to write their fantasies no matter their skill level. This mixture means few write stories, or write them well, and even fewer remain writing for long because of burn out, negativity, and the lack of any reward beyond the few positive messages from fans (which are always nice!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a writer of erotic stories, known as the Shadow (rising), and I publish my stories on Literotica (\u003ca href=\"https://www.literotica.com/stories\"\u003ehttps://www.literotica.com/stories\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003eMy stories can be found here: (\u003ca href=\"https://www.literotica.com/stories/memberpage.php?uid=477083\"\u003ehttps://www.literotica.com/stories/memberpage.php?...\u003c/a\u003e) It has always been important to keep my stories free - the major reason I have not swapped over to selling stories on Amazon. Real life, however, requires work to live and so the difficulties in writing are exasperated. This is where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike many others I write because I can\u0027t stop writing. I have ideas every day (I have hundreds of stories planned) and in most instances I am working on several stories at the same time. I write because I love to and what I write is what I love to read. I share my stories for free because others may want to read them and I know what it feels like to want a particular story, written well, and not be able to find it. My stories are detailed and very long, and as such require even more time and freedom to be creative than usual. Real life impacts this to the point where my writing is slowed to a crawl - a story that would take a month or two takes a year, and often the feeling burns out and a new story needs to be started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my fans have asked for ways to show their support and to aid me in being able to write more. I would like to thank all of you who have said this - and just shown your support via positive feedback - over the years. the thought is truly appreciated. So for both reasons I have set up a Patreon for anyone who would like to support me with a small donation. Please only do this if you are happy to do so. It is not necessary to access my stories on Lit nor should you feel like you have to. I appreciate (honestly) each of my readers whether you can or wish to support me here. I present this option only if you can and would like to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will continue to write as best I can. I have been absent for some years due to working to live, but I am hoping to change that and get back to more stable publishing again. I certainly have the stories planned out for it. For this reason I have set Patreon as a donation per story, rather than per month, so that until I get back into a rhythm donations will only be received each time I release a new story. Though I appreciate all of your support, I would want to make sure you all received something and knew I would be able (and motivated) to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep being naughty out there ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShadow\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Images: I am an excellent writer, but not as incredible as an artist.
