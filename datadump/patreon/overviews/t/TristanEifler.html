    "summary": "Greetings! My name is Tristan Eifler. I, among many other things, write and publish original fiction and tabletop roleplaying games and have been doing so for more than a decade. I\u0027m probably best known for my urban fantasy series \u003cem\u003eThe Lycanthrope Club, \u003c/em\u003ewhich chronicles the emergence of a relatively benign form of lycanthropy in the United States. In brief, a shy, bespectacled young high school girl is changed into a werewolf after a terrifying encounter in a park.\u00a0Unlike many other werewolf stories, there are no vampires, no witches, no ancient conspiracies or secret societies (at least not initially), no weak pseudoscientific justifications (beyond wild speculation), no return of magic or awakening of Gaia \u2013 just a girl who becomes a werewolf and what follows. I have written multiple novellas and short stories set in the Lycanthrope Club universe. I have also written other stories, including ones set in traditional high fantasy worlds and others set in modern ones. You can read most of my writing on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://heliotroph.deviantart.com/\"\u003edA page\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough writing fiction isn\u0027t the only thing I currently do, I wouldn\u0027t mind making a living, or at least part of a living, off it! I have self-published several illustrated books and game books through my company\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://daemoneye.net/\"\u003eDaemoneye Publishing\u003c/a\u003e and sold a modest number of copies (both physical and digital). But I want to buckle down and focus more of my energies on writing. The more money I make, the less time I have to spend at my day job. The less time I have to spend at my day job, the more time I have to write! We both win!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past I have posted nearly all of my writing online for free, accepting small contributions for additional content such as color illustrations, bonus short stories, etc. I will continue this practice, but those who contribute to my work will have early access to stories, exclusive bonus stories, the ability to vote on which chapter I will work on next and even make story requests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you all for your support through the years!! My fans are what keep me going!!\u003c/strong\u003e"
