    "summary": "Hey there! We\u0027re seven writers in a chronically ill DID system of more than thirty people. This is both a good and a bad thing - it makes us excellent writers by way of giving us multiple perspectives on things; it allows us to collaborate with each other and get fresh eyes on things for editing; but it means we have barely any time or energy to write and when we do we\u0027re almost constantly distracted by other people in our brain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know we\u0027re good at it when we can do it, we know people enjoy the things we write and the unique perspectives we bring to the table, but it\u0027s hard to find the motivation/time/energy to write when there are no more tangible rewards from it than the occasional bit of praise, and far more tangible rewards for our (and other headmates\u0027) other efforts. As a result we\u0027ve never yet managed to finish any longer stories, although we currently have TEN novels on the go, all of which have pretty awesome concepts and much diversity but may never see the light of day if we carry on like this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you can help us out! The more incentive we have to write the more leverage we have against other headmates to \u003cem\u003elet \u003c/em\u003eus write! Potentially even free of distractions! ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money will go towards rent and food and medical/carer costs (we get no disability benefits for those), and just generally making life less stressful for us so that we have more time to do things like write!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can view short stories etc on our writing blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://taramorrigan-writing.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, buy one of them in an anthology\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kicking-Screaming-collection-short-stories/dp/1533216819\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, and get access to updates and excerpts on the novels we\u0027re writing right on this page!
