The Gardens are privately owned by us with no outside\nfunding like other gardens that are owned by a University or non-profit. We are\nproud to open our gates every day and invite the community to come see our\nmagical gardens.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHi, we are Richard\n\u0026amp; Belva Krott, founders and co-creators of Tizer Botanic Gardens \u0026amp;\nArboretum in Jefferson City, just south of Helena Montana. We have seven acres of\nland which sits at the base of the incredibly beautiful Elkhorn Mountains with\nthe Prickly Pear Creek running through the middle of it all! \u003cbr\u003eWe started\ngardening as our hobby and people began seeing the transformation of the land\nand asking to come in to see what we were up to. We had no intentions of starting\na business, however folks kept coming back and today, 20 years later, we have thousands\nof visitors from around the world excited to see our gardens that are in the\nmost unlikely place. This is amazing! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy is it so\namazing?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eTizer Gardens\nsits at an altitude of 5000 feet and we are considered a Zone 3 yet we have\nplants growing here that are never seen in a Zone 3.Only once in 20 years have we had more than\n60 consecutive frost free days. We\nnormally get a hard Frost at the last week of June and the fall frost usually\nhits the first week in September.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHere\u2019s a few\nfacts unique and fascinating facts:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe are an internationally accredited Arboretum through an organization called ArbNet\nand we are one of three privately owned in the world! \n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe have more than 300 different varieties of Deciduous Shrubs, over 240\ndifferent varieties of Deciduous Trees and 300 varieties of Conifers for you\nCone Heads out there! We have nearly 700\nConifers in our growing collection, which includes our Signature Collections of\n57 Species. \u003cbr\u003eThere are 12 different varieties of Quercus, which are Oak trees, 40\ndifferent varieties/cultivars of Acer, Maple trees, and 60 varieties of edible\nfruit trees. \u003cbr\u003eIn addition there is the Perennial Plant Collection, annuals\nand containers that are grown each year.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are the most northern test garden for the Plant Select\nProgram (a very successful collaboration between the Denver Botanic Gardens and\nColorado State University) and we are a Demonstration Garden for the All\nAmerican Selection committee who choose the Plants of the Year.\u003cbr\u003eWe have won many awards for business and gardening and have\nbeen featured in several national magazines.\u003cbr\u003eWe offer all kinds of fun and interesting programs in the\ngardens with our most popular being our children\u2019s Fairy and Wizard Festival in\nits 16th year that 2000+ people attend annually. The Scarecrow, Apple and Hummingbird Festivals have\nall delighted our guests and we host high teas, weddings, celebrations, healing\nfairs, herb celebrations, school and family programs and so much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy we need your\nhelp today?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0A garden is an\nevolution. It is constantly changing. Some things live, somethings die but\nalways change. It is an ongoing financial investment. We have survived fires,\nthe flood of 2011, pine beetles and this year drought and high wind that took\nout huge trees on the property.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDue to the\nweather our season is only about 5 months long. We open for Mother\u2019s Day and\nare usually done by the end of September. So when the gates close so does the cash\nflow, however the work and the bills still need to be addressed. It is also the\ntime when we need to design more gardens and plan for the coming year.\u003cbr\u003eOur incredible\ncollection of trees \u0026amp; plants needs to be catalogued and tagged, a labor\nintense project and necessary so our visitors and future generations will know\nwhat they are and can learn about them. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are eager to\nupgrade our facilities so we can enhance our education programs. It takes\nGardening professionals to keep that collection healthy and fresh, because even\nthough the fairies live here they don\u2019t do much weeding and planting.\u003cbr\u003eThis is a place\nwhere people reconnect to Mother Earth. Some come to spend time with friends\nand family, others to meditate, celebrate and heal. Many come to learn, others\ncome to paint, draw, or write. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese gardens are\nsacred space in our troubled world, so whatever you can offer $3.00, $5.00 or\n$500.00 will help us to keep this dream alive, literally!\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much\nfor checking us out and we promise to update you regarding our progress in the\ngardens on a regular basis and we have so much happening this winter to share! \u003cbr\u003eWe would also\nlike to invite you to join us on Facebook at Tizer Botanic Gardens and\nArboretum for gardening tips and know how."
