    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eDISCLAIMER:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e I create animations with focus on giantess and vore. If you don\u0027t know what giantess or vore are, then I suggest you google it before going any further. It\u0027s nothing but pure fantasy but some might still find it a bit disturbing or off putting.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the jungle!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for coming to visit my Patreon page! That said, let\u0027s get straight to the point, shall we? I want to create the most qualitative, most realistic, most erotic giantess-animations ever! But I need your help! With the support of my Patreons, I hope to take it to the next level, increase quality and shorten production time, resulting in more and better animations, with even more professionell content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you become my patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are few good giantess animators out there and luckily, we all create very different forms of content. Some do short cartoony vore scenarios, some video-game inspired scenes, others do Hollywoodesque large scale destruction. Me, I focus on realism. Personal, intimate, realistic animations, most often with a story to tell. A young girl getting revenge on her bullies (The Locker Room), a woman ordering something odd of the menu (Je Voudrais la Beauf) or a beautiful redhead trying to be normal only to fight for her survival (Chapter X) showcases the type of work I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my patreon, you\u0027ll have front row! You\u0027ll know what\u0027s in the pipeline, get access to early renders and test animations, get to read scripts and give feedback on coming projects, see deleted scenes and watch the animations before anyone else, depending on you tier. You might even get yourself eaten! I haven\u0027t figured out all the rewards yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are my goals with Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly: get better hardware. Luckily for us, animating is pretty scale-able. What\u0027s holding me back the most at the moment is hardware. Rendering out just a few seconds of a scene takes many hours but with upgraded hard- and software, that time can be significantly shortened. My first goal is to get two more graphics cards and, if I can get enough support from you guys, a second rendering computer, to set up a mini-farm at home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, I need more assets. The software I\u0027m using allows for me to create just about any scenario you could imagine. You want a giantess from out space, with pink hair and pointy ears, to descend upon a city and devour it\u0027s denizens? You\u0027ve got it! You want a submarine crew to navigate the intestines of a giantess? i guess that can be done... You want a woman to swallow a similarily sized person whole? I know that I can make that happen! Three hot girls at a night club, downing people and whiskey shots? Sure! All I need are the right assets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThirdly: hire voice actors. This would be so amazing! It would add a lot of work but would also be very, very rewarding. It would bring a whole new level of depth and immersion, and personality, to my characters. With proper voice acting, we\u0027ve really taken it to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this and welcome to the jungle!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
