    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m TheHaddockBanker, I make dumb videos usually of video games breaking for me with little to no pressure applied, editing them in all sorts of experimental montage-esque videos featuring the highlights of said brokenness or just whatever tiny stuff I find funny. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI focus more on the editing and presentation of my videos rather than a solely personality based gaming channel. Which I feel provides something more than just a bunch of idiots screaming(though certainly we have a ton of that), something to mix up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStreaming games is on the horizon for me and will be a way for me to produce more constant content rather than the occasional 120 hours of footage edited into a 12 minute funkfest video that appear randomly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat brought you to Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdel\u003eMoney.\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI want to be able to give my little fanbase(all one hundred active accounts, and god knows how many inactive accounts) an ability to directly help out a small channel like mine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get little to no money from my videos on Youtube, while I invest untold amount of time and money in order to produce these videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure, I get some money on some videos with ads, but with the adapocalypse and the second round of it happening right now, what pennies I got is easily drying up already. It wasn\u0027t something I could rely on to begin with but every little bit counts. It doesn\u0027t help with current day American copyright law being such a shitshow that I\u0027m always getting a video demonetized or removed because I dared to have five seconds of a song, when largely everything I produce falls under fair use-parody. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also not a big fan of ads. I appreciate people who sit through something that wastes their time in order to watch my videos, but as someone that adblocks everything outside of some creators, I understand completely why you don\u0027t want to deal with that bullshit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I primarily rely on my other ventures(which doesn\u0027t give a lot of expendable cash to begin with), really generous friends(Yes, you\u0027re gonna get a Super Nintendo sooner or later.), and freebies in order to get games I think would provide interesting content. It\u0027s by no means a reliable way to sustain a channel, but that is how I\u0027ve been doing it since around 2011. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you use this money for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo games and hardware\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use a ton of harddrives to capture footage and video games are an expensive hobby. I may not be able to get every game with my other ventures so some money from my fans could fix this problem thus leading to more content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfornately hardware seems to be a case of extremes for me. Either everything lasts(my 19 year old speakers for example) or break easily(my headsets). Hardware is a constant issue and I use plenty of harddrives to record. The primary hardware I\u0027ll be looking for is just for replacements or something to improve my rate of content. For example, a new hard drive that maybe replaces an old one with superior memory, thus leading to more recorded footage. Perhaps a console or something, but only if I think it has potential for more footage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m spending some spare cash here and there on a capture card, splitters, and the like to enable a decent streaming experience. Capture card is taken care of, I just need some splitters to capture console gameplay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, if money isn\u0027t as much of a problem as it is now, then I can play more video games, and by proxy record more, which leads to more editing and the eventual release of a video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWow, another youtube gaming creator, how original. What\u0027s in it for me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI will admit I\u0027m still figuring out how to give you guys something in return, I\u0027m so smalltime that I don\u0027t know how can I give back to people that allow me to get paid to play video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery reward tier that is five bucks and up is linked with Discord so at the very least I can keep in touch in a much more personal matter than out of touch blog posts. I\u0027d love to play games with anyone who is apart of my fanbase. Fair warning, I like to screw around and get easily distracted when I get the chance to.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOutside of being able to keep me afloat in whatever way you people can. You guys can help create some of the content by playing games with me, or perhaps even influencing what I create next. I\u0027m always open to ideas, whether or not that is backed by money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e With streaming on the horizion for me, I feel it would be a great way to produce more content more often and have whatever fans I got help.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf I can get more funds, I can devote more time to editing(and soon streaming), which will impact the quality of my videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA video a month is my goal, and sometimes I may go way over that. However I cannot gurantee a video month, it all depends on whether I have a game, and said games gives good material for me to edit with.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s your shoesize?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e12. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou do this stuff anyway? Why should I suddenly back you when you\u0027ll do it regardless?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI know I\u0027m shooting myself in the foot by saying this but I\u0027d rather be honest:\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThat\u0027s true, no matter what happens I\u0027ll be producing these videos. I play video games all the time, I like to dabble in editing, so it\u0027s gonna happen no matter what. As long as I have hard drive space, it\u0027s just a click of key to get to recording. I don\u0027t want to become this jerk off session that is begging for adviewers or patreon backers like DSP, so I\u0027ll be doing this regardless if you back me or not. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will help my content stay at a steady rate, you have the potiental to influence what is being created; but ultimately if you just like to watch my content, I already love you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill you play Dragon Age II for us?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUnfortunately. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
