It\u0027s one of a few things in my life that makes me happy.\u00a0I would like to draw them more, but it\u0027s difficult when you have no money and are stressed out about it, among other things. I\u0027ve resolved this year to draw more, but it makes it so much easier to keep that resolution when I know that there are people out there that like my work and care enough to give a little money to keep me going. I know that I want to keep doing it for me, but this is how I can know that you want me to keep doing it for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, don\u0027t think of this as me selling comics to you. I\u0027m not. They\u0027re free. You don\u0027t have to pay to see them. This is just a support mechanism so that you can show your appreciation and that I can feel appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, most of these campaigns have rewards for pledging a certain amount. I don\u0027t have a clue what rewards to add, so if you pledge, please suggest what you\u0027d want for a reward. I will certainly take all of them into consideration and give the good ones to you immediately. Thanks!"
