I really enjoy bringing new content to you guys and also want to grow my channel, make it bigger and better every time I release new content. I can only do that with the help of you guys! Your support means the world to me and I have had a passion for video games for as long as I can remember.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat can you gain by becoming a member of the Dragoon Legion? Well it\u0027s simple.. Live Stream shoutouts and publication, not only that but you have the chance to be imortalised in an indie RPG which has been created by myself as an NPC, a playable character in future DLC or if you have a mean streak, look to become a boss to fight our heroes in future DLC too!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have developed my very own RPG game in the RPG Maker VX Ace engine. The game succeeded on Steam Greenlight. Alongside that success the game released on Steam in July 2017!
