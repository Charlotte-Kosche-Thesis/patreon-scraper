Instead of executing her, the authorities allowed her to live, but\n only on the condition that she pledge them her service at some future \ndate.\u003cbr\u003eThe debt has been called in, and the task is momentous: to \nlocate and secure The Abadon Relic, a legendary artifact of impossible \npower. As Siri gathers a team of experts equal to the task, other powers\n hungry for the Relic begin to maneuver against her. And throughout this\n journey, she is confronted by her dream-like past in ways she could not\n imagine - ways that will shake the foundations of her crew, her \nmission, and even the galaxy itself\u2026\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e----\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, everyone!

As a quick reminder, lore and preview material is available at \u003ca href=\"http://www.theabadonrelic.com\"\u003ewww.theabadonrelic.com\u003c/a\u003e and all audio and video material can be found on my youtube page - look for Lyra Schneider with the Dark Heart icon. (We don\u0027t have any yet, but it\u0027s in the works!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSure, sure. So who are you exactly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Lyra! I\u0027m a 30-year-old bisexual trans woman who loves fantasy and sci-fi. Nice to meet you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLikewise. What\u0027s all this about, anyway?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, this is about a story that started with a game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI gathered some friends - some brand new, at the time - and presented them with an idea: a text-based online role playing game of intrigue, suspense and far-future combat set against the search for a magic-level ancient alien artifact. A few months later, the game had fizzled out due to attrition and schedule conflicts, but the characters we\u0027d created were utterly alive, demanding to play out their lives on the stage of the game\u0027s universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so I decided, with permission from the other players, to fold these characters into a novel called \u003cem\u003eThe Abadon Relic\u003c/em\u003e. The story expanded and demanded to become a series which is now called \u003cem\u003eThe Aeon Immortal\u003c/em\u003e, but since we\u0027re still working on Book I, let\u0027s keep our focus there - \u003cem\u003eThe Abadon Relic\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Abadon Relic, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehuh? What\u0027s so special about it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Abadon Relic \u003c/em\u003efeatures a highly diverse cast centered around several queer women, with their romantic relationships serving as a constant thematic background to the challenges they face; a galactic Federation\u0027s worth of fully-imagined aliens, most of them not humanoid; a commitment to real principles of physics wherever feasibly possible; and constant surprises to keep the reader guessing right up to the end. Throughout the story is an unsettling presence of the otherworldly - beings, forces, and powers that operate through mediums the scientist has yet to truly understand. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInteresting...so why a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis novel has been, until this point, a labor of love. Unfortunately, with the burden of supporting myself financially, it\u0027s starting to look more and more like I will not be able to finish the novel - or any of the countless other stories that tie into it - in any reasonable amount of time (read - years). It occurred to me that I might be able to finish the work sooner, and share it with so many more people, with some financial support in the meantime. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in - friends, family, and fans, I humbly ask you to consider pledging any amount to support the creation of this novel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, but why should I support you, or your book, specifically?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExcellent question! Here are a few possible reasons you may wish to consider:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-This book, and every other book I mean to write in the same universe, will feature as wide an array of diverse representation as I can thoughtfully and sensitively depict. This includes axes of marginalization such as gender identity, sexuality, race, ability, and neurodivergence. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Thematic content running the gamut from imperialism to machine intelligence, personal sacrifice to the galactic role of life, and much, much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-By pledging, you can help generate \u003cstrong\u003ebonus content\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ecustom story material\u003c/strong\u003e regarding your favorite characters and concepts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-You also support entries to the \u003cstrong\u003eEsoterica\u003c/strong\u003e, a blog-style posting of scientific exploration, progress notes, and other ruminations to give you insight into the process of creating this world, its technologies, and the characters who use them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Space vampires - need I say more?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cem\u003eThe Abadon Relic\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and most other entries in \u003cem\u003eThe Aeon Immortal\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0feature normalized introduction with pronouns (\"Hi, my name is Lyra, she/her/hers) and normalized use of neopronouns (including xe/zir/zirs and ve/ver/vis/vers, so far). This book\u0027s successful publication could help make both of those ideas more normalized in the mainstream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI see. Maybe I could see some of your writing, as well?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOf course you could.\u00a0Thank you so much for reading this far! Please find the prologue of \u003cem\u003eThe Abadon Relic\u003c/em\u003e below. I truly hope you enjoy it. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e_____\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e30 years ago...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eSiri Joranson stood on the bridge of \u003cem\u003eThe End of The World\u003c/em\u003e, observing the carnage unfolding before her on the ship\u2019s display systems, grim satisfaction painted across her lips.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cNo one will be safe,\u201d she mused, icy blue eyes unmoved by the pleas for clemency echoing across the open comm bands. \u201cEveryone will feel the terror, and the Federation will burn. At last.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cAll for you,\u201d Eris said, undulating to Siri\u2019s side on the eldritch tentacles sprouting from her back, disdaining the use of her legs for now. \u201cIs it everything you hoped?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSiri turned to the dark woman beside her, seeing a frightening, childlike wonder in her eyes. Eris truly loved her, as she loved Eris. Both monsters that the Federation had created; how could she not love the reflection of all her twisted anger, made manifest in perfect flesh? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cYes.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheir army swept across the Delta Sector like a wildfire. Every ship they faced became slaved to Eris\u2019 will, or utterly destroyed; with every contest, the fleet grew in size. Many former soldiers of the Federation were converted to her brood, crewing the new ships. The rest \u2013 and all their civilian supporters \u2013 were annihilated. Most were simply burned to ash, and a choice few were harvested for grimmer pleasures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet Siri\u2019s thirst for revenge would not be satisfied until the men responsible for the crimes against her were made to suffer even more than she had. Those men, colonels and generals \u2013 particularly, General Garristen - had yet to make an appearance on the battlefield, and she knew why. They were afraid of her. Afraid of Eris. Afraid of the consequences of their reckless, heartless actions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRightly so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cDoes it make you happy?\u201d Eris asked, a tentacle reaching up to caress Siri\u2019s cheek. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe leaned in to the smooth, scaly touch, eyes closed, considering. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cNo. Not really. It makes me\u2026hurt a little less, but it\u2019s like scratching an itch. It doesn\u2019t last, it doesn\u2019t work like it should. No\u2026this isn\u2019t about my salvation, and it never was. This is about punishment.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe looked back to the virtual images playing across the canopy bulkhead, and scowled at an image of a young man begging for his life, ripped to pieces by one of Siri\u2019s soldiers. The soldier was a part of Eris\u2019 brood now, and so, like Eris, she possessed a mind for cruelty, and hands capable of inflicting it in the most horrible ways. They did just so, and the young man\u2019s begging quickly turned to screams. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cEvery single one of them has blood on their hands.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cIt used to make you happy,\u201d Eris noted, distantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI used to think a bit of revenge here and there was all I\u2019d ever be capable of. When I found you, floating alone in that desolated cruiser, I knew you were something special\u2026but I never dreamed you\u2019d be capable of all this. And now, finally, we\u2019re showing them exactly how capable you are.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheir rebel fleet was led by a core contingent of Eris\u2019 brood - former Federation Navigators, whose minds were necessary for warp flight, that Eris had converted to her service. The vast majority of their forces was a band of terrified and awe-inspired rebels, pushed by the twin engines of their own hatred for the Federation and their abject fear of everything Eris could do to them if they got in her way. Every world they\u2019d crossed so far had faced a demonstration of her power, and there had always been a large group of citizens and soldiers willing to turn coat. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cBut despite my capabilities, you are not happy,\u201d Eris observed, pulling Siri\u2019s gaze away from the carnage with a pair of tentacles, surprisingly gentle in touch as she made Siri look at her. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEris\u2019 face was dotted with plates of chitin, eyes burning a witchy green, fires of raw psychic energy wisping into manifestation across the surface of her skin; abundant red hair  parted naturally around a pair of massive ram horns curling out of the top of her head; a slender, enticing neck was atop a body devoid of clothing, vital areas plated over in biological armor. Her skin was dark now, but could change color at will. And, of course, an array of tentacles pulsing slowly, deliberately, through the air behind her back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI am happy to be with you,\u201d Siri said. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe was not lying; there would be no point, because Eris could read her mind. Eris generally didn\u2019t, as a gesture of love towards Siri, but she would if she had any reason to suspect that Siri was being dishonest. But there was no dishonesty: everything about Eris\u2019 form was engineered for virility and attraction, to better empower the unquestioning loyalty of her followers. And she was broken inside, just like Siri. She expressed that brokenness in violent form, cracking whole people into pieces and watching all their smug contempt pour out of them. Often, quite literally. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yet, with all of that rage and suffering, Eris had also fallen in love with Siri. It felt like a blessing Siri couldn\u2019t believe she deserved, but it was evident in every way; the look on Eris\u2019 face, her obvious concern with Siri\u2019s wellbeing, and the fact that she had never once told her a scrap of falsehood. Of course, it was not in a perfect being\u2019s nature to lie; Eris had no need of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI am glad,\u201d Eris said. \u201cBut also worried. Even my power cannot stand against the combined might of the entire IFS.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Interstellar Federation of Species, that ancient alien organization which had drafted humanity into its folds by force, nearly 400 years ago. Most humans never dealt with it directly, but signs of it were everywhere. If Siri were to glance at the catastrophe on her screens, she knew there would be at least a few soldiers that were not human, a few ships that humans could not pilot; the human branch of the Federation was home to natural-born citizens from several alien species. And even if Siri\u2019s army, backed by Eris, could crush every last defender of the human branch - the Delta Sector - there was a grim inevitability to the backlash that would follow. This uprising would not be tolerated by the elder races. It would be seen as an example of human barbarism, and not only would Siri and her crew be executed, but all of humanity might suffer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she said, gritting her teeth, her lip curling in a snarl. \u201cBesides, we knew as much when we started this. We agreed it was worth it - together - we agreed not to tolerate a system that could allow...\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHer voice caught in her throat. It was still hard for her to speak about openly. As she struggled for words, she found herself pulled into Eris\u2019 embrace, first by arms, then tentacles wrapping around her torso, her upper arms, her inner thighs. She flushed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cSiri,\u201d Eris cooed. \u201cYou know I understand. I do all this for you. It just pains me to know that you will die unhappy.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI will die happy if I\u2019m by your side,\u201d Siri said, trembling against the larger woman\u2019s armored body. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI will not die for you, Siri,\u201d Eris said quietly. \u201cI love you. I will kill, torture, rape and corrupt for you. \u003cbr\u003eI would bear an army of children in your name, all of them willing to die for you, and I would watch them do it with a smile in my heart. But I will not die for you. You know this.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut, even your presence would be enough. If I know you\u2019ll be in my mind, psychically, when it\u2019s over\u2026and I know that Garristen is dead\u2026then I\u2019ll die in peace.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThen you will die in peace,\u201d Eris said, holding her tighter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSiri shivered, and gradually pulled away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe twenty three year old pirate captain - scourge of the colonies and hated enemy of the Terran Astral Guard, Siri \u201cDark Heart\u201d Joranson - turned back to the devastation, the expression of a vengeance she\u2019d been incubating for eight long, cold years in space. The screams of her childhood, reflected and multiplied into the screams of her victims, brought her a temporary measure of peace, even as she noted a tiny spark of light within her that railed against it. It had been bothering her for weeks, and she wasn\u2019t sure where it had come from. She quieted it in her usual way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThis is the only course available to us. They forced us to become like this, and now they reap the reward. They sealed their fate as surely as they sealed ours.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEris looked on with her, and said nothing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe skirmish ended in a devastating loss for the Federation, and a colossal success for Siri\u2019s troops. Siri and Eris retired to their chamber for ship-night, Siri cradled in Eris\u2019 dark embrace, dreams free of nightmares thanks to Eris\u2019 psychic touch. When Siri awoke the next morning, Eris had already left the room, presumably to help coordinate her brood for the next day\u2019s march. Siri prepared herself for the day, then left her cabin to search for Eris.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe wasn\u2019t sure where to go. That was odd; normally her psychic link with Eris pointed her in a straight line towards the other woman. Now it seemed like the link was completely gone. Had something happened?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe moved with a bit more urgency, using ship comms to contact various stations around \u003cem\u003eThe End of The World\u003c/em\u003e. No one had seen Eris.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat wasn\u2019t too unusual, since Eris was extremely good at being stealthy when she wanted to be \u2013 she could even make people forget they had seen her \u2013 but still, Siri\u2019s heart raced. She bolted to the nearest security station to access footage from her room, but there was nothing; the camera inside showed Eris getting up and walking out of the room, and the camera outside showed the door opening, but no one emerged. For all intents and purposes, Eris had vanished into thin air.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThat\u2019s just how Eris is,\u201d said Tamlin Mikana, the security officer at this station. \u201cShe pulls stunts like this all the time, tapped into the warp like that. She\u2019ll be back, Captain.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEris did not come back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSiri fell into despair; the bead of light in her heart faded into darkness, and her army fractured against itself without Eris\u2019 guiding influence. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA civil war within a civil war. She knew there was no hope, no possible way of achieving her vengeance. She would die alone, after all, unfulfilled, and having failed every last one of her crew by trusting in the terrible being who claimed to love her. How had she been so foolish? She began to hate Eris for tricking her, for lying to her, when she had never lied to anyone for any reason before. For making her believe there could ever be love in this reality, that monsters like her could find anything but violence and pain. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe found rage again. She was prepared to fight to the last drop, to punish the entire universe for being a place of cruelty. She rallied her loyal troops and made one last push towards the strongholds of her enemies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey beat her, soundly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then they offered her terms of surrender. Terms which featured a full pardon for all of her crimes, in exchange for a favor to be called in later. For the mutual edification of both parties, the government officials said, Garristen would be publically executed for crimes against humanity. \u003cbr\u003eTerrified, broken more surely than she had ever been before, and offered the head of her enemy on a bloody plate, Siri accepted the offer, as did most of her crew.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe was given her revenge. She was given her life. She was given the chance to start over as a citizen, instead of a pirate or a rebel, granted legitimacy by the very government she had sworn was incapable of justice. It should have been the greatest moment of her life; an incalculable victory for her and her entire crew. In some ways, it was; they even celebrated together on the bridge of The End of The World before the ship\u2019s official decommission as part of the terms of surrender, and Siri genuinely enjoyed herself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut she couldn\u2019t truly accept this turn of events.
