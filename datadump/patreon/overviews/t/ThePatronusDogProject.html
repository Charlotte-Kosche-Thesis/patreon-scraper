We run off a team of other volunteer trainers, fosters, and people like you who can help us from afar with donations. Our goal is to help dogs who are at risk or who have been dumped and give them the extra time and training to find their forever homes. We believe in being kind to dogs. We get our fosters vetted, on higher quality food, regular grooming, and regular training with professionals who use dog friendly training methods. Getting desirable behaviors in ways that make it fun for both the people and the dogs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hold onto dogs for 3 weeks so we can find out what their true personality is like at an in-home setting. We do accept applications for adoptions during that waiting and training period, but we will not release dogs until those 3 weeks are up so we can give you as much information about the dog as possible before you bring them into your home.",
