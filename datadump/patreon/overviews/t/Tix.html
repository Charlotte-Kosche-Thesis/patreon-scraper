Something that I never thought possible. I believe education is the right of each individual whatever their social status or background. I know there are people out there who want to learn but for whatever reason life has given, they are unable to. This is where YouTube is great at becoming the link between the teacher and student. I\u0027ve learnt much and I\u0027m sure you have too, by seeing meaningful \u0026amp; engaging content on YouTube. Content that inspires and drives us to become better, content that reignited passions for what we believe in, and content that makes us want to give something back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0like it much better on the creating side as opposed to the watching side and would love for you to join me in creating a complete set of tutorials using a new \u0026amp; unique Qa\u0027idah - that I\u0027m sure we can use to help enhance the learning experience of many children and adults alike, across the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see the first few tutorials on the YouTube page, however, I want to improve the quality, the technology used to create and the content for future lessons, including improved interactions within the videos as well as custom thumbnails (and all the other jiggery pokery an endeavour like this entails), so that the content is relevant and engages learners long after I\u0027ve left the world. In short, I want to leave a small legacy of learning behind me when I eventually depart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to have the full set of tutorials completed over the next year or so. I seek your patronage, advice and support. Hope to see you on the journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely\u003cbr\u003eTix\u003cbr\u003e"
