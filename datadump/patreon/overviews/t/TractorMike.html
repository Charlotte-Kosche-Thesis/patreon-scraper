Generally, it\u0027s for people who have recently moved to the country, need a tractor to maintain their property and have no farm or agricultural experiences, although many seasoned equipment operators tell me they gain knowledge by watching my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a platform that allows YouTube creators to build communities of people with similar interests, while providing additional funding to assist in these efforts through monthly contributions. If you benefit from the information provided in my videos and would like to help support the production of additional videos, here\u0027s an opportunity to do so.\u00a0 With or without Patreon, I will continue to bring you weekly videos to help take the mystery out of tractor ownership, to help you get the maximum productivity and life out of your equipment investments and keep you safe. Through Patreon, I will be able to offer opportunities for monthly live hangouts, where you can get more personal attention, interact with other viewers and discuss your questions with me and each other.\u00a0 It also gives me a chance to determine future directions for videos based on the needs of my most loyal viewers and build relationships with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere your money goes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work three free-lance jobs to support my efforts and I\u0027d like to be able to devote my entire focus to the Tractor Mike website and YouTube channel.\u00a0 I have plans for adding some additional value that time doesn\u0027t allow now. \u00a0In order to take my efforts to the next level, I\u0027m assembling a technical advisory team to keep providing my viewers with good information.
