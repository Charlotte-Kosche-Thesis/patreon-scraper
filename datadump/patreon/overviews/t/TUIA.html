    "summary": "Since the beginning of\nrecorded history, people the world over have looked up at the night sky with\nfascination and awe.  All those\ngenerations with one common purpose \u2013 to discover where they belong in the\ncosmic picture.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nToday we still ask those\nsame questions, but by in large, we have turned our gaze away from the stars.  Our evenings are surrounded by the lights of our\nown making and we spend more time looking down at our mobile devices for\ninstant gratification then staring up at the heavens in wonder.  While technology has undoubtedly enriched our\nlives, it has not been without a cost: we have lost our connection to the night\nsky.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe concept is simple:\nToday, we are living in a golden age of astronomy.  Amazing discoveries are made so often that\nmany of the truly awesome revelations about our universe go unnoticed by the\npublic at large.  And when big news does hit\nthe airwaves, often the information is presented in complex terms that can be\nhard to follow. The purpose of \"The Universe is Awesome\" is to bridge\nthat gap by making these discoveries interesting and understandable \u2013 engaging people\nof all ages in the wonder of the universe, but most importantly, I want to\nreach our youth and ignite in them the same passion that I have for space\nexploration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cThe Universe is Awesome\u201d\nwill broadcast regularly on its own YouTube channel.  In the series we\u2019ll cover the cutting-edge\nideas driving new scientific discoveries like the nature of reality, the search\nfor alien life and how we might develop starships that can travel at warp speed.\n However, we\u2019ll use real-world examples\nto illustrate these concepts in a way that makes them easy to understand as\nwell as exciting to learn about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I\u2019m not asking for\nyour support sight unseen.  The first\nepisode of \u201cThe Universe is Awesome\u201d is already online.  But, It\u2019s taken me a very long time to deliver\njust this one episode.  It was made using\nmy own funds and with the support of only a few people.  In order for me to create a regularly\nscheduled series of this quality, I really need your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy funding \u201cThe Universe\nis Awesome\u201d you\u2019ll be empowering me to build a team of talented professionals\nand create additional episodes.  Your contribution\nwill also allow us the ability to travel to exciting locations like JPL and\nSpace X, going behind the scenes to meet with the people pushing the boundary\nof space exploration.  But most\nimportantly, you\u2019ll be supporting our youth. \nIgniting their imagination and inspiring them to pursue their curiosity\n\u2013 To find their own answers to the mysteries of the universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am passionate about what\n\u201cThe Universe is Awesome\u201d is capable of accomplishing.  It will entertain and inspire people of all ages,\nwhile at the same time, encourage our youth to be the pioneers of tomorrow\u2019s\nscientific discoveries.Your\nsupport is essential to the success of this project.  Together, lets create our own place of common\npurpose where we can ponder the nature of the cosmos and our place within it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
