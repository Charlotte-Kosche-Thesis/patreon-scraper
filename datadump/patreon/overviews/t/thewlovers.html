We\u0027re happy you\u0027re here!!\u003cbr\u003eWe joined Patreon at the beginning of 2016 and it has been WONDERFUL.\u003cbr\u003eOur names are Fleur and Wesley Wood, aka The W Lovers \u00a0and we\u00a0are a husband and wife duo based in Seattle (though, Fleur is from New Zealand).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe just played our 300th show together and over the last two years, we\u0027ve made playing our original music our full time gig. We are no strangers to having our audience be part of our journey. In June 2015 we ran an indigogo campaign and came up with money to record our debut album. We released our album on April 29th 2016 and thanks to Patreon, we\u0027ve been able to release a music video each month since.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHere is a link to our YouTube Channel which has the 6 videos we\u0027ve released since we started with Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI5lsmR9_WKDamGRqDaUfOy3u9Po8F_-W\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCLICK ME\u003c/a\u003e to see what Patreon has helped us release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to continue to create high quality things. We want to make music videos. \u00a0We want to record new songs, We want to press vinyl. We want to tour for a month straight. We want to have hand drawn posters. These things take time away from being able to work our \u0027normal\u0027 job (Teaching guitar, fixing guitars and playing restaurant shows) where our money comes from. These are also the things that would take us to the next level professionally and globally, so we feel they are very important and would help set us apart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea is to keep producing beautiful things and not have to save for months before we can make them happen on our own.\u003cbr\u003eWe would be tickled to have you join us on our adventures and we could certainly use the help in taking our business to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading xx\u003cbr\u003eFleur and Wesley Wood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
