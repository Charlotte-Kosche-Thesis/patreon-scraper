I believe I have a right to exist and that\u2019s why I\u2019m making this page to raise funds. The systems surrounding me don\u2019t want me to live and I need help from individuals who want to combat those systems of oppression and help me sustain myself and do the work I want to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, I\u2019ve been through homelessness, non-consensual s** work, s**ual abuse, and emotional abuse (I\u2019m censoring some words just because I know even seeing / hearing words themselves can be triggering). I\u0027ve lost support from my family of origin many years ago, I am coping with PTSD, I\u0027ve lost my state assistance including food stamps and disability because I haven\u0027t been able to keep up with doctor\u0027s visits and related paperwork. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I had enough money to sustain myself, I would like to focus the energy on supporting other queer and trans folks who are experiencing or facing poverty, homelessness, incarceration, and other struggles that disproportionately affect us (especially queer trans black women and other queer people of color). Ideally I would like to connect with or start a project that provides temporary housing and a variety of resources for trans youth who are at risk for or going through any of the above struggles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSending money on Patreon is considered a donation to me making my life as I need and there are no \"rewards\" outside of that. I will be updating this page with progress on projects I\u0027m able to pursue.\u00a0 Thank you for your help! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*The above photo is not of me but of actress Greta Gerwig.
