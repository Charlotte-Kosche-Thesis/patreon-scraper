    "summary": "Hey there! I\u0027m Kittychan. Right now I\u0027m mostly working on a new game, The Wizard\u0027s Tower, but I also created Maid In Training which is currently on hold. (The explanation for why is in the project description below) \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThere will be three main types of releases on my page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelease Builds \u003c/strong\u003e- These are builds released with a complete block of content. In The Wizard\u0027s Tower, for example, the first release build will allow for a complete cat-girl transformation. A release build for Maid In Training was already released on tfgamessite when I finished the first week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI likely will release some smaller release builds, such as when the Anumra romance is completed or if any new, fully-functional shops are added to Ramsdale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBug Fixes \u003c/strong\u003e- If any game-breaking bugs are found, then my priority will be to release a bug fix. This is extra true for release builds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlpha Builds \u003c/strong\u003e- You can think of these as \"incomplete\" builds. They\u0027re likely to contain bugs and are mostly there for people who want to preview upcoming content. However, because of their incompleteness I can crank these out a lot faster. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nI\u0027m a college student studying Computer Science. Right now my favorite languages are CSS and JavaScript, because I can use them while developing my games. I have some experience with other languages too, though.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Projects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Wizard\u0027s Tower\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nYou\u0027re a traveler who has been searching for a legendary tower, in the hope of finding a cure for your terminal illness. The Tower has what you\u0027re looking for, but no human who enters The Tower remains human for very long.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaid In Training (on hiatus)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eYou\u0027re a young man who finds himself \ntransformed into a girl and forced to work as a maid. Both Mr. Larrens \nand his daughter hate you, but they\u0027re giving you a chance to earn your \nmanhood back. This is no easy task, however, and you may just find it \neasier to give in to your new role.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project is currently on hiatus. This is mostly because I started Maid In Training two years ago when I didn\u0027t know programming. The code is messy(meaning hard to work with) and I\u0027ve been wanting to try my hand at a fantasy setting anyway. I plan to clean it up eventually, but right now I\u0027d rather spend my free time actually developing a game.\u003cbr\u003e"
