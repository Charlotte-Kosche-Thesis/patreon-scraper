Making these deranged recap videos is genuinely a whole lot of fun, and we\u0027re thrilled that you guys are having fun with us. To keep generating high-quality content at a decent pace, we\u0027re working pretty hard (including the huge volunteer efforts put forth behind the scenes by awesome tech people). Since we don\u0027t want to charge for our content, this page is a way for us to get a little help, and to give back to the people who help us. To our patrons: you guys are making it possible for us to live out a dream we didn\u0027t even know we had. And to all our fans: we can\u0027t tell you how happy it makes us that there are people out there who want more of what we\u0027re putting out. Thanks to everyone who even read this far! xoxo, The Nobodies"
