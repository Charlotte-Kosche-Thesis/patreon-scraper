The first, Sweet Nightingale, is already up on kindle. Its sequel, Feathers For Your Bed, is a completed first draft, but needs rewriting and editing before it can be released to the public.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Cityverse\u2013 this June I started to expand\u00a0the Cityverse (a world where Cities are personified and face difficult and often violent lives) from the snippets and world-building on my blog to a fully fledged set of short stories. The first set, \u0027Time Immemorial\u0027, is based on the English Cities, showing their place in the world as well as their culture, influence and the changing times and new enemies they have to face as the centuries pass.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaven\u2013 second and final novel of the Dreamer Duology, a fantasy-horror series following the journey of a girl called Ivy Fairholm who falls into another world filled with familiar faces and unknown rules. This novel will follow and finish what the first novel, Hearth, began.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a lot for me to do, and as I\u0027m self-published the editing costs money but I want to provide the best experience possible for my readers. Anyone who\u0027s interested in helping me along with my journey is more than welcome to."
