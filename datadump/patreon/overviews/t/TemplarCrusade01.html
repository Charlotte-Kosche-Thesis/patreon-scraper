If you learn something: a new skill; a method or a talent; you share it with others. That way the skill carries on, and on, passed on to a new generation and hopefully that generation improves on it and makes it their own. \nBy supporting me, you will help me continue to improve my videos and carry on producing content. This has been an awesome seven and half years, I\u2019d really love to see you guys progress further and expand on your skills and army themes.\u003cbr\u003e"
