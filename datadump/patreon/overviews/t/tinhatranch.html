    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Is The Tin Hat Ranch?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone needs to learn how to prepare for life\u2019s emergencies, be they a simple power outage, a massive storm, a break-in, civil unrest, nuclear war, or (insert end of the world scenario here).  How you chose to be in tune with that information is your own prerogative.  There are many other channels out there that have the same focus, but I feel the Tin Hat Ranch is different. \u00a0 How do you take such a macabre subject and make it fun to watch? \u00a0It has always been the aim of the Tin Hat Ranch to teach\u00a0\u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003eentertain at the same time. \u00a0I value your time, and with each video produced the information is distilled down to the elements that you need, delivered succinctly, and for good measure a bit of sugar is sprinkled on top. \u00a0Of all the subjects on YouTube, this is one of the few that can make a difference in your life. \u00a0While we hope that some of the information we provide will never be used, lots of it is useful day to day. \u00a0Should the unthinkable happen, a bit of information you learned at the Tin Hat Ranch could make all the difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is the Tin Hat Ranch on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why is the Tin Hat Ranch here? \u00a0Transforming imagination into reality is one part time, one part effort, one part soul, and one part money. \u00a0I can provide the time, effort, and soul, but I need your help with the last one. \u00a0 \u00a0Content from the Tin Hat Ranch has always been, and always will be, free. \u00a0The very limited opportunities for income afforded to YouTube channels can put a cap on their creativity. \u00a0Creators like myself often reinvest all of the proceeds (and then some) back into their channels. \u00a0When it comes time to dream big and produce a series like the \"DIY Off Grid Solar Series\", often times the dreams must remain, dreams. \u00a0Your help can change that. \u00a0Your donations can help turn ideas into videos. \u00a0We all share some of the same life goals, what if, in the future, you want to install solar panels or a wind generator, learn HAM radio, or build a complete self-sustaining log cabin homestead? \u00a0If you like to learn from the Tin Hat Ranch, some of these topics are there, some are still dreams. \u00a0There is no fancy way of getting around saying it, producing these episodes costs money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will the Tin Hat Ranch do with the donations?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, I\u0027ll take what is in my head, and put it on video. \u00a0Your donations will do two things, 1.) make them happen, and 2.) make them happen faster. \u00a0This can take many forms, some of them are in the goals section, but producing a channel like the Tin Hat Ranch has costs, ranging from sheer production costs on the topics at hand, to equipment like cameras and lights. \u00a0Your donation will go towards more information delivered in a live call-in podcast, more epic How-To\u0027s, and interesting content from abroad, along with all of things that are associated with the production of the content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get for your donation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor your donation you will get exactly what is stated above. \u00a0The content will continue and hopefully the topics will expand and reach a wider audience. \u00a0With recent changes at many of the platforms used to distribute and fund social media, we are re-evaluating additional methods to reward you for your support. \u00a0Stay tuned.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn unfortunate truth in life-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Everybody needs money. \u00a0That\u0027s why they call it money.\" -The Heist, Danny Devito\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
