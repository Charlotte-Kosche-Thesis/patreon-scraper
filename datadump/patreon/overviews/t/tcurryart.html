I\u0027m an art student from philly, a Junior majoring in Illustration at UARTS. Everything I do creatively is driven by storytelling, which is my favorite thing. In addition to working hard at school, I have my first webcomic project in progress!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/95d55547b21e261f02e069febb7afb5e/tumblr_oey3hdAW191uegio3o1_1280.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s called Space Hop! It\u0027s panel by panel, made to feel more like an illustrated storyboard or beatboard rather than a traiditonal comic. The story is about Space Hoppers, which are a sort of combination between bounty hunters, adventurers, treasure hunters and tomb raiders, in space. Searching for a mysterious, undiscovered treasure that is legendary to all Space Hoppers, It follows the protagonist Yerin and their\u00a0journey to become the best, and a legend themself. Other characters include Annie, Yerin\u0027s co-hop and tamer of alien creatures, Slim, a DJ from earth on his first tour in space, and Travis, a one eyed alien space-cab driver who somehow got caught up in the mix as well.\u00a0The group searches for treasure and fame across the galaxy but not without encountering obstacles and rivals.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.spacehopcomic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20helmets.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n*:\u30fb\uff9f\u2727\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://spacehopcomic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYou can find Space Hop here!!\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0*:\u30fb\uff9f\u2727\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPledging to my project brings my life as an independent artist a little more stability, allowing me to make as much as I can.
