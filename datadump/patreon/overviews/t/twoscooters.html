I\u0027ve published essays on the evolution of my understanding of what happens when you die, why Batman is my favorite superhero, and why Dragon Age\u0027s Qunari race is the most progressive portrayal of the barbaric \"Other\" in modern media. My writing is informed but not academic, personal but not maudlin.
