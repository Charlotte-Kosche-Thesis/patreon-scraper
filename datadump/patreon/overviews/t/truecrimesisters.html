For as long as I can remember we have both been super interested in all things dark and scary. When we were younger it was all about the paranormal, but as we grew up we began to develop a deep interest in True Crime.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal with this podcast is to tell the stories of the victims of crime in a sensitive and factual way. Our keen interest in True Crime coupled with Harry\u0027s \"Bachelor of Psychological Science\" from Deakin University, means we have the experience and tools to ensure our podcast is well researched and presented to a high standard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis show is produced by Harry, who is the main researcher, editor, writer, social media manager, promoter, graphic designer and sound woman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy co-host Bill also does research and brings most of the personality and improv to the episodes that our listeners love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have taught ourselves everything we know and will continue to improve as we go along.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t expect anything from our listeners. This is a passion project and we truly hope that you love the content we produce whether you decide to pay for it or not. Producing the podcast is currently a full time job for Harry and part time for Bill. This is absolutely our choice, we love doing it. Listener support would mean that we could upgrade our equipment and continue to produce content of the highest quality. In addition it would allow Harry more time to research and produce quality content for True Crime Sisters podcast.
