Beyond that, I have many ideas for the future of the blog. There are also certain guests I would like to host on the podcast (eventually).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere will be no ads, ever. I believe in the subscription model.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAdvertising\u0027s enormous advantage is of course the democratization of content \u2014 everyone has access. I am highly sympathetic to this benefit, which is why I will continue to make introductory articles available to everyone from time to time. They will always be a very important part of the blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut the advertising model on the internet is often detrimental. When you have reputable technology websites flooded with highly questionable ads and auto-play videos that greatly inhibit the performance and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/10685/the-iphone-7-and-iphone-7-plus-review/5\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebattery life\u003c/a\u003e of readers\u2019 devices, the system is broken. This is not an indictment of journalism, but simply economic reality. And inherently all advertising is consequential to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxFzf6yIfcc\u0026amp;t=3m50s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe message of its medium\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor all of these reasons, I prefer the subscription model. It also allows me to avoid the temptation of clickbait headlines. Before publishing a piece I can ask myself whether I even have anything of value to add on a topic. If journalists have already covered it well, then that\u0027s great, and I\u2019m happy to share those articles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also believe there is a great need for tech coverage that provides at least some of the perspective of the industry itself, and it\u0027s worth emphasizing how much the average industry observer does not get to see. Talk to an engineer at any tech company, and it\u0027s clear that \"how things actually work\" is often radically different than how it\u0027s portrayed online. There is an tremendous amount of work that goes into creating, testing, and manufacturing tech products, and the vast majority of this work goes completely unappreciated in the public record. What goes into making a product is often just as important as the final result.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI genuinely want to do something different. I\u2019ll do this by covering things that are not normally discussed in the press, or often are not on the internet at all. Sometimes I\u2019ll be able to go into much greater depth on technical subjects. Relatedly, nothing is more important to me than accuracy, and I will always correct any identified mistakes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLastly, within the realm of independent content I am indebted to several influences, including Jessica Lessin and The Information, Dan Luu, and Chris Pirillo. My thanks to them for the inspiration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you all for your consideration and your support. It\u2019s deeply appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
