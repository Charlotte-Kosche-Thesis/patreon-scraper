On this show, I interview alternative health providers, individuals who have found improved health via natural health methods and positive lifestyle choices, cannabis activists, physicians, and other health related activists. \u003cbr\u003eThe Green Zone TV is an educational show (with humorous and entertaining twists) dedicated to medical cannabis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe create some of the episodes at Fayetteville Public TV, and some on location all over the country. \u00a0The producer for Bulldozer Health Show television and podcast editions, \u00a0is Angela Edge from A. Edge productions. She is not only a creative film genius, but a brilliant musician. You can hear her music in many of the episodes. \u00a0We added Jori Costello as Radio Producer putting episodes together, adding music and health tips and making the episodes the required length for Radio. These producers need some compensation for their work! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Green Zone TV is primarily filmed at FPTV and around town in Fayetteville Arkansas. This show is directed by Jori Costello and has a dedicated film and editing crew.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith all of this happening, we also need some funding for travel and equipment.

     "about": "The Bulldozer Health Show features host Wendy Love Edge, who interviews alternative health providers, physicians, cannabis activists, and those who have found improved health through positive lifestyle choices and health freedom. \u00a0We do some of our shows in the studio in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Many of the shows are also done in location all over the country at alternative health provider centers and offices, activist offices, and peoples\u0027 homes. Yup. We gather up the small amount of equipment we\u0027ve got, and hit the road to go and meet in person, and get up close and personal with health providers on location, so people can get an inside view of what it\u0027s like to visit them. \u00a0Also, when it\u0027s someone who has made major personal health changes for the better, we find that we get a more detailed picture by visiting them in their own environment. Once we\u0027ve got all the footage, Angela Edge, from A. Edge productions, gets to work editing and adding original music to the shows.\u003cbr\u003eYes, the show is produced for television and podcast by A. Edge Productions and for radio by Jori Costello. These two add their own creative touch to round out each episode for their respective formats. And the result is amazing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis is part of the Bulldozer Health Inc. project. Bulldozer Health Inc. is a 501c3 nonprofit organization and health care reform initiative. This show helps to fulfill the mission of educating everyone about all of their health care options. \u003cbr\u003eWe have chosen to create all of these formats for the show, because we truly want to reach everyone!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe are coming up on our 50th episode, having created this thing largely on a shoestring and with the generosity of Fayetteville Public TV. \u003cbr\u003eWe need our own equipment, and some actual pay for the producers and creators.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are filled with gratitude for our guests, FPTV, and everyone who has been so supportive of the show. It\u0027s time to take it to the next level! \u00a0We are filled with gratitude for all patrons who support the efforts of everyone involved in The Bulldozer Health Show. \u00a0Thank you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
