    "summary": "My name is Casey Stewart Upton and THANK YOU for believing in the work of the Emotional Labor Union. It means the world to me that you see the value in what we are creating together. The ELU began after a \u003cem\u003epretty\u003c/em\u003e uncomfortable solo vacation in 2017. It was there I realized I was completely out of touch with my inner voice and had been putting myself last. I decided then I would create a space for women to thrive - behold the ELU whose mission\u00a0is to amplify women\u0027s voices and experiences through curated feminist topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe 4 Values of the ELU:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eVoices as power: The ELU is a safe space and a platform to talk about your experiences. Devoting time to critical thinking and interaction empowers us to sharpen our speaking skills and define the source of our feelings as well as reminds us we have voices that deserve to be heard.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCommunity IRL: The ELU brings people together in real life who prioritize being intentional and carving out time and space to devote to knowing themselves and others better. This is a group that provides love, support and where no question or opinion is off-limits.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStrength in numbers: The more time we spend having invigorating in-person discussions, finding common ground with others, and cementing how we feel about topics that affect us, the more powerful we become both individually and collectively.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFeminism as Self-Care: Members of the ELU practice prioritizing themselves by devoting time to pursuing their interests and their $ by supporting causes they think are worthwhile. The ELU gives everyone a nourishing and energizing experience that allows you to find your own voice on matters that are important to you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e"

After a solo vacation taken earlier this year, she felt invigorated by the idea of creating spaces for women to come together to talk openly and honestly about issues they face today; both as a form of catharsis as well as to build a supportive community. When she\u0027s not leading feminist discussion groups, Casey can be found managing the operations of a political consultancy, bartending or chilling at home with her husband and two kitties. \u003cbr\u003e",
