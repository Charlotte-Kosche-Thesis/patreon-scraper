We are, as you likely already know, a real-play D\u0026amp;D 5e podcast set in the magical land of Irulan. We have been playing as a group since November of 2014 and we were having so much fun in our game that we decided to share it with the world. We do this because its a ton of fun and we adore making this podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly, the cost of producing, hosting, and managing a podcast is non-trivial. Our hosting costs are the single biggest expense but we\u0027d also love to be able to greatly improve our audio quality by purchasing some additional microphones and recording gear.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to make sure we share our love and appreciation for our fans by coming up with some fun and unique rewards. Take a look and we greatly appreciate donations at absolutely any budget or level as every penny helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-The Tabletop Champions Crew\u003cbr\u003e"
