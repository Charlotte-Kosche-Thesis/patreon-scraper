In a world full of creative people, Patreon connects patrons directly\nwith their favorite creators and gives them the ability to appreciate their creative\nefforts responsibly. We chose this site because it allows those who appreciate\nwhat we do to tip us, so to speak, and help us reach milestones that will facilitate\nthe growth and project development of other M.a.D projects. Your contributions\nwill give us the freedom to create, without the pressure of compromising our\ncontent just for the sake of making money. You, the patron, can set a budget, and\nput guarantees in place, so you never contribute more than your budget can bear,\nregardless of the frequency of the posted content. Always remember, even though\nPatreon allows you to show your support through your contributions, our content\nwill never be withheld from our viewers because you may not be able to afford,\nor even want to offer monetary support. Of course a good old fashioned,\nFacebook \u201cLike\u201d, Twitter \u201cRetweet\u201d, or Instagram comment will always make us\nfeel M.a.D love!\u003cbr\u003e"
