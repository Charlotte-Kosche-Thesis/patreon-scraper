We are the escaped\nmental patie...I mean, artists collectively known as Team Pizza. Some\npeople even like our art, which was a pleasant surprise.\nAnd because of this wonderful feedback, we\u0027ve slowly expanded our\ncraft. We crawled into our cocoon a small Let\u0027s Play channel on YouTube and\nemerged with a dedicated site, a webcomic, reviews, countdowns, and\nsoon, some games of our own for ya\u0027ll to (hopefully) enjoy. Our\nnumbers have grown from 2 guys with ideas too ambitious to create on\ntheir own, to a whole team of artists, programmers, and other\neldritch abominations. All working on empty wallets with naught but Little Caesars and sheer passion for their craft to keep them going.

Inspired by classic comic stories\nof heroes, villains, and the masks they wear, it\u0027s a thrilling ride\nwhere who you\u0027re fighting against is as equal a concern as who you\u0027re\nfighting for.

And one you have every right to ask. Truth be told, we\nhad a rule that we wouldn\u0027t open a Patreon until somebody asked for one, and lately, we\u0027ve been getting asked for it a lot. Not that we\u0027re\nsurprised, mind you. Maybe we\u0027re biased, but our fans are some of the\nmost positive, supportive, and downright pleasant people we\u0027ve ever\nmet, so it\u0027s become our mission statement to provide the kind of\nentertainment worthy of that level of adoration. Production on that scale isn\u0027t easy to achieve, though, especially when you have\nthe entirety of existence yelling at you to \"get a real job\nalready\". Existence can suck it. We\u0027ve been treating this like\nour real jobs for quite some time now, and if we had the money required to\ndo that 100% of that time, only the need for sleep would stand in our\nway of creating the best videos, comics, and games a group of rebels\nlike us could make.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPut\nsimply, there\u0027s nothing else we\u0027d rather do with our lives than this,\nand souls like you who even so much as check out this page give us a\nreason to keep on keeping on. The least we can do is seek out what we need to pay back that\nkind of love.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i465.photobucket.com/albums/rr16/Whatthefnu/Bumper%204%20final_zps7kjryesr.jpg\" style=\"width: 431px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons\nof the past mostly donated to places like museums or parks. They were\npeople who believed very strongly in the value of a work, and wanted to see it\nsucceed so greatly that they contributed their own blessings to help it\nflourish. All they asked in return was the ability to keep loving\ntheir medium of choice in an ever-expanding way. In that vein, most\nof what we see on other Patreon pages are people who have a very deep\nappreciation for what they support. Not just for the content itself,\nbut all the heart and soul that goes into making it. And sure enough,\nsome of the most popular tiers on those pages are ones that offer\ninside looks into how the videos, comics, and what have you are all\nmade. If that\u0027s your kind of thing, these rewards are REALLY gonna be\nyour thing, offering you access to patron-only streams, blogs,\nvideos, and even the chance to influence the direction of future Team\nPizza content.

Every creation is a work of passion because you feed that\npassion back to us in turn. Every project is a chance to improve\nourselves because constantly chasing that ceiling is how we help even\nmore people discover what you already know. And every hardship is\nworth the headache because you took the time to read this right now.\nYou are the reason we\u0027re artists. And for that, we thank you.
