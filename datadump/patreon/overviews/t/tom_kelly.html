    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, thank you for taking a moment to read this. I want to tell you a bit about myself and why I have created this Patreon account in the hopes you can help me achieve my dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Tom Kelly. I\u0027ve been interested in art for as long as I can remember and wanted to work within an artistic field since I found it was a viable option in High School. While I began College at Pratt in 2007, I had to drop out after just a year due to financial struggles. I continued to create what I could when I could but fell into a depression that lasted many years. Fast forward a few years from one blur into another. My Mother had surgery to remove a tumor from her brain and my Father passed away, both of which compounded on my situation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began working at a call center with some amazing people but this did not help with the creative side of things. I began getting restless around Fall of 2016 and started opening commissions after a month or two of shaking off some of the rust from my pencils.\u00a0I embraced what depression I had and managed to mold it into a macbre style that I am still honing to this day. During this time I also received the opportunity to write and direct horror plots for a live action role-playing game. That opportunity was a second step forward from restlessness to a more driven attitude. A few months later in February of 2017 I was given the opportunity to switch from managing a call center to managing a tattoo shop. Being surrounded by amazing artists day in and day out reinvigorated my need to pursue a career in art and more importantly, it showed me that it was something that could be done with some sacrifice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently took the opportunity to hone my artistic skills at the tattoo shop I work at in the hopes that one day I will gain an apprenticeship and eventually become a tattoo artist. While this is an amazing opportunity that has allowed me to pursue an artistic dream, it has left me with \u003cem\u003ejust\u003c/em\u003e enough income to survive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of this Patreon is to assist me with supplementing my income for art supplies, the occasional night out and of course, copious amounts of coffee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it stands, I am working sixty to seventy hour weeks between the tattoo shop and my position directing a live action role-playing game. I love both positions dearly, but the blood, sweat and tears I pour into both of them does not allow me to entertain the notion of a third traditional job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Is The Goal?:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith this Patreon, you can follow the growth of my visual artwork with updates on what I\u0027m working on while also earning some rewards in the process. You will be kept in the loop of my progress, setbacks, probably a few rants, as well as any interesting things along the way in my practice. In a quite literal sense, you are my Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my goals change from practice, to hopefully apprenticing and tattooing, new rewards will be added to reflect my growth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe hope is that one day I will no longer need Patreon or I can transform it from a platform showing my growth to one used to highlight successes with you, my Patrons, receiving any news and benefits first for sticking with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve made it this far, thank you. It means a lot that you too the time to read all this. If you have any questions, contact me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
