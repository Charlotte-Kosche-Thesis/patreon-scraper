My name is Anne (aka RawMama) and I am on a mission to help save the world! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Story\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up on the Standard American Diet (SAD) and it did not serve my body well (acne,\u00a0gas, bloating, tummy pain indigestion, heartburn, mood swings, thyroid problems.. etc) I also smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for a good 8 years, drank almost daily and was on multiple medications: adderall, seroquel, a pill for my acne, a mood stabilizer and one for my thyroid I was told I would be on for the rest of my life. I am now eating a high raw, plant based diet and I am feeling the best I have every felt in my life. My skin has cleared up after a decade of horrible acne that nothing topical helped, I am off all medications and thriving with this Raw Vegan lifestyle. I hope to introduce this way of living to as many people as possible and show them how amazing life can truly be without the SAD weighing you down :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xlp1/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/12798981_1693338784266470_4146484428937545756_n.jpg?oh=071193767077856268598f0fd76640f3\u0026amp;oe=57985D2A\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy transformation started happening shortly after the picture on the left was taken. I quit wearing ALL makeup in Feb 2014 as well as quit all my meds and smoking in one month. My acne didn\u0027t heal until October 2014 (when I found the high-fat, low sugar raw lifestyle) So there isn\u0027t many pictures in between. I was 4 months pregnant in the picture on the right :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a proud mama to my son Axel who is growing up way too fast. I had a midwife, a doula and my ideal home water birth. I LOVED being pregnant and look forward to vlogging the next go around:)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan is to recreate all the dishes I grew up on and make them into a healthier version. I have done so already with grilled cheese, mac and cheese, pad thai, tacos, crackers, chocolate pudding, ice cream, churros, donuts, energy bars and many more. Everything I make is vegan, gluten free and grain free, mostly raw with some cooked versions. I have been spending most of my time in the kitchen experimenting with different recipes for over a year and I am excited to finally start sharing my creations that I have put so much time, energy and love into.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a RawMama Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be posting videos of:\u003cbr\u003e*\u003cstrong\u003eMy Recipe\u0027s\u003c/strong\u003e I have spent over a year perfecting (vegan, gluten free, grain free, low sugar)\u003cbr\u003e*\u003cstrong\u003eProduct Reviews\u003c/strong\u003e, what few packaged foods I will eat, what I won\u0027t eat and why\u003cbr\u003e*\u003cstrong\u003eMy experiences\u003c/strong\u003e and tips going from the SAD diet to Raw Vegan\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBigger things to come from RawMama:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a couple books I hope to get out, ideas for documentaries and music video parody ideas. My big dream is to have a chunk of land used as a retreat center where people can get away from every day life (being bombarded by crap food ads.. etc.). We will teach them how to grow food, turn it into delicious meals and teach skills to help them stay strong in the real world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading and thank you for your support \u0026lt;3"
