    "summary": "Lets be real, art education is expensive and it also takes time. Being a self taught artist I\u0027ve always used my commission work to push and improve myself, but I\u0027ve hit a point that experimenting on client work just isn\u0027t enough and I can\u0027t realistically make the money I need for bills, while spending valuable time improving. I also need direction to improve. There are plenty of videos, books, online short term schools, workshops out there with brilliant artists willing to teach all that they know, but usually these classes can a good deal of money, money that I really just dont have. 9months ago I had decided to do a mentorship called SmART school. I ended up pulling out a loan. The school was a 3 month program. I learned more then I ever thought I could and it helped me place my work years in advance, but I\u0027m still paying off that loan and will be for the next several months. My goals for this patreon is to continue to go to schools like this, without putting myself and my husband under financial pressure. I love art, I love learning, but I can\u0027t do that to my husband or myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings me to this patreon. This patreon was created to help support me to improve my artwork through funding schools, tutorials, books and anything else that will help me improve my work as an artist. Help me keep my head above financial debts, while I\u0027m still in the process of learning and improving. I\u0027m also hoping that I\u0027ll be able to work on personal projects such as a graphic novels, calenders and several other ideas that typically I couldn\u0027t financially spend the time doing as this patreon grows, but for now I\u0027m only sticking with my education and paying bills. \u003cbr\u003e"
