    "summary": "Hey,\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, thanks. If you have made it this far then you kinda like listening to the Welsh guy going on for a half hour or so each week about some of the most obscure and unfamiliar crimes that have taken place in the UK. That means the world - it really does, your support and interest is great and keeps me doing what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started The True Crime Enthusiast because True Crime has always been my chosen genre of interest, and I wanted to put out what I as a listener would be interested most in hearing. There are so many people who are forgotten and cases that are unheard of - and I don\u0027t believe any one case is more important to highlight than another - that\u0027s why I choose the cases I cover. It takes dedication, willingness to research and commitment - and I do have all of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have never, and will never, aim to use the show to make a profit. It is solely for myself about making forgotten names remembered again - but this does take time, research, production and patience. But I want to make the show better - I always believe that it can be better - and this can be done in a few ways. Better research, production and editing means a better show for people to hear and get involved with - and who knows, it may just spur and inspire someone on to go out and do the same kind of thing. Hopefully, this is where you guys come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a variety of ways that you can help me make TTCE a better show. It can be as simple as a share on social media, or a nice 5* review on iTunes (I hope anyway!), or a suggestion for a case - even offering knowledge sharing about something technical. All will be greatly appreciated. Or if you do appreciate the work that I do - which I won\u0027t lie, is time consuming but totally worthwhile - and it\u0027s within your means, then maybe a small financial contribution to help the show grow - I wouldn\u0027t expect this without offering some kind of reward for yourselves, and if you have a look at the tiers I have created, then you have an idea of what your contributions will bring back around. It would be very much appreciated - it would go into what I have said above. Better equipment and funds for research - because better research, books and access to documents/newspaper archives/FOI Requests etc - all means better coverage of cases and a few more names remembered, making a better show all around - and I would strive to ensure that the improved quality was always apparent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd lastly, I must stress that The True Crime Enthusiast will always be available to listen for free - that won\u0027t change. I just want to be able to deliver more, and hopefully, that\u0027s where you guys come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaul (The True Crime Enthusiast)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "If you\u0027ve come this far, you\u0027ve made it to the Patreon page of The True Crime Enthusiast Podcast, which began as a weekly written blog in mid-2016, and in the autumn of 2017 I decided to make the jump into a weekly matter of fact straight talking podcast. Each week in it, I look\u00a0at and recount in-depth true crime cases from the annals of\u00a0UK crime - solved or unsolved, but I always favour the lesser known and obscure cases. I try to put out on the podcast what I myself would be most interested in hearing as a listener - so it\u0027s a good job I\u0027m a lifelong true crime buff!! I strive to be personal and down to earth - and I\u0027m a stickler for detail (can you ever have too much detail???), but I also like to speak my own mind, and I\u0027m known to put the odd witticism in now and again\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery download and listen that the show gets really does mean the world, plus all of the interaction is great, I am perpetually grateful to each and every one and it has all helped spur me on to make the podcast what it is.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBut it is a labour of love, and one done in my spare time and around my full-time job, so equally lucky that I have endless enthusiasm and I love what I do, and it\u0027s what I want to continue to do. It is a time-consuming process, however, and I always think to myself \"It could be better\". I want everyone to enjoy it as much as I enjoy creating it, and I think better audio equipment and editing, better research = better enjoyment for all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are several ways that you can come in and help with making The True Crime Enthusiast a better show. A financial contribution would be amazing, and I hope my enthusiasm shines through on the show enough so that you would know just how much it meant and the good use it would be put to. If you can\u0027t afford that, then any reviews of or interaction with the show are great and appreciated, they do help believe me. Whatever support you can give would be greatly welcomed, and you have my utmost gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaul (The True Crime Enthusiast)",
