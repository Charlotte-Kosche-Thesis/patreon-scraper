    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eWelcome! Thanks so much for stopping by. You might know me from Twitter, or you might just be into history, poetry, fashion, art, and music - you know, all that stuff that makes life worth living - and hungry for analysis that makes you think. I look at the world through a queer and feminist lens, I\u2019m passionate about discussing and sharing the things I love, and I want YOU to be a part of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make thorny topics accessible and relate long-ago struggles to our current times. I\u2019ll show you how medieval Japanese courtship compares to modern romance, what we can learn from the do-it-yourself abortion providers of the 1970s, and how Gilded-Age-era fears and anxieties about women still reverberate today. Curious about the history of makeup around the world? Want to read about how women survived 19th-century mental institutions? Monthly essays about all these topics and more will be available to Patrons at least a week anyone else gets their eyeballs on \u2018em. Many will remain exclusive to Patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe won\u2019t just look at history and its connections to today, though. We\u2019re going to get \u003cem\u003eliterary\u003c/em\u003e. For $5 and up Patrons, I\u2019ll be posting a poem by a marginalized poet (read: no white straight cis dudes, please)  every month that strikes me as important, gut-wrenching, or just plain beautiful. I\u2019ll explain why the poem is important and what techniques the poet used, too. If you\u2019d love to discover new poets or if poetry has always seemed a little intimidating, this is for you. If music is more your thing, Patrons at this level will also get access to my Song of the Week feature, where you\u2019ll find your favorite jam you haven\u2019t met yet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re like, \u201cOk, history and poetry and tunes are cool, but...I want more. I want more creativity! More fashion! I want to see your artwork and your outfits!\u201d Aw, that\u2019s super sweet of you. I\u2019m blushing! Good news: you can totally have that. At $10/month you\u2019ll get to see weekly What I Wore posts, which will include photos of my outfit and makeup \u0026amp; descriptions of what I\u2019m wearing and why. You\u2019ll also get to post questions and get answers on anything under the sun via a monthly Q\u0026amp;A post. At the $15/month level, you can ALSO check out previews and work-in-progress photos of my visual art, which includes painting, drawing, collage, and sculpture. My current work is heavily inspired by the Rococo period, but with way more queer people, and I\u2019ll talk about my process, my inspirations, and my reference material. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you dying to get my opinion on something, or to have me explain a current event or a historical issue that confuses or fascinates you? For $25/month, you can request a post on a specific topic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALL Patrons, at any level, will get a thank-you shoutout on twitter (if you want - I understand if you don\u2019t!) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, you will also have the opportunity to work with me on your own writing! I\u2019m a professional editor who freelances regularly, and I want my Patrons to be at the top of my client list. From detailed grammar edits to worldbuilding critiques, I\u2019m there, and I want to help you create the best writing you can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for checking out my work. I can\u2019t wait to build this community with you!"
