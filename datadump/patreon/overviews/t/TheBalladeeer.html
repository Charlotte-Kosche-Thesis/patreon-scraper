After the birthing process Mom and Dad took me to our lovely home in Doraville, GA, where I grew up\u2026.kinda.\u003cbr\u003eI was highly influenced by great artists like George Jones, Merle Haggard, Randy Travis, Gene Watson, and many more.  I picked up the guitar when I was about 14, and with a little help from a few friends learned some basic chords\u2026\u003cbr\u003eThrough the years, I did a lot of things, morning drive radio, ran a shoe store, meter reader for the gas company, I even worked as a private detective.  Like most country singers, I\u2019ve been lied to, let down, drink too much and, yes, I\u2019ve seen the inside of a jail cell.\u003cbr\u003eIn 1989 I met \u003ca href=\"http://www.tomparkproductions.com/\"\u003eTom Park\u003c/a\u003e in Atlanta.  I adapted a TV ad campaign he was doing to fit my \u201csmaller\u201d clients.  Since then I have appeared in over 40,000 commercials all over the Southeast.  I\u2019ve been very fortunate.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, I returned to my love of traditional country music, and writing.  Having a blast and hope you enjoy some of it.\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support,\u003cbr\u003e"
