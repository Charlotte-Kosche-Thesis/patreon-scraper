Through patreon you are also helping me pay for food, bills, supplies, software, etc that I would otherwise be paying for with money earned from commissions.\u00a0 With your generous help I will be able to focus more on improving as an artist, having more time for personal work, while also sharing those creations with others. So if you like my art, please consider being my patreon! Other incentives for helping me can be found once you scroll down and check out the awesome donation options I have! Please read through them carefully before making a decision, if you do!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank everyone who reads through this and especially those who donate.
