    "summary": "Hey there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for making your way to The New Family\u0027s Patreon page. I\u0027m Brandie Weikle, creator of this site and podcast, and I\u0027m excited to tell you what we\u0027re all about and why we\u0027ve launched this campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thenewfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Brandie-photo_350.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that family is up to us to define. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a long-time parenting journalist (\u003cem\u003eCanadian Family, The Toronto Star, Today\u0027s Parent\u003c/em\u003e, etc.) and a member of a family that many would describe as \"non-traditional.\" I live \u003ca href=\"http://thenewfamily.com/2014/10/concscious-uncoupling-before-it-was-cool-my-reason-for-starting-the-1000-families-project/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003enext door to the father of my children\u003c/a\u003e and his second wife. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thenewfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/conscious-uncoupling-before-it-was-cool-why-i-started-the-1000-families-project_1000.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to launch a \u003ca href=\"http://thenewfamily.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://thenewfamily.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epodcast\u003c/a\u003e dedicated to exploring and celebrating the many forms that family takes today. That\u0027s because I\u0027d observed that much of parenting media operates from a default position that assumes all families look like this: a married mom and dad, a couple of kids, and maybe a golden retriever. And if your family \u003cem\u003edoesn\u0027t \u003c/em\u003e\u2014 because you\u0027re in a same-sex relationship, embarking on parenthood alone, sharing a home with a friend, getting a divorce \u2014 it can feel a little excluding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe 1,000 Families Project\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Our site\u0027s guest blog series, the 1,000 Families Project \u2014 also known as \"I bet we can find a thousand ways to be a family\" \u2014 immediately touched a nerve. People wrote to say they found the posts validating because, until they discovered the project, they\u0027d felt like maybe their family life didn\u0027t quite measure up. Others said that even though they aren\u0027t parents, they read the series loyally because it offers an interesting glimpse into the human condition simply by showing all the different ways that people form families. The site won Best Blog at the Canadian Online Publishing Awards in 2015 and is \u2014 I\u0027m humbled to share \u2014 a finalist in three categories this year!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe New Family Podcast\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA year after launching, we expanded our offerings with a top-rated podcast bringing these stories to life through the power of audio. Twice a week, I interview some of the most compelling people whose stories represent the changing face of family. And I speak to parenting experts with great insights to share on the challenges of raising kids in these interesting times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eResponse has been great. The show dominated iTunes New \u0026amp; Noteworthy\u0027s Kids \u0026amp; Family category during the launch period, as well as in Society and in Education. It was the subject of CBC radio interviews from coast to coast. The New Family has also been featured in \u003cem\u003eThe Toronto Star, Huffington Post\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eParents Canada\u003c/em\u003e and on numerous other sites and podcasts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love creating this podcast. It\u0027s been incredibly rewarding. However, it could easily be a full-time job. I put a great deal of research and preparation into finding great subjects and preparing for those interviews. I act as my own producer and outsource the audio editing to an expert so that it\u0027s worthy of your eardrums. While we\u0027ve have a few sponsors, I\u0027ve found acting as my own marketing manager difficult while also producing the show and building the audience. The result is that the show currently costs me money to produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eEnsuring sustainability\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to ensure the podcast and website remain sustainable so I can continue to offer great content for free. I do numerous consulting, writing and editing jobs to pay the bills, and that means I\u0027m often working on the podcast and website in the wee hours. I\u0027d love to cut back on outside work once the the site and show are generating more income so I can focus on serving my community (including my free, 1000+ member \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/921760681251872/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eco-parenting support group\u003c/a\u003e), pushing the agenda of family diversity, and empowering people to define their families however they damn well please.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would never expect anything of my readers and listeners other than to show up and enjoy the content. But if you\u0027re game to get more involved, I\u0027d be forever grateful to welcome you to join me on my mission. Your support will secure what we do and help to make us better. I\u0027d like to improve the podcast by adding some documentary-style episodes to the mix, and those cost many times more to produce than regular interview episodes. I\u0027d also like to produce live events, such as podcast-recordings in front of an audience, plus and real and virtual seminars on the state of family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery listener and reader makes a big difference, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for every post you click on and episode you play. The New Family is available to anyone who wants to listen, read and enjoy. You can help simply by showing a friend how to subscribe and listen on their phone, or by asking them to \u003ca href=\"http://thenewfamily.com/weeknights\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003esign up to get our newsletter\u003c/a\u003e (they\u0027ll get a free e-book if they do). But if you find yourself inspired by our missions and able to help us get to the next level, please consider contributing a small amount each \nmonth toward the show and website. Maybe your parents always donated to PBS or TVO. This is a little like the 2016 version of that for smaller-scale creators. If you can spare $1, $3 or even a little more each month, you\u0027d blow my sleep-addled mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron you\u0027ll automatically get access to our member-only feed, where I intend to share some behind-the-scenes stuff, and at various support levels I\u0027ll be delivering bonus content like longer versions of some of our most interesting interviews.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading and listening, and for taking the time to learn a little bit more about The New Family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrandie Weikle\u003cbr\u003eHost, \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-new-family-podcast/id1041865350\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe New Family Podcast\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEditor \u0026amp; Publisher, \u003ca href=\"http://thenewfamily.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe New Family\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
