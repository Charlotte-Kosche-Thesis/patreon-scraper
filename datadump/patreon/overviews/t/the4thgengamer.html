Patreon is a much more reputable way to support my content and also makes it easier for me to thank whoever supports me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimilar to Twitch subscriptions, Patreon runs payments on a per-month basis, and with that come perks! What is different from Twitch subscriptions, is that there is a much greater level of customization as to the perks of contributing (and the amount). As I become more familiar with Patreon, I will look to add plenty of rewards for giving back to my efforts on Twitch and YouTube! Feel free to suggest ideas to me as well, I\u0027d love to thank you in the best way possible, thanks for reading! :)"
