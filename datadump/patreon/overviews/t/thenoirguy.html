I make comics, boardgames, illustrations, and animations. Currently, I create a webcomic called \u003ca href=\"http://www.dimestorenoir.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDime-Store Noir\u003c/a\u003e. I even do other cool stuff, like sketches and illustrations. I keep those \u003ca href=\"http://thenoirguy.blogspot\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eon my blog\u003c/a\u003e. I have had the opportunity to get some of my stuff published in \u2018zines, too \u2013 like \u003ca href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/lqDu\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFlushed\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/itsjustagamevol3\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIt\u0027s Just a Game Vol. 3\u003c/a\u003e. If you wanna do the social media rounds, I\u2019m active daily on \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/thenoirguy\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://thenoirguy.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/thenoirguy\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e. I love drawing comics and would like to be able to do more, which would be completely possible if my Patron campaign here experiences some success!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY DO YOU NEED A PATREON? AREN\u0027T YOU RAKIN\u2019 IN THE DOUGH ON THAT SWEET, SWEET COMICS TRAIN!?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHey now, let\u2019s take it down a notch there. I am doing a Patreon because I\u0027ve been actively looking for stable or permanent work in the art field since I graduated and earned my college degree, and I\u0027ve yet to find anything in those five years. (Hey, contact me if you know of an art studio hiring for my skillset!) I love making comics, and I want to do this professionally, long term. This Patreon, if successful, will help me become self-sufficient. Now, I\u0027m not living on the street looking for my next meal. I\u0027m privileged enough to be living with family at the moment, which covers most of my expenses. But having this Patreon will allow me to give more attention to comic and personal projects, rather than tackling a chain of freelance projects ad infinitum. This Patreon holds the potential to pay for art supplies, classes, loan repayment, convention wares and tables, and even self-published books! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u0027s hard to work on comics full time when you\u0027re constantly looking for work, be it permanent or freelance. I want to make a living off my own art. It seems crazy to me that because artists like what they do, the social standard of belief is that they don\u0027t deserve to get paid for their services. That just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. What about you, do you like my art? Want to support me in my quest to live by doing what I love and see my degree put to good use? Consider becoming my Patreon patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOh great, now I have to PAY for your comics? I THOUGHT WEBCOMICS WERE FREE!?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHey, now, never fear! My webcomics will always be free. This does not mean I will suddenly start charging for my webcomics. All it means is that if you like what I do, and you are able, you might consider supporting me by signing up for a monthly contribution to my cause. Patreon allows you to set a monthly limit, if you decide to lend me your support. You can\u2019t? No big deal! Though, I gotta say, I offer some pretty cool perks for my supporters, like previews and secret sketches and even some custom artwork!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWell that\u0027s alright, I guess. But why are you doing the monthly model instead of the project model, HUH!?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI chose the monthly model mostly because I post stuff so frequently. If you\u0027re a fan of mine, you know I post sketches all the time and try to post something EVERY WEEKDAY. Right now, I post two pages of Dime-Store Noir when a story is running. With your help, Dime-Store Noir could be made to run PERMANENTLY with no hiatuses! And I\u2019d be able to do more new comics in general! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhoa, whoa, whoa! MORE COMICS? Are you INSANE!?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI AM having a full conversation with some pretty confrontational bolded text, so insanity is a possibility, I suppose. BUT ANYWAY, if this Patreon campaign builds enough support, I\u2019ll be thrilled to do more! If I hit one of my support goals, I would love to bring back my silly comic \u003cem\u003eThe Adventures of Purple Boy and Turquoise Girl\u003c/em\u003e, which you can read in full in its current stage \u003ca href=\"http://pbandtg.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eon its Tumblr\u003c/a\u003e. And hey, maybe I can do even MORE crazy stuff! Like new \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps2V0ZRLbr4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBrother Rabbit animations\u003c/a\u003e! I might even revive \u003ca href=\"http://radiogame.podbean.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRadiogame Theatre\u003c/a\u003e, or make some nifty noir \u003ca href=\"http://ricketyrat.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eboard games\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWell that sounds great and all, but WHAT DO I GET OUT OF IT!?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAll sorts of things! There are greater perks for higher contribution levels, of course. For starters, you get access to my Activity Stream, with exclusive sketches, ideas, and previews; you could also snag some freebies or a chance for me to review a movie of your choosing; also up for grabs is early access to full comics, custom artwork, and even guest stardom in one of my upcoming comics! Even if you can\u0027t donate right now, my webcomics, illustrations and reviews are available, now and always, COMPLETELY FOR FREE!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUPDATE: I know have a few boardgames I\u0027m working on regularly, so this patreon will also help cover that. As a bonus, Patrons will get updates on boardgames I\u0027m working on, sketches and graphics, and even print and play versions of early builds! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks a lot for reading, and thanks for your support! I am really excited for this opportunity to create more comics for myself and for you great people to enjoy. So consider helping me out if you can, and be sure to tell your friends!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
