    "summary": "Kade Wells and Sarah Roman are two high school English teachers who spend a lot of time working to breathe new life into the authors found in standard English class curriculum. For the past five years,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rhSAvGbQLU\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSarah had worked to integrate microcomputers and microcontrollers into her\u00a0room, creating high-tech projects based off\u00a0of the readings\u003c/a\u003e. On the other end,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/dd-classroom\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKade has been tirelessly working to incorporate Dungeons and Dragons into his room from the get-go\u003c/a\u003e. Both have had success in their rooms with instruction designed around experimental learning and are looking to really push the proverbial envelope with what is possible with their students.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2017,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.wizards.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWizards of the Coast\u003c/a\u003e put Kade and Sarah in contact with one another, as both were employing the use of the roleplaying game in their classes. With Kade teaching 9th grade and Sarah teaching 11th and 12th, they have collective teaching experiences that range from special education courses, inclusion courses, honors courses, and advanced placement courses. For 2018 and beyond, Sarah and Kade are working to share their practices with the teaching community and build a network of educators who can rely on one another while trying out Dungeons and Dragons within the classroom. The game is a vast, highly mutable system, and they\u0027re aware that conversation is key in getting something like this off the ground.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uegiwrB-8_s\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJumping out of the third person, we\u0027ve had our students create characters and immerse themselves into the campaigns we\u0027ve created that are based on\u00a0our texts.
