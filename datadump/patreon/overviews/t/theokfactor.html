We are a new-classical crossover duo dedicated to expanding the traditional boundaries of our instruments and sharing the joy we find in creating and writing our own music with our listeners. Educational outreach is also a big part of who we are. We conduct workshops and clinics to inspire young musicians to take their classical foundation and run with it! Above all, we write music with the hope that our listeners will hear their story told through our original compositions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon allows multiple patrons from far and wide to help support ours and many others\u0027 artistic vision. Whether you\u0027re donating $1 or $1000, \u003cem\u003eyour support is felt and makes a difference\u003c/em\u003e in our musical career. Studio expenses are increasing, as is the cost to put together a tour. Additionally, streaming services are the main way that people access music today (us included!), and merch sales are declining. But our goals and aspirations are not!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea behind Patreon is that many hands make light work - with your support, we don\u0027t have to choose which of our projects come to fruition and which do not. We can aim ever higher and achieve so much more partnered with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does your contribution help? \u003cbr\u003eYour monthly contribution directly funds the daily workload that helps us share our music with the world. \u003c/strong\u003eOne of the big reasons to become a Patron is to get an inside-look at what we\u0027re up to on a weekly basis. Some of our time is spent answering emails, updating our calendar and maintaining the \u0027business\u0027 side of our musical career (which is not terribly exciting, but necessary!)...the rest of the time we\u0027re \u003cstrong\u003epracticing, writing new music, giving workshops to students, transcribing our original music, and much more. These are the things we want to share with you!\u003c/strong\u003e As a direct financial supporter, you have every right to know exactly what we\u0027re doing with your money, and you can expect weekly updates, videos, rehearsal clips, and photos that will show you just that. \u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll also know that, no matter the amount of your contribution:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027re making art happen. You\u0027re helping us create. You are a big part of why we do what we do, and why we are able to do it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo much goes into making this career a viable one and we truly thank each and every one of you for taking us one step further.

     "about": "Classically trained musicians from the Midwest, cellist Olivia Hahn and violinist Karla Dietmeyer began collaborating in 2012 while pursuing their Bachelor of Arts degrees in music performance. They joined forces with the goal of creating musical experiences that would challenge their formal training.\u003cbr\u003eThe result of this collaboration is The OK Factor, a duo experimenting in a number of genres, including bluegrass, jazz and popular music. Self-described as an alternative folk duo, they possess a unique and original sound, occasionally expanded by their collaboration with multi-instrumentalist Ehler Orngard. The OK Factor uses their instruments as vehicles for creative and innovative musical thinking, writing primarily original music. They also arrange traditional tunes, embedding fragments of folk music into their own compositions.\u003cbr\u003eThe OK Factor\u2019s passion for music has captivated audiences on a variety of stages and venues across the Midwest and Southeast. In addition to writing/composing and performing, they are equally passionate about music education. They conduct workshops at all grade levels, where they teach and encourage young string players to view their instruments and formal training in new and exciting ways. Olivia and Karla believe sharing their love of music is a way for them to give back, displaying their appreciation for living a life of performing and composing.\u003cbr\u003e",
