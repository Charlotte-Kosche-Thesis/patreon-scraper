I have a B.A. in Theatre Studies and my passion is to perform to people. I love to entertain people and I strive to make people smile everyday!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to the Furry Fandom, I am now an active Youtuber, with almost 1,000 subscribers and currently 24 videos (both livestreams and original content) to watch on my channel:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://t.co/X8lYKxTDQE\"\u003eyoutube.com/c/TimustheFox\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou guys are awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTELqabV4AAbeqL.jpg:large\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTimus the Fox at Midwest Furfest 2017 (Chicago, IL)\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why did I decide to open up a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHonestly, I am very passionate about my work in the Fandom, to the point where I have reached a point in my life where I consider this Fandom to be a part of my career. I am an entertainer, a performing artist, an actor, and the fandom, with my fursuit, allows me to pursue my dream of being a professional performer. This is not to say that I have not explored other places, I have been in a handful of stage shows, even having been a performer for Seaworld Parks \u0026amp; Entertainment in Central Florida for some time; however, I strongly believe that there is potential in fursuiting being an actual job, much like how a costumed performer at Disney World is considered a job. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows me to reach out to my audience, reach out to you, the individual, to help me out, and in return I give you some awesome rewards! You guys are awesome and I love interacting with each and every single one of you.
