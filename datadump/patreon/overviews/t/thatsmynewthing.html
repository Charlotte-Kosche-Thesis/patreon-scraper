We can buy actual professional microphones, a camera, and a mixer, which will really give our podcasts and videos that professional-ish touch. Picture it: crisp audio, a beautiful green screen, and the sexy visuals of Halynka and Kingsley arguing about soup or jaywalking or whatever... Doesn\u0027t that sound AMAZING?!",

Just imagine SEEING the aging bodies of Kingsley and Halynka trembling under the studio lights! It\u0027s almost too amazing to handle. At this tier we will also be hiring additional contributors to expand the world of That\u0027s My New Thing, with informational/comedic blogs and videos. Meaning Kingsley and Halynka will be graduating to the level of boss-bitches. You guys, I think we can ALL agree that\u0027s the REAL goal here!",
