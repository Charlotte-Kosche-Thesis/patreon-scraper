White Noise is a long-form webcomic about a small band of monsters trying to make their way in a difficult world--it\u0027s a story about making your own family and thriving with them even in the face of great struggle. If you like monsters, queer characters, or queer monsters, this is the comic for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhite Noise has been running since 2011, and updates once weekly. The comic will always be free to read online, but creating it is a lot like a part time job! With your pledge, you\u0027d be supporting a queer artist in doing more than just paying for web hosting--Patreon enables me to attend conventions, send comics to print, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeed to get a hold of me outside Patreon?
