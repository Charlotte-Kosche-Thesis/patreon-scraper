    "summary": "When I began The South Lawn back in 2013, I never imagined that anyone would actually read what I had to say. After all, Southern politics -- and Southern socialism, in particular -- was not a particularly hot topic to discuss. Well, that is unless some politician said something unbelievably racist or misogynist; then we would be the butt of a few more jokes before people went back to forgetting about us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut that was before the UAW lost in Chattanooga. That was before DSA has founded chapters in places like Tuscaloosa and Tallahassee. And that was before communists yanked down a Confederate statue in Durham. Through writing about issues that matter in places such as these, I have been blessed to be featured in The Guardian, Jacobin, and In These Times. To say that this is a shock to me would be a bit of an understatement, but I am thankful every single day for the opportunities that I have been given.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to keep writing about issues that matter to the working class in the South. I want to keep up the discussion that I joined in 2013, but the truth of the matter is that I am a broke graduate student struggling to get by. I love to read, to learn, to teach, to think, and to write. This is why I am coming to you -- the folks who have supported me throughout this journey -- for assistance in keeping this endeavor going. I want to build The South Lawn into something that makes as much of an impact in the way we see our neighbors, our communities, our cities, and our world as I possibly can. I want to write about the things that are actually important to communities like Norfolk or Savannah without the stultifying filter of mainstream media\u2019s received opinions and common sense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, most importantly, I want this blog to be a place that serves as a home for liberatory thought and solidarity for all those who are oppressed, repressed, and marginalized. Because if we are to win, then we must win together, marching arm-in-arm towards emancipation. And if I make an impact on the outlook of politics in this country in even a minor way, I am happy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that you will join us in this effort and support it through donations. I can never say this enough, but thank you for the last four years of support. It means everything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u2019s continue the fight, and let\u0027s get free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Douglas"
