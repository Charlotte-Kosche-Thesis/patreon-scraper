We have been filming The Union Series every week for most of the last two years, have some really big plans for the future, and we are asking you to be a part of it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSterling Union, LLC is an independent production group consisting of Michigan based actors and producers. As the only State in the Union without a film office, the decimation of the Hollywood film industry in Michigan has laid all to bear for those of us who choose to stay in Michigan and pursue our creative aspirations through film - by the lint of our pockets. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe gather every week outside of our jobs, families, and schooling to write and shoot scenes within The Union story created by Jamal Hines. It is a wonderful challenge not without pain and frustration. But the reward of being able to entertain you while practicing our crafts is worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been very fortunate to be able to create an intriguing and intense series that people actually watch, but we\u0027re never satisfied to settle where we\u0027re at. We always want to continue to grow and expand, whether it be upgrading equipment, gas money, special effects, renting filming locations, etc. in order to bring you better and better stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t expect or assume anyone will contribute to our ambitious project any more than simply watching our show. We appreciate that by itself. But if you feel like contributing more, whether a little or a lot, it\u0027ll all go back into creating more episodes. \u00a0And, as always, you are invited to join in the story through contributing ideas or participating in the the production itself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you and enjoy the show!\u003cbr\u003eJack Michael Findley\u003cbr\u003eXP/Michael Owens\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Union Story:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything is Earned Through Blood\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePower: the only currency in the Detroit underground. Everyone desires it; few will acquire it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a generation there has been a secret alliance between the major families in the city. In the streets it is known only as The Union. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Union has controled the drug and gun trade for a generation and is the only law in the Detroit underworld. It has guided politicians and business leaders from behind the curtain; shaping the entire state. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut no one stays on top forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter her father\u0027s sudden illness Stella Galdwin, heir to the Galdwin Empire, is forced to work with her most fierce rival, her younger sister Claire Galdwin. The two must put years of bad blood behind them and protect their family legacy at all cost as the family is under siege from both its enemies and its allies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Black Order Crew, run by the gang patriarch Joseph \u201cKing Leo\u201d Grove and his adopted son Marco Paige, have maintained order in the streets of Detroit for almost twenty years. Seeing their long-time allies the Galdwin family and the rest of the Union benefit from the efforts of the BOC over the years, The Black Order Crew has now set their sights on higher aspirations. But their foundation is built of sand as secrets from the past threaten to bring everything down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA new threat has silently emerged\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlma Graza, leader of the Los Cuchillo Largos Cartel, slowly emerges to become a major player in the city backed by her mysterious employer known only as Theresa, a young woman with deeper roots in Detroit\u0027s past then anyone can imagine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLoyalty will be tested and bonds broken. At the end of the day there can be only one family at the very top of Detroit."
