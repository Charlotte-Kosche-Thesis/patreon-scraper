TSD is in the making for the past year and a half, on my spare time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTSD is a Single Player Open World RPG and the target platform is Steam (PC) and maybe some console later down the road.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy initial thinking is to have Patreon rewards to give access to monthly/weekly alpha stage of the game according to Patreon level, and higher level rewards that will include a subscription in hacknplan.com project planner so you can also get involved more and\u00a0influence the making of TSD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy I made this Campaign you ask...?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI m thinking about Patreon for a long time now, but last week something \"weird\" happened. \u003cbr\u003e2 months ago I applied for a Games Festival in my Country to introduce TSD for the first time, not hoping for much, suddenly I got an e-mail saying that application is accepted, my booth number and some details. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI panicked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut decided to give it a shot and for the purpose of the\u00a0event, I got a week off of my day-job\u00a0and started working on a demo. What I realized working full time is that I made so much more progress than I had the whole previous month, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe hard work paid off and the\u00a0event was a success, TSD featured on many local sites and streams, and people enjoyed playing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat clicked something and here I am, trying to make this full-time and create something spectacular with your help, not only financial-wise but also with ideas and influence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for considering becoming a Patron, and I will be as consistent as possible with updates and involvement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
