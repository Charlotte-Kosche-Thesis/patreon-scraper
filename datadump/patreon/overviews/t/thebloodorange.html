     "about": "I am a twenty-four year old, married man from Southern Illinois, now living in Dallas, TX. I began \u003cstrong\u003eThe Blood Orange Project \u003c/strong\u003eafter dealing with\u00a0twelve hard months of confusing and complicated emotions. These emotions were brought on by the events that transpired in the winter of 2016 when\u00a0I met my biological father, really, for the first time. My dad contacted me through the internet to let me know that he was dying from Lung Cancer, and that he had not be given very much time to live - just 4 months from August. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat he didn\u0027t know was that I had already been making plans to visit him once I graduated college in the spring of 2017. After 20 years of no communication, I had decided that I wanted to try and mend whatever may have been broken between us. That he was dying meant two things: 1) I didn\u0027t have as much time as I thought I had, and 2) there wouldn\u0027t be much follow up if we are able to heal our relationship. I had one chance, and it was quickly approaching.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough a generous gift from who was, at that time, a stranger, but is now a friend, I, my wife, and my two younger twin brothers were able to fly from Dallas to Seattle, to have the chance to finally meet dad. The fear that set in as our plane landed at the SEATAC airport was crippling as I tried to carry my bags through the terminal. I, and my brothers, were about to meet our dad for the first time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe spent 5 days together. It was a wonderful week. We talked; we laughed; we shot skeet; we ate lunch on a ship docked in the\u00a0Strait of Juan de Fuca. Many hours were spent quietly playing chess and drink hot coffee, as well. Those times were as pleasant as all the others - maybe more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the last day, as he was dropping us off back at the airport, he put his arm around me and my brother Chase. With wet eyes, he gave a look to Chris, who soon joined us in a huddle in the middle of SEATAC security. As tears ran down his thin, weathered face, looking at each of us, in a scratchy voice he said, \"I\u0027m sorry I wasn\u0027t there for you boys. This has been the best week of my life.\" We each told him we loved him - something none of us knew we would say before this trip.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter returning to Dallas, we spent another week at home before we left again, this time for Illinois to visit family for Christmas. During this time, I found out that my aunt had beeb diagnosed with brain cancer, and, at that time, had nine brain tumors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was one hit after the next. While I had reconciled what was essentially a non-existent relationship with my dad, the thought of his impending death squelched any bit of euphoria that could be enjoyed in this thought. And now, I find out my aunt, a woman whom I love very much, is beginning what would become a terrible battle with cancer. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe coming months would be the most confusing, frustrating, and complex times of my life to date. I did not know how I was supposed to feel about these things. I was looking for answer, as anyone would, but came up with nothing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spent the subsequent Sunday afternoon Skyping with dad as his cancer progressed and he became more and more weak. I also made two trips back to Illinois to be with my family, and to be my aunt, Nana, who also began declining very rapidly. It was awful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn May of 2017, I took a trip to Montreal, Canada. I was completing the last requirement to graduate. The first morning after landing, I received a text saying that dad had died just a few hours before. I was tracking his and my aunt\u0027s progress very closely, and I feared that one of them might pass while I was gone. Little did I know at the time, just 4 days later, I would get another text saying that my aunt just a few hours before. The nightmare happened, except it wasn\u0027t a dream. I was far away, in a strange place, without my family, while people I loved had died. I didn\u0027t know what to do, how to feel, or what to say.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is when I found what would end up helping me most. It was when I stopped looking for answers, and just started venting about how pissed, and sad, and confused I was about everything going on. I found that when I let my frustrations out by telling the stories of what was happening, and not looking for answers, or anyone to help me, I felt a little better. It was as if the problems were going away. But it did have therapeutic effect on me. It was as if I finally naming the grief provided some sort of relief. Moreover, in my conversation with different people, I learned that other people had tragedies of their own that they are wading through. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was after a few of these conversations that I realized the importance of discussion. We simply do not talk about the parts of life that are hard enough. These conversations helped me more than anything else I tried during the last 12 months. Our stories are wrought with grief and heartache. Ignoring that fact makes us emotionally isolated, and emotional isolation is just as dangerous as physical isolation. \u003cstrong\u003eThe Blood Orange Project\u003c/strong\u003e is my answer to this problem. In The Blood Orange Blogs, I write about my relationship with my dad. In The Blood Orange Podcast, I host a guest who talks about their own personal struggle, tragedy, or heartache that they have gone through, or are currently going through.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can put out more content, more frequently, in order to start a movement where we address the problems in our lives instead of hiding them. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came up with a slogan for The Blood Orange Project that encapsulates all we aim to do: \"When life is confusing, is when life is normal. Let\u0027s talk about it.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
