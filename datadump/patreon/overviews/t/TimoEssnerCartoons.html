The learning\n phase is long and hard, until you reach a point of actual, serious and \nprofessional work. What\u0027s often forgotten is, that by paying for a piece\n of art, you\u0027re not only paying for the materials used and maybe some of the working hours\n - but also rewarding the artist for keeping on through all the unpaid \nyears of learning and trying, mistakes and failure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution helps me to make a living without worrying about the basic spendings for a living: food, rent, insurance. I highly appreciate even a small support for my work. The eventual goal is to be able to create with a mind freed from worrying about these basic needs. Trust me - that\u0027s a high stake to take!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAbout me\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a \u003cstrong\u003emid-thirty German cartoonist\u003c/strong\u003e, commenting in colors on subjects and matters ranging from politics \u0026amp; economics to cultural phenomena, latest news, memes and gags. Some of my cartoons are rather serious, some are plain stupid - which certainly calls for more laughs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was \u003cstrong\u003eborn and raised\u003c/strong\u003e in the North of Germany, in a district called Angeln. That\u0027s actually where the Anglo-Saxons came from a loooong time ago; they later became known as the British people, but the British today are not too happy to hear something about that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the usual start with two \u003cem\u003e(then)\u003c/em\u003e awful older brothers, some parents that I certainly didn\u0027t choose by myself, \u003cstrong\u003eschool \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(don\u0027t get me started!)\u003c/em\u003e, and the unbearable phase they call \u0027puberty\u0027, I went on with my life trying to study at a \u003cstrong\u003ecollege \u003c/strong\u003ein Denmark, dropped that to work in some good, some okay, and a lot of really effing bad \u003cstrong\u003ejobs \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(and I can\u0027t believe the conditions that are out there, what a disgrace for a civilized country after the 1800s!)\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides that, I always - \u003cstrong\u003eand that\u0027s the only constant thing in my life\u003c/strong\u003e - painted, wrote a little, made plastiques, and last but not least drew cartoons. I actually started drawing when I was 12 and later on became a little famous after a little appreciated cartoon of the high school\u0027s principal, painted meters high in the school garage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, I\u0027m on a good way to \u003cstrong\u003emake a living from drawing cartoons\u003c/strong\u003e - but not quite yet. That\u0027s why now, after some years of training, building up a work environment for a professional flow, and collecting some five hundred good cartoons, I feel ready to ask the community out there to support me - and actually can give something interesting in return!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI\u0027d love to upload a video, but my accent is horrible and I feel like I need to practice English a little before doing so. As soon as I figured out, what to say and how to speak clearly and understandable, I\u0027ll be back with a clip.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport me to create\u003c/strong\u003e and I will do, what I like and do best:\u003cbr\u003eDraw funny, deep, thinkful and / or just crazy stuff to lighten your day!\u003cbr\u003e"
