    "summary": "The Training Cycle educator workshop trains people who teach in both the corporate and non-profit sectors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been training adult educators for close to 20 years in corporate, non-profit,  the film  industry, aviation, and scuba. I guide instructor trainers to apply building block education techniques in their curriculum. These include creating \u201ccommon ground\u201d with your students, using levels of learning to avoid \u201cover-teaching,\u201d and keeping focused on the classical definition of education: to create a change in behavior in your students.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTraditionally I have taught this program in person, either in a classroom setting or via web conference. But now, with Patreon, I can bring this training program to you on a monthly subscription basis via the web. Each month you\u0027ll get a video that contains a new chapter from The Training Cycle corporate trainer workshop. If you move up in levels, you\u0027ll also receive carefully crafted exercises and additional content that will guide you to become the best educator you can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the amazing things about The Training Cycle instructor trainer workshop is that it works in any industry or company. The program is about how to teach, not about teaching your specific intellectual property. The workshop will give you the tools you need to communicate your specific information in an orderly, easy to understand fashion. The employees and clients you train will have an exceptionally high retention rate and a clear understanding of how to properly teach your material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe complete program consists of 14 chapters spread over four units:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnit 1\u003cbr\u003eIntroduction \u2013 Registration, Why This Class, Daily Schedule\u003cbr\u003eSeparating Teaching Techniques from the IP You Are Teaching\u003cbr\u003eEducation \u2013 A Change in Behavior\u003cbr\u003eThe Path to Mastery \u2013 Discover, Train, Practice, Teach\u003cbr\u003eCreating Common Experience\u003cbr\u003eBuilding Block Techniques\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnit 2\u003cbr\u003eLevels of Learning - Rote, Understanding, Application, Correlation\u003cbr\u003eTesting Student Comprehension\u003cbr\u003eTeaching Multi-Tasking\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnit 3\u003cbr\u003eOver-Teaching\u003cbr\u003eUsing Video \u2013 Teaching Out of the Box\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnit 4\u003cbr\u003eClarity and Abstractions\u003cbr\u003eUse Your Stories\u003cbr\u003eConclusion\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Latte Level subscription \u2013 the same price as a Starbucks soy latte \u2013 gives you access to all the current content and the new videos and blogs added weekly and monthly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Workshop Level subscription gives you the complete, two-day Training Cycle workshop, either online or in person.
