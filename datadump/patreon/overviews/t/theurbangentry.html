As the channel grows and becomes more of a viable alternative to the compromised industry big guys, maintaining my independence, integrity and protecting it is key! Like most things in this world, it is a question of money. I despise asking for money, I am fiercely independent in everything I do and even consider it some what vulgar However I understand some of you might be willing to assist directly to further the channel. With your support, skies the limit and I promise to put as much as I can into the channel.\u003cbr\u003eThank you from the bottom of my heart, onwards and ever upwards!\u003cbr\u003eTGV\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "This a lifestyle, horology and culture channel inspired by the loves and passions of its host TGV.  Known affectionately by his closest fans as \"The Governor\", TGV was born in London, the son of a British aristocrat and an Italian doctor. He was raised in both countries and has traveled extensively to many exciting international cities. While studying in Florence, Italy, he fell in love with a New Yorker, and subsequently moved to New York City where he currently resides and works in music, film production and audio engineering.   From the sophistication, prestige and heritage of the British establishment to the rich dolce vita of gritty, working class neighbourhoods of Italian tenements, TGV has had access to two exciting and polar opposite worlds. This has given TGV a truly unique insight and refreshing outlook on life, style and culture.  Welcome to the Urban Gentry Channel.",
