I\u0027m seventeen years old and i dropped out of highschool because i didn\u0027t function well in a public school environment. My family never really had the money for private school and any chance at college is looking slimmer and slimmer. I first started writing poetry when i was about thirteen years old. I started writing because it was cathartic. And i simply wrote because it made me feel better about things. I never pictured myself doing it my whole life. But as i started to write more and more. I fell more and more in love with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t consider myself stupid. I suppose that\u0027s the first thing someone assumes of me when i tell them i dropped out of high school. I try my hardest to educate myself in any way that i can, my family is working to keep food on the table so i usually don\u0027t get a lot of help. But may this page be proof of the effort i am putting into my future. I have many goals and many dreams in life and i hope this page can be the spark that ignites the flame.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a few of my poems for public display so you can get an idea of my work. But i will be posting exclusive poems specifically for my patrons as well.\u003cbr\u003e"
