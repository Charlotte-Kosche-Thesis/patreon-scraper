He became known by\nvarious names to many cultures. Alexander the Great, Winston Churchill,\nPitbull. And yet, he was cursed with loneliness. He needed a friend.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLogan Butterscotch was orphaned\nafter the Duke and Duchess of Wimbdybrook were run off the road by radical\nparties. Found in the wreckage, Logan was adopted by humble railway bandits,\nand later came to lead the ruffians. After being bested by a bogey train, Logan\nrealized he could, instead, do good for the world, and he couldn\u2019t do it alone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLogan and Joe first met in a Neo-Rustic coffee\nshop, and after fighting over the last Splenda pack, they both knew they were\ndestined to work together. The world\u2019s greatest partnership was born.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe\nMarquee: What We Do When Not Vanquishing Evil Forces\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Marquee Podcast came about because of our\nsheer love for good movies and the joy of hating bad ones. We\nwanted to create a community similar to a book club, but with 100% less paper\ncuts and 90% less reading. Movies on Netflix were the perfect answer. Each\nweek, we pick something new to enjoy or enrage, and get to dig deeper into big\ntopics and stupid jokes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe freaking love what we do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMoving forward, we want to spread the love of\nfilm to everyone we can, and our podcast is just the start. Let\u2019s bring this\ndiscussion to our loved ones, coworkers, and even that barista who gives you\nattitude because you happen to come in right at the end of his shift. That\u2019s\nwhere you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eCapitalism,\nBut It\u2019s Chill, Ya Know?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAsking for any amount of money is a big deal,\nand we get that. We all have bills to pay, on top of our Netflix subscriptions.\nWe want to keep our asking prices small, while giving back with offers worth\nway more than what you\u2019re putting in. Community discussions, monthly\nlivestreams, and even helping us pick the next movie! We want to engage with\nall of you, and have some fun doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe want to assure you that your donations aren\u2019t\ngoing to a Scrooge McDuck money pit that we swim in all day. The money we\nreceive goes right back into running and improving the podcast, website, and\ncommunity. We need to pay for hosting, equipment, bargain bulk coffee to get us\nthrough late nights of editing, and advertising to bring in even more\nlisteners. Your donations go right back into making this experience better, for\nyou, for us, and for others.Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
