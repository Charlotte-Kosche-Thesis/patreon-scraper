    "summary": "Let\u0027s face it! Everyone loves seeing characters in books and movies that resemble themselves. Every African and African American adult and child never outgrows this basic desire to have their image represented with  dignity, intelligence and beauty as well. But the Fact is that  \u003cdiv\u003eALTering\u003cbr\u003e history ..\u003cbr\u003eto\u003cbr\u003e ... Not ...include us is real so  ..\u003cbr\u003e WE ...must be the ones to place us back In! Especially in the most amazing book ever written or read ..\u003cbr\u003eThe Bible! All mankind began in, and the garden of Eden was in Africa.  So, what\u0027s the fuss? Power! Economic, political and social. How?  Secretly it\u0027s Psychology. If the scriptures DESCRIBE deity (God) as  looking Dark Brown with \u0027 wooly\u003cbr\u003e hair\u0027 but inside as you read it you view paintings and drawings that doesn\u0027t show the creator\u0027s image that way, you believe your eyes and your mind considers it proof. Not many media organizations teach artists the finer methods of drawing the things that make Black people unique and attractive as the  scriptures does. In His Holy Word our hair is  \"\u003cbr\u003ewooly\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003e but a certain group has it labeled as  \"\u003cbr\u003e nappy \"\u003cbr\u003e .\u003cbr\u003e I personally prefer The lovely way my Lord refers to us and not the one that has been created and used to rig our minds to defer and believe in the myth of inferiority which gives away and doesn\u0027t teach us we can  and should Protect our power. The textures of our hair, the amazing  variety of our skin tones from delicately and deliciously dark skinned  to bleached out Albino. We span the full spectrum and we NEED to see it! Have you noticed that even our youth\u0027s physical shapes increase the  sales and value of name brand items they wear. But, we have very few  artists who draw each hue and feature lovingly for the esteem of our  children and young adults. Would you like and support someone like that?  What if they also are  experts in animation and is an amazing illustrator currently developing  books who specialize in drawing Black and Brown people of African  descent in ways that make you and your child proud enough to inspire a  generation? Well, become a patron. Being a patron for FAR less than a  ..\u003cbr\u003e monthly... combo meal ($3) can make that a reality. You can also ask questions,  create polls and be mentored live on any topic and see the amazing  variety of techniques I use in messages and art to uplift our spirits!   We need you as our heroes and  sheroes\u003cbr\u003e to become a partner and warrior in helping offset centuries of  drawings, photos, movies and animation that doesn\u0027t depict us humanely and Especially delete or distort our role in the ancient days of the  scripture!  Please make history and become one of the pioneers that will actually  help inspire youth to look at themselves with respect (without  self love\u003cbr\u003e you can not share love) and aspire to be limitless in their future  profession(s) while reminding the world of our humanity. So, Let\u0027s do  this! You\u0027ll see, it\u0027s FUN! Click to start right now.   Patreon\u003cbr\u003e .com/ TBFMinistries\u003c/div\u003e"

     "about": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhen\n I was a boy, like most children, I was quite taken by \ncartoon animation. It was a world of magic to see artwork move, react, \nspeak, make you want to laugh or cry.  But my fascination was on a whole\n other level! Because when I tried my hand at \u0027sketches\u0027 ...well...mine \nwould never do that! *//@##!!, I thought to myself! ( i cartoon cussed \nquietly in my head so nobody could hear me)  Why didn\u0027t it move or \nspeak? It was a big mystery to me (remember I was a boy).  I wondered if\n I was ever going to be either smart enough to reproduce this magic or \nhave someone help me get the \u0027training\u0027.  Turns out I had the smarts but\n no help. (My folks were po\u0027.) So, for decades my parents, especially \nmom, encouraged me to continue drawing because they were amazed at how \nmuch it improved in such a short time. (But quite frankly, I think they \nwere simply hoping for some rebate for their investment.) But \nlife happens ( especially in the pre-internet days ) and I was often \ndistracted by needing an occasional sandwich and hygiene product, etc. \nAlso, fighting against open air living (homelessness) was \na constant struggle no matter what job I had. Oddly the first and only \ntime I was actually homeless was when I decided to drive over a hundred \nmiles to train for a government job where I knew no one and was broke. \n(my car was my home for a couple months.Which was great for my posture \nat 6 feet tall in a 1997 Honda civic) A life altering injury some years \ninto the position caused me to lose this job but it did award me \na modest pension that allowed me some time to share with my mom in her \nlast years of life. She was such a tough, funny, gentle soul who taught \nme by example to: take life seriously ... not yourself. And to treat \npeople the way you want to be treated (Matthew 7:12). My parents \nseparated at some point and recently the saddest moments of my life came\n when my dad\u0027s health got so bad he placed himself in a nursing home. \nThis affected mom tremendously, so, I plotted bringing him back in town \nto be with her but he died before I could get anything in motion (he had\n Parkinson\u0027s). I had to give her the sad news. She did not take it well \nand was at the beginning stage of Alzheimer\u0027s. She died a couple months \nlater. The last person to show and give me unconditional love was gone. I\n thought I would never recover. Shortly before she passed I recalled \nhow, in a rare moment of clarity she saw some of my \nstoryboarding/animation and made me promise to continue in it. It was \none of the last things I was to hear her say with verbal clarity because\n a few years earlier she suffered a stroke that took almost all of her \nspeech. I was fortunate to be by her side when she passed on. I\u0027m hoping\n my presence was the comfort she needed to feel comfortable enough to \nlet go. My vision is to reimagine major scenes of the scriptures with a \ndistinctly African perspective of Jesus the saviour to create a \nbeautifully animated series as online content. Currently I am \nlovingly illustrating a DVD documentary and book for my church that attempts to do that. I \nwill post scenes from it monthly for my patrons. If I get your patronage\n you will be able to get to know me and help me build my gospel \nanimation ministry so that I can hire more (currently I have 1 employee \nthat I pay from my truly modest pension).  Anyone who gives monthly will\n get either discounted or free copies of any of our work! Best of all, \nyou will know you invested in building a unique Africanized gospel \nanimation ministry seeking to save souls. And by doing so you will \nbe Literally investing in 100% returns for every soul saved by these \nmessages. Remember, wealth does exist in the afterlife (Matthew 6:19) \nAND there it can\u0027t be stolen, doesn\u0027t deplete in value and is Eternal! \nSo, Lets get this thing started, beloved! Part 1 of the documentary that Reveals the Original image of God, Why it changed using science, archeology as well as the holy scriptures is called: \"The Hidden Truth! Can The Ethiopian Change His Skin?\" IS NOW AVAILABLE @ Sellfy.com/TheBlackFiles as an easy PayPal secure download!\u00a0 All donations over $10 will get free shipping of the DVD.\u00a0 Meantime, May God Bless you \nas He has blessed me......... with you! \u003cbr\u003eThank you!
