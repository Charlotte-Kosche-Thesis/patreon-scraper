I\u0027m a girl who\u0027s thoroughly interested in bringing the world something that I feel as though it is seriously lacking -- explosions via the human body. Whether it be through water, slime, chemicals, pregnancy, air, gas, interdimensional transportation into the wrong place at the wrong time, or losing one\u0027s car keys, I have both a mind and a hand to give the world explosions through a variety of different means.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy be my Patron?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eMy primary goal is to give you, the fans, a cheaper alternative for you, the fans, to get their hands on my art. I understand that a lot of people who want bursting art, and a lot of people in general who have the thirst tend to not have the money. I\u0027m here to correct that -- though I still have to feed myself. I\u0027m going to try my very best to grant every Patron something special for granting me their extra efforts to show my love in kind, and hopefully with your influences we\u0027ll be able to fill the world with wonderful, glorious colors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the most part I am self-taught and work tirelessly on a daily basis to grant you, my most delightfully demented fans, all the inflammatory works that you so crave, even while juggling writing a Novel and a full-time job. Even so, I wish to dedicate myself to this passion of mine, and with the help of my most generous patrons, perhaps one day I\u0027ll be able to do this sort of work full-time.\u003cbr\u003e"

Expect many new things in the future!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNew equipment will be purchased and utilized, meaning much higher quality works moving forward, as well as newer and better services for me to be granting everyone else!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA very special on-running series will be placed in the works! And, it will be offered entirely for free, so even non-patrons will be able to receive it. But you better believe there\u0027ll be a credits page, with your names on it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e",
