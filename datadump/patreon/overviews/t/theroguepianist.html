My album, Dream, was nominated for \u0027Album of the Year\u0027 by one of the world\u0027s largest online piano radio stations,\u00a0Whisperings Solo Piano Radio, and my new composition,\u00a0Ascension, is currently in the running for the \u0027Contemporary Classical/Instrumental\u0027 genre in the Hollywood Music in Media Awards. My music has been played on domestic and international radio stations and is featured on Pandora Radio.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nI am dedicating my life to creating the BEST and most INSPIRED piano music I possibly can. \u00a0However, as an independent artist my budget is limited, making it difficult to get new projects off the ground. \u00a0I always believed that if I saved enough money, I could eventually fund my own projects. But with the new model of the current music industry, this has not been the case. There are so many musical projects I would like to do but am constrained by the realities of my budget. \u00a0I have realized that I can\u0027t do this on my own. In order to reach the level of success I hope for in my music career, I need a community of support behind me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in. \u00a0By pledging any amount, as low as a\u00a0dollar/month, you will become a part of the community I need! \u00a0By becoming a Patron, I will make music \u003cem\u003efor you\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003einspired by you\u003c/em\u003e. As a Patron, you will receive all of the music I have ever made and will make in the future. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever small or large your monthly contribution is,\u00a0my gratitude to you is truthfully beyond words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nXo, Kimberly\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
