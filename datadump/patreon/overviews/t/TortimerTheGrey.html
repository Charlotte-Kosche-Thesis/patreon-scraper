The  grey tortoise wanders here and there they say, playing video game favorites from yesterday and today! Tortimer the Grey is an online entertainer, doodler, \u0026amp; video game enthusiast, who strives to bring you quality, family-friendly, video game centered entertainment and expose you, the viewers, to present, and past, video game classics. He is a Christian, husband, full-time employee, and video game enthusiast who creates YouTube content, when he is able, for your enjoyment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003eWhy Support Tortimer the Grey?!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube is a hobby that I love but unfortunately it is not my job. On an average month, through YouTube ad revenue, I make less than $15, so I obviously work a full-time job and have to put my own money into everything I do for you guys. Despite my amateur status I always strive to run a professional channel and give you guys fun, consistent, entertainment with a message. I would love to enlist some talented artists to create more professional channel art and\u00a0I would also love to expand my channel\u00a0offerings but some of that will require some extra resources.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227,108,9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003eFirst off, my channel\u0027s main content is, and always will be, offered completely free of charge to you; Supporting me is neither mandatory, nor expected, to be one of my Whippersnappers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that said... I have created this Patreon page so that those of you who truly enjoy my content, and want to help support me on an ongoing basis, have an outlet to do so. Patreon allows you to create different levels for your Patrons, so that they can give as much or as little per month as they want, and in turn I can provide different rewards above and beyond my regular content. In addition to the specific rewards mentioned below those who support through Patreon also get access to Patron only areas and content (exclusive mini-series etc.). I thank you all in advance for your support in growing my channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always I have my Spreadshirt Shop, and Paypal links, in the description of every video if you would like to make a one time donation.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
