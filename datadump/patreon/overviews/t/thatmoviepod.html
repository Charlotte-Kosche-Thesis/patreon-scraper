In each episode, we tackle the hard topics, like, \"What is the meaning of life?\" and, \"How do we help end world hunger?\" and then we give up, start recording, and talk about movies! We get down to the nitty-gritty on this show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny donations received would get put right back into the show! Hopefully increasing the quality of our sound, and our guests! Weather it be better equipment, or computer programs, the goal of this Patreon campaign is to make a quality product that you can enjoy listening to! And wouldn\u0027t you feel great about yourself if you could tell your friends and family that you give to charity every month? Your mom would be so proud!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all honesty, we\u0027re super excited to be doing this show. We\u0027re a passionate group, and we care about our community. It might seem funny or pointless, but we feel that producing this podcast is our little way of making Fresno County a better place! Even if we can put a smile on one face in our area, that\u0027s an accomplishment!!!\u003cbr\u003e"
