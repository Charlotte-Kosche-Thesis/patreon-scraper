    "summary": "The Hero\u2019s Journey, as best\nexamined in Joseph Campbell\u2019s \u003cem\u003eThe Hero with a Thousand Faces, \u003c/em\u003eis a type\nof story with which we are all familiar. The tales of Beowulf, Luke Skywalker,\nHarry Potter, Gilgamesh, Moana, or Bilbo, and Frodo Baggins fill our\nbookshelves. Despite their formulaic nature, we celebrate these stories. They\ndraw us in with promises of adventure, self-discovery, and good triumphing over\nevil. We love to root for the underdog hero, and often see ourselves reflected in\ntheir nature and actions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eThe Sword of Light \u003c/em\u003eis one\nsuch story.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe genre of epic fantasy is\nrarely explored by female authors. The fact that I am a woman that will help\nset this story apart from other Hero\u2019s Journeys. I am a feminist, and as such,\nI have taken great pains to ensure a balanced and realistic representation of\nmen and women in this tale. There are both male and female characters who are\nstrong, capable, stern, and independent, and there are male and female\ncharacters who are submissive, shy, meek, and gentle. Neither gender is\novershadowed or sexualized in the story. Even though the point-of-view follows\nthe tale\u2019s hero, each character has their own unique part to play in the\nnarrative. For these reasons, I believe that this story will appeal to both\nmale and female readers in a genre that has, historically, been dominated by\nmale patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFurthermore, I have spent the\nbetter part of five years researching the Celts of Ancient Ireland, and have\nutilized their anthropology, religion, histories, folklore, and mythologies to\ncreate an authentic and interesting world in which to set this story. Many\nauthors use a world akin to Medieval Europe for the setting of their Hero\u2019s\nJourney. \u003cem\u003eThe Sword of Light \u003c/em\u003eis unique in that it uses a setting inspired\nby the Iron Age, and makes use of the shortcomings of the era and location. For\nexample, Ireland was not literate in 800BC, people from different tribes often\nspoke different dialects and were xenophobic. I utilize these cultural aspects\nto add a level of depth and conflict to a tale in which characters are forced\nto act diplomatically.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also feel that my\nqualifications as a writer will help set this story apart from other in the\ngenre. I have a BFA in Creative Writing from Southern New Hampshire University,\nbut I have been writing since 2005. Since I began writing, I have completed\nseveral self-published novels, including \u003cem\u003eTrials of the Guardians, The Star\nof Isa, Wolf Song, \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eThe Watch. \u003c/em\u003eWith each completed story, I have\nlearned more about the writing process, read guides, and taken classes to\nimprove my skills. I did not feel right penning \u003cem\u003eThe Sword of Light\u003c/em\u003e until I felt I could do it justice.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eThe Sword of Light \u003c/em\u003efollows\nFerin, the youngest son of the Chieftain of Loch Coill. Ferin\u2019s father resents\nhim for the death of his mother, who died in childbirth. As such, Ferin can do\nnothing to please or impress his father. When the High King of Hy-Brasile dies, the\ndruids of the land call a landsmeet to elect the next High King. Though Ferin\u2019s\nfather does not wish it, Ferin tags along.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFailed negotiations and\ndiplomacy have reached a boiling point when an ancient evil launches a surprise\nattack. It slaughters chieftains and chieftainesses and kidnaps many of the\norphaned royal children. After witnessing the death of his father and seeing\nhis only brother kidnapped, Ferin suffers a mental breakdown. He goes\ntemporarily insane and is forced to survive alone though the harsh winter.\nSoon, a nomadic tribe of warriors called The Free find Ferin and help nurse him\nback to mental health (or something like it). \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt is then that Ferin resolves\nto avenge his father and rescue his brother, but he will need help to do it.\nRelations between the many tribes of Hy-Brasile have never been friendly, and now\nwith a power vacuum causing disruption throughout the land, Ferin must unite\nthe tribes in order to face the elder evil plaguing their land, or lose it\nforever. To this end, civil wars must be put to rest, land treaties negotiated,\nmarriages arranged to secure ties to power, and the enemy surveyed. It is then\nthat Ferin learns the ancient evil\u2019s name, Balor, and its vile purpose\u2014to\npossess the body of one capable of wielding the Sword of Light, and use it to\nkill and usurp the Gods.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow Ferin must race Balor to\nthe Sword, and turn the blade against the elder evil in order to save his land,\nhis people, and his family.\u003cbr\u003e"
