    "summary": "Hello!\nWelcome to The Mental Breakdown, where we create podcasts and videos that\nprovide listeners and viewers with information, tips, and strategies for\nimproving their lives and maximizing their potential. We are doctoral level psychologists\nwith years of experience in working with children, teens, adults, couples,\nfamilies, and schools. Our goal at The Mental Breakdown is to translate complex\nmedical and psychological concepts into manageable bits of information that people\ncan understand and use.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are\nabout to begin the second phase of our online expansion that will include online\ncourses, workshops, webinars, and more. So join our community and help us put\nan end to the mental health stigma and help each other to live happier,\nhealthier lives!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\ndoes The Mental Breakdown do and what is Psychreg?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDr.\nBerney and Dr. Marshall are practicing psychologists based in central Florida.\nIn addition to their active clinical practice, they host The Mental Breakdown,\na six day per week podcast where issues related to mental health, education,\nparenting, relationships, and more are discussed and analyzed. Our Monday\nthrough Friday podcasts are generally short - 15-20 minutes - while the Saturday\npodcast may include long-form interviews or cover topics in need of more\nin-depth discussion. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll of\nour podcasts are posted on our website, on iTunes and Google Play Music; they\nare also posted as videos on YouTube. You can subscribe, follow, and/or like us\nthrough any or all of these sources to keep up to date with the latest\ninformation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn\nearly 2017, The Mental Breakdown joined with \u003ca href=\"http://psychreg.org/\"\u003ePsychreg.org\u003c/a\u003e, a UK-based website focused on bringing\ninformation from professionals all over the world to one place. Psychreg is\ngrowing at a staggering pace and Dr. Berney and Dr. Marshall were honored to be\nasked to host the Psychreg Podcast, a UK-based broadcast of The Mental\nBreakdown podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut we\nhave plans... Big plans.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAn\nenduring passion at The Mental Breakdown is teaching. To date, most of our\nteaching has been in more structured and traditional graduate and undergraduate\ncourses. However, we are about to expand our teaching opportunities to the web!\nWe are CEU providers in Florida for psychologists, school psychologists, LMHCs,\nLMFTs, and LCSWs. We can offer web-based CEUs that cover a range of topics from\nspecific mental health issues (i.e., ADHD, Autism, etc.) to more generalized\ntopics (i.e., personality theory, parenting, etc.). \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn\naddition to offering formal courses for professionals needing CEUs, we plan to\ncreate therapy-like courses for individuals who are seeking support and assistance.\nEarlier this year, we produced our first course, Parenting Your ADHD Child, that\nis already available on YouTube. With just a little support, we can improve the\nquality while reducing our production time, thereby allowing us to offer more\ncourses and a shorter turn-around time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\nsupport us?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat is\na great question! All the work that goes into sharing information with our\nlisteners and viewers takes time... A lot of time. Currently, we do everything\nourselves; from scheduling interviews, researching topics and recording the\nshows, to editing the audio/video and creating the posts online. And all of these\nthings take time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen we\nfirst started, we had a little extra time to do these tasks ourselves. So that\nwe don\u2019t take time from our clinic schedules, all of our preparatory research,\nrecording, editing, and producing are completed in the early morning hours and\non weekends. Our primary expenses, therefore, are for maintaining our website,\nweb-hosting, and software. In order to increase production and create the new programs,\nwe will are going to need some part-time help with production and an upgrade in\nour software and equipment. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\nnext?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank\nyou so much for visiting our Patreon page and considering becoming one of our\npatrons. If you like what you see and feel inspired by the direction we are\nheaded, we would be honored if you would consider pledging your support. Every\ndollar counts and 100% of the patron support we receive will be used for the\nproduction of content--content that will help everyone become the best possible\nversion of himself or herself. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a\npatron, you will receive rewards, which include access to our Patreon-only\nDiscord server, where you can engage in conversation directly with us on topics\nand show ideas. In addition, as a patron, you will receive early access to all\nof our free workshops and webinars, and discounted enrollment for our CEU\ncourses. We will add other rewards as time goes, including t-shirts and other\nmerchandise. So stay tuned! There is much more to come. \u003cbr\u003e"
