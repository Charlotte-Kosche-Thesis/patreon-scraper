My name is Maty (or as some of you may know me as my gamer alias, MiFU) and welcome to our Pateron Page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am one of the 4 owners of The Sentinel\u0027s Playground. The Sentinel\u0027s Playground is an Automatic game server hosting service which is available to the public. It is available for the game Zandronum (You can find out about this at \u003ca href=\"http://zandronum.com,\"\u003ehttp://zandronum.com,\u003c/a\u003e It is a source port for Doom. Not the new Doom 2016)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically we have developed a website that allows anyone to sign up host a zandronum (Doom) server with their favourite modifications, for free. You can also check that out at \u003ca href=\"https://allfearthesentinel.net\"\u003ehttps://allfearthesentinel.net\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis service is free to use for anyone but it does cost a fair bit to keep it up. So I figured maybe it will be a good time to unveil a few things. This being one of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the main goals for The Sentinel\u0027s Playground is to have a automatic hosting service in key parts of the world. (A node in the UK etc) in order to keep the game we love alot alive, that being Doom. We also intend on growing our community by venturing to other games. We already have a couple of minecraft servers and a terraria server. If you decide to become a pateron then we will give you some perks you can have. Check out the rewards list to find out what they are. The main thing you get however is some chats with me and the rest of the staff to gain a bit of an inside look of the bot and if you wanted to run your own, to help set it up for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways thanks for reading and checking us out. I also want to thank everyone who has supported us so far, if it was just feedback on how we were doing to donations. Feel free to either hang out in\u00a0\u003ca\u003eirc://irc.zandronum.com#tspg\u003c/a\u003e or join our discord at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/Ux4cZyC\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/Ux4cZyC\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
