Thank you for that. We\u0027re glad that you do, and want to be able to expand what we do by offering more episodes not only related to new movies of the week, but far beyond. We\u0027re now making that easier to accomplish, and you can help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can help us record more shows by pledging as low as $1 per episode. If you\u2019d like to contribute more to reach our goal faster, you are welcome to, but we certainly don\u2019t expect you to. Once we hit specific goals, we\u2019ll record more episodes, including classic movie reviews, commentaries, listener-suggested reviews, and non-movie related podcasts. Once each goal is hit, we\u2019ll record one of these special episodes each month, which won\u2019t be included in your pledging amount. These episodes will be available to everyone, so anything you pledge will be counted towards the overall goal. (Example: if 25 listeners each pledge just $1, we\u2019ll start recording classic movie discussions.) As another bonus, if you pledge anything, you\u2019ll be entered into our recurring giveaways for Blu-ray (or anything else movie-related we scrounge up) as well as access to a Slack channel where you can talk with other patrons and our hosts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions will go towards making the show better, including movie tickets, Blu-ray, and VOD purchases (so we can see more movies!), better equipment, and our web hosting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you\u2019ve been listening since Episode 1 or you just found this page after your first listen, we\u2019re glad you are part of The Film Stage Show community and we look forward to providing more listening experiences for you! If you have any suggestions for additional perks/goals or questions, feel free to message us through here, on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/thefilmstageshow\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e/\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/filmstageshow\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:podcast@thefilmstage.com\"\u003epodcast@thefilmstage.com\u003c/a\u003e."
