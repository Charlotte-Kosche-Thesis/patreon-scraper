    "summary": "Hello everyone! Luke Hector here! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I run a blog and podcast called the Broken Meeple! You may have heard of it, if not, I don\u0027t blame you, but I\u0027ve been on the go for over 4 years now and am a proud member of the Dice Tower Network and attend a wide variety of conventions in the UK as well as Essen in Germany. Sadly my location doesn\u0027t allow me to easily get to one of the big American conventions or Dice Tower Con, but who knows maybe a goal for the future?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I used to do video content as well on YouTube including reviews, rules explanations and other ad hoc projects. Unfortunately this was done on a cheap setup and the environment was unsuitable in the extreme with bad lighting, outside traffic noise constantly and lack of space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut now I\u0027ve recently settled into my new house in a much quieter location and I want to get back into video and resurrect the YouTube channel alongside the Dice Tower. In addition, Sam Healey has invited me to contribute to ThroatPunch Lunch when I eventually get back to video. Both prospects sound great and I really want to achieve both.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the deal. If you would like to see me create some decent video content, please be so kind as to pledge what you can to enable me to reach my ultimate goal of bringing video back to The Broken Meeple and once this is achieved, improve on the quality in the future. I want to look at other ways to improve The Broken Meeple with the help of you amazing people!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake care, enjoy playing games and once again, thank you all for reading, listening and watching!!"
