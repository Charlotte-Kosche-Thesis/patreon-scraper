    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHi, my name\u0027s Tom Palmer, and for two years on Youtube, I was known as TheCrankyOldGamer.\u00a0 I used to be a very active and prolific video game Youtuber, but I retired in 2014 when I got promoted to an admin position at my job.\u00a0 I just didn\u0027t have the time or energy to churn out 5-7 videos AND stream several times a week.\u00a0 Since then, my taste in hobbies have shifted more to board games, and I\u0027ve really gotten involved with online communities.\u00a0 And so going forward, I\u0027ve decided to redirect, overhaul, and rebrand TheCrankyOldGamer as a board game channel, with reviews, rules explanations, even explorations of mobile board game apps and Tabletop Simulator mods/DLC.\u00a0 I have lots of ideas, and I\u0027m brimming with excitement!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share my love of games with the world, but making good videos with quality equipment costs money.\u00a0 I have a decent HD Camcorder, but there\u0027s a lot more that could really help.\u00a0 I think my top focus right now would be a webcam and laptop for livestreaming gameplay.\u00a0 Beyond that, lighting, microphones, computer hardware, software, video editing, music licenses, graphic artists... The list of expenses goes on and on.\u00a0 I want to make a name for myself, with animated intros, videos with good editing and graphics, music, sound effects, and animations.\u00a0 All of these things could elevate my work to a professional level, but I can\u0027t do it alone.\u00a0 That\u0027s where you guys come in.\u00a0 Help me realize my dream by funding me, and I\u0027ll crank up the quality on the videos and launch this idea into the stratosphere!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe channel initially went live as TheCrankyOldGamerBG in October 2016, but was removed without warning or explanation by Youtube.\u00a0 I was never told what rules I broke, and my appeals all went unanswered.\u00a0 So I moved my videos to my old video game channel, TheCrankyOldGamer.\u00a0 Review videos go live every Wednesday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/02Rnacd.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 BoardGameGeek profile -\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/TheCrankyOldGamer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTheCrankyOldGamer\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/TyDKQsL.png\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 YouTube Channel (Soon To Come) -\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/thecrankyoldgamer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTheCrankyOldGamer\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/IdvtQhC.png\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Facebook Page - \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheCrankyOldGamer/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTheCrankyOldGamer\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/R7Db4oo.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Instagram - \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thecrankyoldgamer/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTheCrankyOldGamer\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ToZ6FPJ.png\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Twitter - \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/CrankyOldGamerX\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCrankyOldGamerX\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
