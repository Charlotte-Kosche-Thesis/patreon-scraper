    "summary": "Hello! Thank you for stopping by my little corner of the internet--I\u0027m thenewfiction and I write short stories on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/thenewfiction\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e. I made my twitter account seven years ago (!!) and the original idea was to create one never-ending story that I just added onto one tweet at a time. However, I soon realized that if I did it that way I would create a barrier to entry for any would-be readers, as they would have to read my entire backlog before being able to enjoy the story--and mind you this was at a time when twitter didn\u0027t have threads--so it wasn\u0027t ideal. As such I pivoted and decided to make self-contained stories with the idea being to give my readers an escape from their ordinary timelines and an excuse for their minds to wander. Its been an amazing exercise and \u003cstrong\u003eso\u003c/strong\u003e much fun, and I truly can\u0027t describe how great it feels to get even a single like or retweet on something I\u0027ve written. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to finally make a Patreon in an attempt to take the first step toward earning a living through writing--which has always been my dream. Up until now it never really felt feasible to make that jump as life (re: bills) always seemed to get in the way. So at the behest of some of my peers--I\u0027ve decided to test the waters of Patreon and see if it may help me carve the path towards living my dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI honestly don\u0027t know what to expect from this platform and even a single donation would floor me. I\u0027ve created some basic \u0027rewards\u0027 to get things started but once I see how everything goes I am open to explore that further and add more incentives such as writing tweets based on subjects my patrons chose or previewing some of my longer form fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn closing if you are reading this, thank you so much for even taking the time to check out my page--I assume you got here because you follow me on twitter and that alone means the world to me.\u003cbr\u003e"
