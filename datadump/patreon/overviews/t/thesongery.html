    "summary": "I make music. \u00a0I like to tell stories and share emotions. \u00a0I just finished my first music video, \"Prom Queen\" (SEE ABOVE :P) \u00a0It was completely self-financed and self-created. \u00a0(can you tell? haha) This is the first creation I have made that truly explores what my art is about, and I hope hope hope to continue exploring. \u00a0Even more so, I am set to dedicating my life to doing so. \u00a0I have a 7 track EP that I recorded in my mom\u0027s very-dry, very-hot closet and arranged in my own bedroom called \"Second Adolescence\". \u00a0You can stream it on Soundcloud, Spotify, Pandora... pretty much all of them. \u00a0The Songery is still not at the level I want it to be at, that I know it can be at, but... here\u0027s to the start. (*clink* Cheers.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is simple: to spend less time worrying about making a dollar and more time dedicating myself to my songs and ideas. \u00a0This journey has been wonderful, and soul-gratifying in such a unique and powerful way- but so far it\u0027s just been me, myself, and I. \u00a0And me, myself, and I is hard. \u00a0It\u0027s a lot of work mixed in with a lot of despair. \u00a0It\u0027s a lot of swimming against the current. \u00a0It\u0027s a looooot of input, with scraps of output. \u00a0All in all, I\u0027ve spent about $11,000 towards my development. \u00a0And all but about 2 of those thousands has been out of my own hard-earned and super-saved dinero. \u00a0It costs some serious money: buy the equipment, record yourself, have the songs mixed and mastered, educate yourself, network, travel to the shows, pay for that abominable 20-dollar parking just so you can unload AT YOUR OWN SHOW, travel to your sessions, get make up and costumes for the shows (ya feel me ladies?), a website, domain name, copyright protection for your material ($35 a song), lawyer fees (there are some real sharks out there- and no, I\u0027m not talking about the lawyer), and dance lessons because you just gotta dance (to bring that performance to life and, well, because if it\u0027s not dancing it\u0027s a quick trip and fall into a wallowing abyss of despair). \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith more money, I can continue to do all of those things AND... buy new boots because all of mine now have holes in their soles. \u00a0New running shoes because they have holes in them too. \u00a0Make sure my dogs are taken care of. \u00a0But, more importantly, I will be able to do things I haven\u0027t even had the ABILITY to do yet: invest in costumes and props without feeling like I\u0027m cutting off my own flesh every time I do, make a custom Songery outfit to wear to all my shows! (I\u0027ve had that one etched in my brain for a while now.) \u00a0I can tour, buy better equipment, record at better-quality, distribute my music, print physical copies of my music, keep registering my web domain (you have to pay every year), trademark my name, create merchandise, market myself through ads, promotions, and contests, take photos for said promotion, buy a camera and LED lights so I can make lovely YouTube home videos for you that don\u0027t look second rate, maybe even get band mates so I don\u0027t feel so alone (that will be the glorious day!) and, most importantly, make more music videos!! The list goes on... did you get tired or annoyed reading it? \u00a0How do you think I feel? \u00a0And I didn\u0027t even go into the amount of time I\u0027ve spent all alone, cradling myself at night, thinking about all these things, just to drag myself up and do them anyway. \u00a0As you can see, investing all by myself with very little return can cap out quickly. And you helping me is just that- an INVESTMENT. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know, I know- but, guys, I KNOW. \u00a0Yes, by investing in me you are giving me some return on mine. \u00a0But, more importantly, by giving to me, by even taking the time to come on this site and read this now, you are giving me your attention, time, mind. \u00a0You are entertaining the entertainer. *See what I did there? ;)* \u00a0Your support will speak volumes to me. \u00a0It already does. \u00a0There are times I feel like quitting- WTF am I doing? What\u0027s it all for? \u00a0Who was I even kidding? \u00a0So what some people get to do this- I ain\u0027t one of them... but then someone hands me a 10 and says, \"Keep it\"... a 100 and says \"You got this.\"... but then someone comes up, embraces me, and says \"Keep going\"... but then some stranger out-of-the-blue stumbles upon my music (somehow?) and sends me a message and it says \"I found your music... it\u0027s special. I love your voice. You\u0027re gonna go far.\" \u00a0And those moments make me cry. \u00a0I can do it. \u00a0I just have to keep going and growing and I\u0027ll find my way. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs to why I and others are on this site, fellow Patreon artist Julia Nunes (look her up) puts it in such a strong and straight-forward way, \"I hope the rest of the world catches on that every time you spend a dollar, you\u2019re casting a vote for what kind of products, and companies, and musicians become successful. Thanks for voting for me!\" \u00a0If you see someone you like, follow them on social media. \u00a0If you hear someone you like, talk about them to your friends. \u00a0If you want them to succeed, they don\u0027t need the big industry reps or the label or the bribed 5-star review in Rolling Stone. \u00a0They need YOU. \u00a0A bunch of little YOUs gathering together to say- This person is awesome. \u00a0If enough of you say it, the rest will come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027m sentimental so I\u0027m going to take it one step further...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e By you becoming my patron, you become my family. \u00a0I will know someone out there has faith in me and in what I am doing... and I will never stop reaching for my fullest potential. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know a \"monthly payment\" can be daunting, but no fear my dear- you can patron as little as $1 and you can cancel your patronage or change the donation amount at any time you like. \u00a0A $1 donation over the course of a year only comes to $12! \u00a0That is less than you probably will spend on a Friday night movie ticket, or a Friday night cocktail, or a Friday night dinner entree. \u00a0And if you want to donate but still aren\u0027t feeling the recurrent withdrawal thing? \u00a0One-time donations can also be made at thesongery.com. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNow, all that being said- \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your patronage. *tips hat* \u00a0Welcome to The Songery."

Or how about some of the thoughts, dialogue, and warm-up lyrics that were written in the development of a song? \u00a0Sometimes I\u0027ll share what I write with you- It\u0027s not always Hemingway or Dickinson, but some of it\u0027s alright. \u00a0I figure, at this point I know you really care. \u00a0So I am gonna trust and share a little more of myself with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the above.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
