    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Patreon is and How it Works: \u003c/strong\u003eOnce upon a time, way back when, nobility and aristocrats often\nkept artists and musicians on the castle payroll. In this [sometimes tumultuous] relationship the creator was free to create without worrying about\nselling his paintbrushes to pay for bread and, in exchange for paying the bills, the patron ended up with lots of cool artsy stuff to flaunt at both friends and\nenemies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis kind of setup is what gave us those pretty pictures on the Sistine\nChapel ceiling. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLordships with castles have mostly since gone away but art patrons still exist. Today we call them \u003cem\u003ephilanthropists\n\u003c/em\u003eand they use words like \u003cem\u003eendowments \u003c/em\u003eand\ndon\u2019t tend to focus on individual artists. Patronage is also how a lot\nof symphonies and museums stay funded, and they use high-rolling tight-circle words like \u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003esociety \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003efriends of.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis site brings the patronage concept to a level the rest of us can afford. Here, with as little as a few dollars a month, fans who\nreally love a writer, or artist, or musician, make it possible for creators to create without worrying about (figuratively) selling their\npaintbrushes to (literally) pay for bread.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho I am:\u003c/strong\u003e An award-winning\nand \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e bestselling novelist of five-and-a-half\u00a0 Jason Bournesque\ninternational thrillers featuring Vanessa Michael Munroe, a mercenary information hunter. My work has been nominated for the Anthony Award and Macavity Award, is a three-time winner of the Barry Award, is published in over twenty languages, and \u003cem\u003eThe Informationist \u003c/em\u003ehas been optioned for film by James Cameron\u2019s production\ncompany.

Born into an \napocalyptic cult and raised in communes across the globe, I grew up as a\n child laborer in an environment where books, movies, music, and \npop-culture from the\noutside were strictly forbidden and education beyond the basics was a \nwaste of time.

As the publishing industry continues\nto change, my own uncertainty has reached an all time high and this has forced a few creativity-killing choices for the sake of\npaying the bills. I\u0027d really like to reverse that trend and so I\u0027ve come here to collaborate with: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e** Anyone who appreciates the time investment that goes into creating\n the free material and would like to keep it coming,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e** Readers, listeners, and curiosity seekers, who want to be involved in keeping the creativity flow alive,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e** Fans and friends who love me and who, in place of taking me to real life coffee or dinner, would use this as a way to put a little slack into an otherwise austere author budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most immediate goal is to try to get all expenses for hosting and servicing the websites, podcasts, and email streams self-sustaining. If funding goes beyond those basics I would like to bring THE VESSEL (which has only been available in eBook and audio) into print, publish an already written book that sits outside the thriller genre, and even be able to set-up fan-based events in areas that haven\u0027t been on my publisher\u0027s radar. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow far we get will depend on the goals we reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find more detail on each of these goals and the funding we\u0027d need to be able to attain them by scrolling up ^^^ looking over there \u0026lt;-- and clicking the little arrow to tab through the goals. (If you\u0027re on a mobile device you\u0027ll find them way\ndown at the bottom.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get in Exchange*: \u003c/strong\u003eMy biggest challenge has been finding ways to provide value\nat each patronage level. Most writers and creators seem to do this by offering new\nexclusive content but since I labor over my work (read: I\u0027m slow) and already give away the best of me for free, that doesn\u0027t leave much wiggle-room for coming up with more without eating into limited writing time which would defeat the whole\npurpose of setting this up. I\u0027ve done my best to offer\nwhat I\u0027m able based on what I thought might be of value to you. If there\u2019s\nsomething else you\u0027d appreciate instead, please tell me about it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* It kind of goes without saying but long-term future rewards that may or may not materialize--such as not-yet-built programs or free copies of books that have yet to be published--are only able to distribute to patrons who are active \u003cem\u003eat the time the reward becomes available.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
