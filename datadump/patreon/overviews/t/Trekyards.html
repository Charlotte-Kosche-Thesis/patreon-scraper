We go in depth and are attempting to be the definitive go to place for all you trek based knowledge. We wish to spark new ideas and expand on the ever growing Star Trek mythos and encourage our viewers to share their knowledge by way of the comments section. We research each episode completely and endeavor to let you know all the canon and no-canon facts about the hardware from the Trek universe that you all love. But despite our best efforts, we may miss something or make the occasional error. So we encourage all who watch to add anything they feel is important. We have an expert panel of designers and special guests that have designed some of the most iconic ships as seen on screen and even visit the future as we talk with the men and women behind the up and coming Trek as well as the old timers. So join us on a weekly voyage as we boldly go, where no web series has gone before.",
