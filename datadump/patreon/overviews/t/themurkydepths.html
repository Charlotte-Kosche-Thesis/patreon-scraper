    "summary": "I write From The Murky Depths (as a one man band) which is a lot of fun but time consuming, and not that easy what with trying to afford very high rents and travel in London hence starting up this Patreon page to help with allowing me to devote more time to the site.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been able to increase the number of articles recently and I hope you both enjoy them and find the content interesting and revealing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe aim is to write more content and who knows, maybe one day get enough to do it full time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site is concerned with covering news and events in London. It\u0027s mainly south east London though I hope to expand coverage and recently have done a bit more on Canary Wharf, Canning Town and the Royal Docks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an American site meaning you see dollars but it is converted to pounds when donating.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe costs of running the site and time spent doing so have all increased in recent months. I hope to maintain existing levels of articles, plus expand content and coverage in different areas too. But to do so needs help. Especially with the very high cost of living in London and making rent each month. It\u0027s more overtime or time to research and write articles I hope you find interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt can be a lengthy process writing up posts - travelling for photos, researching, emailing and calling people, trawling documents (this can be particularly tedious!) and more, and a little help will go a long way in allowing me to dedicate more time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny help is greatly appreciated. Thanks."
