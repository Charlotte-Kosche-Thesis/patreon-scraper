The show is coming right along, and I am so happy to be talking about fat people with fat people and sharing those conversations with you. I have big plans for The Fat Lip\u0027s future, and I would love your support going forward. For as little as $1 per episode you can help me improve equipment, support hosting, and further the show\u0027s reach. If you want to hear more fat people in media, please consider becoming a patron. The plan is to release an episode every two weeks, but don\u0027t worry. You can set a monthly maximum so you\u0027ll never give more than you can manage even if I go a little crazy and post more often than that.\u00a0And there will be perks for you along the way!"
