The Naughty\nRabbit figurines began simply as a way to pay for Monty\u2019s amputation surgery\nbut have in a way become representations of his ability to be or do anything he\nwanted. Monty never let being a rabbit or having three legs keep him from what\nhe set his mind to. He taught me not to take things for granted and that with\nenough grit, one can leap any obstacle.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMonty\u2019s\nantics often made me think of phrases like \u201cI aim to misbehave\u201d from the\nresolute Malcolm Reynolds in the movie Serenity and the much quoted \u201cWell\nbehaved women seldom make history.\u201d Both these statements hint at naughtiness actually\nbeing a virtue. After all, when you really break it down, it comes from a place\nof both curiosity and determination, both of which are pretty damn good\nqualities in my book. Monty\u2019s naughtiness was really just an unquenchable\ninquisitiveness powered by a buttload of tenacity. To me, that means even\nsomeone small can make a big difference if they\u2019re eager to learn and they stay\ndetermined. I want my art to give people glee and incite in them a little of that\nnaughty spirit.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon\ngives me a chance to have a stronger personal connection with my fans and gives\nyou a voice in my future projects. You\u2019ll get a behind the scenes look at my\nsculpture and illustration as well as exclusive access to some of my work. With\nyour pledge, I will expand the naughty rabbits beyond the figurine and create more engaging art while traveling to new places to bring and spread the naughty spirit.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/11188176_437175456407413_5679098981095225886_n.jpg?oh=1509027c006523450957be9ebdc08be4\u0026amp;oe=58709AAE\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nHere\u2019s our tale of love and determination:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere once\nwas a naughty gray rabbit\u003cbr\u003e\n\nwho had a\ngreat many bad habits.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAn\nadventure one day\u003cbr\u003e\n\nleft this\nbun in dismay,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nfor a\nbroken back leg\u2019s problematic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGood thing\nMom\u2019s a rabbit fanatic \u003cbr\u003e\n\nwith a\nflair for the melodramatic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTo the vet\nthey both went.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll her\nmoney she spent,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nto avoid\nsomething much more traumatic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith three\nlegs he\u2019s quite asymptomatic\u003cbr\u003e\n\nand he\u2019s\nstill very much charismatic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlways\nscarfs down his food\u003cbr\u003e\n\nthat he\nbarely has chewed,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut his\nhops are mismatched and sporadic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
