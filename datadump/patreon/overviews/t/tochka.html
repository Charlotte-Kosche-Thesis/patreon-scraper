It is a hard way, but we are really oriented to make a change.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn the residence there are only few rules - no drugs or alcohol, be polite, try to act and participate. We have no common political or religious agenda and we are not looking to choose one.\u003cbr\u003eWe live by the rules of understanding, respect, growth and tolerance.\u003cbr\u003eThe activities are - music studio, board games, LARP, costume design, extreme sports, talking clubs, art exhibitions, craft workshops, book reading space, recycle lab for crafts, movie props and general art, hack space, gallery and much more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a safespace for LGBT community members, and we are mostly working with less fortunate, so called LOST kids and youth, different subcultures and national minorities.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe managed to  procure a \u003cem\u003erent-free 5 story\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0building, and our volunteers and philanthropists work hard every day to create ways of generating money for \u003cem\u003ethe bills\u003c/em\u003e. While everyday creating souvenirs, art, writing different projects, etc. we are still far away from the goal.\u003cbr\u003eWe need to generate \u003cstrong\u003e4300$\u003c/strong\u003e a year in order to maintain this very important place running.\u003cbr\u003eThis year we have around \u003cstrong\u003e1000$\u003c/strong\u003e and growing, but we are \u003cstrong\u003e3300$\u003c/strong\u003e short.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo with great pleasure we would like to create and send superb, artistic, hand-made presents to everyone who help us!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we get more than expected, and more than we need monthly - we will use money to improve our habitat and then raise such residences world wide, starting with Latvia and Estonia, and then growing further. But first we need to pay our current expenses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, OF COURSE, at any time if anybody on the planet, donating or not, is visiting Lithuania - we are happy to invite you to our space for a tea, a walk near the lake, or a night of philosophy talks."
