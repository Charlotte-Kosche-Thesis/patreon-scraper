Would you lose it if you saw a man jogging without a shirt along the beach? Then why lose it over a female? I\u0027m setting up this Patreon account so that those who want to donate can do so with the security of knowing every cent will go into improving the videos--getting a better camera and providing traveling funds so we can explore nudist resorts across the country (and maybe someday, the world), as well as funding projects like a \"nude in nature\" photoshoot with the bulk of the proceeds going to charities like the GLBT Help Hotline, to help those who are struggling in finding their identity to know they\u0027re not alone."

(slow clap) I\u0027ve been making Youtube videos since the website was first created, but it wasn\u0027t until late 2014 that I realized what I wanted to focus on making--videos that promote the nudist/naturalist lifestyle, giving others a chance to see female nudity in a non-sexual situation so we can break that pesky stigma that says male nipples are fine and dandy but female nipples are profane! Surprisingly Youtube has turned out to be full of fellow naturalists who also support this message, and my hope is that I can help inspire others to make their own Topless Topics, so we can make that goal of equal treatment just a little less far-fetched! Obviously I\u0027m a big supporter of #freethenipple, by the way.",
