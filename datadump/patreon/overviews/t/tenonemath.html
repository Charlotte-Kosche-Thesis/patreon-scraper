    "summary": "What if I told you 80% of the world (including the U.S., UK and Australia) is teaching number words that are \u003ca href=\"https://tenonemath.com/scientific_proof.pdf\"\u003escientifically proven to confuse math learners\u003c/a\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy situation:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m Michael Dowell, a dad and math nerd. I started Ten One Math in 2016 after posting on facebook a weird idea to make things easy for math learners. I figured the post would get ignored and I could go on with my non-mathy life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut nooooo. Friends who are teachers and parents wrote, \"Hey, you might be onto something here. Science proved we need new English language number words, and apparently you just invented them. You should make this into a math game for kids.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I\u0027ve published over 100 game levels built in Unity, HTML5 games, printables with \u003ca href=\"https://tenonemath.com/img/printables/tenonemath-1-100-printable-bw_612x792.pdf\"\u003enumber words\u003c/a\u003e 1-100, started tutoring young children how to count up to 100 on Skype, and Ten One Math has become a 60+ hour/ week job for me. Ten One Math keeps growing every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCost: Free. Everything can be accessed for free on tenonemath.com -- including free 1-on-1 Skype tutoring. This helps low-income families who have the greatest need. Some friends suggested Patreon, so I\u0027m giving it a try!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is you can donate any amount you want and the donation continues every month after that. Anything from $3/month is a huge help to the cause!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we\u0027ll use the money for:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is $12,000/ month -- with this amount Ten One Math can keep going indefinitely. Here are Ten One Math\u0027s costs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHosting.\u003c/strong\u003e We need robust hosting so we can remain online during highest spikes in traffic so it doesn\u0027t ruin our happiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSoftware Development.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0We hire programmers to help build math software and make changes to the website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook post \"Boosts\".\u003c/strong\u003e When we write a new announcement on facebook, this makes sure that 1/2 or 1/3 of our audience will see the posts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMe\u003c/strong\u003e. I need to eat and wear clothes and keep the lights on. I\u0027m a dad with one kid and I live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment in Pasadena, so needs are minimal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne employee.\u003c/strong\u003e We need someone to handle things like language translation requests, spam comment deletion, customer service, and other small jobs. These things add up to several hours per day, and without this employee I end up doing these things myself and have much less time to work on new math games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose are the basics. With these bits covered, Ten One Math can support itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStretch Goal:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stretch goals will allow us to take Ten One Math to the next level and do things like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2022 More Free Tutoring \u003c/strong\u003e-- hire a 2nd employee to do more free 1 on 1 tutoring for young children\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2022 Bigger Games\u003c/strong\u003e -- multiplayer, 3D, MR / VR / AR\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2022 Animated Videos\u003c/strong\u003e -- animated versions of blog posts?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe stretch goal would be amazing to hit, but simply being totally supported by reader generosity would make us feel endlessly grateful, no matter what.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, thanks for any support you can offer if you decide to, and thanks for being a part of Ten One Math.\u003cbr\u003e"
