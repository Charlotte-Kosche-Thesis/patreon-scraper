The Notable Woman is brought to you by me, Cristin Downs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m creating The Notable Woman as a way to spark conversation, create connections, and be a catalyst for a new world order. I want to replace authority with collaboration and hierarchy with a framework for collaborative, multiple intelligence based community with rotating, situational leadership models. I want to smash the patriarchy and transcend the ways that privilege has crushed our society\u0027s march for equality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe do this by having the conversations. By making mistakes. By changing the way girls think and women lead. We can create the kind of world we want to live in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll that starts with conversation which the podcast starts, continues with connection that we find in the online community, and catapults as a catalyst for new ideas, programs, campaigns, and initiatives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo join the community, find us here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.thesocietyofnotablewomen.com.\"\u003ewww.thesocietyofnotablewomen.com.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo catch up on everything, head over to the website, and subscribe to get updates in your inbox: \u003ca href=\"http://www.thenotablewoman.com.\"\u003ewww.thenotablewoman.com.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
