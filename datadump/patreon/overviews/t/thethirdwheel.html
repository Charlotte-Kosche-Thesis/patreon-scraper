Will they craft the world into a better, kinder place? Will they burrow to its core and obliterate all existence? Or will they leave it all behind and become a hugely successful jazz-fusion trio? Your guess is as good as ours, but we can tell you that it probably won\u0027t be that last one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re an extremely fortunate lot, in that we\u0027ve made a series we love working on that others want to watch. As a team, we\u0027re a roiling mass of dreams and opinions, but we all agree that we want to do better for our viewers. We\u0027re hoping to return even a fraction of what\u0027s been given to us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re new to patreon, but we\u0027re eager to use it to its fullest extent. We\u0027ve put together some reward tiers which we think should be fun for everyone involved- us included- and we\u0027re eager to fine-tune it in the months to come. We thrive on fan feedback and suggestion, so please send us any ideas, comments, or questions you might have! We seriously value our community, and want to hear what you have to say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking on Thrilling Intent has been an incredible experience made possible by your consistent contributions and kind words. Here\u0027s to hoping we can do even better in the year to come!"
