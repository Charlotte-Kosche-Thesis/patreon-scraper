Tasia, which to some is intimidating when said aloud, can be spelled a number of ways, but I\u0027ve found \"Teza\" to be quite fitting. Teza, which means to reap what you harvest, sums up my past, present, and future in a short yet impactful two syllables.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe last three years since \"The Year In Music 2012,\" while many may think I have been hiding, have actually been a beautiful process of growth, creativity, and self-discovery. I am so excited and proud to be sharing my art, music, life, and experiences with all of you now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat:\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon is every creator\u0027s dream. It is a way to continuously make art and also a living. My music, art, and videos will always firstly be gifts to you guys via YouTube, Sound Cloud, and anywhere else I can make some noise. But now, because of Patreon, you guys can make a choice to stay intimately interactive with me. The packages I have personally made for all of you are truly from my heart because your support means so much to me. Thank you for allowing me to do what I absolutely love to do, and feel I must do, with my life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy:\u003c/strong\u003e With your support, a little bit goes a long way. You will see I have milestone goals for each new artistic vision I undertake. Your financial support will always go towards my artistic endeavors - be it production costs, new gear, or travel expenses for creative collaborations - and I will always keep you updated on what we are working towards together. My longterm goal is to be able to get to where my fans are. I want to have the ability to tour, get my music on college radio, and perform at popular festivals all over the world. I KNOW we can do this together! Every song is an original piece of my truth and purpose, and every visual is an interpretation of that. Every monster I paint is a piece of my heart, and all this art is for you. If you would like to be apart of this exciting new chapter in my life, I am so happy to welcome you on board. Thank you for your support, love, and honesty.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you are just passing through thank you for reading my story. Please share if you can, I am grateful of every kind of support! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTo humble beginnings!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Though I am (the) Batman, I also write music, paint monsters, and create unforgettable memories and short films with my friends. To know me is to know the art I create. Art has always allowed me to best express and show people who I am. I believe limitations exist only when they are not creatively challenged. I do not think any perceived limitation is ever intended to hold back but should rather be embraced as a key to unlock creative innovation; limits will cease to restrict when they are welcomed not merely as conquerable but as educational and ultimately uplifting. With this in mind, I always strive to be as raw, authentic, and uncensored in my art as possible, and I can only hope this allows all of you wonderful, beautiful beings to be a vital part of, and to have an up-close and personal look at, this crazy experience I call my life.  Through your support and love, I promise to create and cultivate art that will make you feel, question, relate, and inspire you to cry, laugh, and live your best life possible. After all, you guys are allowing me to live mine. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMay the force be with you,\u003cbr\u003e\nTeza\u003cbr\u003e",
