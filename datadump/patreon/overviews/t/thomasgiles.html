    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eI love writing, especially sci-fi. While I did little pieces here and there in school, I never really gave the craft the time it deserved. It was a few years later that I decided to find a local writing group and see how it went. It went well. It was the first time I had spoken to other writers about writing, and I can safely say it was life-changing. By the feedback I got from them, it seemed I had some skill in the written word, and this encouraged me greatly to write more and more so that, over time, I have honed my craft enough to start to show the world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eI have already gathered a close-knit group of early \"alpha\" readers, but would like to officially make an open invitation to you, dear Patron, to join me in my writing endeavours. Not only will you get regular, interesting short stories, but through your feedback in the form of comments and \"likes\" you will be helping shape my style and improve the quality of my work! I cannot tell you how much it means to me to get feedback, positive or negative, on my writing. It is this input that is the single most upbuilding and encouraging part of writing for me; it\u0027s what makes it such a joy to do.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eSo here\u0027s the plan: Write as often as I can, and get it out to you guys for comments and critique. In the past, I have written maybe a few thousand words every month or so. This may sound like a lot, but most professional writers do this every day! In an effort to go full-bore at improving my writing quickly and efficiently, as part of this Patreon-Patron setup, I will do my level best to write something each and every day. Sometimes this will be a short story, or maybe some planning or writing towards a larger piece. Some days I may write something that\u0027s not all that readable. It happens to all of us. But don\u0027t worry; while I will post those pieces, in case you were wondering if I\u0027ve been keeping up with my daily goals, but they won\u0027t count against your pledge.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eOkay, so how do you get onboard? Simple. See that \"Give $ per short story\" box on the top-left? Just type in whatever amount you\u0027re happy with and hit \"Become a Patron\". Once that\u0027s done, every time I release a short story you will pay what you pledged straight to me. That means if you pledged $1, and I posted 3 stories, the Patreon system will automatically transfer $3 from you to me, showing your support of my work. Now, for people like me who may produce a \u003ci\u003elot\u003c/i\u003e of content each month (if all goes well), Patreon lets you add a special limit on how much you\u0027re willing to pay per month, to make sure you don\u0027t accidentally overspend.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eAnd now comes the moment of truth... Have you read some of my stuff in the past and want to show your support? Or are you looking to help a budding young(-ish) writer improve on his craft? Then step right up and pledge today! ^^\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eIf you are still unsure, or wish to see some of my work before pledging, feel free to peruse the following short stories, and see what you think...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cfont\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 21.75px;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BRqUl-0wanHHKGk50UCkmS1dQsWKZVFZ7UnUU8oe6iQ/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLast Ride\u003c/a\u003e: A young man sits on his cycle, waiting for fate to catch up with him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cfont\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 21.75px;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQTh53Pm9gLCanKSGTK0WsfuhzkRHvBZ40Par93rjxQ/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFinal Farewell\u003c/a\u003e: A girl rushes down through old lifts and abandoned corridors to reach a dear friend and say her last goodbye.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n"
