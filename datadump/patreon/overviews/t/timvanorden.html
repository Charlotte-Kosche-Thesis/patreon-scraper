Along the way, I won 10 U.S. Masters running championships, and was named a U.S. Masters Runner of the Year four times by USA Track and Field.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile my focus may have shifted away from raw foods, I still remain plant-based and committed to eating as many whole, fresh, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds as possible. At present, in addition to training several hours a day for elite running events, I spend a good part of the day doing research into psychology, neuroscience, and human potential. My hunger for this type of information continues to grow, and I\u0027ve accumulated a large body of writings on these topics, which will turn into book form someday.\u003cbr\u003e",
