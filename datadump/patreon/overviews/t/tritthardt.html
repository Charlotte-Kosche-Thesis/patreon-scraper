I don\u0027t \n\t\u003cem\u003eever\u003c/em\u003e want to stop again. I want to have a massive archive for people to read through. I want to have fantastic and up-to-date websites.

I want to be able to go to more conventions and meet all my readers. I want to make more people happy with my work. And hopefully, every so often, I want to make some lonely, weird person not feel so alone in this world. That, my friends, has been the greatest gift I have ever given and received. I can only achieve these things with your pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\"How often will you be posting here on Patreon?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tYou can see from the Post Feed that I currently have no solid schedule for posts. I usually post something when I have it ready. Comic strips will be posted every Monday and Wednesday (when they come off of hiatus) and illustrations will be on a random schedule depending on what I\u0027m working on.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e*\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m going to be honest with you right here and now. I \n\t\u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e have two comic strips, I \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e post videos and sketches and illustrations, I \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e post everything I make as often as I make it. It\u0027s just that it\u0027s not on as regular a schedule as I would like. I \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to post more work, I want a regular schedule, but I\u0027ve proven time and time again that it just doesn\u0027t work out. Now here is the hard part... Admitting this in a public format...\u003cbr\u003e\n\t*breathe*\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI have mental health problems.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI suffer from Depression and Post-Traumatic Stress.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe combination of these make it extremely difficult to produce quality work with exact regularity. Now I\u0027m not trying to make an excuse or give myself an \u0027out\u0027 for when I miss a deadline, far from it. This work is the most important thing to me in the world besides my cat, Mao. I take it hard every single time I fail to meet my own expectations. I take it hard knowing that I failed \n\t\u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e, my supporters. I know that some other artists are better than me, more prolific, and more punctual. I constantly strive to be as good as them. My brain just doesn\u0027t let me do that sometimes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tFortunately, many of my supporters have told me that it\u0027s better to have quality over quantity, and that\u0027s something with which I wholeheartedly agree. Each illustration and comic strip takes a lot of time to produce because I want everything to be as good as it can be. I want to be proud of the work I make. And I want you to look at it with the happiness and pride of knowing that you helped me make it.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSo those are the kind of supporters I am looking for. Are you one of them?\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
