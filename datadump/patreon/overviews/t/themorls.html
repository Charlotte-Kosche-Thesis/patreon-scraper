Each episode features a classic, or maybe-not-so classic story from the old-time radio vault, complete with historical notes and nerdy trivia. At the end of each podcast, your hosts, Tim, Joshua and Eric discuss the merits of the story, and decide whether or not it stands the test of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Release Schedule:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe release episodes weekly. The exact day of the week is usually a surprise.

In 2016, Ghoulish Delights founder Tim Uren, along with frequent collaborators Eric Webster and Joshua English Scrimshaw, created The Mysterious Old Radio Listening Society Podcast. For more information about Ghoulish Delights and your Mysterious Old Hosts, please visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.ghoulishdelights.com.\"\u003ewww.ghoulishdelights.com.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Do It:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love old-time radio. What\u2019s more, we love talking about old-time radio. The internet is full of podcasts that repackage old-time radio shows, but we are one of the few to include analysis and discussion. We post a poll on our website with each new episode and encourage listeners to share their thoughts and opinions. We want to connect and communicate with existing fans of old-time radio as well as introduce these great shows to new listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Support:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love making this podcast, but researching, recording, and editing weekly episodes is a considerable amount of work.  In addition to our time, there are expenses related to recording equipment and web hosting. Don\u2019t worry though. We plan to make this podcast for the foreseeable future, but your support will make weekly episodes more manageable and allow us the freedom to create more content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Bottom Line:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMembership is not required to enjoy The Mysterious Old Radio Listening Society. Although we offer rewards for membership, our regular weekly podcast will not change or disappear behind a paywall. If you love the podcast and want to support it through a membership, we are very grateful. If you love the podcast and can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to support it through a membership, we are also very grateful. Thank you all for listening!\u003cbr\u003e"
