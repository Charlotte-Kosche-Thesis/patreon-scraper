For the past five years I\u2019ve created audio adaptations of articles\nfrom the SCP wiki (\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/\"\u003ehttp://www.scp-wiki.net/\u003c/a\u003e),\na horror based community writing site that has risen in popularity in recent\ntimes. As time has went on, I\u2019ve put more and more effort into trying to make\nmy content look and sound to the highest quality I can personally make it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u2019s been a personal goal of mine (since I can remember) to make it as a voice\nactor, and my YouTube and small following has allowed me (in a very basic way)\nto do this. I have been featured multiple times in an SCP themed PC game called\n\u201cSCP: Containment Breach\u201d \u2013 in this game I voice several characters (\n\u003ca href=\"https://scpcb.gamepedia.com/Voice_Actors\"\u003ehttps://scpcb.gamepedia.com/Voice_Actors\u003c/a\u003e)\nbut the one I am most known for is the mysterious Plague Doctor \u201cSCP-049\u201d. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kSss8p5.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOk, the main reason i\u0027m starting Patreon as a means of support (apart from people asking) is that I want to make more content for my listeners - because the more financial support I receive, I can take more requests, vastly improve the speed in which I work and improve the quality of my work ... all of this means more content that you will enjoy! Not to mention (OK, i\u0027ll mention it) the rewards you will get exclusively from Patreon, so this can only be a positive step forward. Over the last few months \u2013 I have been gradually stepping up\nmy production schedule for videos and as I have done this I have become aware\nthat due to the horror nature of my videos, they are being deemed inappropriate\nby certain ad companies (even though to my knowledge I have made my content adhere\nto their advertising guidelines), this makes it much harder for me to continue\nmaking content.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat being said \u2013 I know there is still an audience for what\nI do!. So I have decided to open a means of support for people that appreciate\nwhat I do. I have set up a number of rewards for people that might like to\nsupport me (and who knows, if this is successful \u2026 it might end up making the\nchannel even better!).  Though my channel\nis largely SCP themed \u2013 I plan to start narrating a broader array of horror\ncontent known as \u201cCreepypasta\u201d these are short form (sometimes long) horror\nstories from an array of talented writers across the world that are sure to\ngive you a SPOOK!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading and I hope you choose to support me - i\u0027m 99% certain you won\u0027t regret it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Aaron \"TheVolgun\" McKee\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
