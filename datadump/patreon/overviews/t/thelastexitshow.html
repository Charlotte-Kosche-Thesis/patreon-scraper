It\u0027s funny sometimes, it\u0027s sad sometimes, and it\u0027s about the desert and it\u0027s about the smoke lingering in a bar at closing time and it\u0027s about all the towns the highways bypassed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Kaleb Horton and I\u0027m from Bakersfield. I\u0027ve been making this show for years, but I took some time off to write for Vanity Fair and MTV. You are seeing this Patreon page because I need money to live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll have guests when I can get them and I\u0027ll have co-hosts when they can stay awake, and Big Jim Murphy, my original co-host, will still pop in when we can make the time. If I can make enough money, I\u0027ll do the show once a week, and if I make too much money, I\u0027ll do the show more than once a week. If I make a spiritually upsetting amount of money, I\u0027ll do it more than once a month.\u003cbr\u003e"

I photograph the remnants of 20th century America and the desert and the old part of town. I drive far, and too fast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a podcast. It\u0027s called \u003ca href=\"http://lastexit.libsyn.com/\"\u003eThe Last Exit Show\u003c/a\u003e, and it ties all those themes together into a rambling hour or two. People tell me it sounds like Art Bell hosting a comedy podcast at 2 a.m.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making the show for a few years, and took a couple years off to write for \u003ca href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/contributor/kaleb-horton\"\u003eVanity Fair\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/author/hortonk/\"\u003eMTV\u003c/a\u003e. I intend to start making it again on a regular basis, for money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe aim of this Patreon is to try and turn this podcast into a real source of income, because you need money to live. Some of the money will go to setting up a proper recording rig so guests can come to my apartment and sit down with a microphone they don\u0027t have to hunch over and speak quietly into. I know people, contrary to the gossip, and they are funny and interesting people. You\u0027ll like the podcast, because it\u0027s good.\u003cbr\u003e",
