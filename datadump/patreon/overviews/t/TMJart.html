However, it can be challenging to squeeze in the time to practice my craft while working a full time job, but that\u0027s where you come in! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you can help me build a dependable, monthly income in support of my artistic endeavors and most importantly, help me expand my current horizons by giving me the financial freedom to explore new techniques, new materials, new subject matter and more!\u00a0 Ultimately I want to create art that inspires people or just makes them smile. \u00a0Currently I am focused on pop-culture, tv, comics etc., but would like to expand my subject matter to military, martial arts, and police/law enforcement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost exciting, is my new goal to write my own illustrated novel and/or comic book! My story is still in the early development stages, but I will post development updates here for all my Patreon supporters and I work to bring it to print!\u003c/div\u003e"
