    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is ThorHighHeels. I make video game reviews \u0026amp; essays, and also music. ...but you\u0027re probably here because of my YouTube channel. For which I have also made this \u003cstrong\u003ePATRONE\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee, I tend to cover the more obscure side of gaming, which also just so happens to be the most expensive one. Currently, I pay everything out of my own pocket, but there\u0027s definitely a limit to how much I\u0027d be willing to spend on something I technically do just for fun. So, I launched this \u003cstrong\u003ePATRONIZE\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0just so I can take out said fun! Together we will \u003cstrong\u003ecorporatize \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003emonetize\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0this tiny little YouTube channel, just so that I could like.. i dunno, buy like Metal Wolf Chaos or something. Maybe like, move house, so I can stop having to work from out of a box. I would like those things very much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLuckily for you though, I feel incredibly awkward about doing this, and so, I shall repay you in some manner.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor 1 whole US Dollar\u0027s worth of money, you will gain access to a \u003cstrong\u003ePATRO\u00caN\u003c/strong\u003e only podcast. In which I will talk about all manner of things, for aprox. 1 hour maybe i dunno whatever works best for you guys we\u0027ll see. I will most likely appear on camera for these as well. So it won\u0027t be too lazy content-wise.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor 3 bucks, you\u0027ll be able to request toppings for said podcast. Whether if it\u0027s the latest gaming controversy, my super duper in-depth creative process, or stories of my cripplingly awful childhood, I\u0027ll totally talk about it if you want me to!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdditionally, I might also add all backer\u0027s names into the credits of my videos. I say \"might\" as I\u0027m currently still working with a backlog of videos, so it\u0027ll be rather difficult for me to keep that shit up to date. I haven\u0027t quite worked out the best way to do this pretty much, but I would like to in the future for sure. Look forward to it and stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo yeah! There you go. I know this isn\u0027t the most lavishly decked out \u003cstrong\u003ePARKINSON \u003c/strong\u003epage ever, but I figured I\u0027d give it a go either way. I could also really do with not living in a box PLEASE HELP.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
