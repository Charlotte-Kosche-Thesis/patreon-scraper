You might be considering giving something\nback to show your appreciation and helping to support us create even more\ncontent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully our videos have helped you learn engineering and\nexcel in your studies and career. If so, and you would like to contribute\ntowards us making even more content, then any support would be greatly appreciated.\nIf you scroll down the page you\u2019ll see there are a number of support levels\ndown the right hand side with a special reward for each contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo a little about me and the channel. My name is Paul and I\u2019m\nusually the one talking in the videos. I\u2019ve studied for many years to obtain\ntwo engineering diplomas in manufacturing and design as well as a dual first\nclass honours degree in a mechanical and electrical engineering. I\u2019ve used this\nto gain experience in many roles over the years in everything from rewiring a\nplug up to rebuilding the cooling system of a nuclear power station.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy brain is constantly in over drive. I look at everything\nmechanical and electrical and assess how it works and how I could improve it,\nor, I question \u201cwhat is that and how does it work!\u201d One of my closest friends\nwas always asking me how things worked and then one day asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you\ngo into teaching?\u201d I didn\u2019t much like the idea of being confined to a class\nroom anymore, so I decided to start a geeky website and Youtube channel\ninstead. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never dreamed how many engineers around the world would\nfind my content and interact with me through it. It amazes me when people sent\na message or comment from the most remote parts of the world. There is an enormous\nfeel good factor knowing that the content we publish is helping people all\naround the world. Hopefully it will inspire others to join the industry and make\ntheir mark on the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you would like to support us in doing so, your help would\nbe much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e",
