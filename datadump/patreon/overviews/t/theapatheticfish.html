    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Alan Hernandez. I have 5 years in the hobby of miniature gaming and 3 years producing videos for youtube as The Apathetic Fish. At the time I\u0027m writing this I have \u00a0more than 20,000 youtube subscribers close to 180 videos and over 2,000,000 views.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is it I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI fell in love with miniature gaming 5 years ago. Being that the miniature hobby is getting more and more expensive by the year I decided to create a youtube channel where I\u0027d do tutorials, unboxings, reviews and such to monetize my videos and see if I could that way sustain my hobby. Turned out to be pretty good and there\u0027s a lot of positive feedback in the miniature gaming community supporting my channel. Sadly times are rough and the add revenue while is good to pay my internet connection and maybe a couple of miniature boxes is not enough to allow me to keep up with the way the community is evolving and the add revenue that I earn for my videos does not justify the large amounts of time and money that I invest producing videos. I do video tutorials because I love it but real life forces me to try and find a better job from which I can exist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need your help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMiniature gaming is expensive. Keeping up with new releases and different game systems is hard and very expensive for one person. Many people want me to make tutorials for the models they collect for different factions or games and it can be difficult especially if the model is a new release or is larger than a troop size model. Producing high quality videos is also very time consuming and I would like to get paid for doing it. Normal video add revenue is not enough for the amount of effort it takes to make the videos or the cost of the miniature and materials themselves. Your contributions will help me stay up to date bringing you fresh new content and also Improve the quality of my equipment. For example a new computer to render videos faster, better camera, better lighting equipment, microphones, pay for new miniatures, pay for the tools and materials, pay for books, and make this hobby not a financial hindrance from which I can actually get fair remuneration for my efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo money? No worries!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t have to pledge money if you can\u0027t afford it or you don\u0027t want to. By watching my videos and sharing them with your friends you are helping out a lot and if you can spread the word about this patreon account to people who like my channel and are willing and able to contribute you are helping a lot too."
