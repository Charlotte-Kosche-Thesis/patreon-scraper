More succinctly, it \u0027s a collection of some 300 forty \u2013 sixty minute interviews with accomplished authors, critics, poets, publishers, book makers \u0026amp; designers - biblio people - conducted by an excitable bibliophile.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Producing the show enables me to indulge my passion for books and to share what I learn on my travels.

There were only four or five of us in it, the perfect number if you ask me; enough of us to get a good selection of ideas on the table, not too many to cause separate conversations to break out. Then one of the key (okay you guys were all key!) members left to teach in the English Department at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. It was a crippling loss. The club couldn\u0027t recover from it.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI immediately missed the stimulating literary conversation. After a while I hit on an idea. I\u0027d host a radio program on books. Matthew Crozier agreed to let me host a show on CKCU FM 93.1, the Carleton University station in Ottawa. Only one hitch. The time slot. 6am Monday mornings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI toughed it out for a year or so, then took the easy way out. The show would be a podcast,\u00a0 produced and aired whenever I felt like it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the moment I launched The Biblio File I knew I was doing the right thing. The void had been filled. I live for this stuff: reading the books, recruiting, researching, connecting and conversing with the guests; editing the recordings; creating programs that I hope reward the listener.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing this show enables me to indulge my passion for books, and to share whatever I discover. It allows me to interview amazing authors, publishers, biographers, booksellers, book collectors, fine press proprietors, book designers... and many other fascinating people connected with the book;\u00a0 to engage them in conversation - and you know what Montaigne had to say about conversation:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my opinion, the most fruitful and natural play of the mind is in conversation. I find it sweeter than any other action in life; and if I were forced to choose, I think I would rather lose my sight than my hearing and voice.\u003c/div\u003eIf you love books, reading and good conversation, my hope is that you\u0027ll enjoy listening to The Biblio File.\u00a0The great thing about podcasts is that you don\u0027t have to wake up at 6am on Monday mornings to listen to them. Unless of course you want to.\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to devote the necessary time to The Biblio File \u2014 to flesh out the content in various subject categories and make the program as good as it can possibly be \u2014 the podcast needs to generate reliable revenue. Here you can help by sponsoring the show directly through Patreon for $1 a show. You\u0027ll get exclusive, bonus material on the people I interview and the places I visit.

Guests, famous and unknown alike, typically talk about books they\u0027ve written, made, sold, studied or collected. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to entertain and inform those who love, like, obsess over, or merely have a passing interest in books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve chosen to support the podcast,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ethanks again\u003c/strong\u003e for your generosity.
