Groundbreaking stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I donate or support this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn August 2017, I found myself out of work. In order to keep myself busy and not slip into any sort of malaise, I devoted upwards of 30 hours a week making the first round of videos that currently exist today on my channel. This kept me mentally active and feeling good about every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, I was able to find work again, however, this has put a dent in the amount of available time I have to make the kind of video quality I expect from myself. So your donations through Patreon help me be able to devote more time to this kind of work and less time to the other, boring kind of work. I live comfortably, so please only donate if you enjoy my work and simply wish to show appreciation. And thank you so, so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you teach me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI create content in two places.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly, I\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/thethoroughtank\"\u003e create Youtube content\u003c/a\u003e, mostly centered around Mythic+ dungeon guides, but also including other aspects of tanking in World of Warcraft, going into as much detail as I can while trying to keep them as accessible as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/thethoroughtank\"\u003eI stream regularly on Twitch\u003c/a\u003e, which encompasses everything from Mythic raiding, to practising high level keys with my dungeon team, Questionably Epic, to just hanging out and doing easy WoW content while conducting Q\u0026amp;A sessions with chat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
