We\u0027re starting this Patreon to fund appearances at events we don\u0027t profit from, but enjoy attending, expand the depth of our offerings, and eventually support the opening of physical stores. Our focus is on building an international community through tea knowledge, and we invite you to share that vision by pledging to support us at any level you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of community events, if you have any that could benefit from tea stands that sample anywhere from 3 to 7 teas at a time (At the cost of a \u0027good conversation\u0027), we\u0027d love to hear about them! We\u0027ve complimented Art galleries, weddings, church tea parties, coffee competitions, burner parties, steampunk conventions, and craft shows. Send us an email at TeaologieLLC@gmail.com."
