     "about": "The \"Database\" is probably the biggest source of typewriter serial numbers on the Internet today. As far as I know, it\u0027s even the most complete collection of serial numbers ever. But when you see the number of given brand names, it\u0027s still only a beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Database is also a collection of typewriter photo galleries from the collections of enthusiasts all over the world. These galleries are linked to manufacturers and not only serve as a valuable additional resource for research about various machines, but also are fun to page through and see what collectors have in their collections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis site was created by and for collectors of antique typewriters, with the help of many old documents and other collectors. Its primary task is to help collectors to date their typewriters by the serial numbers of the machines. The data in the database is pretty reliable, since listings of different sources were compared and evaluated, but please don\u0027t hold me responsible for any mistakes in old listings. For some of the brands there are no serial numbers available yet and I try to help with some information about the years of production in these cases. Step by step, I\u0027ll add data, which was researched by other collectors or by myself. In my opinion, it\u0027s very important to focus this information in the database, even when it might be fragmentary sometimes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince there were more than 1000 brands of typewriters all over the world, this web page will never contain all the information. But we try our best and we need help. So, if you have any information about serial numbers of typewriters and the related years of production, please e-mail them to me. I need them urgently! We have only the information we can get from old documents and colleague-collectors, so when you contribute, you will help everybody. Thank you for visiting this site. I hope you\u0027ll find what you are looking for.",
