His unique appearance makes him interesting to both humans and gods and he has to choose his allegiances wisely or fear for his life. Will he be able to find out where he came from and who he is?\u003cbr\u003eIt is a fantasy drama based in the setting of the ancient Aztec culture, and explores relationships of different romantic and non-romantic nature.\u003cbr\u003eI want to complete it and create more original comics and art with your help and input!\u003cbr\u003eOnce BTOM is done I want to make a print version available for readers to purchase.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming my patron you help me get closer to these goals and worry less about my job or health and family expenses. You help me continue doing what I love most and get to see how I do things step by step - from first idea to sketches to the finished comic/illustration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will regularly (at least once a week) post something new, mostly sketches and works in progress that I do not post anywhere else.

(There is no set date for these updates, at the moment they are once every one or two weeks. Keeping a regular schedule is at the moment impossible, due to health and family, but I\u0027m trying hard to get new pages done as fast as possible.) \u003cbr\u003eI have a full-time job and a child, so I won\u0027t be able to do livestreams, although I would have loved to offer you that. Maybe in the future that will change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat you\u0027re here reading this means that you have considered helping me, and alone for that I thank you. Even if you can\u0027t become a patron, BTOM will always be free to read at smackjeeves, so don\u0027t worry about that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to become a patron, my undying gratitude is yours as well as the respective reward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHugs for all who stopped by!\u003cbr\u003eTashina\u003cbr\u003e"
