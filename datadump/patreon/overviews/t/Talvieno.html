    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eHello!\u003c/h2\u003eI\u0027m Nathan \"Talvieno\" Weeks, and I\u0027ve created \u003ca href=\"http://forums.ltheory.com/viewforum.php?f=29\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea forum RPG called REKT\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s kind of like \u003cem\u003eDungeons \u0026amp; Dragons\u003c/em\u003e, except instead of five people meeting at a table each weekend, I have twenty players that live all over the world and can choose to interact with the game universe at any time. It\u0027s founded in science fiction, with lasers, spaceships, aliens, ship-to-ship combat and more. It has a deep plot that reaches far beyond each current mission and will stretch to the end of the campaign, and the players are fully capable of affecting the outcome. As of this year, it has a very wide selection of gear, a deep and complex universe, full NPC interaction, and very detailed updates for the players - complete with highly detailed maps and occasional 3d renders. All of this takes a lot to do, but it adds flavor, depth, and atmosphere to the game and the world it exists in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI dream of someday turning this into a full-fledged tabletop RPG that could sit alongside D\u0026amp;D and other RPGs like \u003cem\u003ePathfinder\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eCall of Cthulhu\u003c/em\u003e, so that anybody could get out a copy of REKT and set up their own campaign in the universe - not necessarily aboard the Tartarus, either, like today\u0027s REKT campaign, but anywhere they want! As crazy as it may sound, I know it\u0027s possible. I\u0027ve made games since I was a little kid, when I built little RPGs out of \u003cem\u003eLEGO\u003c/em\u003e for my brothers. Then I moved on to making computer games, and finally, we have REKT. I love writing, I love making games, and I love 3D modeling - and REKT is something that brings all of those loves together. I want to share it with the world. It\u0027ll be a long time getting there, but if we just do a little at a time, we can make it happen. Like Henry Ford once said - whether you think you can, or think you can\u0027t, you\u0027re right. I really, honestly think I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eNotice: Some people have opted to pay through PayPal rather than Patreon because of the large cut Patreon takes for overseas transactions. As of June 26th, 2016, I\u0027m actually earning $105 more per month than Patreon states.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AXtVujC.png\"\u003eMore about REKT\u0027s world:In REKT\u0027s universe, the year is 3152. Humanity \nhas taken over the galaxy, confining \nthe former inhabitants to barren worlds at the edge. These are dark \ntimes, heavy with specism, hatred and criminal activity. Prison \ncorporations such as Tartarus Inc. comb the galaxy with prison ships, taking on criminal inmates from planets they pass by for fees. Tartarus then utilizes the inmates to retrieve valuable substances and artifacts from dangerous locations. If an inmate successfully completes ten missions, they are set free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this campaign, every player is an inmate in Tartarus Inc.\u0027s \u003cem\u003ePlatoon 56\u003c/em\u003e. During each mission, players are dropped or flown to their Area of Operations in CASKETs - cheap mass-produced fighters - and it\u0027s up to the players to figure out how to accomplish the objective and get out alive. After each mission is over, players can enjoy a brief intermission aboard the Tartarus, where they\u0027re free to roleplay or visit the VR Combat Simulator. They can also upgrade their ship and purchase new equipment and weaponry via a Tartarus-specific currency.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eREKT was inspired by a Bay12 forum RPG called \u003ca href=\"http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=106279.0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEinsteinian Roulette\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSome map images:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/oNN1Jq1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/oNN1Jq1m.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/AeQhetW.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AeQhetWm.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/ySNhnkR.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ySNhnkRm.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/rajynKF.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rajynKFm.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOther REKT art:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/qz25aAQl.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/x9ICmT2l.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7EaIx8yl.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Eif14Hml.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
