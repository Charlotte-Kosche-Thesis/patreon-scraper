Have you ever? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe majority of people will never talk about their abortion experiences, and very few people will ever hear their stories. I created The Abortion Diary in order to create a community around an experience that can be extremely isolating and overly politicized, and provide an intimate space for sharing, listening and, most importantly, feeling listened to by others.The Abortion Diary is the intersection of self-expression, healing, and the art of story-sharing and story-listening. I have always been dedicated to creating a space for people to share stories they haven\u0027t been able to share and listen to stories they haven\u0027t been able to hear.
