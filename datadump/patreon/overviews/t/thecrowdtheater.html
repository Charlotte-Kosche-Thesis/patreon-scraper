At the base level, you get \u003cstrong\u003eunlimited access to shows at our theater for just $5 a month\u003c/strong\u003e. We hope this not only makes it more affordable for those who wish to see shows at our theater, but will also provide our theater with a consistent audience, making our shows more worthwhile for both performers and audience members.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who don\u0027t live in Chicago, feel free to donate, and should you ever find yourself in our city we would be more than happy to have you come see some shows at our theater. While we\u0027ve been lucky enough to enjoy a reasonable level of success in our first year, any and all proceeds we receive will always go towards improving our theater and furthering our mission of diversity, inclusivity, and affordability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you have any questions or want to get in contact with us, please feel free to message us on Facebook or shoot us an email at info@thecrowdtheater.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll donations to the Crowd Theater are tax deductible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
