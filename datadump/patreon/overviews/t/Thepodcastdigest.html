    "summary": "Hello podcast lovers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Dan Lizette and host a little show called \"The Podcast Digest\"! Since September 2014, I\u0027ve released a show weekly featuring podcast recommendations and interviews with hosts of podcasts, both big and small, to take you behind the scenes of the best shows around! \u00a0I absolutely love doing the show and hopefully you\u0027ve enjoyed listening! \u00a0I want to take the show to the next level, but I think I\u0027m going to need help to do it! \u00a0See.. here\u0027s the thing. \u00a0Between my day job, my 2nd job and my family time is very tough to find the time to solicit guests for interviews, to record, to edit, to publish and promote the show. \u00a0In fact, there are some ideas I\u0027ve had that I\u0027d like to improve things with (see the Rewards!), but I can\u0027t seem to be able to get there. \u00a0I am one guy, famously working from my basement, and want to be able to do even more! \u00a0In a year a half, I\u0027ve invested in new audio equipment, software and hosting to make sure the show is a good as can be! \u00a0But to do that I need to cut back on the \u0027other things\u0027 (well, maybe not the family time!) to be able to invest it back into the show! \u00a0I\u0027ve tried merchandise and t-shirt campaigns, but now is time to appeal to you, the listeners to see if you will me out with a little tiny push into the next level!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cs9y6pbWEAAxcqU.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see from the above, I\u0027ve been very fortunate to bring interviews with some of the biggest names in Podcasts (99% PI, Lore, ATP and so many more!) as well as some \u0027up and coming\u0027 indy podcasters whom I\u0027ve become huge fans of like Dark Angels and Pretty Freaks, Couple Things Podcast and 7 Days a Geek! And tons more in between! I\u0027ve brought you new friends, great content and hours of entertainment! \u00a0But I\u0027ve only scratched the surface of the huge catalog of great stuff available out there! \u00a0And I want to be able to keep bringing it to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CbIaMpYWAAUys2p.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Podcast Digest has been featured in the Itunes Podcast App in a featured collection, appeared on several top charts and has become one of the premiere homes for great interviews and stories from great hosts and producers! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027d like to be a part of the show\u0027s future growth, I\u0027d be forever indebted to you! \u00a0So check out the cool rewards and see if you might share a little love with this \u0027one man show\u0027! \u00a0I deeply appreciate all of the support!"
