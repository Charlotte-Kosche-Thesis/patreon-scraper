    "summary": "The Reformed Gamers started with the question, \"Can Christians play video games?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe answer? Absolutely. But what does that even look like? Is it about having the best K/D in Call of Duty? Is it about how many Platinum Trophies, or 100%, you have on your games? How much time can Christians play before it\u0027s too much? How can you even glorify God while gaming? The Reformed Gamers has been around for 3 years, asking these questions, and giving answers rooted in God\u0027s Word. We have done this show via podcasts and recently branching out onto YouTube and Twitch. It\u0027s been an exciting and encouraging time as we reform (eh? get it? ;) ) the way we play games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e But now, we need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are at a pivotal point where we sense God\u0027s calling to continue to grow and be a resource for the Christian gamers out there. But in order to grow, we need your help. By pledging to The Reformed Gamers, you\u0027ll be investing in a ministry that God started 3 years ago. You\u0027ll be part of the Deer Listeners (don\u0027t worry, we\u0027ll explain that later): a vibrant community of like-minded gamers. You\u0027ll have an active role in helping us provide content that helps you in your walk with the Lord. It\u0027s been an amazing journey so far. Won\u0027t you join us?"
