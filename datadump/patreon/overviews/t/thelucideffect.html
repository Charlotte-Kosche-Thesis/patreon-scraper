    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Declan Ramsay and I put out music as The Lucid Effect. TLE has just released it\u0027s 2nd EP and gone on its first tour, which is super rad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I put out this new EP I did something I hadn\u0027t done before, which is charge a minimum amount to download it. I\u0027m really for having music being accessible and available to all, but also I was curious as what kind of effect having a small paywall would do to people downloading it. What I found is that the people who pay for it were incredibly generous in their support, but the overall amount of people downloading it dropped pretty significantly compared to my first EP as The Lucid Effect, which had no minimum price.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that in mind, I\u0027m giving Patreon a go. It means for you awesome people who can \u0026amp; want to support me financially can do so, people who can\u0027t support me financially can still get this music, and I can hopefully get some money together to make more things! From orchestral scores, to music as The Lucid Effect, to quantum-physics inspired vocal pieces (parallel universes for the win), to terrible love songs for Republican Candidates (\"I\u0027m a Gamblin\u0027 Man But You\u0027ve Trumped My Heart\"), I have a huge bunch of projects that I am really excited to get started on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for supporting me.\u003cbr\u003elet\u0027s make stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ex Declan\u003cbr\u003e"
