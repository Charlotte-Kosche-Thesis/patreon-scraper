She is a multiracial trans woman with well over a decade experience working with feminist and LGBTQ organizations and currently serves as board chair at Gender Justice League as well as working as Communications Director at Gay City: Seattle\u2019s LGBTQ Center. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith her background in activism, she operates her own media production company, Handbasket Productions, creating stories and entertainment that reflect community needs and values, including her erotic documentary series Doing it Online as well as her just released anthology - Nerve Endings: The New Trans Erotic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAbout this patreon\u003c/h3\u003eThis patreon used to primarily support Doing It Online, and your support still comes with a membership log in. However, updates have slowed to very infrequent and the focus on this patreon has shifted. Instead of rushing to produce new episodes released monthly, I\u0027ll be focusing on roughly one major project per year, with smaller creative works popping up now and then, posting monthly updates about the projects I\u0027m working on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn 2016 I edited Nerve Endings: The New Trans Erotic, an anthology of short fiction exploring trans experiences of sex, sexuality, and relationships\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn 2017/2108, I will be working on Fallen Star, a one woman play about a trans superhero turned villain (scheduled to show in Seattle in May 2018).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn 2018/2019, I expect to be working on a new volume of Nerve Endings, possibly with a specific thematic focus\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther projects may include spoken word performances, storytelling, short stories, children\u0027s books, stand up comedy, conference workshops, non-profit trainings, activist interventions. You\u0027ll get updates about it all, and occasionally about the political organizing I\u0027m doing in Seattle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat your support means\u003c/h3\u003eTo be clear, I\u0027ve got a full time job right now, it means I\u0027m producing things more slowly, but also that I don\u0027t need to rely on this patreon to support myself. But your support is still meaningful, here is just a bit of what it will do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay webhosting fees to keep DoingitOnline.com and my other websites open.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAllow me to hire other artists for collaborations.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCover travel to present my work in other parts of the country.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWith enough support, I could potentially even take a short sabbatical to complete a major project.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eBut most importantly, this will be a way to keep in touch with those of you who\u0027ve been interested in my work, let you know about things I\u0027m working on that aren\u0027t ready to be public yet, and share major releases with. \u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s actually incredibly meaningful to have a network of people interested in my work and who would like to help spread the word when different things come up. \u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s why backing at the $1 or even following without making any pledge is still very helpful. Thank you!\u003c/strong\u003e"
