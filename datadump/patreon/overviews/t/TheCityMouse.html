(No exaggeration) Could this be more of a set up for a sitcom? I\u0027ll be learning how to get by, tame the wilderness, and tackle new crafts. It\u0027s going to be a bumpy road, but I am ready to make something happen! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also got some big ideas brewing on fiber arts crafts and a \"farm-to-table\" approach I am eager to make happen. This is where I raise the animals, shear them, spin the fiber, dye it, and then crochet beautiful crafts from them. Each piece of craft being accompanied by a bio of its journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, here we are. I just opened up my Etsy shop. I\u0027m beginning a blog with videos added as I can (also new to editing so that\u0027ll be fun) so everyone can join in on the fun as I learn, craft, and live.

I want to have videos for each kit that I put out so you can crochet along with me knowing I am using the same materials you ordered, looking at the same pattern and doing the exact project you are working so everything is wonderfully clear. Lastly, I\u0027d like to start streaming so I can hang out with all of you while I tackle new projects, kits, and commissions. All while we chill together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far all I have for this is my laptop. My You Tube and Twitch channels are all set up and waiting for content. I need a\u00a0separate camera with a rig to give you all a top down clear look at what I\u0027m doing. The next thing will be an additional monitor so that I can better manage everything on the stream so it can be more awesome for all of you (even adding some give-a-ways\u00a0;)\u00a0\u00a0)\u00a0",
