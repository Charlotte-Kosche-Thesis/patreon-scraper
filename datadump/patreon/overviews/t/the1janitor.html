    "summary": "Thanks for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho am I?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://the1janitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hiimt1j.gif\" style=\"width: 400px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Kevin, but you can call me T1J, if you like. T1J is short for \"the1janitor\" which is a username I created on a whim when I was a kid, that has become my personal brand. Kind of weird how that works. What does \"the1janitor\" mean, you ask? I\u0027ll tell you later.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a professional content creator, which basically means I make stuff and then put it on the internet and hopefully enough people like it that I can make a living doing it. Right now, my main platform is creating videos for YouTube, and I\u0027ve been a serious YouTuber for around 7 years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy am I asking for money?\u003c/h3\u003eAs mentioned, I\u0027m a professional content creator. The basic way you make money doing this is through advertising. Given the kind of videos I make though, this can be difficult. I sometimes like to talk about tough, controversial issues which are increasingly being neglected by advertisers, especially on YouTube. \u00a0On top of that, I try to make inclusive, optimistic videos that stress the importance of nuance, but those types of videos simply don\u0027t get the traction and exposure as decontextualized rants or low effort \"response videos\" that are designed to be pumped out frequently and generate drama. However, with Patreon I have a real shot at making the types of videos I actually love and making them sustainable. If you like those kinds of videos too, consider becoming a patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I do a weekly livestream (every Sunday sometime around 2-3 PM Central time), on my YouTube channel, where I interact directly with the viewers. These streams are usually very laid back Q\u0026amp;A sessions, where we discuss recent news and current events, as well topics like social issues and pop culture -- basically whatever\u0027s on the minds of myself and people in my audience. These livestreams do not generate much income, they\u0027re simply a way to hang out with you guys in a more relaxed, personal way. If you enjoy that kind of thing, supporting on Patreon is a good way to help me make it sustainable!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat am I going to do with the money?\u003c/h3\u003e All contributions here will go towards meeting my financial obligations so I can focus on making more and better videos for my viewers, as well as towards equipment and other costs associated with improving the quality and frequency of my uploads.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHere are some things I\u0027ve been able to buy, entirely because of Patreon support:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61o1s7nk7ML._SX522_.jpg\" style=\"width: 141px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71H9XbRZmlL._SX522_.jpg\" style=\"width: 141px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712iGcE8YgL._SY679_.jpg\" style=\"width: 86px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618TVXD771L._SL1278_.jpg\" style=\"width: 108px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo get an idea of what kinds of things I\u0027m looking forward to buying/doing in the future, check out my \u003cstrong\u003eGoals\u003c/strong\u003e section which should be just to the left of what your reading now!\u003cbr\u003eThe main idea for the time being is getting equipment and other resources that make it possible for me to make more videos, better videos, and to engage with you guys even more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patron is obviously completely optional and will not affect your ability to watch my videos or livestreams, which will always be free on YouTube (or somewhere else on the internet).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you only want to make a one-time donation, or if you want to find other ways to support me,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://the1janitor.com/support/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003echeck out this link!\u003c/a\u003e"
