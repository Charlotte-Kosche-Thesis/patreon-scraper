Not all kids have the access to this type of mentor-ship and why not.... all kids should have an opportunity,\u00a0 More importantly teens who are underprivileged and statistics say don\u0027t stand a chance. I\u0027m looking to foster blooming artists lost in a sea of self doubt. It will involve teaching them about photography how to use a professional camera and most importantly boosting their self esteem. The idea that artists are a dying breed scares me. I can\u0027t imagine the world without people who were encouraged to create. Your pledge will help me put together the program. as a start, I am looking to purchase equipment for the kids to use during their mentoring sessions. They includes things like DSLR cameras a projector, and two laptops meals for the children an award for participation and galleries of their work will be hosted.",
