We live in Nepal and are loving it. We\u0027ve done all sorts of jobs before we started vlogging, from janitorial work to English teaching (both jobs were not at the same school, that would be awkward...).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ\u0026amp;A;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow long you been at this?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarted YouTubing in August 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat\u0027s your niche?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot your run-of-the-mill travel vlogging, but we focus on doing out of the ordinary things in out of the way places. We get hands on instead of just spectate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou guys married?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYep, to eachother.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do you want from me?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want you to help out if you desire and have the circumstances. We don\u0027t charge for our content, but we only get a small amount from YouTube.\u00a0The more support we have, the higher quality our content will be able to be. More than that, it ensures our ability to continue creating!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo this is basically a money grab, not some new innovation that will enrich our lives? Is that what I\u0027m getting right now?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, that\u0027s a little blunt, but yes, this a platform to get funding to creators by viewers who want the creators to continue and to succeed. As explained in our Patreon video, we feel uncomfortable rewarding our viewers based on how much money they give us, as many viewers are not in the circumstances to support us monetarily.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFair enough. Did you know my school had a teacher who was also the janitor?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo I didn\u0027t. Cool...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo, like, I give a dollar a month? Isn\u0027t that like an insult, like tipping a waiter a penny?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, every bit adds up, if it makes you feel better, you can donate $5 per month which would be just over a dollar per video if we were doing one video per week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can we expect if we all help out, and give a little?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will use the funds for our video ideas, especially to travel to far out regions of Nepal and beyond. Our projects include India, China, Mongolia, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Turkey, Lebanon and beyond. Our international projects will be made possible by crowdfunding. If our channel is all about, travel, well...we gotta travel, don\u0027t we?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI suppose so. We get anything else by being a Patron for you guys?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know some of our viewers aren\u2019t in the circumstances to donate, and we respect them as much as those that are in the position to help out. We want the motive behind any patrons donations to be from the heart. Therefore, we don\u0027t offer specific rewards exclusively to patrons.\u00a0However, we do suggest you subscribing to our newsletter to keep up to date in a more personal way, which you can subscribe to here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://eepurl.com/bsqbWD\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://eepurl.com/bsqbWD\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAny last words?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, that\u0027s long enough. Wait, yes, there is something. Thank you. To all, whatever you can do, thank you very much for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
