    "summary": "What\u0027s going on everyone, It\u0027s TheNSCL (or The Niskel if you want to pronounce it phonetically).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess, um... hmm... where should I start?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create comedic reviews of different animated media, mainly anime and cartoons, but sometimes I\u0027ll review manga if I\u0027m feeling REALLY daring... and all in increments of seconds (3 seconds, 30 seconds and 300+ seconds or First Impression, Summary, and Analysis/Final Thoughts). When I\u0027m not joking over animated silliness, I talk over video games in an informative/comedic manner because I love video games. I want to show them off as best I can so that others can see how cool a game is and maybe they\u0027ll play it themselves. Sometimes I have my friend Ultra Director Jester join me in a co-op LP and shoot the shit while having fun with a game. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I do the things I do? I love animated media; the fact that someone can put still images into a moving sequence and create something out of seemingly nothing is fascinating to me. I just love watching them \u0027moving pitchers\u0027 and love seeing what people can create, the good and the bad. Yeah, sometimes my reviews can dip into the negative because I want to see all sides of animated media... no matter how bad it gets. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the video game side; As mentioned above, I LOVE video games for almost the same reasons as my reviews. The fact that a video game can invoke different emotions, different subject matters, different play styles, everything about video games is an interest to me. I like seeing how ambitious some games can get and when I see a game that really interests me, I want to show other people. I\u0027ve explored the Danganronpa franchise, Resident Evil, Mario, Spyro, many different franchises all in an attempt to show people how cool these games are. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObligatory TL;DR - I like making people laugh while making fun of animated shows and show people awesome games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now you must be wondering... why Patreon? In all honesty, this was made as an alternate version of donations. If people want to support my channel, that is up to them. I would eventually like these reviews and Let\u0027s Plays to be a job as opposed to just being my hobby, but at this moment I cannot. Right now I work a 40-50 hr a week job and I make videos in my free time. The donations would help me purchase review material and any storage/recording equipment for the Let\u0027s Plays. If anything, this Patreon would help speed up the process for making videos. Again, this is all optional, but anything is appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s it, the most important parts anyways. Thanks for taking the time to read this and if you want, check out some of my reviews and Let\u0027s Plays to see if I\u0027m worth donating towards. Also thank god that Sonic \u002706 goal will never be reached, just imagine if... it... made it... heheh...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
