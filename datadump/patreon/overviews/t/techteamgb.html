    "summary": "If you\u0027ve seen my channel or website, you\u0027ll know I make videos about PC gaming hardware. I love what I do, and it\u0027s awesome to get to share that with you. Here\u0027s the thing though, I\u0027m self employed. This is my full time job and I\u0027m now living with a life-long health condition that keeps me in pain basically 24/7. I\u0027m 20 right now, and like everyone else I\u0027ve got my bills to pay - happily though I\u0027m ok on that front. Sponsors, Amazon affiliates and Youtube adsense covers the basics and that\u0027s great.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had a load of requests for second hand tech guides/builds, worldwide giveaways, DIY projects and a whole load of other stuff that I can\u0027t just get from companies - it costs money. I don\u0027t have much spare right now, so if you are interested in seeing any of those things, or want to make sure that no matter how much Youtube messes with its creator\u0027s revenues, I\u0027ll still be here making videos, then you can chip in here.\u00a0Here\u0027s where the Patreon page comes in, and where you can help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re someone running adblock (and honestly, I don\u0027t blame you), this is also a great way to support me. Of course, the most valuable resource right now is your attention. Advertisers want that, a lot, so if you are a Silver tier or up supporter, you\u0027ll have access to videos with Youtube ads turned off, as well as any in-video ads removed too. You\u0027ll still get the full sponsored content, as I do my best to make enjoyable videos regardless of who pays for it, but of course you can choose to not watch them if you prefer. As always, I make sponsorships clear so you can make that decision!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, no matter how much you can afford, you\u0027ll get something in return. Whether it\u0027s access to the Patreon feed, early videos, livestreams, private discord chat, or anything else you can see here, you should be at least close to getting your money\u0027s worth!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not one to ask for help much (ask my partner...), but this could be awesome so why not, right? Any questions about this, hit me up on Twitter (@techteamgb) and I\u0027ll be happy to answer."
