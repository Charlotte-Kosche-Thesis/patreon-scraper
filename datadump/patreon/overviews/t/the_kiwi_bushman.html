We are slowly getting there and I am now able to dedicate the majority of my time towards video production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0What changes will the $10k target goal enable?\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0-I get a camera operator!!! At the moment I do a lot of filming of hunting and fishing and being a one man band is a bit of a mission as I need to hunt and fish and capture it all on film. Luckily I have patient mates that allow extra time for all the mucking around that comes with video production. Having a camera man will leave me free to be more creative and focus on the storyline and shots I need as well as enabling me to actually do more hunting and fishing and presenting. Freeing me up to direct will make the productions a lot smoother and more enjoyable.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0-I am slowly managing to upgrade the camera gear, drone, better lenses etc...\u00a0 The environments I film in are very hard on gear and equipment is always getting broken. Having more equipment and better equipment will lift the production quality immensly.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0-You get monthly live prize giveaways with audience interaction and Q\u0026amp;A\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0-Hitting 10 grand a month will enable me to produce a top quality, 20 minute video weekly, with a variety of content featuring us, our \nfriends and family out hunting and fishing with more kiwi culture, plus clips posted on social media every couple of days\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0-\u0027The Department of Awesome\u0027 \nnewsletter gets mailed monthly - this is focused on living a happier and\n healthier life and making your situation in life as awesome as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0-Regular social media snippets of where I am and what Im up to for patrons only - bar shouts when Im at your local and other cool stuff. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0-Better content, more areas visited, North island, all round the South island and Stewart and Chatam Islands.
