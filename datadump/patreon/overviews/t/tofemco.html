    "summary": "T.O.FemCo [tee-oh-fem-co], a Toronto Feminist Collective, is a group of women and non-binary identified people who are passionate about intersectional feminism.T.O.FemCo is trans-inclusive, queer-positive and strongly committed to an anti-racist and anti-oppressive approach. We are rooted in the heart of Toronto.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eT.O.FemCo first began in spring 2015 as a book club where feminists who like to read could discuss a variety of books using a feminist lens and a sense of humour. Since then, we have grown into a community that supports each other, shares communal meals at monthly potlucks, plans social gatherings for Toronto feminists, and attends community and activist events. Members of T.O.FemCo work on various projects including hosting the podcast Underwire: Support for the Girls, writing for the blog and continuing to host our bookclub.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eT.O.FemCo started Underwire in the spring of 2016 because we wanted to bring our dynamic feminist book club conversations to the public sphere. We were inspired by each other and wanted to create a podcast that shares our stories and experiences. As we have moved forward the group has changed and the demands of the podcast have changed. We want to bring more contributors to the podcast and share stories from marginalized people. In doing so, we want to be able to provide monetary compensation because often their labour is taken for granted and profited from. We also want to expand and create a space for local feminists to gather and support each other. Being a feminist is so hard and we need to be there for each other IRL. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll proceeds raised from Patreon is going to covering our costs for the website, running the podcast, paying contributors, hosting events, materials/equipment, and other podcast related expenses. So far we have been self-funded or have relied on the proceeds from a community fundraiser. Any contributions would mean that you are supporting T.O.FemCo\u2019s efforts to foster a feminist community and share important stories that don\u2019t often get told. As women, our thoughts and opinions are often devalued and it is so rare to find spaces that include us - that\u2019s why we made one. Join us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone who has contributed to T.O.FemCo so that we could create Underwire. We appreciate every person who has been able to do this and you are integral to the work we create.\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e"
