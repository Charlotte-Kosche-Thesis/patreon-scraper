Unfortunately, the ability to manipulate my writing into PDFs won\u0027t be free, and that\u0027s where I hope you guys will come in.

The Write Nerd has a following and it means that something\u0027s being done right! Now would be the time to start considering other creative options. Having generosity like this coming in would give me peace of mind and the ability to seriously consider self-publishing my novel. I can begin looking at other Freelancing options out there. Things like Ghostwriting would no longer be out of reach! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, I\u0027d have more time to consider what other business we can get into here at The Write Nerd. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
