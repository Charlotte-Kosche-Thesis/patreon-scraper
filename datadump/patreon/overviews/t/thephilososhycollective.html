With this we\u0027ll be able to dedicate our time COMPLETELY to the community... or at least that\u0027s the hope. Times will be tough but it\u0027s still just more than we live off now. ^^;;",

     "description": "Normally most of our medicine money comes from patreon cause it doesn\u0027t get covered any other way and takes a lot of pressure off the other expenses. Money that we spend from patreon is money that we don\u0027t have to spend from the SSI account. Medicine Money goes away in 600-650 USD chunks because that\u0027s just how it is to buy medicine in bulk and normally we save up for a bit to do that. This would allow all our medicine expenses to be taken care of without any worry at all and we can experience less anxiety, body pain and focus better, letting us be more productive!\u003cbr\u003e",

We will never have to worry about medicine expenses, we\u0027re making more than the Gov gives for SSI and thus free from THAT tether and we would have enough money to work off any expenses like utilities, food, clothing and other such mundane effects! THIS is our end goal! Financial Independence and Stability! Times being easy, Patreon and other such networks will be able to take ALL our waking time when not training, eating sleeping, etc!

If we already HAD some deal for land by this time (one can only hope at the moment) we\u0027ll be able to pay things off faster and afford better utilities for the situation, that we might be able to create that much more content... suffice to say this is incentive to do more!",
