A lot of people enjoyed it, and still do. Now I\u2019m making How to Host a Dungeon V2. Along the way I also plan to make a lot of new drawings and maps.

I have illustrated for several games, such as Dungeon World and Blossoms are Falling. I\u2019ve also written a few.

The second reason is that with Patreon I\u2019m connected with the people who are most interested in my work. If no one\u2019s interested in what I\u2019m doing, I lose interest too. Making things for people and seeing them used is a huge reward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://tonydowler.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Lake-Dungeon_small.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

Gage focuses intensely on technique, which is why it\u0027s a great value for me. Figure drawing is one area of real interest to me, as it will enable me to expand the range of what I draw.\u003cbr\u003e",
