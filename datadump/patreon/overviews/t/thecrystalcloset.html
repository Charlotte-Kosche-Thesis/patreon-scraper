So, we need your angelic-heroics, to open it ASAP, as well as to expand our reach, including fulfilling the visionary purpose of our sanctuary here. We meet new people every single day who want to make our place, their home. In order to fill the need, desire and be here for the long haul, we need your ongoing support. When going not-for-profit, didn\u0027t seem to be the path, the Universe took us in another direction, and instead brought us to Patreon \u2014 \u00a0thank goodness for that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from being a sacred sanctuary for some, and without becoming a church or not-for-profit (wasn\u0027t exactly in the cards), Patreon is a way to accept funding and evolve with our Patrons. We can do what we came to do, fulfill our purpose and fill another request simultaneously: We also started this Patreon portal to fill a nagging need, one that our spiritual family has been begging us to find a way to implement. That is, some type of membership that works for all of us. One that offers lots to experience while providing us the means to provide more and more, evolutionary experiences for you \u2014 a win-win, mutual benefit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur long-time worldly patrons know how many things we have been saying we want to do over the past seven years to expand our teaching, such as write books, gather more, give you all bundled gifts and especially crystals, one-on-one sessions and coaching both online and in-person, artfully mindful workshops, presence presentations, easy downloads, how-to\u0027s, videos, DIY\u0027s, educate, help you meditate, etc., all for a \"packaged membership\".

Consider our way, \"manifested\"! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow when you become a Patron here on Patreon, your wish is granted to get more deeply involved in our wonderful sanctuary, and our wish is granted to truly expand to our truest potential.

So you can\u0027t make it in? \u2014 Well in this system of support, you help to ensure that when you do come, that we\u0027ll be here. Someone has to help us keep the lights on... Be an angel...
