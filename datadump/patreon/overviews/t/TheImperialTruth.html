    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Imperial Truth\u003c/strong\u003e is the first fully dedicated Horus Heresy Podcast. On the show we delve into the quite massive \u0027history\u0027 of the Heresy via the Black Library productions, we also\u00a0talk about the quite amazing models that Forgeworld put out and the rules system in which we love to play with those models. In addition to this the podcast is firmly aimed at encouraging the community to grow and develop within itself, to this end we cover events, whether these are official ones or run\u00a0on the independent scene, how to get the most in terms of painting and modelling and anything else that may come up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFanatic Podcast \u003c/strong\u003eis a show that looks at the whole Games Workshop hobby from books to gaming to licensed products and much more. So if you are interested in Specialist Games, licensed RPGs or maybe how we approach some of the less clearly defined topics that surround the hobby and community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why run a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main reason I have started this campaign is because I have been asked to by some of my listeners. I have been asked if there is a way that they can \u0027give back\u0027 to the show which they enjoy listening to and engage with - this is the most important reason for me to be running this campaign and I hope to use the money they give me to make the show that they listen to better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a number of costs associated with running a podcast and this means that the purchasing new equipment is delayed due that money being absorbed by the fees that have to be paid to keep the show up and available. Things like mobile recording devices, mixer, microphones and replacing bits of tech that fail or break. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the other desires I have is to attend events in a \u0027journalistic\u0027 capacity, this would work to help promote those events but to also to show off the nature of the community that attends and hopefully encourage more people to join us at the table.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of Patreon as a tip jar, a nod of the hat to the podcast that you consume, the show will always be free and if whether you choose to support this campaign or not then I thank you for your support in listening to the show. \u003cbr\u003e"
