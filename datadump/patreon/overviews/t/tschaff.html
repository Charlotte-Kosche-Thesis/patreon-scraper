    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"https://americanplus.us/images/29373_401938645806_1564225_n.jpg\"\u003eHi, I\u0027m Jeff, the creator of the Pairing Decoder.  Before becoming an American Airlines flight attendant, I worked on IT projects for United Airlines and as a freelancer.  My mission is simple, use software to make our lives easier and schedules more flexible.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I write this, around two years ago, I was in a meeting trying to get our company to build us better software. They approved it.  Some in our union demanded control of the project and in my estimation they were not talented enough to deliver the popular features flight attendants were asking for.  Many nights I\u0027d come home and vent to my wife about how badly the meetings went.  The designs the programmers were getting from us were shamefully bad. In the end, the union official won and I was kicked out of the project.  Shortly after, my wife and I got married.  Instead of having a wedding ceremony, my wife urged me to use the funds to build the Pairing Decoder instead.  My wife knew that I felt like I had let our community down, and she said that if I don\u0027t build this, I\u0027ll regret it forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never required anyone to pay in a nerdy attempt to promote kindness and goodwill within our community.  However, to keep the servers humming, it requires both me and my loving wife to work many days per month extra, and we don\u0027t have another wedding fund to make the changes it needs to keep running after FOI.  Cruelty is one of the main obstacles to achieving a strong and effective union.  Our inferior software and weak contract/contract enforcement are a direct result of cruelty.  Other unions have been rejected after reaching out to us in order to work together on matters that benefit all flight attendants.  We can all do a better job being good to one another, we must if we\u0027re to be better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoftware like this is difficult to build even under ideal conditions. Features that are easy to explain like \"arrival time\" are hard to implement.  What would be two step task for the company ends up taking twenty steps from the outside.  Doing this from the outside means a custom web browser had to be made that automates logging in, compensating for expiring passwords, invalid logins, errors, then surfs to the correct pages and finds the start and end of the data you want on the page and delivers it to you in the timezone you requested.  Doing things this way requires multitudes more code, requires more frequent maintenance, bigger servers, but it works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you believe in what I\u0027m doing, and would like to see me continue to build and improve our software, I\u0027ll need your support.  If EVERY user were to contribute $3.50 a month which is less than your van tips for a three-day trip, I\u0027d be able to pay the monthly server bill. If you\u0027re able to give $8.33 or more a month I\u0027ll include ETB alerts as a special thank you.\u00a0 With ETB alerts, you get a notification when a trip you want gets dropped so you won\u0027t have to stalk the trade board anymore.  Giving is optional, I don\u0027t mind working extra to bring this service to those going through tough times.  However, if you\u0027re able to give, you\u0027d be directly responsible for delivering more flexibility and convenience to our community which is a wonderful thing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you and safe travels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJeff (Tsch\u00e4ff) Reisberg"
