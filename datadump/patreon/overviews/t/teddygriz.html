Must be 18+ to be a patron and view my work. Viewer discretion is advised.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Teddygriz, an online content creator of cartoons. I range in content rating between mundane and most bizarre, sometimes dabbling in less than SFW content when the mood strikes me. I am flexible in the content I cover, so certain niche groups may commission me for content themes that aren\u0027t for everyone. \u003cstrong\u003ePlease keep an open mind and don\u0027t judge or harass anyone for the content you see posted.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it stands, I am currently job hunting and am using art as a stopgap to pay the bills. I would love to make creating content my full time job but until its profitable enough and I\u0027m able to assure being able to support myself, it just isn\u0027t realistic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonations from this page would go to pay bills, buy groceries, upgrade equipment for drawing/streaming, and just support this artist in general. But the total amount monthly would need to be comparable to that of a full time job for me to focus on this as a profession and provide a satisfactory array of perks and rewards for patrons and supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo until that time comes, this patreon is simply a donation page. I\u0027m looking to reinvigorate how I approach art and cartooning, doing more work that I enjoy and putting more of myself into the craft. If you want to support an artist doing what he enjoys, then thank you kindly for everything that you do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be looking to expand what I offer here as well as diversify the content when I am able to upgrade my equipment. Improving my computer, tablet, and even allowing myself to do better quality streams of different content are all things I would love to do when I am able to afford it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to check me out and let\u0027s see where this weird journey takes us."
