I will also give you all my undying gratitude! I will also host a mix-and-match challenge, where you, my supporters, comment and vote on what type of challenge you want me to do next, what subject matter you wish the finished piece to have, and what medium you want to see it completed with! I will then select three random comments, and mix the votes and create a piece using only those votes! :D Crazy? HAH! ...Crazy like a fox. \u0026gt;3\u0026gt;",
