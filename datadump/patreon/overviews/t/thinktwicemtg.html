    "summary": "Think Twice is a weekly podcast hosted by Ali Aintrazi and Justin Parnell that looks at a variety of topics from dual and occasionally opposing points of view. Ali and Justin primarily discuss the world revolving sound Magic; the Gathering, but touch on movies, music, other games, general pop culture, and personal musings. \nThink Twice is directed and produced by Jonathan Choi, with additional direction from Justin Parnell and additional producing from Ali Aintrazi.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJustin Parnell has been ingrained in Magic and it\u0027s culture since first opening a Might of Oaks from an Urza\u0027s Legacy booster pack in 1999. Justin\u0027s world has revolved around Magic since.   He\u0027s played competitively to a plethora of 9th place finishes in formats from Standard to Vintage (his current favorite) and has providing years of content in the casual formats of Cube (\"Cubers Anonymous\") and Commander (\"Commander VS\") for StarCityGames.com, making him one of the most knowledgeable and practiced figures in each format. After 25 years in North Carolina,  Justin currently resides in Roanoke, VA and earns his living managing the Acquisitions Department at Star City Games, after 11 years in the footwear industry. When he\u0027s not thinking about Magic, Justin is watching his Duke Blue Devils and Green Bay Packers, playing\u003cbr\u003eMTG Arena\u00a0and Hearthstone in his underwear, or managing his life in the form of spreadsheets.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAli Aintrazi has been around Magic for almost twenty years. He\u0027s a professional magic player with multiple SCG Open wins, a SCG Invitational win, earning his own angel token, he\u0027s played in the Player\u0027s Championship and he was the last player to win US Nationals making him our \"forever national champion.\" Ali is known for his innovative decks, finding and playing the cards that others tend to look over. He is the creator of such decks as \"Five color Door Control\", \"Naya Dragons\", \"Turbolands \", \"Loam Pox\", \"Sanity Grinding\" \"UB Heartless Summoning\", \"Grand Architect Control\" and many more. If it\u0027s insight into exciting new decks/cards or just deck building in general, Ali has you covered. When Ali is not playing Magic he is spending time with his family, walking his Dragonite on Pokemon Go, or being an all-around bad ass.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
