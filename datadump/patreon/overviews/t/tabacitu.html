    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe :DigitallyHappy Manifesto\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know how during the ancient times \u0026amp; middle ages, the well-off supported painters, writers etc., just so they can \u003cem\u003edo their thing\u003c/em\u003e? That\u0027s what I\u0027m asking you to do here, but with $1/month. If it sounds pitiful, pretentious or unrealistic, well... it \u003cem\u003emight\u003c/em\u003e be. So here\u0027s me explaining why this could work, what qualifies me to do this and what I plan on doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might know me as the creator of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://backpackforlaravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBackpack for Laravel\u003c/a\u003e. And yes, that might be my most popular accomplishment so far. But at my core, I\u0027m a maker. \u003cstrong\u003eI love to build stuff for people like me.\u003c/strong\u003e I plan to devote \u003cem\u003ea lot more\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0of my time in this direction, so I\u0027ve setup this Patreon page for people that, \u003cem\u003efor some reason\u003c/em\u003e, like and trust me enough to help me be a \u003cem\u003edigital artisan\u003c/em\u003e. Crazy, I know. But read on and it \u003cem\u003emight\u003c/em\u003e make more sense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far my professional journey has taken me through being a web developer, freelancer, manager, client, CTO, CFO, co-founder, founder or CEO in various companies. I\u0027ve personally launched and closed 3 startups, and learnt a lot in the process. In a crowded market,\u00a0\u003cem\u003einvention happens at the intersection of fields\u003c/em\u003e, and as a man who has worn \u003cem\u003emany\u003c/em\u003e hats, I think I have a unique perspective \u0026amp; ability to \u003cem\u003ebuild stuff that people like me enjoy\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I \u003cem\u003enow\u003c/em\u003e do for a living is usually called an \u003cem\u003eindie hacker\u003c/em\u003e. Or \u003cem\u003esolopreneur\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eSomeone who prefers to be \u003cem\u003ea maker\u003c/em\u003e, not \u003cem\u003ea manager\u003c/em\u003e. To \u003cem\u003ebuild stuff\u003c/em\u003e, not \u003cem\u003etell people\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003ehow to do stuff\u003c/em\u003e. Someone that prefers to be \u003cem\u003ea peer\u003c/em\u003e, not \u003cem\u003ea boss\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e And I think my experience through all of the above, along with my skills and passions make me a \u003cem\u003egreat\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0solopreneur. Or at least a decent one. As I always say this about me:\u00a0\u003cem\u003eAt every new thing I try, I usually become mediocre very fast\u003c/em\u003e. And I think I\u0027m already \u003cem\u003eat least\u003c/em\u003e mediocre at solopreneuring :-) My startup experience has helped me develop \u003cem\u003ea great system for doing business plans, market research, prototyping and development\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0One important thing I\u0027ve learnt, since I\u0027ve started my solopreneurship journey, is that \u003cem\u003ethe most satisfying work you can do is \u003cstrong\u003esolve itches for people like you\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. That\u0027s why I built\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://backpackforlaravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBackpack for Laravel\u003c/a\u003e. That\u0027s why I built\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://schedulethatemail.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSchedule That Email\u003c/a\u003e. That\u0027s why I\u0027m building\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://digitallyhappy.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e:DigitallyHappy\u003c/a\u003e, a network of web dev agencies \u0026amp; freelancers.\u00a0And \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ethat\u0027s what I plan to do for a living\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eBuild stuff for people like me.\u003c/strong\u003e If you happen to be \u003cem\u003elike me\u003c/em\u003e, and want to help out with $1/month or more, so I can \u003cem\u003emaybe\u003c/em\u003e build something you\u0027ll enjoy, I really \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e appreciate it. As a bonus, \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ll be sharing my journey here, with my patrons\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ll try to include \u003cem\u003eeverything\u003c/em\u003e important that I learn, in my solopreneurship journey, so that you can avoid my mistakes. \u003c/strong\u003eSo it\u0027ll be an exclusive blog, with lessons learnt. I hope my thoughts help you in whatever you are doing. I\u0027ll also be sharing opportunities for new businesses in our space, that I think could be profitable and would like to see done, but can\u0027t do myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s what I\u0027ll be working on in 2018\u003c/strong\u003e, in addition to Backpack, in no particular order:\u003cbr\u003e- create \u003cstrong\u003ea network of web development agencies and freelancers\u003c/strong\u003e, that share projects with each other; I know all too well that our industry is plagued by \u003cem\u003efeast-or-famine, \u003c/em\u003eand I plan to eliminate that, for people like me; members will be able to \u003cem\u003ereceive web dev requests \u0026amp;\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0find good people to outsource to, when they\u0027re overbooked; I currently do this manually, and really want to automate it;\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003ewrite a book\u003c/strong\u003e on Building Admin Panels\u003cstrong\u003e;\u003c/strong\u003e I will try to distill all the knowledge I\u0027ve gained from doing this \u003cem\u003efor years\u003c/em\u003e, into an easily-readable book; read once and know all the mistakes I or others have made, and how you can \u003cem\u003eeasily\u003c/em\u003e create beautiful admin panels that your admins love; the dos and donts; the 80/20s; what to do an what \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e to do, using Backpack or any other software you prefer; I currently have all this information stored in one place (in my head), and really want to put it on paper, for others to take a look at;\u003cbr\u003e- create an \u003cstrong\u003eApp Store for Composer\u003c/strong\u003e; a marketplace where you can browse, buy and easily install high-qualify PHP packages; making Backpack make \u003cem\u003esome sort of money\u003c/em\u003e has been so difficult, and I really want help other indie developers\u00a0\u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e go through the same thing; App Store for iOS brought on a new era of high-qualify mobile apps; I think an App Store for Composer, where devs can publish $1 apps that are easily installable will \u003cem\u003ealso\u003c/em\u003e bring a new era and sustainability for the PHP community; I \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e want to make it easy for developers to just create a great PHP package, put it out there, and start making money thanks to it;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yes, if I get my way, at the end of this year:\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eweb developers \u0026amp; designers\u003c/strong\u003e will have \u003cem\u003ethe first ever\u003c/em\u003e book on how to build administration panels;\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003efreelancers and web dev agencies\u003c/strong\u003e will have a place find new work and outsource development;\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003ePHP developers\u003c/strong\u003e will have an online store to post their high-quality creations and make money;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf any of my new projects interests you, please consider buying me a cup of coffee every month.
