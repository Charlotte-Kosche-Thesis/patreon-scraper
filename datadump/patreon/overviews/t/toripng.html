I am a graduate from SCAD and I have a BFA in game design. I\u0027ve been interested in art and video games pretty much all my life. Video games were a significant part of my childhood so I have always dreamed of creating games for others to enjoy as much as I had enjoyed what I played.\u003cbr\u003eI love to design very colorful and emotionally enticing work- whether that be joyful or just thought-provoking. I\u0027ve always thought that interactive experiences were the best way to tell stories and to\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/005f/f/2017/346/c/9/me_by_toripng-dbwkgk8.png\" style=\"text-align: center; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u00a0teach. My background affects my work in\u00a0multiple ways. I come from a mixed household- my grandmother is from Thailand and I lived with her for 15 years. I\u0027ve always loved S.E. Asian culture, history, and mythos despite the fact that I\u0027ve only ever had an Americanized education. I love to research and I like to include stuff about my culture in my work.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eIn school, I was always into art (of course) but I was also a music student (and I still am)! I have studied music for over 10 years and I have studied instrumental performance for over 8 years now. I play the clarinet and the saxophone and I do some independent composing every now and then! In addition to narrative, art, and design, I hope to include some of my own original compositions in games. Music heavily inspires my work.\u003cbr\u003eAnother part of me that affects my work is my identity and orientation. I am an ace-aro, transgender-agender person. This affects the way I create characters. I want to give my characters diverse orientations and identities because I believe everyone should be represented in entertainment media. It\u0027s important to me not only personally but also because it is so crucial for people to have characters they can relate and connect to so that they can work through their own challenges and experiences.\u003cbr\u003eI am also a mentally ill artist. I don\u0027t view that as something that hinders me or defines me but I believe it also affects my work in some ways. I have hypomania and bipolar disorder and I am medicated. Mental health is another really important thing to educate people about and represent in media.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I create?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have a couple of projects I hold very close! I hope to create a webpage that describes each of them so people can get a little more involved or immersed in the stories and worlds I create.\u003cbr\u003e Currently, I have a project called Mark Time March. It is intended to be a rhythm and visual novel game about marching band!\u003cbr\u003eSecond, I have a project called Typhoon Ten which is intended to be an action-RPG with elements from S.E. Asian mythos- namely some stories from the Ramayana.\u003cbr\u003eThird, I have a project called Callisto. Callisto is meant to be a rhythm-fighter RPG. The themes for this one are space and mer! Alien mer creatures!\u003cbr\u003eI have a number of other projects I\u0027d like to introduce but these are the ones I have the most work on currently.\u003cbr\u003eIf you had reached my Patreon through my DeviantArt account, you probably know me most for the species and groups I\u0027ve created. My species projects are also close to me and I want to be sure to spend more time on their development! Currently, the species I am developing are Pacapillars and Nimblix.\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I am working on smaller games as I complete my degree here at SCAD. I intend to join in on Global Game Jam as well as a number of other indie projects so you\u0027ll definitely see some WIPs from those endeavors!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFollow me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://toripng.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://toripng.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tori_png/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.artstation.com/toripng\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArtStation\u003c/a\u003e, and I sometimes do streaming on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/toripng\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePicarto\u003c/a\u003e. There\u0027s generally differing content on each of those accounts.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do your donations go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePrimarily, I would use the donations I get to pay for my education at SCAD and possibly onward from there if I choose to pursue a masters. The funds would not only go to payments for classes but also campus housing, books, software, and other supplies. Donations will help me go further with my education and I would use the skills I learn to create even more awesome content for you all to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003eDonation money will also go towards medication costs and medical bills. I am currently mid-transition so your donations would help me pay for that process. Donations will also help me cover the cost of medications for my mental illnesses such as hypomania and bipolar disorder.\u003cbr\u003eDonations will also be used for necessity such as food, utilities, etc. I am best performing when I am healthy!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHopes and Dreams\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt my current state, my skills can be put to use for small indie games! I really would love to start making some finished games for you all to play. I\u0027m currently working with some friends on campus to make some games and learn more about the software and engines we use to create.\u003cbr\u003eI also hope to get some concepts rolling for merchandise! I want to see about opening a shop for prints, keychains, charms, stationery, and more! This merchandise would be both fanart and original pieces. I am hoping to have some more mascot Pacapillar designs specifically for merchandise so I can make some cute prints and keychains.\u003cbr\u003eLastly, one of my present dreams is simply to live comfortably and without student debt. I would be incredibly grateful for all the support I can get!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
