Within a few days of graduating college, I moved my life 800 miles away and joined the adult world. With full time employment, a quiet one-bedroom, and\u2026 the ability to go to Disney World literally everyday, it seemed like I was living the dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut after a while, I realized I wasn\u2019t very happy, mostly because I had pretty much abandoned music. I wasn\u2019t writing or singing anything. Even when given the opportunity to, I shied away from it. I lost a sense of who I was without it and eventually found myself desperately in need of something different.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, after a year of that, I packed up, moved home, and pressed reset. It\u2019s been a tough road to this point with a lot of highs and lows and self-doubt and wondering if this is the right decision. But what I\u2019ve learned in the last year is that music is everything to me. It\u2019s my first and greatest love and if there\u2019s ever been a time to chase it full sprint as a viable career option\u2026 this is it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow, I\u2019m still working freelance as a videographer \u0026amp; editor, but in order to get serious about writing and recording music, I need a little extra help. Soooo I\u2019m super pumped to introduce (or reintroduce) my \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSong of the Month Club\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e on Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is a platform that allows anyone to pledge any amount of money to support their favorite artists, musicians\u2026 really any kind of creator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy pledging a dollar or more for each new video or song that I post, you can directly support me on this new journey. AND as a thank-you, \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u2019ll get access to patron-only downloads of my music, the chance to see what I\u2019m working on before anyone else, even live streams and hangouts.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI hope to build a community through this platform and pour every cent back into my music. If you\u2019re considering joining my Song of the Month Club, thank you in advance. Thank you a million times over. I really wouldn\u2019t be here without people like you that believe in art and artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212); background-color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e(I used to think that stood for \"Facts \u0026amp; Questions\")\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How do I join the Song of the Month Club?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e You join by becoming a Patron right here on Patreon.
