    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHi sweet loves my name is Tina! :3 I am trying to pursue my love for cosplay full time! I learned to sew at my Abuela\u0027s knee at five years old. She taught me how to hand-stitch because she was afraid I would hurt myself if I used the sewing machine! I eventually taught myself how to use a sewing machine and fell in love with cosplay when I made my first cosplay of Zelda\u00a0for DragonCon. It was the first thing I had sewed since my Abuela had passed away that I was truly proud of. The confidence it gave me was incredible. Cosplay allows me to be a badass like Lady\u00a0Maria, or a sexy sniper like\u00a0Widowmaker and even a princess like\u00a0Zelda. I get to be something more than just Tina, even for a moment. Seeing the support online from so many people, and going to the cons\u00a0gave me a new perspective that what I was doing did have value.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EgzvGMD.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\u00a0early\u00a0cosplays\u00a0are\u00a0from the Dark Souls series. I was in a very low point in my life when\u00a0I found Dark Souls, and began to cosplay shortly afterwards. I was in an abusive relationship, and was\u00a0struggling\u00a0with my confidence.\u00a0Dark Souls\u00a0taught me\u00a0I can defeat the giant impossible demons in my life if you have the tenacity to not give up! There are always friends along the way who will drop their sign if\u00a0your\u00a0battles get too hard. That has been you guys for me, the support I have received thus far from my fans has given me confidence I didn\u0027t know I had, has shown me that there are other people who share my passions and my interests, and has given me the courage to finally make cosplay into a career.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MQwK0M4.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I have been cosplaying characters from Overwatch, and my Halloween Witch Mercy Cosplay is what boosted my name as a cosplayer. So for whatever I end up cosplaying next I hope you will choose to be a part of my journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Jwdu5Me.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I will also do a boudoir shoot every month for that cosplay! I try to spend as much time, and effort on my boudoir shoots as I do on my actual costume builds. There is a beauty, and minimalist art to boudoir and I feel if it is done right it can be truly breathtaking in a more intimate way. That being said I am not doing nudes at this time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/TiP8dzJ.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why should you support my Patreon? You will get exclusive content, early access to photo shoots and tutorials.\u00a0 You will receive a personalized gift box at the end of one year of your support!! \u00a0Your support will allow me to do this full time, and grow as a cosplay artist. That means bigger and better cosplays of your favorite characters!! I can\u0027t fulfill this dream of mine without you. You are are the key to helping me achieve this. Supporting me on Patreon will help me give you loves the best possible versions of my cosplay! A monthly subscription will grant you access to exclusive content, as well as all kinds of different loot, but it will also allow me to further my career and further my reach, which would mean traveling to cons so you and I can have jolly cooperation! I will continue to cosplay, and post on my other platforms, but it would mean the world to me if you would help me take these next steps to a bigger and brighter future!\u003c/div\u003e"
