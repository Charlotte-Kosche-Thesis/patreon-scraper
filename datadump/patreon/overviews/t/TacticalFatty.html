I aim to educate, entertain or inspire my viewers every day to go out and do what they find joy in doing within their lives. Be it simple as I am or something that takes a large sum of willpower, I wish to be that push. Simply because I have found myself without it several times, and being a fun guy (not a mushroom) that isn\u0027t fun.  I want to work to change that, and with your help I can do more than I ever could do on my own!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy have I turned to Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI learned recently that doing what I want to do is very hard, and something that takes a lot of time and, money. Through your help, all pledges given go into benefiting the channel and channel alone. Each one will better help the channel grow in both technical and quality aspects allowing me to broaden my range of content to its farthest limits. Thus helping me to achieve entertainment of the sheer highest quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Mission.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an entertainer I am reliant on the grace of people\u0027s laughter to keep me going. If I could live on laughter alone, well then I would be immortal, but alas I cannot thus I am a man stuck in his mortality. This requires funding. A subject I always hate talking about because an innocent part of me wishes we could live in a star trek world, a world devoid of the need for money. Since we cannot I turn to you all to help me better both my stream and myself. As I said earlier we can do more together, than I ever could on my own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeing a Viewer Isn\u0027t Enough, I \"Have\" To give money.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime and time again I have heard this line spoken in one way or another. It is probably the most false statement ever spoken. Ok, second most false statement, Tricky Dick beat me to that one. In short YOU DO NOT have to donate or pledge anything. Just being a viewer, being a good friend, and a great human being to others is enough ten times over. For if you are at least these things, and you truly enjoy your time, and are entertained. I cannot and will not ask for anything more from you. A wise man once said to me \"Never ask for more than you need, Never give so much that you go hungry.\" These are words I say every day because it is Reality. While giving is good, being happy yourself is greater.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe End Goal! The Finish Line!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere we are down to the brass tacks, the nitty gritty. What is my truest end goal? To do this full time. I am in the throws of dealing with medical issues that have kept me down and out lately. However, with your help I aim to step up out of these throws, and do my job, to make people laugh. Six days a week, three shows a day is a tall order, but I am a tall man so... it should work right? All facetious jokes aside I want this to be my job, how I make my belly stop grumbling and how I keep the lights on. Honestly I want this to get big enough so that my Father, the core inspiration for all that I do, wouldn\u0027t have to work 50+ hour weeks to keep us going comfortably. He enjoys the work mind you, but doesn\u0027t have a choice. I want to GIVE him that choice, and doing stuff like this is the only way I know how. With your help I can achieve my full schedule, my maximum quality, and above all else the biggest laughs :D. Plus Possible other unforeseen goodies! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLet\u0027s make history together shall we?"
