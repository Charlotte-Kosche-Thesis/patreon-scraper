Even if this isn\u0027t your cup of tea, I appreciate the eyeballs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn January of this year, as I was meant to be finishing up my coursework for MFA in creative writing, turning in papers and polishing the novel I intended to be my thesis, I found myself pulled in another direction. I still love writing, telling stories and making people laugh, and I still very much want to do that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut right now, I feel like my calling is America. My job is America. Our country is imperfect, but it ain\u0027t going down on my watch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMOM AND DAD - DO NOT WORRY. I FINISHED MY DEGREE. I SWEAR.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStriking a balance between the time I spend writing my essays and re-writing my novel, the time I spend writing my representatives, and the time I spend writing cover letters for a \"real job\" is hard. I want to do all of those things, with a little less worry about paying for postcards and postage and a pumpkin spice latte every now and then when the world is too frelled to deal with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get out of this? Letters - letters to congress, letters to the editor, a letter to your mom if you want - about the issues we all care about. The killed darlings of my works in progress - the bits of writing I love that just don\u0027t belong in any of my current pieces. First access to my funny anecdotes (example: Tristan Vs The Jesus Fish) and serious thoughts (example: Taylor Swift is Bad For America) before I post them anywhere else. And perhaps some laughably bad videos of my sick dance moves and freestyle odes to shredded cheese (like carrots, only better).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t promise you I\u0027m gonna overthrow the government. I can\u0027t promise I\u0027m going to write the great American novel and win a Pulitzer. But I also promise I\u0027m not going to misspend your contributions on a Hulu subscription."
