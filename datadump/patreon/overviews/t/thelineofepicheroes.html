    "summary": "Hello everybody, my youtube name is Faethontas and my passion is music composing, synthesizers, workstation keyboards and of course video games. I started my Youtube journey by uploading some music videos but later i decided to turn it to a gaming channel and see what happens.\u003cbr\u003e When i did that, the channel started growing in a way i was never expected it to go and here we are, after some of you, my fans and supporters of \u003cdel\u003emy\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eour\u003c/strong\u003e channel, asked me to find a way for you to support me via donations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e I create playthrough videos of arpg games Diablo like ones, build guides, game guides and also i started live streaming after some viewers of my videos asked me to try it. I tried it, i liked the live communication, fun and conversations we have during live streams and i started a live streaming schedule so everyone would know when we are going live and\u003cstrong\u003e when we are playing together during livestreams\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e Who would have thought 2 years ago that one day i would become a live streamer, lol. When i started uploading videos i did it just for the fun of it and never expected to create videos that would reach more than 200 people, i never dreamt of becoming a live streamer but sometimes life gets you into paths that surprise you in good ways (bad ways also but in our case it\u0027s an awesome way)!\u003cbr\u003e The most importand thing i would like to say is this: You should support me \u003cstrong\u003eonly if you really feel you want\u003c/strong\u003e to do it and with the amount that only \u003cstrong\u003eyou really feel that you want\u003c/strong\u003e to spend, i don\u0027t want to become a seller and giving more rewards to people that donate more is the same as selling a better product so all tiers of patrons will receive the exact same reward for the \u003cstrong\u003esolely reason\u003c/strong\u003e that you should do it \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eonly if you really feel that you want it\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e Thanks for everything, thanks for keeping the dream alive with your support (i haven\u0027t really figured yet what exactly the dream is here, lol)!"
