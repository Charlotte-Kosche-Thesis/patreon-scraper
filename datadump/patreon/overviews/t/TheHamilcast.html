I pride myself on this accessibility and that\u2019s what the Patreon is going to be about. I promise that I\u0027ll make y\u0027all proud.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Hamilcast is a full time job. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I LOVE IT (seriously, it\u2019s my favorite thing), but it\u2019s a full time job. The catch is that I an *actual* job is needed to keep living in the greatest city in the wooo-oooo-ooooo-ooooOOOORLD, giving me access to the Hamilton cast and crew I\u0027ve been lucky enough to interview so far. Cue Hamilton: Eliza, I\u2019ve got so much on my plate. Just imagine what I can do if I had the ability to work less, and podcast more. If I can could do the podcast full time I\u0027d be happier than if I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention. And so would you! Ultimately, doing The Hamilcast full time would mean better episodes, meetups, events, merch, the works. Remember, the Patreon will always be evolving! As it goes on, I\u2019ll be adding more reward tiers that will include meetups, early access to events, etc. The more time I can dedicate to The Hamilcast, the cooler the rewards will be. It\u2019s going to be awesome.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince January 2016, I have fanned this spark of a podcast into a flame. The goal is to continue to put out fun and engaging episodes that only get better, and continue to connect with you, our amazing listeners. One of the most pleasant surprises I\u0027ve experienced since launching is finding a place in the Hamilton community and the engagement I have everyday with people from literally all over the world.
