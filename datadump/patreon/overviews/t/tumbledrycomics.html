It began in 2013 and updates four times a month, with topics ranging from weed to video games to pop culture and usually back to weed again. I\u0027ve also recently started a weekly podcast called Wisconsin Bound, an intimate (and dare I say, sexy?) tickling of audio comedy featuring lots of funny mouths saying funny things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://tumbledrycomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pillow.jpg\" style=\"width: 461px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://tumbledrycomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/seuss.jpg\" style=\"width: 379px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to create comics and Tumble Dry Comics will keep tumbling on for as long as I am able to make them. It makes no money and is currently supported 100% by the self-esteem boost provided by it\u0027s readers. Tumble Dry Comics will always be free, but by becoming a patron, you\u0027re not only supporting the content you enjoy, but giving me an opportunity to give back with some tasty little benefits you can\u0027t get anywhere else! We\u0027re talking sneak peeks, making-of videos, live and awkward sessions, and more! \u003cbr\u003e"
