    "summary": "Housing Matters is a registered not-for-profit corporation that was founded in 2017 by Torontonians concerned with the increasing unaffordability of our city. We all share the common view that housing in Toronto could and should be more affordable than it is, and that materially increasing the supply of new housing to the market is the only sustainable way to keep prices in check in the long run.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, we\u0027re a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://torontoist.com/2017/06/yimby-movement-taking-off/\"\u003eYIMBY\u003c/a\u003e initiative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo kickstart our efforts, we\u0027ve begun hosting a monthly meetup and speaker series, where we invite leading experts to discuss issues related to housing affordability. We\u0027ve hosted three so far and have seen our audience double in that time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve now come to Patreon to ask for your support in keeping these going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat We\u0027ll Use the Money For:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is $1,000/month. That money plus a little bit of our own will be enough to cover the costs we incur for each of our monthly meetups. These include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVenue. \u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027ve been hosting our meetups at Brightlane, at 545 King St. West, an ideal venue given our audience size.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSnacks and drinks.\u003c/strong\u003e People like our pizza and pop.
