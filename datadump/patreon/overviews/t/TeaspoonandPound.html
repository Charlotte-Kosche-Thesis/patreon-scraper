    "summary": "Bringing complex stories to the screen is a collaborative process that can be costly and very time consuming. Thankfully, I get a chance to work with some of the most passionate and highly skilled technicians in the digital media space. We have no shortage of inspiration, passion, know-how or the willingness to push up our sleeves and get the work done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the cheerleaders who ask what I\u0027m doing and encourage me to keep going! You are awesome and I wouldn\u0027t have gotten this far without you! Now, I\u0027m asking that you become patrons of the work I\u0027m doing. Having patrons would allow me to add critical elements to these projects such as securing AP photos/videos for Freedom Denied, creating the animated segments for On the JOB with Lani Lou, getting research and editing support so we can create outstanding film and video programs that are factually sound, supported by educational consultants and have been blessed with the expertise of editors and \u00a0post-production sound technicians.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe work being done here are all original concepts that are being built from the ground up. We\u0027ve been able to do a lot with very little and the talent is ready and available to take these projects to the next level. In order to do that we need the financial support that patrons like you can provide. Please consider pledging at the $3-$5/month level, but know that every single dollar helps us get closer to a delivery date and to sharing our work with you! I hope you will stand with us as we tell the stories that are often overlooked, under-financed and often forgotten.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon makes it simple to become a patron of the arts.
