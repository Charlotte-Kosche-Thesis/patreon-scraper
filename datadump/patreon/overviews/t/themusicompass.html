My \"Passport to Musicland\" is already taking place not only in my lesson studio with my private students and young bands, but as workshops and seminars in the form of everything from Outdoor Wilderness Music Adventures in the backcountry of Montana to spontaneous guerilla theater presentations of downtown Eugene, Oregon, with serious plans to take this around the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the philosophy of \"Always a student, immediately a teacher...\" this phantasmagoria of fun-based and game-oriented music education is delivered with the help of my top students, some of whom have already launched their own music teaching career while still in high school. We\u0027re just getting started, and there\u0027s a lot more fun on the horizon. We\u0027d love for you to join us for the ride!\u003cbr\u003e"

Our family is so grateful to him and his amazing musical gifts.

Music has become such a huge part of my life that honestly I don\u2019t know where I would be if I\u2019d never met Scotty. Learning an instrument along with a lot of music theory has helped me so much in choir and band classes, and also with teaching my own students. I use a lot of what Scotty taught me to teach my students because it\u2019s a really fun way to learn about music. \u201d  ~Emily Sangder, 16, South Eugene High School\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201c\u2026the best piano/music theory teacher ever!
