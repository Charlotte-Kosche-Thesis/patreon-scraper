    "summary": "Hi everyone! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are the cast and crew of That DnD Podcast. We are numerous, energetic ambitious, and hungry. At any given time, we probably have \u003cem\u003eAT LEAST \u003c/em\u003etwo or three campaigns being recorded per week. We are also getting into the \u0027Interview incredible tabletop RPG folks in various positions and from various backgrounds\u0027 game, and I\u0027m incredibly proud of the work we have done so far.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost updates are Mondays and we do some\u00a0 extras on Thursdays. If you want to check those out and haven\u0027t already, you can do so at the following places:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePodcast feed can be found at \u003ca href=\"http://www.thatdndpodcast.com\"\u003ewww.thatdndpodcast.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwitch streams can be found at \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/thatdndpodcast\"\u003ewww.twitch.tv/thatdndpodcast\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYoutube videos of offline stuff AND archive of our Twitch streams can be found at \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/thatdndpodcast\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/thatdndpodcast\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOur ramblings, updates, and community outreach is generally available at \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/thatdndpodcast\"\u003ewww.twitter.com/thatdndpodcast\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eSo, we are doing a thing already. Why bother to make a Patreon page, you ask? Well, we want to do more. We dig deeply and greedily. We need your money to keep those digging machines going. But to sum things up, we\u0027d benefit in several ways with increased funding\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe can keep things running! File hosting is expensive. We\u0027ve bounced around between places, but have settled into our SquareSpace site and the plan we are using lets us host our files there. That saves some money, but SquareSpace and Roll20 and ObsidianPortal, and any other necessary expenditures add up. While the podcast may be free to listen to, it is not free to put out.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe can upgrade our gear! Stuff sounds better, looks prettier, and is overall more enjoyable\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe can buy more materials! We don\u0027t want to dwell on the same rulesets we\u0027ve played already. More money means access to more handbooks and rulesets and cool stuff like that\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe can pay our editors! I know that getting paid for tedious work seems like a no brainer, but currently it is being done pro bono by some of the cast. Erin did a huge chunk of the early editing. Renee took the reins from her after that has been doing the lion\u0027s share of the \u0027make us sound pretty and competent\u0027 work. We aren\u0027t expecting to be able to pay her to be a full time audio editor or anything, but being able to compensate people for their hard work would be really nice\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStretch goals! Having more money coming in means we can worry slightly less about keeping the lights on and more about new \u003cem\u003estuff\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0we want to do. Going above and beyond our monthly cost reimbursement opens us up to not only buying new gear and books, but saving up for BIG STUFF. Maybe we can fly places and interview people live! Maybe we can do awesome giveaways! Maybe we can get everyone together for some live in-person streams, or cons, or a bunch of other things! Your time and energy as a community is the biggest thing for us, but some extra money would go a long way to fulfilling some theoretical *PLANS* that exist in our hearts and minds.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eWe have the ideas. We\u0027ve got the people. We\u0027ve got the energy and the desire to create and explore new worlds and engaging situations and be the best heroes/villains/anti-heroes/screw-ups we can be (depending on the campaign). Hopefully you believe in us enough to support us. Either way, though, thanks so much for taking a look!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn dice we trust,\u003cbr\u003e-DM Erin\u003cbr\u003eFounder, co-host, techpriestess"
