It follows the adventures (and misadventures) of mighty heroes doing their best to help the few human survivors of a land that is the ruined carcas of our own, beset by nightmarish, wild things which sprung from nowhere when reality came undone for one thousand-year-long moment... \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eOn this page, I plan to expose the belly of the beast and reveal much of my thought process and progress/construction concepts.

The kind of effort takes time and money, to pay bills, to buy food, to keep me going. Unlike other methods of creative development, Patreon allows me to connect to you in a more direct way, to let you see what I\u0027m up to and decide for yourself if it\u0027s something you want to see more of. If you do, please tip! The good thing about this platform is that it does not rely on big commitments from an investor and forces me to create at their whim; \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0are the investor here, and \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0decide if this is worthwhile for you. All I ask is small monthly donations to keep me going; two bucks, five bucks, or whatever you feel like... Every small bit counts and adds up. With your help, I can realize this fervid dream of mine and create a nice little place for us to escape into, a place full of wonder and danger; unmovable heroes, and unstoppable monsters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Little About Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI\u0027m a lifelong professional artist, writer, and a fresh dad currently hailing from San Antonio, TX. I\u0027ve traveled near and far and had the privilege of meeting people in several continents, cultures, and walks of life, each with their own unique perspective on our world and the human experience. I\u0027ve seen war, peace, love, hate, fear, hope, sorrow, and joy. I draw inspiration from (and take great interest in) nature, history, psychology, mythology, long \u0027what if\u0027 conversations, and metal music. As far back as I can remember,\u00a0I\u0027ve enjoyed fantasy/sci-fi art, literature, movies, shows, and games, and found these little perspective shifts on our reality can not only provide an immense reprieve from the harshness of the human condition, but also teach us a great deal about each other and about ourselves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
