    "summary": "For over six years, the Mexican Soccer Show has been proud to be a consistent voice of Mexican f\u00fatbol coverage in English through weekly video podcasts on YouTube. We are incredibly thankful for all of our supporters, listeners, and viewers now and over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith the World Cup approaching, we\u2019d love to expand our coverage of Mexican soccer and specifically the Mexican national team. Your financial support means that we could devote more time to content creation while also improving the product already in place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTo that end, we are extremely excited to introduce \u201cMexico\u2019s Countdown to Russia\u201d. This will be a weekly audio podcast that focuses specifically on El Tri and will cost you just $1 per episode ($4 per month) between now and the big event in July.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis isn\u0027t the usual brushing over of the Mexican national team. This show will be a breakdown and deeper dive into the topics surrounding El Tri. Delivered in English by bilingual hosts, this is your weekly dose of absolutely everything to do with the Mexican national team. Why does Juan Carlos Osorio rotate? Is the Mexican media to blame for false expectations? Who should be the goalkeeper? Why has Mexico never truly become a World power? What should be El Tri\u0027s starting XI in Russia? What has Osorio done behind the scenes to win over the players while the critics continue to snipe?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s plenty to talk about ...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe pod is brought to you by regulars Cesar Hernandez,\u00a0Tom Marshall and Nayib Moran and with the odd appearance from Wiso Vazquez, Amy Lopez and Jason Marquitz, who will all be working behind the scenes and be producing content for different tiers here at our Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nThe idea is that \"Mexico\u0027s Countdown to Russia\" goes further than any podcast or outlet out there when it comes to getting under the skin of the Mexican national team as it seeks history next summer. This will be a great way for supporters of El Tri to get ready for the big event in July. Additional bonus content is also available if you elect to support us even further.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally, the Monday live show on YouTube is not going anywhere. We want to thank the loyal bunch who have supported The Mexican Soccer Show down the years and we pledge to keep that space free.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGracias. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
