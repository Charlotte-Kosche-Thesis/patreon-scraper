Well, amazingly, that has become a reality, and you have responded in your hundreds of thousands, we have won awards for the website and spent months at the top of the podcast charts and now with your help we could make it a more polished and professional show that can exist as a candid repository of alternative beliefs, mentalities and world views.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOUR MANIFESTO:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWe wanted to catalogue and compile all manner of conspiracy from the unseen hands that guide societies to the unexplained oddities that have raised questions for millennia. Every episode we select an intriguing topic and tirelessly research and contemplate all the facts, rumours and sources available on the internet.\u00a0We analyse this easily available material and cast a critical eye over it; discussing the validity of its sources and its credibility as fact.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWe then present this information in a conversational and entertaining manner, not all serious and shouty. We don\u0027t flinch from the humour in any topic, or the taboo nature of the information we find. We approach all topics fairly and evenly with an open mind and a skeptics eye and we are able to decant this deluge of alternative info into your ear holes. We dont hold back as far as conversation and contemplation onthe topic goes and the episodes can last up to \u003cstrong\u003e7 hours\u003c/strong\u003e! Each show take about \u003cstrong\u003e100 hours\u003c/strong\u003e to produce, between production, research from all presenters, recording, editing and publishing and promotion.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eNo topic is too delicate or outlandish (except the ones with the \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e good lawyers) and we want to make it palatable for everyone from beginners to experts. If you have ever been at a party and overheard someone talking, jabbering on about jet fuel and its rumoured inability to melt steel beams and you wanted to join the conversation, then this is the place for you. It\u0027s tough to talk about these topics in work or with family and friends, or while making love to your significant other, and maybe you have questions that you don\u0027t feel comfortable taking anywhere else; but you can browse our website, listen to our podcasts or watch our YouTube channel and get some of the answers to the questions that you were afraid to ask that guy at the party with the dreads smoking a long bifter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s tough to find information out there in the murky mire of the internet and even tougher to decipher and contextualise this rambling mass of news reports, robotic voiced documentaries, anonymous rumour milling and misrepresented media sound bites. We trawl through all this information and disseminate it into a palatable, relatable, funny and entertaining format all while keeping the information flowing. A lot of people say its like listening to a bunch of their own mates talking and teaching them!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you ever seen a piece of news and thought this can\u0027t be real? \u003cbr\u003eDo you wonder about the future of humanity and the possibility of extra terrestrial life? \u003cbr\u003eDo you believe in paranormal phenomena, but have no way to begin searching for the answers you need?\u003cbr\u003eDo you feel that there are hidden forces or secret organisations behind the operations of governments, militaries and religions to control humanity?\u003cbr\u003eAre you afraid of, so called Conspiracy Theories, but are still interested in alternative viewpoints and want to explore these options without having to pour over long winded documents and documentaries?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen let us do the hard work for you and let us package said information into an honest and entertaining show that you can enjoy wherever you like. This podcast is for everyone, from the average guy on the street to a die hard conspiracy nut, and we want to bring you the great conspiracies of time immemorial to the ones unfolding around us everyday. We avoid the tinfoil hat merchants and poorly crafted sci-fi stories and fake news, to bring you conspiracies and true crime stories that you have heard about and more that you haven\u2019t.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a community that help artists like us, connect with their audience and develop and evolve with subscriptions from fans. It\u0027s more interactive than ads and more sustainable than once off donations, and our Patreon campaign gives you the opportunity to get access to exclusive material that the general public won\u0027t ever see and even \u003cstrong\u003ejoin in in the conversation\u003c/strong\u003e with us every month. The main podcast episodes will always remain free, and all the videos we make will be freely available on our YouTube channel. But what we give you access to, is the rarest glimpse of how it\u0027s put together and how we make the show that you love. We also share behind the scenes footage of making the show, and we really like to interact and converse with our fans here on Patreon and on social media to further the conversation.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWe have developed a set of milestones that will increase both our output and our ability to interact with our fans. It declares what we need to be able to advance into a fully committed output schedule, which means more stuff from us, for you to enjoy.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe tiers you can choose here describe the benefits of subscribing and how you are making a change in our lives, however large or small. We appreciate every dollar you pledge and we promise to make Those Conspiracy Guys the best it can be. If everyone who listened to the most recent show would give one dollar, only once, then we would be able to make a network TV level YouTube channel so every little bit helps, really!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour subscriptions will go towards the running costs and maintenance of the podcast, website and YouTube channel\u00a0including: our hosting service, our tracking software, numerous paid services for research, production and collaboration, artists and designers for our merchandise and website, remuneration for our guests and content creators, and finally\u00a0audio and video\u00a0recording equipment and software. Eventually, we want to turn your subscription into a living wage so we can concentrate fully and dedicate our time completely to the show. We have added a couple of new members to the TCG family lately and we really want to reward them for their effort.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to look at and understand our Patreon campaign and we hope you\u0027ll be happy with where the future brings us all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003eGordo\u003cbr\u003e"

This means we can get up to that radio station standard equipment and start paying the wonderful guests and contributors we have on board, helping make the show awesome.\u003cbr\u003eThis gives us the opportunity to manage the website on a day to day basis, saving and indexing mountains of source information, writing new articles and we\u0027ll be able to afford to pay writers for thier like minded content and make the TCG world that little bit more complete.\u003cbr\u003eThis stage will ensure daily interaction and information sharing amongst the community with news feeds, breakdowns and forums across social media and we will have the time to create, research and record all the fun stuff you like so much.\u003cbr\u003eAnd best of all, we can make a\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eguarantee\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e of no more breaks in schedule. A constant, unstoppable and unrelenting run of\u00a0episodes, videos and even more new content like the live shows and true crime episodes. \u003cbr\u003eWe will knowingly sacrifice personal relationships, familial ties and probably our own health and personal security to complete the goal we started with: A weekly Podcast with companion website resource and Youtube videos trying to highlight, expose and change conspiracy and corruption.\u003cbr\u003e",

To apply our open style of interview and candid discourse to key figures who drive conspiracy theories and get a chance to talk to the sources that we consistently check.\u003cbr\u003eWe plan to visit the US and all the sites and meet the people we talk about in the show. We will visit Patreon members homes and spend extended time in LA and New York with a travelling tour of as much of the States as we can! This is almost all down to you guys! We really need this amount of support to make this happen.\u003cbr\u003eWe can also use the new resources to fully complete work on the website, upgrade hosting and equipment, increase prodcution quality and frequency of YouTube videos and generally give a glossy professional sheen to all of our media outputs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

It means we can also travel with a crew and start making videos outside in the real world and get to really spread our wings.\u003cbr\u003eIt will also ensure we get to keep producing our Live Shows with a higher production value and will allow us to get one true crime episode out every week!\u003cbr\u003eWe will also use these resources to get a better hosting package for the website and the podcast and even be able to launch an app where you can download all this Patron content, the secret shows made just for Patreon folk and all the old backlog episodes.
