    "summary": "It\u2019s been almost three years since I started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://teslapodcast.libsyn.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis little passion project\u003c/a\u003e of a podcast (click that link to get to the show homepage, where you can listen, download, and/or subscribe), and I am humbled and excited to be able to say that it has exceeded my wildest expectations, growing into a Top 10 Automotive\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ride-lightning-tesla-motors/id1025399574?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiTunes podcast\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s been my way of trying to contribute to the wonderful Tesla community without yet being able to afford to buy a Tesla myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why am I launching a Patreon?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrimarily, it\u0027s because as the show has grown in popularity, it\u2019s actually taking up a LOT more of my time. What began as something I studied all week for and then recorded in an evening now takes up a significant chunk of my week due to preparing topics, listening to hotline calls, recording, editing, and publishing. It has effectively turned into its own little part-time job! The shows started out at about 20-25 minutes and they are now regularly around an hour long, and sometimes more! And so far, the show has hit your feed, like clockwork, every Sunday at 9am ET. It\u2019s been my goal to create a show you can count on, and I\u2019m proud of the fact that I\u2019ve been able to accomplish that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI should note that whether or not you choose to pledge to this Patreon, this isn\u2019t going to change anything about the podcast as you\u2019ve been enjoying it. Let me be clear about that. I don\u2019t want to create any artificially walled gardens. Instead, I want to offer subscribers a bit more, like a monthly all-call-in show to get more of your great phone calls on the air, a monthly Google Hangout with me, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn conclusion, I hope you\u2019ll consider being a patron. Your $1, $5, $10, $20, or whatever dollar amount you feel comfortable with will continue to get you a Tesla podcast that I pour my heart, soul, knowledge, and enthusiasm into each and every week. Thank you!!\u003cbr\u003e"
