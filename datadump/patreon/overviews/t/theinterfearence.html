I am what is known as a \"Horror Host\". Yes, good people, I am one of those eccentric characters who introduces unsuspecting audiences to the strange and unusual world of horror and science fiction movies that would otherwise go unseen. Do I have the country charm of Joe Bob Briggs, or look as good in a slinky black dress as Elvira? Not without a southern accent and some serious elective surgery. What I do have is the humble ambition to drive the entire civilized world straight into that two-story parking garage that is chaos and disorder with the mind-bending menagerie of movies that I have at my disposal.\nWhy, you ask? Well, my therapist says I need to interact more with people, but the way I see it, the world could use a little break from its boring routine.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat better way to shake things up a bit than by exposing the world to a chaotic collection of creature features so bizarre, they\u0027ll never know what to expect next. With your patronage, together we can shake the status quo upside down by its pleated pants. Every little bit helps keep the chaos coming and is always greatly appreciated. For those out there wondering what\u0027s in it for them, I\u0027ve put together a modestly ingenious selection of patron rewards that vary from early access and unrestricted videos, to a variety of downloadable content and extras. Why, it\u0027s enough to choke a murder of crows... or is it choke down a pack of camels? Anyway, I do hope you\u0027ll join in on the madness and until next time, wayward wanderers, I hope that you\u0027ll... \n\u003cstrong\u003estay tuned\u003c/strong\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goo.gl/t8BtrS\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube:\u003c/a\u003e Subscribe to the mayhem and help spread a little yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goo.gl/4qdnGP\"\u003eFacebook:\u003c/a\u003e Get inside my head and see why I\u0027m not just a pretty face.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goo.gl/HyKVTL\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRedbubble:\u003c/a\u003e My maniacal merchandise for the maladjusted.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e"
