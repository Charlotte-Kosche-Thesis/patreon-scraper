    "summary": "Since we lured Chuck Wendig into a volcanic tea lair in May 2012, the Tea and Jeopardy podcast has evolved. It used to be virtual tea, a little chat and then a dollop of mild peril. As time has gone on and our guests have faced more perilous situations, we\u0027ve grown in confidence and the podcast now features singing chickens, time travel and an increasingly complicated background plot as well as nice cups of tea and a cheeky bit of cake during our chats. If you\u0027d like to listen, here\u0027s an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.enewman.co.uk/resources/tea-and-jeopardy-index-of-episodes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eindex of previous episodes\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result the show takes longer to write and produce. Each episode takes anything between 2-3 working days to produce from start to finish. That includes coming up with new lairs and perils, interviewing and editing so our guests sound as fabulous as possible, scripting, sourcing sound effects, editing and putting it all together for your listening pleasure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love making Tea and Jeopardy and we love how much people are enjoying its frivolity. It also gives us the opportunity to put very creative people into silly situations and see what they decide to do. However, we also have bills to pay and at the moment we have to prioritise paying projects. What we\u0027d really like to do is secure some help from the fine people who love Tea and Jeopardy so we can prioritise making the show instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help we could guarantee regular production of episodes and attract a wider range of guests with additional, super duper (super-secret) one off specials scattered through the year.\u003cbr\u003eIf things went really well, we\u2019d even like to do a live travelling Tea and Jeopardy show! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you love what we\u0027re making, join the Order of the Sacred Tea Cup by becoming a patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove and hugs,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEm and Pete (Latimer)\u003cbr\u003e"
