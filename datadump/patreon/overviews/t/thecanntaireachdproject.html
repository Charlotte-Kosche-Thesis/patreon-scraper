It aims to increase the understanding of the Campbell Canntaireachd Ms. (c. 1819), the single most important primary source for \u0027pibroch\u0027 or \u0027ce\u00f2l m\u00f2r\u0027, the \u0027classical music\u0027 of the great Highland bagpipe. By understanding the Campbell Canntaireachd, one can learn how this music was played before it changed by way of increased dependence on written scores and divorce from its cultural context. Almost a quarter of the content has never been published in staff notation. Furthermore, the settings of many of the tunes that have been published in staff notation differ substantially from the Campbell Canntaireachd, where interesting variants and shorter versions appear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe know that pibroch, although performed at the highest technical standards on good instruments today, has changed substantially. \u003c/strong\u003eFrom the earliest evidence of 1760 (Joseph MacDonald\u2019s \u0027Compleat Theory\u0027), when pibroch was transmitted in a purely oral tradition, it was much more variegated. Pibroch was formally in tune with the rich matrix of rhythms found in the language and poetry of Gaelic song. The versions presented in our publications are based on extensive research and cultural intuition. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWithin the clan system of the Highlands of Scotland, this instrument and its music once enjoyed the patronage of their chiefs \u2013 now we are calling upon you: \u003c/strong\u003eHelp us to proceed with this existing project and become a patron today!"

Realising our goal involves research and preparation: recording and translation as well as occasional travel. An issue of this project will\nbe composed of c. 35 minutes of audio material as well as an accompanying PDF in both English and German. Your\nissue will be send to you via your patreon account. Contrary to crowd-funding,\nwhich supports a project on a single occasion, patrons on \u2018www.patreon.de\u2019 can\nsupport a project in a recurring manner. We aim for publication of a tune from the Campbell Canntaireachd every four\nweeks. We will only charge patrons per issue, not monthly. You can both\nsubscribe and unsubscribe at any point in time. \u003cbr\u003eWe would like to make this music accessible for musicians other than pipers, because it is universal. To that end, we intend to record the urlar/theme of each tune on at least one instrument other than the bagpipe itself to allow you to listen to it in a different way. \u003cbr\u003e",
