     "description": "The People Of Skyrim is a DLC sized mod. I have spent 5000 thousand hours in creating it, it has been a massive project to date. I also make reviews of other mods and provide advice and help from my YouTube Channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of $1000 is just a figure, any help is needed and appreciate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a full time job for me people wanted a classic version and an SSE version; I have accommodated both; now xbox users want a version too. If you are serious and continually want more of TPOS on all platforms I need your financial help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to continue breathing life into Skyrim,\u00a0revitalizing the game for you, so you feel that excitement and thrill like you did when the game first came out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will of course extend my ambitions to future Elder Scroll releases.Including questing on a massive scale, but I need your help, we need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will join me on the journey I will not disappoint you. Try out my mods and read some of the below reviews to date:\u003cbr\u003eYou can confirm these quotes under comments on the Nexus website, classic in this case...\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/87687/?\"\u003ehttps://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/87687/?\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQoutes:\u003cbr\u003e\"So I had to return here to leave another comment. After having played the Hell out of the game with this mod, I have to say this is by far THE most stable city related mod I\u0027ve ever used. I have tried Holds, JK\u0027s Skyrim, Dawn of Skyrim and ETAC. While those are fine mods, it was normal to see a CTD every half hour or so. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, I have had..... ZERO crashes with this mod, ever! \u003cbr\u003eNot one since I\u0027ve installed it. I\u0027m even using the Palaces and Castles Enhanced mod along with this mod \u003cbr\u003eFor those wondering what I\u0027m running with this mod (I\u0027ll only list mods that some would think may be incompatible, yet, they are absolutely compatible)...Beyond Skyrim : BrumaPalaces and Castles EnhancedHold Border BannersCastle Volikhar Redux (only a slight glitch on the right side of the building, regarding LOD, but nothing major at all)\u003cbr\u003eThank you again nesbit098 for this fantastic mod! It\u0027s got my vote for Mod of the Month, and if I could, it\u0027d have my vote for best city mod of all time as well.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is another........\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Great work! Allready enjoyed the old ultimate version of People of skyrim but this is even better. So much stuff to explore and even small things like added trees here and there help to create a more immersive experience. I used the performance heavy jk skyrim for mayor cities before but with this mod i dont need that one anymore xD\u003cbr\u003eCant recommend this mod enough !\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Morthal is my favorite hold as well and it has definitely been upgraded. I used ETAC modular specifically for Morthal but I am much happier and more satisfied with the TPOS version. Thank you nesbit098 for bringing this incredible mod back. Really missed your work..\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I\u0027ve waited a long time for this thank you, and thank you for coming back to us and reuploading i love your work\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegards Nesbit\u003cbr\u003e",
