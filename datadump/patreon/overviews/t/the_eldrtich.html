    "summary": "Hello!! \u00f3v\u00f2\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Ciar\u00e1n, more commonly known as Eldritch or the-eldritch-IT-gay. I\u0027m a young, gay, disabled, trans man with a passion for creating rich fantasy worlds for creative projects. As it stands right now, I\u0027m a fulltime college student majoring in software engineering, but also unemployed. Due to physical and mental health issues, it\u0027s hard for me to hold a job. While I sometimes do odd jobs for a friend\u0027s floral business, I don\u0027t have a steady income (or much of an income at all).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBut even through college stress,\u00a0finacial\u00a0issues, and health problems, I\u0027m an artist and a writer, creating my own original stories and worlds and characters (and languages and alphabets). \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve put countless hours into this art, writing, and worldbuilding, and wish for a way to continue doing this without worrying about my living expenses. \u003cbr\u003eMy current writing project is\u00a0Nih Piutyil\u0275 Qu\u00f1iez:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eNih Piutyil\u0275 Qu\u00f1iez is a high fantasy novel centering around three characters of color struggling with their own identities, culture, and religion- all while under the threat of war, violence, and prejudice that surrounds them.\u003cbr\u003eCir\u00edaco is a disabled, mixed race, non-binary wizard. Following the death of his parents, he\u2019s left taking care of his young siblings, trying to provide for them in a society that treats him poorly because of his perceived dirty-blood. On top of that, he has his own personal struggles with his identity and a disability that leaves him in pain and greatly affects his mobility. And as things start to turn for the worse, he finds that his dead father\u2019s tribe has been searching for him since the war began. He knows nothing of the tribe, only the stories that soldiers share of hellish mutants and undead monsters that they have slain. Curious and desperate to understand who he is, he breaks the only law the Esjaras have- don\u2019t go out after dark on The Hunt\u2019s Night.\u003cbr\u003eL\u00e2ii is a self-isolated former-monk, living in the ruins of the monastery she once called home. Her tribe, the Ixaili, is made of plane-touched fae warlocks, created to be pacifistic protectors of nature. But now as mortals continue to slaughter their kind, the tribe is only a fraction of the population it used to be. Her fellow monks were slaughtered in war when she was still young, leaving her the only monk of her tribe\u2019s religion left. But she doesn\u2019t want to be part of the tribe. Struggling with her PTSD, she wants to be alone, and she desperately wants answers to why her god would abandon her like this.\u003cbr\u003eZch\u00e1, like L\u00e2ii, is from the Ixaili Tribe. Unlike L\u00e2ii though, she wasn\u2019t a monk, but that doesn\u2019t mean the war didn\u2019t affect her. After her family and most of her town died, she tried to fight, and in doing so, broke the Ixaili\u2019s pacifism law. The battle left her scarred, physically and mentally, and now an outcast in their close-knit tribe. L\u00e2ii is her only friend, and while she tries to take care of L\u00e2ii and gain the favor of the Tribe\u2019s remaining Elder\u2019s, she can never seem to do either. As she and L\u00e2ii near a coming of age trial that will decide their fates, she fears neither her nor L\u00e2ii will pass, and wants to do all in her power to save them both.\u003cbr\u003eOne of their only hopes is finding a legendary figure- The late leader of the Ixaili\u2019s son. Qu\u00f1aii, the lost healer. Not only was he blessed by their god and said to hold immense powers, he would be the next in line for leadership, but no one knows where he is after the attack to the Northern Temple. Desperate and impulsive, L\u00e2ii ventures off in search of Qu\u00f1aii, but when she finds him, he\u2019s far from what she expected.\u003cbr\u003eIn a story of high-fantasy and magic, three young disabled queer warlocks must work together while they struggle with identity, faith, and culture following tragedy and war.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/em\u003e"
