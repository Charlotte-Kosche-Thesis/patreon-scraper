    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting ThoughtSpark\u0027s Patreon page! I am a new and very small Canadian content creator! I absolutely love what I am doing with ThoughtSpark\u0027s niche channel, and I hope that you do too! I\u0027ve set this page up to allow people to get more of what they want! Awesome, thought-provoking video content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon for ThoughtSpark??\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYouTube is a great platform for creators, However it\u0027s gone down hill (IMO) for small, serious, and dedicated creators like myself. Especially in the last few weeks with the changes to its partner program along YouTube\u0027s \"ad-pocolypse\". Making it harder for us smaller creators to get ad revenue.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThese videos do take a lot of time and effort. And I\u0027ll keep doing them as long as people want them, even if a video gets 2 views lol! I work so hard on this, as its a passion of mine! So I\u0027ve set up Patreon as a way to enable people to support my content and donate as they wish.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAlso because I am in Canada, I cannot \u0027enable paid content\u0027 for my YouTube channel until 2023 according to YouTube\u0027s new policy. To make the content better and better every post for my viewers like you; I need to pay for software, stock footage, and royalty free pictures, and music! Eventually I plan to save up for a camera, (I use my phone for filming) microphone, and lighting equipment!\u00a0Everyone needs to earn revenue, I never pirate software, or steel content for my channel to grow! I give credit where credit is due in my video descriptions.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eContent creators like ThoughtSpark need to grow on their own, and to do so the right way! That is why I made this page! Charged monthly, your money will go directly into these aspects mentioned above! I am always checking back here to make tweaks and updates to better this Patreon for all my supporters, to give back and offer what I can for you all! I hope the rewards structure is fair, and I am always open to hear feedback.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e You may donate as much or as little as you wish! But PLEASE, if you are hard up and struggle to make life costs of living month to month, please do not donate! Those of you who cannot afford or do not wish to donate, it\u0027s totally cool, your not obligated to, and I totally understand! Just keep watching my always free content, I will always appreciate you as a viewer. All I ask for non-donators is that they like and share my content to help the growth of ThoughtSpark! THANK YOU and thanks for your time and support!\u003cbr\u003e-Matt\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHave any suggestions? not comfortable with Patreon and want to make a one-time donation via PayPal? email me: matthew-emery@hotmail.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
