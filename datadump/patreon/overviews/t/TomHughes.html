    "summary": "Hey there,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Tom Hughes and I make narrative games about people. Stories are a hugely powerful form of media within society and I believe that stories about people are what triggers imagination the best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrue stories are ones that come from the heart and mean something to someone, by making games like these it is my way of connecting with people and telling them stories about myself or those around me, and maybe you can draw something from that yourself, if not, maybe you can have your own experience with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy latest venture is a series of episodic narrative games called The Archive, focusing each episode on a different theme, story or idea. Each episode will be unique and will have a different message.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA link to my itch.io page where you can find all the games:\u00a0https://tomhughes.itch.io/\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a service that allows creators like myself the freedom to be able to make what you guys want. Via the use of regular payments each month or per item created. It allows us to keep making the stuff we wanna make and more importantly, the stuff you want us to make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is solely consumer driven, that means you, yes you reading this sentence right now, are in control over what you want to see from us. You\u0027re on this page so you obviously like narrative driven games. But as a Patreon supporter you can pledge and get the rewards of giving us feedback for ideas or themes you want to see from future titles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I join?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might be thinking, wow, that sounds amazing, but Tom, how do I join you on this amazing adventure. Well it\u0027s simple, just pledge on the right of the screen the amount you would like, any effort helps at all and I am grateful for everyone who pledges and donates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce you click on that your adventure begins and I will roll out regular projects for you to enjoy, higher tier supporters will have the opportunity for early releases and feedback builds of the game. So, so tempting eh? So please, if you enjoy narrative and want to help me explore it more, help me out and give what you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does my money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood question. Your hard earned money will go towards being able to make more of these games, equipment costs, software licenses and most of all time. It allows me and the people I work with more time to be able to work on the projects as you guys have funded us. Meaning we can\u0027t let you down!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny amount you pledge goes right back to you in the form of quality content that is player driven, you will have your say as to what you think needs to be in the game in the form of polls, votes, discussions comments and so on. Allowing you to spend your money on something you will always interact with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the tiers?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tiers to the right of the screen are the different levels of how much you pledge to give and therefore will reap different rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eListener\u003c/strong\u003e: The listener tier is the base tier for the pledges, for just $1 per creation you will get sneak peek photos of the upcoming project to see what is up next for the game. As well as a big virtual hug from me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatcher\u003c/strong\u003e: The watcher tier allows you to go more in depth. For $3 per creation it allows you to get unseen gameplay from development of the game and behind the scenes secrets. Shhh! Plus all previous rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlayer\u003c/strong\u003e: the player reward tier allows you to experience the creation. For just $5 per creation you will be able to get a copy of the game on release sent directly to you via a key. As well as a signed digital poster for the new project. Wow! Plus all previous rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreator\u003c/strong\u003e: The creator reward tier allows you to get directly involved. For just $10 per creation you will get an early copy of the game before release to allow for your feedback to be taken on board. Meaning you have a say in what you want in the game! Whoah!! Plus because you\u0027re awesome you get your name in the credits of the game! Plus all previous rewards\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWow aren\u0027t all those thing amazing! Before I go just a quick thank you again for visiting my Patreon page and for checking out my projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again, see you around."
