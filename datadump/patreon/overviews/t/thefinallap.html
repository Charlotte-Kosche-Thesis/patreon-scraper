You, The Final Lappers, are incredible and have become like an extended family to us both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t believe we have made it past recording 500 episodes, and that our shows have been downloaded over 1-million times. Wow. For a guy who grew up as a fan of the sport, it is humbling to know that there are other fans who value my thoughts on the sport!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to our Patreon page, I guess this is where we get into the How and Why of this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no doubt that you love our show, that\u0027s obvious. You guys and gals listen every week. You know all of our tag lines, you tweet us all the time. Well now this is your chance to play an integral part in drastically improving The Final Lap Weekly, while also earning some exclusive rewards in the process, by donating whatever you feel our service is worth. Whether it be $1, $5 or even $20 or more each month. Every bit helps.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eYour donations will help us cover studio costs, talent costs, rent, equipment and web hosting, but more importantly your contributions will also get us to the track more frequently which will result in more interviews with your favorite NASCAR drivers on the show, and more written articles from myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
