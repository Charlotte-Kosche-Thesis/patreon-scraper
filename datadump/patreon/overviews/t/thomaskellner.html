    "summary": "Hi there!\u003cbr\u003eYou probably found this page because you\u2019re either a longtime supporter or because you just found my work. No matter how you found this patreon, I wanted to thank you for taking interest in me and my work, it really means a lot to me. I am able to live my dream thanks to everyone who supported me all these years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have no idea who I am yet, my name is Thomas Kellner and I am an artist and fine art photographer from Siegen, Germany. I am best known for my photographs of seemingly dancing architectural exteriors and interiors of tourist attractions from all over the world. The method I use to create my art is called \u201cvisual analytical synthesis\u201d in which I do not take one shot but several thoughtfully planned ones in order to create a picture out of contact sheets, which makes my work unique. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon account will allow me to get in touch with my most faithful supporters. You will also be able to share thoughts and discussions with the community. Besides every supporter will get an exclusive look into my studio and work. Most importantly you help me create more art for you to enjoy. You will assist me with covering organizational costs, costs for printing, transportation as well as maintaining the studio.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on multiple projects. My most recent project Fluticulus is scheduled to be launched or at least partially launched in November 2017. The project \u201cG20 \u2013 buildings of power\u201d is set to be launched in 2020. Besides that, I am also working on at least four other projects. \u003cbr\u003eOnly here you can get exclusive previews of my latest projects, for example early sketches and a look at my works in progress. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n1. Create Art \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs already mentioned the method I\nuse to create my art makes it one of a kind, my photographs are\nmulti-perspective set. Each motif is defined by single unaltered images that\nwere captured by distinctive frames on the photo camera. Afterwards detailed images\nare added, while I closely follow a predetermined and orderly sketch.  The appearing filmstrips are realigned to\ncreate the final result, that can consist of multiplied shots with a varying\nnumber between 36 to 2160. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n2. Show, publish and represent \u003cbr\u003e\n\nFrom the first sketch to the finished product all work steps are handled\nand organized by myself. I also take care of distribution of my photographs and\norganization of exhibitions. Besides that, I stay in close contact with the\ngalleries and museums that are currently taking care of my work. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n3. Work in my Studio \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll of my work, aside from the photoshoots, is done in my studio in\nSiegen.  It does not only serve as my\nworkspace since 1998, but as a vibrant place open to other artists besides me.\nMore than 300 artists from all over the world and each continent exhibited\ntheir works here. I host two shows in my studio annually namely an Open Studio\nas well as the group exhibition Two Seven, in which seven fellow artists take\nthe spotlight. The educational aspect of my work as an artist is something I\nhold in high regard, which the reason and motivation for me to work as a\ncurator. Besides it is also my reasoning for giving interested young people\n(10-20 per year) the chance to work with me via an internship in my studio. Above\nall these great events, the studio serves as a place of inspiration for myself\nand others. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou are of course not obligated to gift me something via patreon, but\nknow that even the smallest gesture will go a long way. Furthermore, you can\nbecome an important part in the realization of my projects and exchange\nthoughts and opinions with me and likeminded people. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThomas \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "German photo artist Thomas Kellner is known for his photographs of seemingly dancing architectural exteriors and interiors of tourist attractions from all over the world. Even though his photographs show popular motives that have been mass-produced, his work is unique due to his new artistic method called \u201cvisual analytical synthesis\u201d in which he does not take one shot but several thoughtfully planned ones in order to create a picture out of contact sheets. His work is often referred to Cubism considering that his creative process includes a construction but the results resemble a deconstruction.  Thomas Kellner\u2019s works imitate the wandering look of the eye, showing us segments of the total which come together as one image. Therefore his photographs do not deconstruct architecture but reconstruct our view on it. At the same time his work also reflects the flood of pictures we live in nowadays and furthermore contains the question of decaying cultural values.",
