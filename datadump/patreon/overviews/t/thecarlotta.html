My passion has been collaborating with artists and inspiring others, and I have had the good fortune of modeling full time for over 10 years (and counting). I am slowly working my way behind the camera, and I\u0027m hoping that patreon will be a good place for me to share my growth as an artist. The money that comes in from patreon will help fund new camera equipment, my ability to cover travels around the United States (and perhaps outside of it!) and the ability to create art to share with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the first of the month (after billing) pledgers will receive passwords for photos and/or video of myself, as well as content of other models. \u00a0There will be many other goodies including signed prints, hand written letters, and even polaroids.
