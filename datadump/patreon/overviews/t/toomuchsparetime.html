Although I hadn\u0027t played TF2 at the time (omg what a poser), I enjoyed the TF2 GMod videos and fan comics and wanted to join in the fun, with a bit of classical animation comedy. \u003cem\u003eSpy \u0026amp; Pyro\u003c/em\u003e, an absurd love story surrounding the titular characters was well received both by the fans and by the people at Valve who\u0027d worked on TF2. It is still the most successful animation I\u0027ve made in recent years, with millions of youtube views to date and becoming a Valentine\u0027s Day fave of AlbinoBlacksheep and Newgrounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/-GNnftq744I\" width=\"420\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u00a0So how could I \u003cem\u003enot \u003c/em\u003emake another TF2 video for Valentine\u0027s Day 2015, when I\u0027ve had an idea for a spiritual successor to S\u0026amp;P brewing for a good while now? The character designs and art style have been improved, yet it\u0027s still very much in the spirit of the original, with physical comedy that draws heavily from both classical animation and GMod videos, \"shipping\" (that means fandom-based lovey-dovey stuff), and references aplenty to TF2 canon (i.e. things that Valve invented) and fanon (dank memes).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHEN\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProduction started in November with redesigning the characters, and the animation really got going in December, when I had more spare time. As of launching this Patreon, a little over 2 minutes of footage has been completed. Although the entire running time hasn\u0027t been worked out yet, it\u0027s shaping up to be at least the same length as its predecessor, i.e. 5-6 minutes. With more than twice as much production time set aside this time, there\u0027s a pretty good chance of getting it done in time for February 14, and I\u0027m on track so far. In March I\u0027m leaving the world of freelance animation to join an \nanimation studio, so this could be my last chance to make something of \nmy own like this for a while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpdate: S\u0026amp;P2 was finished and released on AlbinoBlacksheep\u0027s Youtube channel a day early on February 13, then re-released on Feb 14 in HD, and on Newgrounds.\u003cbr\u003eIt turned out to be just a few seconds shy of 10 minutes in length, almost twice as long as S\u0026amp;P! I had a feeling \"5-6 minutes\" was a fairly conservative guess, but \"9-10 minutes\" would\u0027ve seemed like an unrealistic goal (not that the length of the movie \u003c/em\u003ewas \u003cem\u003ea goal, though. I didn\u0027t plan how long it would end up being).\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy either not sleeping for two months, or by saying no to any freelance work that comes my way during January to early February.

If I don\u0027t release it, you aren\u0027t charged for anything. I get paid just as much for delivery by Valentine\u0027s Day 2015 as I would for delivery by Valentine\u0027s Day 2016 - unless of course you change or cancel your pledge by then, which you\u0027re free to do at any time until the final video has been delivered.
