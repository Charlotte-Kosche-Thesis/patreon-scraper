Sean \u0026amp; TriHard Brian actually learned to play Magic: the Gathering together. On a fateful day in the early 90\u0027s, Sean\u0027s dad Don returned from an invited artist gig at a \u0027con in Chicago (sources believe it was a WizardCon but that was many, many drinks \u0026amp; brain cells ago) with two Unlimited Starter decks in his swag bag. Initially thought-of as possible additions to their long-running D\u0026amp;D campaign, Sean \u0026amp; Brian taught themselves the game of MtG \u2013 incorrectly - \u0026amp; launched Sean on a cardboard addiction \u0026amp; losing spree that\u0027s never really ceased.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving been involved with broadcasting for 3 decades, Sean is now embarking on what may turnout to be a career change \u2013 though he still does voice-over and production work. While his passion for St. Louis Cardinals baseball borders on the unhealthy, it\u0027s the little things that keep him going \u2013 a great pork steak, craft beer, good scotch \u0026amp; disc golf. Turns out Sean really enjoys two things he\u0027s not so good at: Magic and disc golf!\u003cbr\u003ePreferring Legacy above all other formats, Sean\u0027s hope for Magic is to have fun while winning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFavorite Legacy deck: Pox!\u003cbr\u003eFavorite Standard deck: Mythic\u003cbr\u003eBest deck Sean\u0027s ever brewed: 5 Color Mono Black Control \u003cbr\u003e(Innistrad/Return to Ravnica Standard)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeet Tri-Hard\nMatt!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMatt Hurley\nhas been involved in Magic for more than 20 years. He was first introduced\nsometime between Unlimited and Revised, and assembled a \u201cdeck that attacked\nwith black creatures.\u201d After a long hiatus to join the Army and finish 10 years\nof college, he decided to get back in when he found his cards in the basement. \u201cThis\nwill be cheaper than going out all the time and keep me out of trouble,\u201d (or so\nhe thought). Matt\u2019s return to the game spiraled out of control quickly, while\ndrafting original Zendikar and Scars of Mirrodin. Always looking to make Magic\na little cheaper, Matt became (and still is) a backpack grinder, jump-starting his\ncareer in Sales. Several years ago fellow Tri-Hard Sean introduced him to\nLegacy and aggressively-hopped IPAs in Quincy, IL. He eventually met Brian\nthrough Sean and the Tri-Hards were formed. He is currently working as a\nproject manager for a top electrical distribution company in Louisville, KY,\nwhich means \u201cworking from home\u201d lets him keep the pulse on the game of Magic more\nthan one man should be allowed to do. His all-time favorite Legacy deck is a tie\nbetween Mono Green 12 Post (thanks @theboozecube!) and Food Chain. When he\u2019s\nnot hanging out with his better half Lauran, he\u2019s casting turn four Kozileks in\na local game of EDH (yeah, that\u2019s right, we still call it EDH!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMeet TriHard\nBrian!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBrought into\nthe game during his formative years by fellow TriHard Sean, Brian has been\nspending the past 20+ years regularly losing at MtG and having a marvelous time\ndoing it. After Brian\u2019s initial focus on the game waned after college, Brian\nreturned to active playing and collecting with the release of Lorwyn block and\nall those cute, uh...terrifying Kithkin. Brian rediscovered his love for the\ngame with original play partner Sean and the degenerate, amazing group\nin West Central Illinois. As Brian\u2019s interest in all things Magic has increased\nover the past few years, his time to devote to the game has decreased,\nrelishing his role as \u201cfull-time adult, part-time Magic player.\u201d Brian would\nclassify himself as an old \u201cJohnny,\u201d preferring to try to beat the field with\nan often highly conceived yet poorly constructed deck. He longs for a day when\nhe can play Legacy Miracles on a daily basis. When he\u2019s not slinging spells or searching\nfor hard-to-find basic lands, Brian teaches high school Latin and English in\nMonmouth, IL, travels as much as possible, and is trying to be the best husband\nand dad to his highly patient wife and amazing daughters. He shares the\nTriHard love of good beer, good food, and having a ball winning (or not).\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
