I make my videos for \u003cstrong\u003eYOU. \u003c/strong\u003eYou\u0027re the reason I take time during the day to record, edit and upload videos. Being the father of a 1 year old takes a lot of time and costs a lot of money. The money raised on patreon from you beautiful people will go towards purchasing and maintaining the hardware and software that I need to make the best videos I can. I have never asked for a penny from anyone, and thus I was very reluctant to make this. But I feel patreon is a great way for fans to support their creators. Much love and peace. The Scots Review."

I make videos for YouTube about, well, everything! As much as I LOVE making videos for you guys it becomes hard. Especially with equipment costs. Being a father of a 1 year old boy all my time and money goes to him. So with the spare money from generous patrons I could purchase the hardware and software I need to make my videos better than ever. You would also be making me and my son extremely happy and humbled. Thanks again for visiting this page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKieran\u003cbr\u003eThe Scots Review",
