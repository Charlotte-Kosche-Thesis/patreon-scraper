To make a long story short, at this point in time 7/2/2017,\u003cdel\u003e I\u0027m planning on going part time at my job so I can grind more hours at my passion and what I love\u003c/del\u003e. I\u0027m currently a twitch affiliate with my sub button and I do create YT content for the games that I play. At the moment I\u0027m not sure how many different fantastic things I can offer you, but what I can offer you is my time and my thoughts of what\u0027s happening in my world and I can attempt to give you advice with what\u0027s happening in your world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy intent is having two different \"tiers\" Tier 1 would be about $1 and Tier 2 would be $2. In Tier 1 I\u0027m going to update what is going on in my world in blog form. In Tier 2 I plan on giving updates and answering your questions in vlog form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003eMy income will be cut in half BUT\u003c/del\u003e I will work my ass off every day and provide you with my work as best and as often as I possibly can. Thank you so much for finishing this short read and thank you so much for your support \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e^ whoever the fuck I was at that point in time was impatient af and needs to be slapped. I\u0027m gonna work hard every fking day, not say a word but just DO, and see y\u0027all in 5 yrs. The question is, when will you be apart of the journey? (7-10-2017)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9-20-2017: As time goes on, I\u0027d like to try to start adapting my patreon page to the current life style. I\u0027ve made it to where i\u0027ll be doing mainly blogs and once I hit 10 patrons then i\u0027ll start up videos on a weekly basis and those will be open to each patron :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2-27-2017: Going to be redoing a lot of things overtime. On 2/20/17 I turned 23 and the parents gave me the green light to go ALL IN on streaming/youtube. Obviously I still have bills to pay so any help is always appreciate af. I\u0027ll be updating tier lists here and there and so there will be HELLA fkin changes. Be prepped for big things to come \u0026gt;:D\u00a0"
