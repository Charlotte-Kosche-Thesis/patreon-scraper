    "summary": "For over two years, The Redacted Files Podcast has been releasing actual play recordings of role-playing games large and small. We have sought to bring you games you may not have heard of or entertain with our own little spin on the classics, and always bring you something fun. Now we\u0027d like your help to do just a little bit more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHard as it is sometimes to believe, we have almost 100 episodes in the can now, and over twice that many recorded and ready for editing and release. What\u0027s more, we\u0027re recording an average of three more per week. We love doing this for you and for ourselves. It has been and always will be a labor of love. But it has been a costly undertaking. So we\u0027d like to ask for your help. If just some of our amazing fans chipped in, we could recoup some major expenses and afford to invest in new and exciting weirdness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges help us invest in better equipment, more material for games, and pay for all of the costs associated with hosting and producing a podcast. We couldn\u0027t be more grateful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a humble enterprise here at TRF, just a few people with some USB mics, a credit card, and a desire to entertain folks with some actual play hijinks. Having the last and wanting the first lead to some real harm to the second. \u003cimg height=\"12\" src=\"https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif\" style=\"color: rgb(34,34,34);\" width=\"13\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you\u0027ll consider donating though, and help us keep TRF going with new games, new members and new oddness for years to come."
