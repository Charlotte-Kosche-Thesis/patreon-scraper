    "summary": "Howdy! I\u0027m Tapanga and i\u0027m a cosplayer from Dallas TX. \u00a0As a kid I was introduced to the nerd culture through my dad who introduced me to comics, video games, and even some old school anime. Before I started cosplaying I didn\u0027t have a hobby. I was never really interested in extracurricular activities in school, and i\u0027m not the most athletic, so I had a lot of free time. I became interested in fashion and sewing at a young age but never really found a style that suited me. I was then introduced to cosplay.\u00a0I\u0027ve been cosplaying since 2013 and i\u0027ve been making costumes since 2014.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon is to do more of what I love and what i\u0027m passionate for, as well as giving back to the community. Creating costumes and content requires a lot of time and resources. With the support from my patrons I will be able to create more content such as higher quality photoshoots, more costumes, and eventually allow me to branch off into video creations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBy no means is this mandatory as I am just as active on other social medias, but your generosity is much appreciated!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
