Pay me $50 a month and you get 50 Juncture points and so on. If you decide to pay me something like $1.50 or $1.02 or something it will only be counted as a full point when it hits the full dollar. I can see what everyone has paid so nobody can cheat extra points or lose them. I keep a separate database just as a backup. That way if you have to leave for a month or so, you can jump back in and your points will still be accounted for.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(147, 137, 83);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe point of points:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e600 Juncture Points\u003c/strong\u003e = A background cameo in the actual official Engelbaum comic for your Fan Gen.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e1200 Juncture Points\u003c/strong\u003e = Or an actual speaking part in the comic for your Fan Gen interacting with the main characters on a mission or a scene.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith either point cash-in you are also mailed a hand made \u003cstrong\u003eGlimmer Scroll\u003c/strong\u003e from the Gold Realm to hang on your wall and show your Gen is just too legit to quit.

Details will be given at the end of each chapter how to view your total so you can plan how to use your points.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA few important things though. Personal points reset to 0 once they have been cashed in, this is so everyone gets a fair chance. Also you\u0027ll think that the point levels are pretty high but the first story arc has no Gens, so by the time that chapter comes around people will be ready to cash in their Juncture Points rather than wait around for months. Inclusion of your Fan Gen is also down to passing a few design checks so it fits within the lore of our story and doesn\u0027t break anything (No Spectra-sues or characters derivative of other series please!). You also have to agree to us using your Engelbaum fan character in a one off royalty free manner. We don\u0027t own your Engelbaum fan Gen (because that\u0027s personal to you and I\u0027m not particularly evil like that) but for legal reasons you have to sign a contract I\u0027ll provide to give the go ahead when that time comes around.
