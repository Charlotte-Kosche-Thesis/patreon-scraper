    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I doing?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am writing regular blog posts on \"\u003ca href=\"https://typo3worx.eu/\"\u003eTYPO3worx.eu\u003c/a\u003e\". Because\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.typo3.org/\"\u003eTYPO3\u003c/a\u003e is my favorite content management system, the topics are mostly all about TYPO3 related stuff. My goal is to provide you with valuable content and insights, so you get most out of TYPO3 and enjoy working with the CMS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe History\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore this english blog, I ran typo3worx.de, which had the similar topics, but was german only. Due to the discussion about the \"german prison\", I started with this blog\u00a0in late 2014. This is now english only. Since January 2016 I\u0027m regularly writing posts on \"\u003ca href=\"https://typo3worx.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTYPO3worx\u003c/a\u003e\". As far as possible I try to publish one blog post per week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVisitors and Readers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with any other publication there was a slow start. The first significant rise in visitors was, when I started to blog regularly in early 2016. The next \"jump\" of visitors started, in autumn 2016. Back then I managed to publish two articles a week. In the christmas week 2016 the number of visitors exceeded 1.000 for the first time. This was a nice x-mas present. The year 2017 looks quite good. Since the first week of June 2017, I have already more visitors, than in the complete year 2016. In average there were over 4.400 visitors each month (until June).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEfforts needed\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext to my regular job as a senior web developer and my family, this is \"the thing\", which consumes very much time. Each post takes about 7 hours in average for collecting ideas, research, writing and proof reading. The technical posts take more time as I try to make it work for all readers. Community topics and other stories do not need that much time. Additionally technical and organizational maintenance requires about one to two hours a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinancial support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCounting all in I invest about 32 hours a month in this blog. Taking an average hourly rate of 60 Euro into account, this is a value of slightly above 2.000 euros.\u00a0Therefore I would be very happy, if there will be some financial support. I really would appreciate it, if you sponsor the blog and my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much!"
