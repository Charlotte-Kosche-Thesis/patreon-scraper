    "summary": "Daily Doodle Draw is a project I started years ago, with the express purpose of being able to post a new drawing every single day. Many are sketches, many are doodles, but some pieces that come out are great. In a case of getting more drawings done, more than one image can be posted per day, getting as high as 10 images a day! Maybe more!\u003cbr\u003ePart of the experience is doing these many drawings LIVE through a streaming program like livestream. Energetic music and interaction with fans is what makes these live drawing sessions more than just watching some person draw. We stream to have fun! \u003cbr\u003eIf this project really takes off, I\u0027ll be able to do such streams full time! \u003cbr\u003eOne of the goals is also to obtain a full copy of AutoDesk Maya and AutoDesk Mudbox, in which I\u0027ll be able to take 3D commissions and requests. Getting subscriptions for better streaming priority and removing ads is also up for what the money would go towards.\u003cbr\u003eAs streaming becomes a regular ordeal, I will offer tutorials and critiques for viewers. Critique sessions will be by volunteer only, so I\u0027m not gonna just grab some work and shred it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://techcat.tumblr.com/tagged/DDD\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy works are published in a queue using Tumblr, you can always view what\u0027s immediately available there, and see the history of the DDD\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eAs of now there have been over \u003ca href=\"http://techcat.tumblr.com/tagged/DDD/page/100\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e2,000 DDD\u003c/a\u003e posts over the last five years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Wait if you\u0027re already doing these for free, why should I pay you?\u003cbr\u003eA: Because support is hard to come by, and without it I can\u0027t do this forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Do you draw NSFW?\u003cbr\u003eA: Occasionally. It\u0027s not my main subject of drawing. There WILL be figure drawings that will show up, and there will be, well, naked figures. This is out of study, not fapping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: Couldn\u0027t I just commission you?\u003cbr\u003eA: Yes! Commissioning is based on time taken to make a piece, I charge a minimum of US$12/hr, this price will gradually increase over time. Use what you can tell from what is in my streams and archives to know what I already know how to draw somewhat well, the more difficult something is, the longer is is likely to take. (I will NOT charge you for time spent doing other things like eating or browsing Tumblr, but researching will reflect a bit on the final price.)\u003cbr\u003e"
