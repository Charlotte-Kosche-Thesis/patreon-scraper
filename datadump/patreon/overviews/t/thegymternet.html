    "summary": "Flashback to the summer of 2014. I was newly out of college, working only part time, going to bed in the wee hours of the morning and waking up in the afternoon, and only mildly panicking about what to do with my life. A little after midnight on July 19, while watching \u003cem\u003eDawson\u0027s Creek\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0on Netflix and Ambien-blogging my reactions, I was like \"I should start a gym blog.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI manic-messaged my friends informing them of my plans and they were like \"cool, go to bed.\" But I didn\u0027t listen, and a few hours later, I had a fully-functional live website called The Gymternet. I started covering my first meet, the 2014 Commonwealth Games, immediately, and the site was a literal overnight success with 12,000 views on day one thanks to gym fans who wanted coverage and interviews and insight they couldn\u0027t get anywhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThree years later, the site has grown into a full-time job and has led to some incredible opportunities (like writing a bunch of young adult books and working for NBC Olympics and winning an Emmy Award, \u003cem\u003eno big deal\u003c/em\u003e). While I have some ad money coming in each month that I budget for travel to cover meets, as we keep growing and expanding, that money isn\u0027t stretching as far as I\u0027d like, especially as I began branching out to cover international meets (either on my own or with the help of writers all over the world). I\u0027ve also started using a photographer for meets, and am working on video production coming up this fall, a major step up for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI and everyone who works on the site with me, we\u0027re all volunteers with full time jobs that pay our bills...and we often self-fund a lot of what we do for The Gymternet. A niche interest like this will never become a global empire or make me enough money to pay myself or others for the work we\u0027re doing, but what we CAN do with a little more income is continue expanding. We have some great opportunities for video production set up this fall, which is something we\u0027re hoping to work on even more in the future, with a goal of four video projects each year. Our other goals include travel to a greater number of international meets, like getting to world championships each year as well as having writers at the national championships for every major program on the international scene, and bringing a greater number of people to these events so we\u0027re not limited in the kind of coverage we do (e.g. being able to get more interviews in the hectic press zone, having photographers capture the meet, etc).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so grateful to the people who have helped the site become what it is, which is a lot of you. As we reach our third birthday, we\u0027ve had 1.5 million individual visitors viewing this site 8.4 million times, an awesome number and you\u0027re all helping us simply by showing up. Many of you have also donated to our PayPal, or have offered volunteer coverage, both of which is invaluable to our goals as we continue growing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the Olympics last year, I\u0027ve had many people ask why we don\u0027t have a Patreon, and I never felt like we needed one, but as we continue growing into something way bigger than I ever thought imaginable, I thought why not? So if you love what you see and want to help us make it even better, we\u0027re thrilled to finally give you a way to contribute and hope to bring in some fun incentives along the way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much for the love over the years, and here\u0027s to the future!\u003cbr\u003e"
