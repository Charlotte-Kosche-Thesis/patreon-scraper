We seem to put a lot of value on the publication\n process, and when it comes to artistic output, whether stories, songs, \nor film, we usually focus on a finished product.  Even art which is not \nenvisioned as a product seems to get most of it\u0027s attention as such.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Art translates into a product for a few purposes but one of the main purposes\n is reach as many people as possible.  Reaching as many people as \npossible is not my goal.  I\u0027m writing to inspire a few readers who are \nable to connect with what they are reading.  I also hope to share ideas,\n share as in we share with each other, not I share with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n Another reason art translates into a product is to fit our rigid ideas \nof exchange in order to conform to a structure which creates an \nopportunity for the artist\u0027s monetary compensation (not to mention the \npotential for the company responsible for promoting the art to bring in   massive profits  which is what really drives the whole process of turning\n art into product).  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I intend to avoid conforming to this \nstructure.  I do hope to be provided for but I do not wish for it to be seen as compensation for a product (or even some kind of perks).  I offer what I can offer and trust and hope that you do \nthe same.  Monetary gifts or other form of support are encouraged and will be greatly \nappreciated as they will literally allow me to quit my day job and focus\n on writing, art and community building.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e In the future I may \nchoose to edit and reorganize the stories into a PDF or physical \npublication.  Some of the stories may be expanded into longer narratives\n that can stand on their own.   Everything is subject to change and I \nhope to make it a collaborative process.\u003cbr\u003e If you can relate to any\n of the stories or characters or feelings presented by the Tree, feel \nfree to write about it in the comments on Patreon or on Facebook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/internet-busking-7403236\"\u003eOn Pay-what-you-want and a Gift Economy\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eConfessions of the Damaged\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/1-climbing-fence-7258612\"\u003e Climbing the Fence\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/2-invisible-7403244\"\u003eInvisible Strings\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3 \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/3-astral-blanket-7583934\"\u003eAstral Blanket\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/10803093\"\u003eA Good Day\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/5-village-8804566\"\u003eThe Village\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/11607709\"\u003eHis Battered Vessel\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Part 1\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/his-battered-2-6-11749157\"\u003ePart 2\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/his-battered-3-6-13951330\"\u003ePart 3\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/his-battered-4-6-14572840\"\u003ePart 4\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Part 5\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Part 6\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI very much welcome crypto gifts\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBTC\u00a0\u00a01HsHctHFoZucpjEY9NfE4SHUfEpCQwaDVc\u003cbr\u003eETH\u00a0\u00a00x252c2641438709687aec16d42974fbc3952f88d8\u003cbr\u003eLTC\u00a0 \u00a0Ldzq13WK1fTDZe9p7WvaQhqWyx8TWcweNx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
