Ultimately, the goal is to only need to work 10-20 hours a week there so I can do content creation full time. Then, beyond that point, I could help do the same for my team.

I am currently developing Generation 0, which is a fangame made through RPG Maker XP with the Pokemon Essentials Starter Kit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e While right now I am working on Gen 0, as a content creator and developer, I have plans for a completely original game after this that I would then sell! To be clear, Generation 0 is the first and last foray into fangames that I plan whatsoever. After this is all original games that I will be making. Not to worry, though, Generation 0 will always be free.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch3\u003e_________________________________\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eGames\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn development: Generation 0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn Planning: An original RPG\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3\u003e_________________________________\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eMeet the Team:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTBC\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLead developer, mapper, eventer, dialogue wrtier and nerd.
