I run a small recording studio out of my home in southern Ontario and I teach folks the art and science of modern mixing.\u003cbr\u003eEver since I was a teenager the only thing that ever came close to providing the joy that I get from playing and producing music has been teaching. So much so that I worked for five years teaching music for almost no money! I love the sense of pride that comes from watching another person succeed as a direct result of the things I\u2019ve shared with them.\u003cbr\u003e",
