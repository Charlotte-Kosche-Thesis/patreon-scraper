Governments canvas their population for potential Meta-Humans and utilise them almost exclusively for defence and intelligence purposes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 1959 a small group of people had a vision for a different option; they established the island nation Nirvana in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and invited the greatest minds of the time to join them. Philosophers, engineers, doctors, chemists and all manner of highly talented intellectuals answered the call and in March of 1964 they formally announced governance of what had become the most technologically advanced city in the world. They offered citizenship to any and all Meta-Humans at no cost and promised protection for those seeking to flee oppressive regimes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, as the Independent State of Nirvana approaches the 10th anniversary of it\u0027s formation, political tensions across the globe have reached fever pitch; Meta-Humans are emerging in the highest numbers since their discovery, political borders are more heavily militarized than ever before and every nation looks greedily at the flourishing Nirvana, desperate for a taste of their wealth.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is\u00a0Patreon?
