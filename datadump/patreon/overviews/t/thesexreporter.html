Your contributions, input and support show that independent, ethical content creation is possible.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thesexreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/v-i-b-e-s.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi all! I\u0027m an independent journalist covering human sexuality, and founder of The Sex Reporter, a website for sex positive journalism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was a reporter at \u003cstrong\u003eThe Wall Street Journal\u003c/strong\u003e for almost 12 years, covering business, technology, China and Brazil, which required an open-minded and objective approach to complex industries, economies and cultures. I specialized in finding and identifying the stories on any given topic that were most important to tell, reporting the facts, and relaying the information in a way that was accessible to readers and viewers across the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was a GREAT gig. But at the end of 2016, I decided to tackle a topic that isn\u0027t a core focus in mainstream media: sex. The way I see it, sex is deeply embedded in the foundation of our lives and the economy. From the multi-billion dollar sex industry itself, to healthcare, public policy, technology, religion, education, commerce\u2014you name it\u2014it\u2019s hard to find a corner of society that isn\u2019t touched by sex. Plus, it\u0027s so much fun to discuss!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to approach the subject would be as an independent writer, while promoting other sex positive journalists who are doing the same, on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thesexreporter.com/\"\u003eTheSexReporter.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thesexreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Why-patreon-.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is one way to make this process more collaborative, and lets me connect more deeply with those who believe in my work.\u00a0I also want to show that it can be sustainable to be an independent journalist, and part of that model is a revenue model that isn\u0027t overly reliant on advertising and traffic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a Patron, you can show your support for independent content creation by giving a little bit each month. You\u0027ll get exclusive behind-the-scenes content like uncut interviews and detailed, private updates on the project I have in the works,\u00a0including articles, videos, and podcasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thesexreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Why-patreon-1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheSexReporter.com is self-funded, and has only been possible thanks to the generosity of friends, family and members of the sex positive community who\u0027ve contributed their time, energy, skills and moral support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many freelance journalists and independent creators will tell you, there isn\u0027t a lot of money in this business\u2014far from enough for everything that goes into reporting, including time, energy, audiovisual equipment, hosting, travel, telecommunications and more. Your contribution will help maintain the site, and eventually pay for original content by other awesome sex positive journalists and creators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thesexreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Why-patreon-2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo worries! You can also help by sharing my content, subscribing to my Youtube channel, and giving your feedback. Rest assured that I am always doing everything I can to be able to continue working on my mission.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who have pledged support, thank you so much! Your contribution helps not only to normalize healthy, informed reporting, and diverse discussions on sex, but the overall effort to empower independent journalists to serve their readers and viewers above all else.\u003cbr\u003e"
