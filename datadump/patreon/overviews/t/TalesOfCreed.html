I\u0027ve been doing videos for many years and more so recently, I\u0027ve been putting much of my time into them. I like making content for you guys and while I never expect it to be really a thing that fully supports me, I would like to make enough where I can help out with paying for some bills and necessities. I\u0027m going to be trying to put even more work as some future games that I\u0027m excited for release so if you do enjoy my stuff and want to help out, think about supporting. It honestly helps me out a lot and makes doing these videos easier for me since I know I\u0027ll be really making them for a purpose. And that is just to please you guys and have fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo add on to this since I haven\u0027t updated this description in awhile, this is something that helps me out immensely with getting to be able to release content, having better equipment as well as paying for bills. I want to continue to create better work for you guys and knowing that there are people willing to support and help out alone is an amazing feeling. As well as just things cost money. Damn them things. So just know that even if you take a glance at what\u0027s going on here, I do appreciate it and I hope you\u0027ll consider supporting me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
