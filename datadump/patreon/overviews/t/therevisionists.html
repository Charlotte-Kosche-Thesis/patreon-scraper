    "summary": "What do you get when you take three comedians and you let them run wild through history?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was the question that started The Revisionists-a podcast that is equal parts comedy, history, and ever-evolving story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re Brian Flynn and Zach Powers, the producers and hosts of the show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach episode, we invite a guest from Denver\u0027s vibrant comedy scene to talk about a subject from history. One of us presents the official version of events, and then one of us gets to come up with an alternate history. We deliberate, and whichever story wins becomes the truth, which means that is has an impact and every story told after that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we started the podcast in the summer of 2015, our reception has been so surprising and humbling. We\u0027re growing by hundreds of subscribers each month, and we love hearing from them. Now we\u0027re asking you to help us grow the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s what\u0027s on the table for us:\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eLIVE SHOWS: \u003c/strong\u003eOn October 3rd, 2016, we organized \"The Night of 1000 Podcasts\", which brought together five of Denver\u0027s funniest podcasts for a live event. We have a green light to go ahead and do it again, but we don\u0027t want to stop with just one night. More live shows are in our future, as well as building a podcast festival for Denver!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eNEW EQUIPMENT: \u003c/strong\u003eWe know that the first thing you hear on the podcast is, well, what you hear. We want to bring you the best-sounding show we can. New microphones are called for, as well as new stands, stools, and other equipment for the recording space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eVIDEO: \u003c/strong\u003eWe want to bring alternate history to you in all sorts of ways. Being able to deliver video content will allow us tell more stories and open up at least a dozen new joke possibilities. But this requires equipment, transportation, and editing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eKEEP IT INDEPENDENT: \u003c/strong\u003eUltimately, we want the people keeping this show going to be the people who listen. You keep us going by letting us make you laugh every couple weeks, now if you have the means help us grow the show without having to find outside sponsors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to all of you for listening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a good time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrian and Zach\u003cbr\u003e"
