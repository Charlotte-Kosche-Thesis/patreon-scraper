A nomad, a vagabond, a little off-balance? Well, we\u0027re doing it. We\u0027re not young, we\u0027re not rich, we\u0027re not in perfect shape, but we\u0027re not going to let any of that stop us. There\u0027s too much great stuff to see on this planet, and too many awesome people to meet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re Team Hazard and we want to bring you along on our trip around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to share the real story of the places we go, not just the tourist sites and glamour shots. We\u0027ve traveled enough to know that the best stories happen in the in-between times, like the crazy moto ride going the wrong way on the freeway ramp, or the conversation in the hutong where neither party spoke a word of the other\u0027s language yet everyone understood what was being said, or the haggle over a necklace that turned into a crowd-drawing sporting event. Real stories involve real people and we\u0027re going to share those stories as we travel around the globe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes we\u0027ll be telling our stories in photos or video, sometimes in words, and we will be releasing books all along the way. This Patreon will help keep us going so we can keep bringing you awesome stories and content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSo...who is Team Hazard?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eTrina Phillips\u003c/strong\u003e and I\u0027m a professionally published science fiction writer and futurist. Despite being a lifelong Angeleno, I\u0027m a nomad at heart. I\u0027ve been to China, parts of Africa and Europe, and of course, Mexico, but I\u0027ve always dreamed of traveling around the world. After years of saving and finding myself with no job and few attachments, it feels like the right time to go. I\u0027m glad I\u0027ve found someone crazy enough to go with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAND\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eTim Jacobs\u003c/strong\u003e, former artist, motorcyclist and all-around adventurous guy. I say former because now, due to a brain tumor they removed in 2005, I\u0027m legally blind and there are a lot of things I can\u0027t do, or are difficult without assistance. I\u0027m grateful for what I can do and see, though, and I try not to let my blindness slow me down too much. I\u0027m also a Type 1 diabetic (since I was 18 months old). So we\u0027re going to include some of the challenges we encounter in both juggling medical needs and traveling while disabled. My first trip outside the US was in 2007 when Trina dragged me to China to see the Great Wall before I lost all my sight. Fortunately, I still have some vision left and I\u0027m excited to set out traveling once again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Route:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe route is not set in stone, nor do we know exactly how long we\u0027ll spend in each place and we may add or remove destinations for any variety of reasons. We\u0027ll discover as we go and see what we can see \u2013 and we\u0027ll share it all, in photos, videos and writing. We\u0027re going to be traveling fairly cheap, staying in budget hotels, eating where the locals eat and using public transport whenever possible. Why take a taxi when you can take a tro-tro?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re starting in Indonesia and moving north through Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. Then we\u0027re heading to China to go to a bunch of places we didn\u0027t get to when we were there in 2007. Then north again to Mongolia. We\u0027ll cut back through the northwest corner of China to go through Urumqi and then into Kazakhstan and through the other \u0027stans of Central Asia. Then it gets tricky. We\u0027d love to see both Iran and Turkey but much will depend on the political climate at the time. We might go through Pakistan and India instead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next part of the trip will be through Africa. We\u0027d like to go to as many places as are reasonably safe to go. We\u0027re not planning this too thoroughly yet because a lot could change. I will say that I\u0027m looking forward to returning to Ghana. I was there on a solo trip in 2003 and I loved it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter that\u2026who knows? Maybe India, maybe Central and South America. Maybe we\u0027ll be able to go to the moon by then. Wouldn\u0027t that be a kick?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, those who help support us will receive exclusive content, previews and discounts available only to our Patrons. We appreciate your support and hope you enjoy our tales.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

This is a one-time reward of a free e-book that we will send to you personally. We\u0027ll be writing these throughout our travels, covering the different countries and adventures we\u0027ve had. In addition to our blog posts, we\u0027ll be including all sorts of in-between stories that might not otherwise get told, and give you travel tips for every region. Obviously you\u0027ll have to wait a little for this reward, but to hold you over, you\u0027ll always get everything in $20 tier.\u00a0 And we\u0027re happy to add you to our postcard list, on request. \u00a0",
