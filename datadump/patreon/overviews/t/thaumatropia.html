I write about art, sports, queer politics, books, and pop culture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my sportswriting focuses on soccer, baseball, and chess.\u00a0 I spent three years as a regular contributor for Paste Magazine. I\u0027m currently an editorial assistant for Howler Magazine and am an editor for Hot Time In Old Town. I have bylines at MLSSoccer.com, Unusual Efforts, All Heels On Deck, Victory Press, Queership, The Cauldron, and The Toast (RIP), among others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy background is in new media art. I have a BFA in Interactive Arts and Media from Columbia College Chicago and I spent a year in the MFA program at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. My art practice primarily focused on generative art, computer-mediated installations, and performance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came out as nonbinary in early 2016. My recent published work has expanded to include more on LGBT issues and trans activism, and in particular how it intersects with the sports world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do I fit in?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m focused on my writing career. While soccer is still a primary focus on my work-- particularly with the World Cup right around the corner-- I\u0027ve also started doing more baseball writing.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/intermezzochess\"\u003eI also recently launched a chess blog\u003c/a\u003e, and I hope to use that as a platform to tell new and interesting stories related to the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven in the best of times, making it work as a freelance writer is tough. Everyone wants well-crafted words but very few want to pay for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also dipping my toe into the world of competitive chess. I plan on doing a few small-scale local tournaments this year, and my hope next year is to go to a major regional FIDE-sanctioned tournament next year (such as the Chicago Open or even the US Open). Obviously, between entry fees and equipment and US Chess membership dues, the costs add up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eYour support will help reduce expenses as I work to grow my freelance writing business. It\u0027ll allow me to focus on producing thought-provoking work, as well as give me space to take risks I wouldn\u0027t otherwise be able to take. Ultimately, my goal is to be able to make a sustainable living as a writer, and thus indefinitely postpone the day I have to grow up and get a \"real job.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will also help me compete in more chess tournaments, which will help me develop into a stronger chess player and, hopefully, eventually, become the first transgender Grandmaster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlright, I\u0027m in. Now what?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to Patreon, you can send a small tip my way every month for whatever amount you\u0027d like. If even half of my Twitter followers threw in $1 per month, it would take care of my expenses and allow me to keep doing what I\u0027m doing. Every little bit helps.\u003cbr\u003e"
