You might know me from YouTube. For the past few years I\u0027ve made professional quality video game based music. I\u0027m a gamer and a musician who makes video game inspired music. I\u0027ve been lucky enough to be able to afford to make my music independently. I\u0027m not on a label and I don\u0027t receive any sponsorships or payment from the companies that produce the games I sing about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoin Me In My Music Making Quest!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI spend days writing lyrics, melodies, and working to produce my music. My channel has grown and with that I want to be able to release MORE NEW MUSIC. But that doesn\u0027t mean I want to sacrifice the quality of my music for the quantity released. I\u0027d like to continue making the best sounding music I can for all of you . To do this I work with my producer and animators. I want to be able to pay these people what they deserve for the amount of hard work and dedication they put in to each project. As much as I wish I could keep paying for production costs out of pocket it\u0027s becoming harder to do consistently. In order to make sure I can make great quality music on a regular basis I need YOUR HELP (seriously, every little bit helps)! Money raised from Patreon will go directly into studio time, mastering services, and music video production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is going to be dedicated to giving you direct behind the scene access. Everyone that donates will have insight into everything that goes into my music making process. I will be using this page as a line of communication between me and my biggest supporters. I want to talk to you directly and that\u0027s something I just can\u0027t get on YouTube or even Twitter. I hope you join my Patreon community so you can be updated on everything that\u0027s going on.\u003cbr\u003e"
