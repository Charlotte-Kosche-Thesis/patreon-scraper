But for those of you who don\u0027t, then let me introduce myself\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWHO AM I?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m The8BitMonkey, a gaming and tech review YouTuber. The main game of choice on my channel is \u201cMinecraft,\u201d a blocky game of backwards logic and infinite possibilities, but I do also venture into other games as well (\u201cGolf with Friends,\u201d \u201cGarry\u2019s Mod\u201d and retro classics). Along with that, I also look at some of the latest gaming tech on the market and give my own opinion about it so you can get a better idea of whether it\u0027s the right thing for you, before you go and spend all your saving on it to find that it\u0027s not quite what you thought it was. This has only been possible through sponsorships with brands and through the support of my amazing bananas (subscribers/fans) over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE TO FIND ME!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love talking with the amazing bananas that make up our growing community, if you would like to be a an even bigger part of that you can find me at the following places:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zgDqxsX.png\" style=\"width: 34px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/The8BitMonkey\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYouTube.com/The8BitMonkey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/The8BitMonkey\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwitter.com/The8BitMonkey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7e68GRE.png\" style=\"float: left; width: 37px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/The8BitMonkey/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInstagram.com/The8BitMonkey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JtXIxQJ.png\" style=\"float: left; width: 32px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://discordapp.com/invite/NcAXsrD\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiscord.gg/NcAXsrD\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ug1qvEE.png\" style=\"float: left; width: 34px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oIFTCZC.png\" style=\"width: 38px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.the8bitmonkey.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.The8BitMonkey.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY DO I NEED YOUR HELP?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBasically, I\u0027m just one monkey and as much as I love making (hopefully) entertaining content for you, it does take a long time to produce and sadly costs more to make then it brings in.

This amount can range from product to product, but hardly ever covers the cost of making the video in the first place. Nevertheless, I still do them as I want to inform the viewers and I just REALLY love playing with tech \u003cimg src=\"https://discordapp.com/assets/b731b88b6459090c02b8d1e31a552c5a.svg\" style=\"margin-bottom: -5px; height: 1rem; width: 1rem; color: rgb(115, 127, 141); margin-top: 0px !important; margin-right: 0.05em !important; margin-left: 0.1em !important;\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
