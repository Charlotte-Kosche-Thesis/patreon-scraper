I\u0027m exploring the world through video games, vlogs, and acting in tv shows \u0026amp; movies, and making sweet \nvideos about it. With titles like The Walking Dead and Vampire Diaries under my belt, it\u0027s an exciting time! Join me, won\u0027t you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eI\u2019m new to Patreon, how does this work? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of \nthe videos I produce will live on YouTube, available for free to \neveryone. However, if you\u2019d like to support me, you\u2019ll get access to \nPatron-only stuff depending on your level of contribution (see the \nRewards column on the right). As a Patron, you\u2019ll get notified any time I\n post something visible at your level of contribution (you can turn \nthese notifications off, if you like).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter years of working in the Entertainment industry, I saw firsthand the great things that come \nfrom having a dialogue with a small group of passionate users. It\u0027s a \nmodel I believe in, not just from a business standpoint but as a fan \nmyself. I\u0027ve cancelled my cable and instead subscribe directly to \nprojects I\u0027m interested in and want to support. I truly believe this is \nthe way the world is going, and I couldn\u0027t be more excited to be a part \nof it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith many big businesses caving to the pressure to become more \"pc\" in their content, many artists and entertainers have become restricted in their work. Patreon allows content creators to keep doing what they love without having to change or adhere to the censorship or pressure of platforms like YouTube to change their content. Many people don\u0027t know this but YouTube pays only pennies per video and they say that for every minute of video uploaded, it is an hours of work. I personally work on my channel anywhere from 60-70hrs a week or more. It is a passion project for sure, but supporters like you allow me to continue to provide content on a daily basis. For a breakdown of where your money will be going or what I will be doing with it, see the breakdown of my overall goals to the left!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eYour Opinions Matter!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The cool part is, through the comments on Patreon and the chat room on \nDiscord, I\u0027ll be able to hear directly from the people that support me, \nand use that inspiration and guidance to create something we\u0027re all \nexcited about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eExclusive Rewards! \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI absolutely \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eLOVE \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003emy YouTube community of subscribers and am very excited to now offer rewards to give back! Who doesn\u0027t love to get something in the mail? chat with or even game with the youtuber they watch online? I can\u0027t wait to share these rewards with you guys and on a more personal level get to know each and every one of you guys through a more private and personal monthly live stream and patreon feed! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you suggested that I should make a Patreon account due to the unfortunate circumstances I am currently in. I hope you guys enjoy the reward ideas I came up with (if you have your own ideas message me!) and I hope this will help me move past this scary situation and continue to make top quality entertaining gaming videos for everyone. \u003cbr\u003e"
