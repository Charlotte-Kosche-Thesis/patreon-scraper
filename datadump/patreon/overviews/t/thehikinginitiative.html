Although, I don\u0027t think we will ever become experts, so we will find mentors in the industry who are. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result, we are dedicated to educating, encouraging, and empowering people to not be shy talking about our Public Lands. Giving advice, looking for the best places to put our dollars towards, amplifying our voices for the cause. Politics and hobbies don\u0027t normally mix, but it\u0027s time to change that when speaking for the outdoor spaces we cherish. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe prefer to keep it fun and educate our readers on hot topics in politics, but let us not forget about the trails we seek for solitude, and the gear we use to extend our trips in those fortresses of solitude. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day, we hope to hit the road so we can join the rest of the pack and organizations that are rigorously working on the ground to fight against Congress for public lands. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s get chatty.
