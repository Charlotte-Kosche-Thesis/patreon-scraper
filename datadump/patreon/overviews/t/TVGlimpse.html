    "summary": "HI, my name is Andr\u00e9s, and I\u00b4m the guy behind this awesome channel about recaps and (hopefully in the near future) reviews and a lot of more awesome stuff! So, none of you (at the time) has expressed their interest in supporting the channel, I don\u00b4t blame you, this is still growing and it\u00b4s barely new. But, I realy hope this can change in the future so I can continue providing with better and more awesome videos.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon campaign is simple - to reduce my dependence\n on ad revenue. To create a more direct relationship between myself, and you, the viewer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I get paid by AdSense based on how many people watch ads on \nmy videos and interacts with them. So basically, someone tries to sell you a new product or a new idea, or whatever, through ads in my YouTube page. For me, a vivid YouTube viewer as yourselfs, really hate the idea of watching an ad or anything like that before watching a great video. I would \nmuch rather have my income come directly from the people who enjoy my \ncontent, rather than some company trying to take advantage of our time watching hours of videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for every $500 per month that you, \nthe audience, pledge through this Patreon page, I\u0027m going to remove ads \nfrom one video per month. $500 is certainly more than the average video\n earns in ad revenue, but I need to leave room for growth as the views \non the channel increase and ad revenue increases with it. And as a lot of peaople has said to me, dream big and aim high.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the reward. Ad-free content. No one trying to get between you and I every day as I share what I\u0027ve created for you. And of course, because a lot of the videos I upload to YouTube has coppyrights claims, \u0027cause obviously I don\u00b4t own the rights, I don\u00b4t earn a penny for those videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf\n course I\u0027ll turn to you, the patrons, first when planning new ideas and \ncontent for the channel. As direct supporters of the content being \ncreated, you\u0027ll have a say in what comes next. Through the Patron-only \nfeed, we\u0027ll discuss upcoming ideas and I\u0027ll take all your feedback into \nconsideration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support thus far, and I\n look forward for a great parnership and big growth for us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
