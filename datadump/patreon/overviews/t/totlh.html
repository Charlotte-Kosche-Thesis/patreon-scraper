    "summary": "Hi, I\u2019m John Meagher, a writer,\nvoice actor and graphic designer, and I write and narrate Tales of the Left\nHand, an ongoing series of fantasy novels offering \u201cswashbuckling, intrigue, and\na dash of magic.\u201d The three novels I\u2019ve completed so far are available in print,\nebook and podcast formats. I\u2019m working on Book 4 right now and I thought I\u2019d\ntry Patreon as a way to get more content out for you before that book is\nreleased.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat is TotLH?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe\nbooks take place in a collection of small tropical islands known as the Frees,\nwhere a number of independent realms trade, compete and feud, settling their\ndisputes with dagger and coin rather than cannon. There are continental powers to\nthe north and an aggressive naval empire to the south, all of whom have their\nown interests in the region, making the Frees a hotbed of spies, ambassadors,\nassassins and pirates rubbing elbows in back alleys, dockside taverns and upper-class\nestates.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eOur\nheroes are a pair of adventurers who literally bump into each other and are\nforced to work together to cut their way out of a dangerous situation, and in\nthe process, they find that they make a good team, becoming fast friends. The\nseries has lots of cliffhangers, daring escapes and colorful characters, all sprinkled\nwith a little bit of magic and hints at bigger events that our heroes are just\nnow beginning to uncover. If that sounds like your cup of tea, head over to \n\t\u003ca href=\"http://www.talesofthelefthand.com\"\u003ewww.talesofthelefthand.com\u003c/a\u003e and\ngive Book 1 a try! You can find links to purchasing the book in print or ebook\nformats, or you can listen to the audio version for free.\n\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat do you\nget for your support?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI originally set up this Patreon with regular rewards for different\npayment levels, but in late 2017 I started a new job that takes up a lot more\nof my time and mental energy. And I\u2019ve realized that I just don\u2019t have\nthe time to write that I used to and don\u2019t see that changing in the immediate\nfuture. It wouldn\u2019t be right to charge monthly fees for content I can\u2019t\ndeliver, so I\u2019ve switched over to a pay-by-creation system, and I hope you\u2019ll\nconsider $1 for any more \u201cDashes \u2018o Canon\u201d that I produce or perhaps a few\ndollars more for any short stories or longer content that shows up here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks very much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- JM -\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e"
