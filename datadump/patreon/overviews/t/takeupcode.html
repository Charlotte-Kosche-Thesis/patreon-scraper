And you get bonuses to help you learn how to code too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s nothing extremely complicated about programming. It doesn\u0027t require a lot of math like many people believe. In fact, it often resembles the way we do things in real life. When you listen to an episode of Take Up Code, you\u0027ll get real understanding. Not more questions and a vague sense that something doesn\u0027t fit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get the benefit of short explanations that make sense. Wherever possible, you\u0027ll learn through examples familiar to you if you\u0027ve played any video games. You don\u0027t need to be a hard-core gamer. But it\u0027s a lot easier to learn something when you\u0027re having fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003eWahid Tanner\u003cbr\u003e"
