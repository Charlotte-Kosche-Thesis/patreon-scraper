Though I\u0027m hardly in a precarious financial position, needless to say every little helps, especially now that my country has decided to drive the economy off a cliff. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy acting as a Patron for my creative endeavours you will help silence that annoying little voice in the back of my head that tells me to be more productive with my time. That means more time spent guilt free working on both The Town Crier and other CoE related content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your patronage I\u2019ll do my very best to give you value for money in terms of entertainment hours."
