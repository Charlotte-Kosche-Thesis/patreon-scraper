    "summary": "Please be sure to watch the video above first, it captures what we cannot put into words.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Sunflower Project\u0027s mission is to spread accurate information about the use of psychedelic drugs, using high-quality video and audio. We feel that the current stream of psychedelic knowledge generally comes from two polarized sources: the media and, well...hippies. The media notoriously paints psychedelics as a dangerous drug, leading people to believe they are more dangerous than drugs like alcohol or cigarettes. Statistically, this is inaccurate and leads to the public having an incorrect bias. However, we don\u0027t blame the media entirely for psychedelic\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003ebad brand image\u003c/strong\u003e. A majority of the online videos available discussing psychedelics are created by a very niche, bohemian group. It sort of leads people to believe that you need a nose ring and dreadlocks to even be interested in psychedelics. We love tie dye as much as anyone else, but this bohemian-only image gives an inaccurate picture of psychedelic substances\u00a0as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where we come in: our goal is to give psychedelics a \u003cstrong\u003ebetter brand image\u003c/strong\u003e. We take great inspiration from The School of Life and love the short animated news videos that companies like Vox produce. \u003cstrong\u003eEducation should be entertaining\u003c/strong\u003e and that\u0027s what we plan to do. The plan is to interview experts in the field:\u00a0from a western medicine doctor, a shamanic practitioner\u00a0in the Amazon, and anyone in-between.\u00a0We will shoot interviews, as well as more cinematic pieces. It is important for us to balance the very quantitative\u00a0aspects of the psychedelic experience (such as research from universities) with the very qualitative, elusive nature of these trips that can be better explained in a painting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the process of all this filming, another really cool thing will happen: we will learn a lot about these substances and their potential for therapeutic use. And this is great because it is our goal to open a \u003cstrong\u003epsychedelic retreat center \u003c/strong\u003ewithin the next five years. This is the aspect of the project that sits closest to home for us. Our founder, Julia Piedmont, first took psychedelics as a last resort while\u00a0dealing with depression and PTSD from a sexual assault. After a single session, Julia\u0027s night terrors stopped and she felt immediately relieved. She made it her goal to spread this information to the people who need it most. A retreat center would make her dream a reality and potentially help thousands of people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this and feel free to contact us with any questions you might have or just to say hello. You can send us an email at:\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003einfo@thesunflowerproject.co\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Julia \u0026amp; Austin"
