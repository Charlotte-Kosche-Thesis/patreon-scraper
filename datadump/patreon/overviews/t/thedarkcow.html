I play the drums, write music, and write speculative fiction and poetry.\u00a0 These things don\u0027t provide much of a stable income, but I love them so much , I can\u0027t staaaaaaahp!!! Heeeeelp!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m a writer! I\u0027m involved in the burgeoning rise of African Speculative Fiction. I\u0027m a member of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/africansfs/\"\u003eAfrican Speculative Fiction Society\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve had works published in the seminal \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AfroSF-Science-Fiction-African-Writers-ebook/dp/B00AEUH112/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1501409925\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=afrosf+anthology\"\u003eAfroSF: Science Fiction by Africans\u003c/a\u003e, alongside greats like Nnedi Okorafor and Tade Thompson. I also have works published online, such as \u003ca href=\"https://omenana.com/2015/10/01/the-horror-in-the-bush/\"\u003eThe Horror in The Bush\u003c/a\u003e, at Omenana and The Wild Dogs, in \u003ca href=\"http://thenakedconvos.com/lights-out-resurrection/\"\u003eLights Out: Resurrection.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write poetry too! I\u0027ve been published in the \u003ca href=\"http://www.thethinker.co.za/\"\u003eThe Thinker\u003c/a\u003e, and #The Coinage Book One.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComposing/Arranging/Drumming\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo, I also like writing and producing music under way too many pseudonyms. \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DrummerMad/messages/?threadid=731895571\u0026amp;timestamp=1414767222637\"\u003eThe Mad Drummer\u003c/a\u003e is a narrative/music project I\u0027ve been working on. Genre wise it\u0027s my unbridled insanity converted into music form. You can check out my last release \u003ca href=\"https://themaddrummer.bandcamp.com/album/kratos-god-of-war\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, and in most online streaming services and stores. I like\u00a0 a lot of Prog-Metal\\Metal, Jazz, and classical music. So I like genre mashing, and the music is written as such. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe project is experimental in as much as I\u0027m not doing it without a full band (this cuts out a hell of a lot of expenses, as running a band is like running a business, sunk costs everywhere!!!!), and sort of trying to test how far I can push today\u0027s software in terms of getting a natural raw sound out of a computer. Think the opposite of what the music industry is currently doing, trying to get musicians to sound creepily perfect, and over processed, and inhuman. I don\u0027t like that...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
