    "summary": "They always take the offering before the preacher gives the sermon...well, sometimes I want my money back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShowin off my interstellar dance moves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is an ongoing collection of my writings, music projects, film projects, as well as excerpts from my series: The Economicist~Manifestist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlso, occasional posts from my tiny house build, barn build and other physical sculpture/art projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am in the process of writing 6 books. 1-5 being autobiographical in nature (at the behest of friends and family...they\u0027ve been asking for years) and the 6th book is an anthology of poerty, lyrics, socio-economic commentary and esoteric/philosophical writings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlease enjoy :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep in mind that I am a comedian, first and foremost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe weak-minded or fearful, when faced with the reality or possibility of confronting a new dynamic or truth, point to their current circumstances as excuse, make lists, build walls in their psyche or simply live in denial. Such individuals never succeed and are incapable of breaking the surface on the other side of the event. They are destined to revisit these milieux until the task is finished. The strong and virile face such challenges head-on, without fear, without hesitation, relying only on their own merit, skill, intuitive prowess and brut strength. To the strong, the happening is an opportunity to learn...to become more than they were. This is, after all, the reason that we come to this place again and again...that we bind ourselves to the confines of time and space and openly accept this reality. The weak have simply lost their way or decided to learn a lesser lesson this time around. You must not pity them...it is their own course. In the beginning you may offer encouragement and advice but at some point you must shed yourself of the burden and not be weighted down to such a point that you lose footing on your own path. This is the danger...one of the most elementary lessons. Find the compass within yourself and learn to focus on it above all else...if others wish to navigate with you for a time, so be it...but ultimately the tide must break and each must plot his own course. So, simply put, you may wish to walk awhile and share the road but eventually you must go it alone. Once you reach the milestone...the place where you begin to remember what came before...and comprehend how trivial and unnecessary most of this is, then and only then can you focus on why you are here and what is truly important. Learn fast and act quickly...the moment is upon us! ~ W. K. I. M. Morris ~D. M. Book 6\u003cbr\u003e"
