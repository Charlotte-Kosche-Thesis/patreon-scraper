    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe\nMind Reels is a Canadian blog/podcast which focuses primarily on pop\nculture and entertainment \u2013 film, television, books, and more.  Formed in October 2011 as a way of giving ourselves an online\nvenue in which we could discuss some of the things we love, we rapidly found ourselves interviewing the directing, acting and writing talent behind many of those \u00a0very things and more! \u00a0We then went on to join a video podcast channel, break a Guinness World Record,\nmoderate celebrity panels at a comic convention, and host our own awards for Canadian film and TV!\u00a0 We have even begun to add new content beyond standard interviews to our podcast show - for example, our Ole Timey Radio Play segments, featuring classic radio play scripts from the 30\u0027s and 40\u0027s, as performed by Canadian talent, all of which is now becoming available on our new SoundCloud account!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWe\nlove what we do.  Our casual interview style allows our creative and talented guests to share their own passions with us and with our\naudience.  We have been extremely lucky with the opportunities which\nhave been afforded to us, and we are eager to do even more. While our podcast will always be free for the public to enjoy, there are costs and time associated with producing each episode, and those add up quickly. \u00a0Thus\nfar, \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ewe\u0027ve\nbeen paying for everything out of pocket, so our first goal is to cover the costs which we already accrue, and then build on it all from there. \u00a0We are growing. \u00a0We want you to share more fully in this journey with us, and become an even bigger part of our continued success as we strive to do more. \u00a0We want to see just how far we can take this, together, with you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
