    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, hey there! We are The Movie Sleuth and Reel Crime podcast. For the last few years we\u0027ve been creating movie based content including spoiler free reviews, videos, lists, and our nearly new podcast. We\u0027ve tried to maintain a mostly ad free site and podcast but have the challenges of the costs associated with maintaining all these different outlets. We\u0027d also be able to pay our writers/creators for their time. Cause you know, time is money and money is well..........more cash to buy movies and games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs much as we enjoy providing our content for your enjoyment, we\u0027d like to have a solid way to support the site and podcast. So, we\u0027re gonna give Patreon a try. Hopefully it works.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.themoviesleuth.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTheMovieSleuth.com\u003c/a\u003e is growing at an exponential rate and has remained nearly ad free for almost 6 years. With just a little help we can continue bringing you guys the special spoiler free reviews that we love writing. We\u0027ve grown to over 20 thousand followers on FB and really think we have a shot of becoming a competitive genre and entertainment news source! With a little financial boost, we can keep doing what we do, help cover travel expenses for film festivals, and can finally buy that personalized XBOX One controller we\u0027ve been dreaming about.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://reelcrime.podbean.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eReel Crime\u00a0\u003c/a\u003epodcast is still in its opening phases but has been doing really well. We\u0027d like to keep that ad free as well. With just a little support, we\u0027d like to keep it that way. Why? Because ads are annoying and distract from the listening experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAre we offering prizes, awards or certificates of gratitude right now? How about a golden ticket to Willy Wonka\u0027s chocolate factory? You\u0027d like that, wouldn\u0027t you? \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tTake a quick peek at where we\u0027re headed with our videos!!!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qd-LxXGKqWI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\tFind us at \u003ca href=\"http://www.themoviesleuth.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.themoviesleuth.com\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\tand\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://reelcrime.podbean.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.reelcrime.podbean.com\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"mailto:chris@spoilerfreemoviesleuth.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEmail us.\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
