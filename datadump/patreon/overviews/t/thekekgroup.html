    "summary": "The KEK Group is dedicated to the study and advancement of the culture, history, and philosophy of the peoples of European Caucasian descent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe group allows members to identify with others of similar mindsets and backgrounds, who value community and history. This shared cultural heritage can provide an automatic sense of unity and belonging within a group and allows us to better understand previous generations and the history of our people, as well as recognizing the shared duty to continue that legacy which has been left to us. Another benefit that comes from preserving cultural heritage as a whole is the communal support. Those that identify strongly with a certain heritage are often more likely to help others in that same community. This heritage is preserved through books, artifacts, objects, architecture, photographs, art, and oral tradition. Cultural heritage is in the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the religions and customs we follow, and the the skills we learn. Sometimes we can touch and see what makes up a culture, other times it is intangible.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough this fraternal order we promote continual self improvement, team building, camaraderie, community service and political activism. Each member should work and strive towards becoming the Roman Ideal, or Plato\u0027s ideal man, or Nietzsche\u0027s \u00dcbermensch. Through political activism and community service, members are a force for good in their communities and role models for younger generations to look up to. Through Brotherhood, Heritage, Readiness, and Outreach, we make a difference."
