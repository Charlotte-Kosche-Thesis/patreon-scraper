We\u0027re the Farris Wills, a group of students in the St. Louis, Missouri area who are striving to bring more free theatre to our city.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003eOur group is built on what we consider ideal theatre: Low cost, accessible Shakespeare, put on by people who truly want to bring this to their community. As an entirely independent group of students, we stand as proof that incredible things can happen when people are just given the chance. It is our belief that Shakespeare is not only entertaining, but important, and the more accessible it is, the more opportunity we have to grow as artists, and to help the community around us grow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve seen our shows, you know that our little group has a whole lot of drive, and we put so much of ourselves into every show we produce. Unfortunately, we can\u0027t afford to do it alone. We don\u0027t want to charge for tickets since our entire goal is to bring more free theatre to the Metro area. Under our current pay-as-you-can model, we can\u0027t count on exactly how much we are going to be bringing in for each show. That\u0027s where you come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs our loving patrons (and hopefully audience members!), you can help us create good theatre by funding the building materials for our sets, the fabric for costumes, rental costs, and prop purchases, as well as a multitude of other little expenses that are essential for us to keep doing what we do. You\u0027ll be billed about a week after we complete every show, and the money we\u00a0receive\u00a0from this page will go directly\u00a0into keeping the group alive through normal maintenance\u00a0costs, as well as funding our next show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for helping to support independent student theatre in the St. Louis area. We hope to see you in our audiences now, and for years to come! Feel free to drop by anytime, admission is free!"
