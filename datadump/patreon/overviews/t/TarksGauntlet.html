Buy in at the tier you think represents you or pick at random it doesn\u0027t even matter. If you guys are here supporting me whether it\u0027s 1 dollar or 100 I want to show you that I appreciate you all the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom here on out everybody on here will get the same thing. When I have an early video I will share it however many hours in advanced it goes up so long as the video isn\u0027t tied to an embargo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be sourcing monthly questions and topics for video\u0027s from you guys. Things like Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s or general topics like \"Most cherished childhood games\" etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always I\u0027m open to hearing what you guys think and any suggestions you might have! This is only the beginning!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo all those who support me and follow my work on youtube, and to those who go the extra mile through donations, my amazon wishlist or here on my patreon I\u0027d like to extend my sincerest thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started the reviews I did because I didn\u0027t think people were reviewing the games I do honestly. The landscape has changed drastically since I started and so too have my videos. Each week I learn something new, and each week I try to improve. All I ever wanted was to make something useful, and I\u0027m very happy to say you guys make me feel like I succeeded."
