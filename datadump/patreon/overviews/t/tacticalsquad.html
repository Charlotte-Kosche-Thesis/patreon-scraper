We\u0027ve been working hard over the past two years to put out the best sounding and most informative Conquest podcast available on the Internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn our podcast we\u0027ve got news, reviews and things you can use, plus contests, interviews and all the good stuff you\u0027ve come to expect from our episodes. Now we\u0027re looking to take our podcast to the next level with your support. Using your contributions we\u0027re going to put money into improving our recording equipment, covering our overhead costs and running exciting contests!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you guys running a Patreon campaign?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main reason we\u0027re running this campaign is to improve our gear and help us cultivate a strong Warhammer 40,000: Conquest community online. We\u0027re not asking for extravagant sums of money or doling out fancy rewards. At the end of the day, this Patreon is really about making sure we can consistently deliver great content to our listeners and consistently improve the quality of that content. We plan to use your contributions responsibly to help us make a better podcast and to cover some of the day-to-day costs of running a website.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou pick a sum you\u0027re going to make for each episode of the podcast. We make and release two episodes a month. So you\u0027ll be kicking us a couple of dollars or cents for every episode, probably less than a cup of coffee or a pack of gum.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a dedicated Tactical Squad listener, does this mean I am going to miss out on episodes?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNO! \u003c/strong\u003eListeners and contributors will have access to all of the same content at the same time!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes this mean you\u0027re going to make a lot of little episodes to milk me for money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNO!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0It\u0027s enough work to write, record and produce an episode. We\u0027re planning on sticking to one episode a fortnight (one episode every two weeks). We\u0027re also happy with the 45 to 90 minute format and we don\u0027t plan to change that anytime soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, but what will my support get me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContributing to the Tactical Squad means that you\u0027re going to help us build a better podcast and in return, we\u0027re going to use Patreon as an open platform for communicating with our fans, taking feedback and requests about episode content. Outside of that we plan on providing backers with a livestream of our recording sessions, running backer contests and online tournaments with prize support. We\u0027re not offering crazy merchandise or other services, because this is first and foremost about running a community podcast and working within our means.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are my contributions going to pay for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe members of the Tactical Squad have largely paid for this podcast out of their own pockets, buying webhosting, cloud services and recording equipment with our own money. With your contributions we\u0027re going to get some better recording equipment, pay our overhead and acquire prizes to distribute though contests on our show! The Tactical Squad already sounds great, but we need your support to sound like Noise Marines riding warbikes across wraithbone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have questions and concerns about contributing, can I send you an email?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSure, drop us a line at\u00a0\n\u003ca class=\"__cf_email__\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e[email\u00a0protected]\u003c/a\u003e\n/*  */\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith your support we\u0027re going to grow this podcast, rule the Traxis Sector and take you along for the ride!\u003c/strong\u003e"
