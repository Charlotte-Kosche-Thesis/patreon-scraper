    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eMy name is \u003cstrong\u003eKaya Lili\u003c/strong\u003e, I mostly go by \u003cstrong\u003eToxic Tears\u003c/strong\u003e online, and I am a full time Content Creator. I use many platforms including Instagram and Twitch, but YouTube is my main platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d had my YouTube account for a number of years, occasionally uploading random little silly videos of me and my friends, but in early 2014 I decided to start \u003cem\u003ereally \u003c/em\u003edoing YouTube. The response I got was great, particularly after my currently most popular video \u003cstrong\u003e\"What NOT to say to Goth Girls\".\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0My channel focuses on alternative fashion, lifestyle, and a little bit of whatever I\u0027m feeling like, including personal vlogs, make-up tutorials, unboxing videos and more. I hope to add to this list as time goes on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe support on Patreon has been my main form of financial support on YouTube since the very beginning, and I can\u0027t thank everyone enough for that. I have a pretty hard time with YouTube because of my appearance and I\u0027m regularly turned down for sponsored videos and other brand work, constantly hearing phrases like \"Not brand safe\" and even \"Her alternative lifestyle will damage our brand\". Its very disheartening since most full time content creators earn the vast majority of their income through work like this! I never expected this kind of discrimination in such an open and creative line of work, but it is heavily present, which is why Patreon is so important to me. These brands may not like me and see me as something scary and bad to be avoided, but my wonderful viewers know who I really am, and choose to support me based on that and not by a quick glance at my appearance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to help me keep going on YouTube and combat how these companies turn me down, Patreon is the place for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nPatreon\nlets users donate to projects regularly, contributing to their growth and\ndevelopment. Its not the same as kickstarter or gofundme, where you donate towards one large goal, but rather a way of \"tipping\" your favourite online creators. Your support will allow me to continue making videos, as well as providing me with opportunities to get better equipment, host awesome giveaways for you, and provide new, exciting content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou have COMPLETE control over how much you pay. You can select the amount you wish to donate per video, as well as a monthly limit. This means if you donate $2 per video but put a monthly limit of $10, even if I were to upload 20 videos that month, you\u0027d still only pay the $10 you set as your limit. You can also change, adjust, or cancel at ANY time. On top of this, Patreon allows you to use PayPal, for total security. No sneaky costs, no getting caught out, just a straight forward way to help out the creators you love!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will patrons get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, first off, my undying gratitude and love! On top of that, you will have access to a private Patron only discord chat (its a little bit like skype but better!) where you can talk directly to me and all of the other lovelies. We\u0027ve had this chat going on for quite a while now and I\u0027m blown away by the amazing community that has formed there. Even on days when I\u0027m too busy to be involved myself, the constant chatter, support and love everyone has for each other is just amazing. The fact that I have such an incredible community that are so kind to each other is one of the things that I\u0027m most proud of.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll also occasionally find other fun Patron only activities, such as Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s just for you guys. My public Q\u0026amp;As tend to receive way too many questions for me to ever answer, but since we have a smaller community on here I can answer everyone\u0027s questions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the day I adore every one of my followers and subscribers, and I appreciate it so much when any of you help out here! You don\u0027t need to pledge a huge amount. $1 may not seem like much on its own, but every little bit helps towards a larger goal! So no matter how much or little you put towards this, you can bet your butt I adore you!:D\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks so much beauties, your support means the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginal Patreon Announcement Video\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/QR15Nc4hhyo\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
