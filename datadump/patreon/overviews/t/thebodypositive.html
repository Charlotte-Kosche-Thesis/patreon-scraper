We need your support to continue creating cutting-edge curriculum and to produce outstanding video and web content for you and future leaders. This monthly goal helps cover the raw costs of editing, production, development and more. Your support will help bring mass visibility to the true Body Positive movement that celebrates and honors people in \u003cstrong\u003eall bodies\u003c/strong\u003e. We aim to take The Body Positive from a grassroots nonprofit in Berkeley to a global network of like-minded professionals, educators, and activists. We also want to continue to provide scholarships to our events, building equity into each and every room we fill. At The Body Positive, we believe that if we aren\u0027t working with you then we aren\u0027t doing our work. Your support at any level makes a huge difference towards creating a world where people can be free from the constraints of body shame and social injustice. This will allow so many to make the strides needed towards a better planet for us all.",
