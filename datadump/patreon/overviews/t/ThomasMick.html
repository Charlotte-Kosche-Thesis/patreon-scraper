    "summary": "It is often tempting to compromise my message or join forces with organizations or individuals who are conservative but operate within the corporate structure; such alliances have practical financial benefits, but the message of the truth becomes obscure and ineffective in favor of tactics and strategies that have little chance to actually defeat our enemies and restore freedom to our people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney seems to always steer people away from what is right to what is expedient, always resulting in weakening the effort while appearing to provide more resources to prevail. I simply cannot take that route personally.... it is extremely frustrating to see compromising organizations and individuals thrive, while principled efforts are starved into oblivion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps someday, hopefully soon, people will come to realize that compromise with evil always benefits evil at the cost of right principle... we will never prevail under such delusional thinking no matter who tells us otherwise. We must learn to stand on principle and refuse to bend it to the whims of pragmatism and compromise or forever be deceived into complying with our own destruction.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am an American who values the truth and the freedom it brings more than anything else. Since July 1973, when I was 17 years old, I have been on a quest/obsession to find the truth regarding what I see and am told regarding this life; for better or worse, it has been the driving force behind who I am today. On that day over four decades ago, I made a decision for Yahshua and experienced the indwelling of his Spirit within me... changing my life and setting me on the path I am on today for the truth, wherever it leads.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have spent a great deal of time investigating history, science, law, politics, religion (particularly Christianity), and philosophy over the years, giving me a perspective that has alienated me from most of those around me in the matrix... I have taken the red pill. The search for truth has led me to a place I could have never dreamed I would arrive at when I began, Natural Law.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a strong desire to share what the Spirit within has revealed to me; helping to remove the veil of deception covering people\u0027s eyes. Unfortunately, I must rely on the support of others in order to have the time and resources to effectively perform the mission before me; without it, I will be forced to drop out, unplug, and go off the grid entirely and focus primarily on survival. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not suicidal, though I recognize what I write could likely result in my death by government. Over the millennia, it has become necessary at times for mankind to stand up and resist the chains that have bound them, even at the risk it will result in the end of their temporal existence; it is their duty for the Creator, their family, and the rest of mankind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe I have such a duty and will continue on this path as long as I am able and have breath... please help me to continue.\u003cbr\u003e",
