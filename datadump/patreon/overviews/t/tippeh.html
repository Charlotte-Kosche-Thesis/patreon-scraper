I make YouTube videos, and I love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not alone though. Without idiots such as BARCON-, shinz0, KungFuJarhead, Captain Hobo, kiliki, StingA and a load more idiots we\u0027ve picked up along the way, my videos would be dull as hell. So this Patreon is about supporting us to buy and dick around on new games, so that we can share our gaming idiocy with the world together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a solid investment, really.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003eWhat?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s an investment in\u00a0videos. Currently the most frequent videos come from amusing antics in CS:GO, but I will be expanding soon into several other games that I think I can show the funny side of. I\u0027ve never been a fan of playing a game alone, so I want to buy my idiots games to join me. One of my best\u00a0videos is of us idiots playing Murder Miners, and it\u0027s this sense of complete bewilderment and confusion of the new that helps to make my videos special.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003eWhy?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m starting the Patreon fund to support my videos, and to enable me and my idiot crew to expand to other games. I do have a full time job, but the pay isn\u0027t great and sadly essentials like food and high quality air come before new games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all so much for anyone who chooses to throw a few quid my way- I promise to show you all in praise and adoration (I\u0027m not sure how to add this to the rewards section yet, but I\u0027ll figure it out. Perhaps I could use a portion of the money to fund a machine which comes round to your house and showers you in kind phrases. I\u0027ll look in to that.).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
