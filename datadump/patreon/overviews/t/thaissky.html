It\u0027s an honor that you are here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI created RECLAIM the podcast with a yearning to engage in rich dialogue with other women on the intersection of feminism and spirituality. \u003c/strong\u003eI was finding that I didn\u0027t fully fit into either of these communities, and this desire to belong catalyzed me to start my own discussions where I explore what it means to be a spiritual, embodied, brazen feminist in the modern age.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSince the inception of the podcast in Oct of 2017, I\u0027ve been pleasantly surprised to see that I am not the only one craving these conversations.

As a Patreon member, you choose however much you want to give and you can change the amount at any time. In exchange, you get access to Patreon only gifts, my eternal gratitude, and a feeling of satisfaction that you are affirming someone\u0027s art. Whichever level you choose, I deeply appreciate your patronage and support of my work.

I want RECLAIM to feel like a recluse away from the noise of the world and a space where you are invited to access your own truth and joy. Being a supporter of my Patreon will allow me to keep this podcast ad free for your listening pleasure.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY ARE ALL THE TIERS THE SAME?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSome Patreon users offer you different gifts based on your level of contribution. I decided to do it differently where no matter what you pledge, you get access to the same things.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nConsider this an experiment where\u2026\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eyou get to practice radical witnessing and personal generosity.
