I always wanted to make videos and talk about Tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons and Pathfinder; but I never dreamed of how supportive you guys would be. \u003cbr\u003eWhen you hear me say that I love roleplaying games in my videos, I really mean it. And thanks to you, I have been able to meet a lot of people; and, at least some people tell me, actually help some. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere did my Adventures begin?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eA couple years ago, I fell in love with Roll20 (an online virtual tabletop for pen and paper roleplaying games). It gave me the ability to hang out with my friends again and it has continued to give me a lot of wonderful memories since I discovered it. So I wanted to share it with everyone. I wanted to help people find better ways to use it, so they could reconnect with their friends. And thus Taking20 was born, allowing me to share the Roll20 Master Series with you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then Taking20 has really grown, thanks in no small part, to you guys. But I think it still has a lot of room to continue growing. And, if you\u0027ve enjoyed the adventure so far and want to be a part of that growth in the future, this is how you can do it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon and what would it mean to Taking 20?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003ePatreon is essentially a place where you can support a creator financially for the awesome content they make for you. The reason I have a Patreon for Taking20 is because even though I love creating the content and have a passion for helping people grow their games and welcoming new adventurers into the hobby, it does take a lot of time and effort. I won\u2019t stop making content because of money, as I have already put a lot of my own into Taking20 and am loving every minute of it, but with your help, I can make the content better by hiring an editor and I could make more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I don\u2019t want to become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWhether you decide to become a Patron or not, I want you to know, that all of your support is appreciated, whether that\u2019s through being a Patron or by sharing my videos and subscribing to my channel, you are appreciated and the reason I create this content. If you decide being a Patron isn\u0027t right for you, no worries, nothing will change for you. I am still going to make new videos, I am still going to try and answer your questions and I am still going to love talking about Tabletop games with you. And if you do decide to become a Patron, know that you are helping the channel grow, and for that, you have my thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhatever you decide I would love to get to know you and your games more. So please join the Taking20 community on:\u003cbr\u003eFacebook \u2013 \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/Taking20Community\"\u003ehttp://bit.ly/Taking20Community\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eDiscord - \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/Taking20Discord\"\u003ehttp://bit.ly/Taking20Discord\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to the future. This is just the first chapter to our Adventure. We still have many mountains to climb, dragons to slay, and D20\u0027s to roll.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, may your games be filled with awesome memories and even better friends.\u003cbr\u003eCody\u003cbr\u003eTaking20\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
