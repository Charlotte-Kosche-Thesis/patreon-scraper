    "summary": "I never know how to start the \"about me\" section so I hope this suffices.\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Tim but took on the nick name Timmy Turtle when I started my youtube channel in the hope it was a catchy name people could remember. It was never something people called me in school, I can only remember one of my mates ever calling me Timmy Turtle but I liked the ring to it and hoped it would help build a community of the younger generation who had a passion for fishing. \u003cbr\u003eI grew up in Brisbane and while I only ever fished once a year on our family holidays, I would fish all day and all night for the entire week we would spend at the beach. Although I loved it so much living that far from any good fishing spots, my passion lay else where for all of my teens and into my early 20\u0027s.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI started racing kayaks at the age of 14, lost my first race 3 months later and I was hooked. I was always the smallest kid in high school and that didn\u0027t help when it came to kayak racing. It took me several years of training before I managed to win my first race and then another couple of years before I managed to become Australian champion! \u00a0I represented Australia 3 times in marathon kayaking but my goal was to make the olympics in the sprint discipline. I suffered a few set backs with no coach and glandular fever but after 5 months bed ridden and two prestige levels on COD Ghosts, I trained my heart out on my own got back on track until I finally made the decision to leave Brisbane and head to the Gold Coast to train with the Australian Institute of Sport. I moved back in with my dad and transferred universities where I studied psychology and exercise science so I could continue my training on the Gold Coast.\u003cbr\u003eLife couldn\u0027t have been better with training going well, I found myself a girlfriend and was passing everything at university. I made the Australian marathon team and competed in Hungary world championships but was really disappointed with my result after a terrible race in tough conditions. Shortly after I arrived home my girlfriend and I separated and I started going through a tough period where I struggled to train and university became increasing more and more of a struggle.\u003cbr\u003eIt was during this period kayak sessions slowly were replaced with fishing and I traded sleeping on books to delivering pizza on mopeds. Fishing was the only thing that kept me happy during this period, constantly looking for that next line burner kept my mind occupied and lure fishing quickly became my new obsession. \u003cbr\u003eDisappointed by the lack of videos teaching me how to fish around my local water ways and sick of watching the Americans fish for bass I decided to start my own youtube channel.\u00a0My plan was simple, I was going to make family friendly fishing videos and teach my audience what I learn as I go. The rest is of this story can be caught up on my channel. I turn my cameras on every time I go fishing then try and put together an entertaining videos or everyone to enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am am extremely proud of what I have achieved and learnt in such a short period of time, as fast as my audience grows so does my ambitions to keep the channel growing. My goal is to turn this once hobby into a career and travel Australia learning new skills in fishing, filming and hunting so everybody can enjoy my journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAny support you can offer is much appreciated and I look forward to creating new and exciting content for Youtube and Patrons!!"
