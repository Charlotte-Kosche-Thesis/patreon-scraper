    "summary": "The PERC (Peacefully Engaging the Rome Community) is focused on the six dimensions of wellness as defined by\nthe National Wellness Institute: Occupational, physical, social, intellectual,\nspiritual, and emotional.  The PERC takes\na holistic approach to wellness and aims to provide individuals with a\npositive, community oriented space in which all six dimensions of wellness are\ninterconnected and actively contributing to healthy living. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe occupational dimension acknowledges that one\u2019s attitude\nabout work is directly related to personal satisfaction and overall\nwell-being.  The PERC is committed to providing a positive, uplifting work\nenvironment for all employees and independent contractors.  The PERC also offers life coaching to assist\nclients in choosing an occupation which is consistent with the individual\u2019s\npersonal values, interests, and beliefs, as well as assisting to develop\nfunctional, transferable skills through structured involvement opportunities. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe physical dimension relates to the need for regular\nphysical activity, sound nutrition, and preventative care. The PERC will provide massage therapy, yoga, chiropractic care, and\nacupuncture. The PERC will also contain healthy food and diet planning.  The PERC will hold a juice and smoothie bar,\ncoffee shop, as well as a variety of raw, vegan food.  Healthy food preparation classes will also be\noffered. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe social dimension recognizes the importance of contributing\nto one\u2019s environment and community.  A\nkey element of wellness is in human relationships and The PERC will foster\npositive relationships and community outreach through social events and service\nprojects.  The PERC will also meet the\nsocial needs of our customers by providing an open space to enjoy healthy food,\ncoffee, fresh juice and smoothies. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe intellectual dimension centers on the importance of\ncreative, stimulating mental activities. \nThe PERC will foster intellectual health by\nproviding a stimulating environment with resources, materials, and events to\nassist individuals in expanding his or her knowledge and skills while\ndiscovering the potential for sharing his or her gifts with others.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe spiritual dimension involves the search for meaning and\npurpose in the human experience.  The\nPERC will provide multiple modalities for spiritual health including meditation\nclasses, yoga, tarot card reading, and life coaching.  The PERC will also hold special events geared\ntoward understanding different belief systems and encouraging tolerance of\nothers\u2019 experience in spirituality. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe emotional dimension is based on the awareness and\nacceptance of one\u2019s feelings.  Through\nmany modalities at The PERC, individuals will be\ngiven the strength and tools necessary to express themselves freely and manage\ntheir feelings effectively.  Depending on\nthe individual client, this may come through life coaching, massage, yoga, art\nand music, or simply through their social experiences in a positive space and\nculture.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe PERC will be operated by Jessie Reed who has invested a\nlot of time and energy into creating positive change in the Rome\nCommunity.  Jessie has spent the last 10\nyears working in the field of social work and mental health, working with\nfamilies and children.  In 2016, Jessie\nbegan an organization called, \u201cTurn Your Back on Hate\u201d, where she organized and\nled over 400 local Romans in a silent protest during a Neo Nazi rally.  Through the organization, she also held a\ncandle light vigil after the Orlando shootings, a spoken word event to promote\ncommunity healing after a divisive presidential election, a live radio theatre\nevent as a fundraiser, and spear headed the recent \u201cKeys to Rome\u201d public art piano\nproject.  She has formed a partnership\nwith a local, low income Cub Scout troop and led multiple community\ncleanups.  In addition to Turn Your Back\non Hate, Jessie also sits on the board of \u201cOne Community United\u201d and \u201cThe House\nof Compassion\u201d.  As a result of her\npositive impact on the Rome Community, she was recently featured as one of Rome\nNews Tribune\u2019s \u201c20 under 40\u201d for 2016. The PERC will be an extension of Jessie\u2019s community work and desire to positively impact\nthe overall wellbeing of individuals and the community of Rome. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour monthly contribution will help us to stay true to our vision and offer events and services that are centered around art and community in a pure way without having to stress about that \"bottom line\". Help us keep our mission going!\u003cbr\u003e"
