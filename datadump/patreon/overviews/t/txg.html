    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eHow are\nyou doing everyone, my name is Aaron Wharton, or better known as TxG Architect,\none of three Owners of Total Extreme Gaming. \nWe officially re-opened on the 01st of September, so we at\nTxG wanted to get this uploaded as quick as possible while still doing all of\nthe other work one might expect comes with running a Clan.\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith\nthat said, let\u2019s get to work! The contents of this introduction are going to\ninclude what Total Extreme Gaming, or TxG is, and what we try standing for,\nalong with a little bit of our past history both leading different versions of\nTxG, as well as where some of us came from. \nAlso we will briefly explain how we set up our teams, where to find us,\nhow to connect to us and where to go if you want more in depth explanations of\neverything, so stick through it, send a like and maybe a comment, God Bless.\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTotal\nExtreme Gaming is once again back, and better than ever I might add.  On our first few months before publicly\nopening, we dug through our memories to pry out the best players, personalities\nand leaders we knew.  We wanted the best\nclan we could become to rise from the past! \nFrom ranging from our first days of the Original TxG, back in 2011, or\nthe foundations of what Total Extreme Gaming was based on, whether that was\nCDR, CSM, FaTaL, or SFH, we took the diamonds from the ruff, deciding to focus\non what had caused those groups to fail miserably over time, even if it was us\nourselves.\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut in 2016-2017,\nwe have achieved maximum overdrive.  We\nhave found the purpose that our younger and immature selves couldn\u2019t seem to\ngrasp: family.  We have been praised for\nour sense of comradery and family in the past, and we have made that the\ncornerstone of our Clan in this year. \nAround that cornerstone we have focused on individual Game Teams, along\nwith Game Leaders that allows members to see how they are improving and\nexcelling in the community and clan instead of remaining stagnant.  We have also branched to hear from ALL our\nfans and members to ensure that if anyone has a skill, or a desire to do\nsomething, that we don\u2019t just let them shadow away, we want all the input we\ncan take.  And oh how far we have all\ncome with that tactic, and we are thankful.\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all these teams however, Total\nExtreme Gaming Owners has gotten with any and all Leaders, Game Leaders,\nElders, and Social Admins to ensure that their message is stressed and that\nthese players really are the best fit: family first, fame after.  We encourage that all Leaders know their\nmembers and team inside and out, and know that family should never just be on\nthe TV screen, but all encompassing, and the Game Leaders have listened,\nensuring that their team has numbers to call, and names to reach out to\nwhenever they need anything in life. \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey have a family\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that, I would like to close\nthis long winded commentary with a thank you and a question.  Total Extreme Gaming has been around since\n2011, want to see what the talk is all about? \nI will be posting links to all you need, and hope to see you soon,\nwhether that is on the site, in the tower, in my lobby, out in Tamriel, or out\non the Battlefield!\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTotal Extreme Gaming, Let\u2019s Get\nFamous!\u003c/div\u003e"
