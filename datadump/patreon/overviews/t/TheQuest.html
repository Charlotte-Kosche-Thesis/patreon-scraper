Christians... man are we a faithful bunch... but sometimes... we get lost... or broken... and then we have questions... and if we don\u0027t get answers, then all hell breaks loose. We scream and get angry with God and I\u0027m here to tell you... that, that, is okay. But before you get all \"\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eGod why don\u0027t you love me and give me everything I want...\" \u003c/strong\u003etake a listen to The Quest... it started out of my own personal journey -- and feeling like God was punishing me (which you can read about below) -- and has grown into a a full blown search and find mission.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe release a podcast every other Tuesday but as a Patreon you\u0027ll get a new episode every week, AND access to both our Facebook Live episodes and our newest series \"On This Episode of..\" -- where we discuss the current episode in more detail and answer listener questions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I started The Quest:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Quest stemmed from my personal crisis of faith. I recently had a stillborn son and my marriage suffered from the stress of a pregnancy loss. I found myself childless and marriageless. I was really angry with God. Like, really angry. I kept begging for understanding from every Christian I knew. I grew up in the church and believe God would give me whatever I asked for. I couldn\u0027t understand how I had lost so much on his watch. So I kept searching. And since I am an Emmy award winning television producer, my search lead me to producing a show that helps me process the things I was (and still) struggling with. Pledging to our page will further the conversation about faith how it pairs or not with everyday social issues like, mental health and addiction, gender roles, death and loss; Real life struggles and what our faith says about it. \u003cbr\u003e"
