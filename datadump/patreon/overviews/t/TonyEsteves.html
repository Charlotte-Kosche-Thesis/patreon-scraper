I started reading comic books at ten and fell in love with the medium. Inspired by \u003cem\u003eCalvin and Hobbes\u003c/em\u003e, at thirteen I tried drawing a comic strip but didn\u0027t really find my voice. I drew my first 3 page comic story at 15 and felt this incredible feeling of accomplishment. I\u0027ve been cartooning ever since in an attempt to recapture that feeling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn university, I drew comic strips for the school paper. \u003cem\u003eMetro 86?\u003c/em\u003e was an action-adventure serial comic in the hopes that I would be able to brush up on my style and build a portfolio to work for Marvel or DC. Unfortunately, it wasn\u0027t well-received and I moved on to create \u003ca href=\"http://www.cigarro.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCigarro \u0026amp; Cerveja\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, a humour comic. Surprisingly, I found my voice with C\u0026amp;C. I fell in love with creating so much so that I dashed my earlier ambitions of working for a major publisher aside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Comic Strip\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.cigarro.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCigarro \u0026amp; Cerveja\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e is a comic strip about the zany adventures of a high-strung cigarette-smoking rabbit and a laid-back beer-drinking goose. It started back in 1998 for the University of Alberta paper \u003ca href=\"http://thegatewayonline.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Gateway\u003c/a\u003e and transitioned over to the burgeoning internet of the late-nineties. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was somewhat critically-acclaimed but not exactly financially successful. It ran for ten years and I retired the strip in September of 2008. Even though I put the strip to bed, the characters are a part of me and I find myself writing new strips every so often and posting them on the site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBest/Worst Case Scenario\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on how you feel about money and supporting the C\u0026amp;C strip, \u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e allows you to support the comic \u003cstrong\u003eONLY\u003c/strong\u003e when a strip gets posted. So if I continue to be lazy, you keep your money. But if for some reason I were to spontaneously become prolific, you may want to place a limit on how much money you spend (Which \u003cem\u003ePatreon\u003c/em\u003e allows you to do). Although, I may have to assume that your patronage means that you actually want to read more C\u0026amp;C comics. I\u0027m not entirely sure why but who am I to judge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always grateful to hear from you and I am humbled by all the folks I meet at conventions that say they remember the strip. It\u0027s amazing to find out that I impacted someone\u0027s life so deeply that I made a gloomy day turn bright.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again.\u003cbr\u003e-tony\u003cbr\u003e"
