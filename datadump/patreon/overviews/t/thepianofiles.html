    "summary": "My name is Mark Ainley. I am a musician, writer, and teacher with a passion for individual expression in music, and for much of my life I have had a fascination with historical piano recordings. It began when I was a teenager, when my piano teacher introduced me to old recordings and I discovered how differently musicians of the past performed and brought inspired individuality to their interpretations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I explored historical recordings by the great pianists, I developed a deep interest in the legendary pianist Dinu Lipatti (1917-1950), whose handful of highly-prized recordings were always critically acclaimed for their depth of musicality. Curious as to why there were not more unofficial recordings of the pianist in the form of radio broadcasts or unreleased studio sessions, I set about on a quest to discover lost performances by this great pianist. Over the last few decades I have located approximately 3 hours of previously unknown recordings of Lipatti. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last three decades, I have written CD liner notes for multiple labels (VAI, APR, Opus Kura, Decca), published articles in various music magazines (International Piano, Classical Record Collector, Clavier Companion), and presented lecture/presentations at universities, conservatories, and on the radio.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI host a page on Facebook called \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThePianoFilesWithMarkAinley/\"\u003e\u0027The Piano Files with Mark Ainley\u0027\u003c/a\u003e, which since its inception\u00a08 years ago has garnered over 8000 subscriptions from around the world, including professional pianists and relatives of some of my musical idols from previous generations. Every day of the year - with only a few exceptions - I post a recording from YouTube of a great pianist and describe what it is about their performance that makes it worth listening to. The posts invariably inspire lively, entertaining, and educational commentary by and discussion among the page\u0027s members.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a passion for sharing these recordings and writing about them, but have been constrained from contributing more due to the more mundane realities of time and finances. With Patreon, I will be able devote more time to offer longer, more detailed explorations of pianists, their lives, and recorded legacies. Subscribers will have access to articles, blog posts, and podcasts that will include biographical information, photos, and public-domain recordings (via YouTube) that demonstrate the great pianists\u0027 artistry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining The Piano Files!"
