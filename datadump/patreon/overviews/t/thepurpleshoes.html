Patrons will get early bird previews of demos, artwork and exclusive videos of gigs they weren\u0027t able to attend in person as well as access to my back catalog of work and unreleased tracks depending on how much they choose to support me. However large or small, it will be hugely appreciated by me as my patrons will be my go to gang to share spanking new content with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for caring enough to help me continue doing what I love."
