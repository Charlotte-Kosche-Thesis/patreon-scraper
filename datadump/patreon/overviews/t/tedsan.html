    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eOrigins in frustration\u003c/h1\u003eWhen something goes wrong in your home, where do you turn? Often to a stranger who makes \u00a0money, usually related to how long it takes them to fix your problems. I don\u0027t know about you, but that seems like a conflict of interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter seeing too many people getting taken advantage of, I decided to do something - help people diagnose their own problems so when they called the contractor, they\u0027d know enough to receive the service they were paying for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHelping people help themselves\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://tedsenergytips.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTed\u0027s Energy Tips\u003c/a\u003e started because I love to help people help themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started with individual consulting and teaching. My clients loved that they got impartial information and the information necessary to talk intelligently with contractors. But before long, I realized that there was only one of me and millions of people who needed the same information. Out of this,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tedsenergytips.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTed\u0027s Energy Tips\u003c/a\u003e was born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting and speaking about issues that most homeowners face allows me to get the word out to people everywhere. Vendors don\u0027t pay me to write glowing reviews. I don\u0027t get free products. I do this for the satisfaction of helping people like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFree can only go so far\u003c/h2\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon helps people like me do a better job helping you. While I\u0027d love to keep working for that warm feeling I get when I read your comments, there are bills to pay. Patreon has set up a great system for letting you drop your spare change in my tip jar. It shows me that all this work is helping real people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this case, I\u0027m asking for a small amount for each post I make. If you\u0027ve read\u003ca href=\"http://tedsenergytips.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Ted\u0027s Energy Tips\u003c/a\u003e, you\u0027ve seen that I try to make each post contain practical tips. They might help you reduce your utility bills, track down a mold problem or maybe just make your rooms more comfortable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can do this as long as you want. If you don\u0027t feel like you\u0027re getting anything out of my posts, just turn off the contributions. Or, if you found something particularly easy, you can drop more in the jar. It\u0027s really easy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the way, by default, Patreon fills in $1 and gives me no way to change that. I don\u0027t really expect you to give me $1/blog post! I\u0027d be happy with much less than that."

My wife calls me an Energy Geek and it\u0027s stuck. I admit it, when it comes to home energy use, I geek out. How\u0027s a heat pump work? Should I install solar panels? What\u0027s the right way to do geothermal? I\u0027ve studied it all and now I\u0027m sharing it with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond that, I\u0027m a homeowner, probably like you. I get leaky pipes. My heating systems break down. Sometimes there\u0027s mold growing where it shouldn\u0027t be. And when these things happen, I study the cause and proper repair techniques and either fix it myself or call in a specialist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, I discovered that these expensive specialists usually knew less about how to actually fix the problem than I did after a few hours of reading on the Internet. Sure, they could (sometimes) solder pipe better than me and they had access to certain tools that I didn\u0027t, but usually, they were just people making a buck at my expense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027m here. When someone asks me about a problem, I\u0027m here to share the most practical, cost effective solutions I\u0027ve discovered. I believe in the best fix, not the most high tech one. Sometimes it just involves a little tape. Other times, well, it involves understanding a little science. But whatever the case, you can rest assured that I\u0027m on your side, helping you discover the truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e",
