    "summary": "Hello, I am Jeremiah, The Second Narrator, and I wish to produce for all of you awesome video game orchestral arrangements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started out orchestrating Zelda: Link\u0027s Awakening as a means of teaching myself digital music production. I learned so much from the experience, and have been blessed with many that appreciate my work. People have been constantly asking me to arrange tracks from other games. This is something I would like to do on a regular basis. However, music production is a time consuming task, and being self-employed with currently no income source, I must prevail upon all of you to support me. In return, I will provide you with orchestral arrangements of the highest quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen I orchestrate I do much more than simple arrangements\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn orchestra is not just about having many instruments playing in unison to sound grand. It is an opportunity for a composer to tell stories vividly with an arsenal of instruments at his disposal. Each orchestral section has its own unique flavor, and each instrument has its own personality. My style is to find the essence of an original track, and determine what instruments to use and how they get used in ways that preserve that essence while providing something new. There might be intimate solos, grand swelling of the orchestra, battles between each section, all to inject energy into music we already love.\u00a0Take a listen at my Link\u0027s Awakening arrangements. The average track is 4 times the length of the original version, with ideas expanded on and even original melodies added in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.thesecondnarrator.com/img/patreon/fighting-project-screenshot.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFFVII Battle Theme uses over 75 instrument tracks. Not your typical fan arrangement.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have fully played the games I orchestrate from\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is a big rule I follow, and it is for your benefit too. Only by being completely familiar with the context in which the music originates from can I provide an orchestration that preserves the spirit of the original and also builds on that foundation to create something enhanced. Please reference my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thesecondnarrator.com/played-games.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eever expanding list of games\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e when determining which tracks to nominate for voting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThings to Note\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI use Loudr to obtain the necessary \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emechanical licenses\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e for each track I produce. Even though the MP3\u0027s are given as rewards, I will treat them as sales and the original creators will still be paid the royalty fee I believe they rightfully deserve each time a derivative work is distributed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMany video games have soundtracks that have never been released for sale in the US. The owners of said music have a \"\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eright of first release\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e,\" and can withhold or take down any music I arrange. Hopefully the rewards system Patreon uses does not apply, but it does mean I am not allowed to sell it directly on music stores.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach track is first released as a \"\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003efirst draft\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\" This is so I can take people\u0027s critiques into consideration and eventually tweak and revise the track as I see fit to produce music with the highest quality.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also reserve the\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003e right to veto\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e any voted songs if I feel I cannot produce a worthy arrangement. This applies mostly to music that already feature full orchestrations and/or high quality sample libraries. (example: TES:Skyrim, Call of Duty, Zelda: Skyward Sword, most modern games)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e"
