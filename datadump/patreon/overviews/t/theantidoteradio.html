Some of the artists heard on this programme could be considered \u201cunder the radar\u201d, while other artists have found huge success in the music industry. The common trait between these bands and solo performers is that they\u0027re creating an artistic statement through their music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeatured artists are those who create a unique sound and excel in their artistry. Most episodes feature a single artist and we spend time in conversation with them about their music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Antidote covers a wide spectrum of genres. Ranging from indie folk, punk, rock, alternative rock, hip hop, funk, ska, and the sub-genres of metal, The Antidote will always surprise you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Antidote is an independent broadcast program originated in Southern Ontario, Canada and heard throughout the world via iTunes and www.theantidoteradio.com.\u003cbr\u003e"
