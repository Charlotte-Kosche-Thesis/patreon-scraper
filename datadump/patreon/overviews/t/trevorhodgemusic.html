    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe last two years...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn 2014, I decided to try Patreon out as a means for gathering support to write congregational worship songs. \u00a0I was working part time as a worship pastor, and was keen to keep writing, training and leading to encourage the wider church...but was struggling to make that a priority. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how has it gone? \u00a0Well, as\u00a0a quick summary, the last two years have been amazing! \u00a0I\u0027ve written a whole bunch of songs. \u00a0If we just want to talk figures, then the amount of congregational songs I\u0027ve completed since being on Patreon just about equals the amount of songs I actually finished in the 20 years before that! \u00a0And in regards to quality, I\u0027m confident that some of my best songs have been written over that time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinancially, it has helped me make songwriting a priority, rather than a \u0027leftover time\u0027 activity. \u00a0And its been such an encouragement to share with other musicians that there are other ways that can work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProbably the most encouraging thing for me has been having a team of supporters who are eagerly waiting (or sometimes bugging me...which is cool!) for new songs to be written. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo how about now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of May 2016, I started work full time with EV Church on the Central Coast of NSW, Australia. \u00a0One thing that drew us to this opportunity (among many!) was their shared vision and desire to see churches across Australia, and beyond, encouraged and supported through training, coaching and songwriting. \u00a0Within that, my aim is to be finishing a new song each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo do I still need Patrons?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, in short, yes! \u00a0While I\u0027m being paid a full time salary, the financial support for this wider church component of my role is drawn from a bunch of different sources...including Patreon. \u00a0And this vision, and the support base, is something we\u0027d love to keep growing - we\u0027re exploring a bunch of different initiatives to bless other churches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027d love to invite you to become a Patron, to help enable more great congregational songs be written. \u00a0But beyond that, to be part of a bigger team that\u0027s looking to encourage great music ministry in churches across Australia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
