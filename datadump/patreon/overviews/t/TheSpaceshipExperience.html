Many of my passengers have asked how they can support \"The Spaceship\" and the upcoming \"The Spaceship Experience\" show so I created this Patreon page to tell you more about it and to give you a way to help out. Even if all you have is a little bit, we appreciate support in any amount. We are hoping that with your help we can create a fun and united community comprised of all the best that Portland and surrounding areas have to offer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is The Spaceship Experience?\u003c/h2\u003eThe Spaceship Experience is a mixed reality and variety show featuring the amazing people of Portland and surrounding areas. Follow along as The Spaceship records its adventures and antics interacting with your friends and neighbors. We will be introducing you to new restaurants, bars, breweries, wineries, entertainment venues, local merchants, and up and coming artists of every type. We will be giving people a chance to have their voice heard on topics they are passionate about. We will be doing community service projects. We will definitely be playing some practical jokes on passengers, other drivers, the general public, and from what I hear, not even I will be safe! Think -- Candid Camera / Impractical Jokers / Cash Cab / Carpool Karaoke / Taxicab Confessions / The Tonight Show / and the unique flavor that only a quirky rideshare vehicle dressed like a spaceship in Portland, OR could bring. Check out our YouTube channel after June 1st to see what all the fuss is about.

But that doesn\u0027t even come close to telling you what it is. Close your eyes for a minute and imagine yourself getting into a futuristic vehicle decked out with lights, sounds, and technology that will blow your mind. The Spaceship is a fairly well-known fixture in Portland and can often be seen taking Uber and Lyft passengers from here to there (19,000+ of them so far in fact). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many features and amenities to be experienced once inside the vehicle, but suffice it to say, you will feel like you are traveling in a luxurious and futuristic transport. With snacks, beverages, and good music, you will be put right at ease and we will travel the Portland universe together as I take you where you need to go. Along the way, we might share stories, sing some Spaceship Karaoke, take a short tour, play the Trivia Challenge game, share your talents and superpowers, play other games complete with prizes, or just enjoy an entertaining and mind-blowing travel experience.
