I\u0027m Al-Tariq Shakur Harris, probably known a little bit better as \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eToonrificTariq\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u003cdel\u003e(Do I wish I came up with something better when I was fourteen? Absolutely. But that\u0027s not why we\u0027re here)\u003c/del\u003e and I recently opened up this Patreon account to help fund my journey with these video essays that I\u0027ve been doing for over half a decade now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank anyone who has even scrolled past one of my videos. It amazes me that there are people out there who not only care about animation in the same way that I do, but want to hear me, of all people, ramble on and on about them. You guys are my light. With the funds that I\u0027d gather from this Patreon account, I\u0027ll be able to create these videos a bit more regularly than my normal \"Oh, every eight months\" thing that a lot of my followers had to endure over the years. If you\u0027re new, you\u0027re lucky. It was much worse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch much worse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you all so much for sticking around. I wish my videos had some kind of witty outro that I could put at the end of this, but they don\u0027t so I leave you with my personality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether that\u0027s fair trade or not is completely up to you."
