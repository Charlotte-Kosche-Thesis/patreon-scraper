Hello, I\u0027m the Musical Anti Hero, and I tackle games critically and just for entertainment! I create Critical Editorials (Angry Rants),\u00a0before and after movie reviews (Drive-Thru Reviews), and Comedic Video Game Reviews (IS IT GOOD)! Currently I\u0027m working on developing the, \"League of Heroes Podcast,\" on my channel, a round-table series where we talk about the latest on the web and in gaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I love doing YouTube as a hobby, gaming is \u003cstrong\u003eexpensive! \u003c/strong\u003eWith Youtube\u0027s ever dwindling stability, it\u0027s becoming clearer that crowdfunding is becoming the most stable source of looking at going pro online. This allows us a stiped to work and offset costs, like\u00a0regular maintenance on our equipment (new cables, air cans for cleaning, etc.), as well as the purchasing of vidya games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo What Does My Money Go To?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. EQUIPMENT! First and foremost your money will be going towards equipment and general maintenance. While it doesn\u0027t happen often, wires fry, disks burn, mice die and hard-drives explode. Often I have to drop 5$ for a cable here or there and that\u0027s where a lot of that money will be going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. STUFF! As my channel deals with gaming, I can\u0027t just pull Steam Keys or Plastic Discs out from the nether for you guys. A large majority of the money will be going into games for our review series (IS IT GOOD), or tickets for movie reviews (Drive-Thru Reviews).\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdel\u003e3. MY CRIPPLING ADDICTION TO THE BLIZZARD PET STORE.\u00a0\u003c/del\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. YOU GUYS! Anything that isn\u0027t used on gaming or equipment is going back into the channel. Whether it be for advertising, upping video quality, or even towards\u00a0another giveaway, that money is going forward to you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo How Can I Help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDo anything you want! Talk about my content, share it with people, even yell at me on my social media! But since your here, \u003cstrong\u003eplease consider donating and becoming my Patron.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre There Rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf Course!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonating as little as \u003cstrong\u003e$1\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0will give you access to the Patron\u0027s Only Feed here on Patreon! If you are a member of our Discord, The Hall of Heroes, you\u0027ll also recieve the \"Patron Hero\" tag which will give you access to our secret chats! As a Patron, you\u0027ll also receive early access to all scritped content, and will be sought after for feedback on all scripted videos (IS IT GOOD, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA \u003cstrong\u003e$5\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003edonation will give you a producer credit on the channel, and your name (as it appears on Patreon) will end up in the Endcard for each video, as well as in our livestreams! You\u0027ll also get access to the rewards in the \"Patron Hero Tier.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you looking to just blast money on something ridiculous, our \u003cstrong\u003e$100 JOKE REWARD TIER\u003c/strong\u003e will allow you to challenge me to a dance battle, anytime, anywhere, on social media.
