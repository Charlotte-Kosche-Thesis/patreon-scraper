    "summary": "Hi, and welcome to my Patreon page! I\u0027m Jamie from The Student Developer, a YouTube channel that teaches you how to program in what are said to be the best and easiest tutorials to follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is seriously cool because it allows you guys to help people like myself if you enjoy what i do. It allows you to choose a monthly amount (completely in your control) to fund to help me making more consistent and interesting tutorial videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what are you about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI love making tutorials on YouTube, i enjoy developing and i love knowing that i am helping other people learn how to do it too. When i was first learning to develop, i didn\u0027t have a clue where to start and all the help i could find was complicated, confusing and to be honest, a little boring! I have been building up my YouTube channel over the past couple of years and i have now got a strong audience that love my videos and request help with coding problems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere is an example tutorial\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/OFZC991T9HY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bFn2wuGY9H8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jvhwf6E9D3k\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I benefit from becoming your Patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you enjoy my videos and you love developing as much as i do then you are the perfect Patron. Creating all of these videos takes up a lot of time and as much as i love to make them, i don\u0027t have enough time to do as many as i would like to!\u003cbr\u003e- More frequent videos\u003cbr\u003e- More development subjects\u003cbr\u003e- Better quality (i wont have to rush as much)\u003cbr\u003eObviously you do not have to fund me anything, my videos will still get created just not as regularly as i would love to be able to! So anything you do fund would be absolutely amazing!\u003cbr\u003e"
