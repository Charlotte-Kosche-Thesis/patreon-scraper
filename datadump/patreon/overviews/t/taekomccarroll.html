     "about": "Grew up playing classical Piano and Violin. Only heard classical and \nbalkan folk music, along with Musicals growing up because thats what my \nparents listened to. That was until I learned about the radio around 3rd\n grade. Once I found out about the radio I was introduced to 90s RnB, \nAlternative, Pop, Hip Hop, and some Rock. 50\u0027s \u0026amp; 60\u0027s Pop music \nalong with Jazz was also introduced to me at an early age because of the\n diners, dessert shops and festivals around town in Sacramento. In High \nSchool I got into JPop, since I grew up back and forth between the US \nand Japan, it was only a matter of time. I believe all these styles of \nmusic have a huge influence on my music, and this is why I talk about \nit. My love for Rock music started late, in my last two years of High \nSchool (03\u0027-04\u0027). So you can imagine the very specific things and sounds\n that were happening in rock at that time, which I actually liked and \nfeel like is also an influence on my music. But of course I\u0027ve grown as a\n musician and become more educated in the history of rock and what it \nreally means and my taste for musicians, bands and music have grown \nalong with it.\n\u003cbr\u003eI do this because I love music, I love playing it, performing it, \ncreating it, and being a fan of it. It feeds my soul... so hopefully in \nsharing it to the world, there will be some folks who resonate with my \nmusic too... And that\u0027s why I do this, for me and for the people it may \nresonate with and maybe even help, the way other people\u0027s music has \nhelped me.",
