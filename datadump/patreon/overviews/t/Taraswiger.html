    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m Tara Swiger, the author of Market Yourself (2012, Cooperative Press), and I help makers and artists build sustainable, love-able business. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy podcast, Explore Your Enthusiasm, provides (free!) weekly lessons to handmade business owners. We discuss how to get stuff done (with the workday you have), how to talk about your work (without feeling gross), and how to do more of what you love (and less of what you don\u0027t). Every episode comes with a transcript and many have \u00a0worksheets, checklists, or Resource Guides. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are over 125 free episodes of Explore Your Enthusiasm, along with nearly two hundred videos on YouTube: all if it aimed at creating sustainble maker-based businesses. I make all of this pragmatic business encouragement available for free because I love you, and I want your business to succeed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also created over a dozen online courses, both for my own site and for CreativeLIVE, and I lead an an online community for makers dedicated in building the business they really want (it\u0027s called...The Starship. We are nerds.).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the podcast, YouTube videos, Periscopes and blog posts, and you\u0027d like to have more of it in your life, this is the place to tell me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron, \u003cstrong\u003eeven at the $2 level,\u003c/strong\u003e you\u0027re going to get more behind-the-scenes stuff, including contributing to the podcast and the classes I create! Basically, you\u0027re going to tell me what would help you most, and I\u0027ll make it! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the higher levels, you\u0027re going to get more biz encouragement, like \u003cstrong\u003eweekly texts \u003c/strong\u003ewhere I prompt you to take a biz-building action. At $33/mo you\u0027ll get cold, hard, physical goods: \u003cstrong\u003eA signed copy of my book\u003c/strong\u003e right away and more goods inthe mail as the Patreon grows (check out my goals!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal is simple: I want to create more helpful stuff, for more makers\u003c/strong\u003e, as sustainably as possible (so I can keep doing it for a long time!). Your patronage makes that happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m gonna level with you - my current biz model (lots of free stuff, with applicable, highly valuable clases available only to those who can afford a $200+ class) has been \u003cem\u003every successful\u003c/em\u003e. I pay all of my bills. Both my husband and I work full-time in the business (i.e,. we don\u0027t have any outside income). I\u0027ve traveled the country (and soon, the world!) teaching makers how to become their own business expert.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u0027m ready for the next adventure. Instead of making increasingly expensive classes for a few people, I want to make even more small fun things for \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e people (like my Month of Biz Love (free!) or the 6 week Biz Confidence Challenge (also free!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecause I believe YOU are the best expert in your business.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s right. I\u0027m not the expert. You are.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI know some things, after building my own handmade business (I sold handspun, handdyed yarn, since 2006!) and after working with hundreds of crafters, designers and artists. But I\u0027m unwilling to create a \"brand\" that has to convince you that you are NOT the expert, in order to make more money or seem fancier or earn more prestige.\u003cbr\u003eInstead, \u003cstrong\u003eI want to find the most sustainable way to build your biz confidence\u003c/strong\u003e. I want to make things that remind you of what you already know, that help you take what you know and put it into practice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo do that, to help more makers and artists, at every stage of business (and financial means), I need your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYes, you\u0027re going to get fun behind-the-scenes stuff and not-available-anywhere-else stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBut alo, you\u0027re going to be supporting me and the work I do. You are going to be directly supporting my personal Mission: to spread sustainable, love-fueled businesses, run by artists and makers with integrity, throughout the world. To let every woman know: your work is valuable and you can build the life you want, with hard work and experimentation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt comes down to this:\u003c/strong\u003e If you become my patron, you\u0027re helping me create more goodness for you and other tiny creative businesses who can\u0027t afford to spend money. You\u0027re supporting me in making something that will hopefully inspire \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e to become more adventurous and share your handmade goodness with more people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are working together to tell makers and artists and designers: You can create the business you want. \u003c/strong\u003eYou are the best expert in doing that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy first few goals for the Patreon include:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eGetting a video lighting set-up, so I can make brighter, better videos throughout the colder months.
