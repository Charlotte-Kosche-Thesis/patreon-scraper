    "summary": "What do you think of when you hear the\nword, \u201cBible\u201d? Maybe you picture a relic of a pre-scientific age,\nassociated with a religious mindset that is long on emotion and short\non critical thinking. Or, perhaps you revere the Bible as a sacred\ndocument that is central to your deepest convictions. Either way, the\ninfluence that this difficult, disturbing, and sometimes confusing\nbook has had on world history is undeniable.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have a passion for the Bible, though\nI harbor no illusions about how challenging it is on many levels.  In\nthe course of my studies I have discovered patterns that stretch\nacross different biblical books. These patterns make literary sense,\nyet defy ordinary explanation. I refer to the identification of these\npatterns as \n\u003cem\u003etypologetics\u003c/em\u003e. The results are intriguing, even\nstartling.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet me briefly describe one example. If\nyou begin reading the Bible, starting in Genesis chapter 1, you will\nnotice that God creates the world in six days, after which he rests\non the seventh day. (For the present purpose, we will leave to one\nside the question of how this narrative relates to scientific ideas\nof earth\u2019s origins.) The story describes the seventh day as blessed\nin a way that indicates a superior quality by comparison with the\nprevious six days. In certain other Old Testament passages we find\nsimilarly that the seventh person or event holds a place of honor.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith this feature of the Old Testament\nin mind, we turn to the Christian portion of the Bible, the New\nTestament. The central miracle described there, through which the\npurposes of God are accomplished, is the resurrection of Jesus.\nHowever, the Bible contains stories of other people rising from the\ndead before Jesus did so. Three resurrections were performed by\nancient Hebrew prophets, and three were performed by Jesus himself\nduring his ministry, before his death by crucifixion.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe first six resurrections returned\npeople to ordinary, mortal existence; the resurrection of Jesus, as\nthe New Testament has it, was uniquely to \n\u003cem\u003eimmortal\u003c/em\u003e life.\nNotice that when we assemble these resurrection stories from various\nbiblical books, Jesus becomes the seventh person to rise from the\ndead. Moreover, the resurrection of Jesus has a superior quality,\njust as with the seventh of the creative days of Genesis and certain\nother cases. (See\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.typologetics.com/wp-content/uploads/Resurrection_Pattern.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.typologetics.com/wp-content/uploads/Resurrection_Pattern.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e for a more detailed treatment.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMight the original authors or later\ncopyists have opportunistically manufactured stories in such a way as\nto make the resurrection of Jesus appear to be the seventh in\nsequence?  The details of the evidence plus the light that modern\nscholarship has shed on the documents render conspiracies or other\nnatural explanations implausible. The mystery grows deeper the more\ninformation we assemble.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nObviously, coincidence could in a rare\ninstance create a pattern like the one I have just described. Before\nwe could conclude that there was some supernatural influence at work,\nwe would have to examine a number of these patterns in detail. We\nwould have to develop a pattern of patterns, as it were. That is\nexactly what I do in my Typologetics series. (See\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.typologetics.com/biblical-studies-videos/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e for my first two videos.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter you watch one or more of my\nvideos, please follow up by doing your own research. Go online and\nconsult respected sources concerning the provenance of biblical\nbooks. I\u2019m convinced that the more you know about the subject, the\nstronger my case will appear.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve made these videos because the\nmaterial I present cannot be found elsewhere. I have a job and family\nand pursue my studies on a limited budget. If you find what I am\ndoing to be worth your support, I will use  the funds to bring new\nvideos out more quickly. I will purchase a few pieces of new\nequipment that will make it easier to get quality recording done with\nless setup time. Also, I will pay for some assistance with editing so\nso that I can concentrate on producing scripts. I have enough\nmaterial to keep creating videos indefinitely.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhether or not you choose to support my\nefforts financially, thank you for taking time to view this page. And\nremember to check back regularly on my YouTube channel for the latest\nvideos.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDarek Barefoot\u003cbr\u003e"
