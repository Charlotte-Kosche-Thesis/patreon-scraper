    "summary": "Hi. Im TheVeganAtheist, thank you for stopping by to check out this new patreon project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent the last few years producing videos on YouTube on a variety of topics including atheism, veganism and crazy religious beliefs. The mission of my channel and this Patreon project is to dispel the many myths surround atheism and veganism, and to promote rationality and skepticism in the pursuit of truth. I want to help change the world for the better, and I\u0027m convinced that this is one of many ways to make real progress towards that goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAs many of you have commented, my videos tend to be a slideshow gallery of stock photos, and I\u0027d like to change that. When I first began this channel, all the images I used came from a Google image search. Later, I started up this account with Patreon, and you my fans were super generous and I was able to purchase a subscription to Shutterstock (a professional stock photos service). You aided me in upping my video creation game, and I am forever thankful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow is the time to take the next evolution in video creation and I need your help. I am looking to purchase a subscription to VideoBlocks, a professional stock video footage site, and Epidemic Sound, a professional music service. Both with the addition of stock video, and professional grade music, my content will be much more captivating and entertaining, which will aid in spreading my message. Here\u0027s the rub, VideoBlocks subscription is currently $149 USD, Epidemic Sound is $180 USD, and Shutterstock is $348 USD. If you love my content, and want to see where I can take this channel, please become a Patreon supporter and pledge whatever you can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really do hate asking for handouts and donations, and I know I can really improve my videos with these extra services in place. If you got a few bucks to spare, it will be greatly appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Promise to You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make a promise to you here and now: Once I reach a mere $100 USD a month in support, every last penny above that will be donated to charity. Each month on my Facebook page, I will post the receipt for that month\u0027s charity. I\u0027m not looking to make money from your donations, just help covering some of the costs of production. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything you can spare will help a lot in making my content better. Thank you for your ongoing support and as always thanks for watching.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are new to Patreon, this platform allows you to cap your monthly spending so you have no worry of donating more then you feel comfortable doing. You also have the option to terminate your support at any time, and you will only be charged for videos produced. Initially I plan on releasing 1 video per week, however if we can reach the upper tier milestones, I will be aiming for 6-8 videos per month. Patreon is like a Kickstarter for video creators, aiding us produce better quality content for our fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will agree that this project is necessary, beneficial and deserving of your continued support. There is a lot of work to do, am I\u0027m ready to get started. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
