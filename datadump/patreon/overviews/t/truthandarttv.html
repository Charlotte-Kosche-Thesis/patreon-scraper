So whose side are you on? I\u0027m with God, truth, honesty and love. I\u0027m with justice, accountability, freedom of speech and the U.S. Constitution. I\u0027m with America and conservative and family values. I believe in life and I believe faith is a good thing. I also believe in small government ruled for and by the people and I believe in the free market. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately there are many entities today that are very against everything I\u0027ve listed above and that should concern us all. I believe people have a right to disagree with me. This is the essence of free speech. I don\u0027t believe however that someone has a right to silence or censor my free speech just because they don\u0027t agree with it. There IS a moral standard of right and wrong and that should be our guide along with the \u0027do no harm\u0027 principle.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, welcome again and if you like the work produced by my channel please support this effort and help spread the word. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace and God bless,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBernie Suarez\u003cbr\u003e",
