We\u0027re losing caves to development so time is pressing. And state of the art technology to help with cave modelling is developing fast - but at a price!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin The.CaveMan on Patreon and he\u0027ll be making more cave art. From images to videos to 3d models to 3d printed models to virtual cave tours using Laser, Lidar, Photogrammetry and Photospheres\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis isnt a project; more a lifetimes work! There are 600 cave entrances within 2 hours drive from here (Kuching, Sarawak). Many completely unexplored.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe content, much of it exclusive, will be delivered to you using e-booklets. Posts will be made on Patreon which link to a new or updated e-booklet. Each e-booklet will either be about a cave system or about other aspects of the underworld and the work which The.Caveman is doing. Towards the end of each month a simple text paid post will trigger your Patreon invoice at whatever reward level (+VAT if appropriate) you have chosen. On the 1st of the following month the payment transaction will be triggered by Patreon. Every 6 months we will send an email asking you to confirm that you wish to continue with your pledge - Reply \u0027No\u0027, or no reply at all, and your pledge will be suspended until we hear from you. You can of course cancel your patronage at any time. You are not committed for life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProcessing fees come out of your pledge - they are not additional. The fees (Patreon and Paypal) are pretty steep for a $1 pledge but reduce rapidly for larger amounts. However, every bit helps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to join The.Caveman in making cave art....\u003cbr\u003eTHANKYOU!"
