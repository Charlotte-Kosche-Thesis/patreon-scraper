Abridged!\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eMAGI: The Abridged Series of Magic\u003c/em\u003e, and many other parody series! We\u0026#8217;ve had fun making abridged content over the years, and hope to continue to do so. We\u0026#8217;re thankful for all the support that you - the loyal schmucks - have given us over the years. We want to say thank you from the bottom of our schmucky little hearts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why do we want your money? Well...we kind of realized that have too much on our plate! (There are only so many editors we can lock up in our basement to get this all done.) In order to fix this, we\u0026#8217;re looking to hire some extra help to help get content out at a steadier pace! The majority of our Patreon proceeds would be going \u00a0to the channel to help increase content production and quality. By reaching out Patreon goals, we\u0027d be able to put more time into making the content you\u0026#8217;ve know and love...or hate...lovingly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe pledges here are in no means a way of payment for episodes\u003c/strong\u003e. The pledges just help us get the episodes out faster. Regardless of how much we make from this, we still plan on making the best possible content we can. We just want to get our content to you guys as fast as possible because we love you! Especially you, person that is reading this!. You know who you are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help the future of The Schmuck Squad. Our dream is to not only continue to work on what you\u0026#8217;ve come to love from us, but to also create original content one day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom all of us here at The Schmuck Squad, we want to say thank you for taking the time to read this. We hope to serve you the best way we know how: by being total schmucks! And\u0026#8230; making you laugh...or cringe laugh...whatever floats your boat! We love you!"
