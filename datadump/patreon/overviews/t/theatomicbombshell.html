    "summary": "Well, hello!\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, thank you for taking the time to check my page out. I\u0027m a burlesque performer living and working in New Orleans, LA. Having been trained as a ballerina since the age of 5 and schooled in the arts of song and acting, there was no career I would settle for other than one that involved the stage. I started my burlesque career at the House of Blues in New Orleans with Bustout Burlesque and have since decided that I wish to seek a broader career in burlesque.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the coming year, I plan to travel the country, performing in festivals, collaborating with new troups and launch my own production company, or \"troupe,\" at home in New Orleans to help spread the beauties of the South a little further and bring the sparkly arts to more places. After 3 years in the game, I\u0027ve begun to feel the production itch. To do this, I need a little help though. I work for my living, like anyone else, but getting a new company off the ground, travel costs, and financing the intricate costumes involved in burlesque isn\u0027t always in my general budget. That\u0027s where my Patrons save the day. The money pledged here doesn\u0027t go towards my groceries or my rent. I funnel 100% of it into my art and business, giving you a tangible image of what your money has the power to do. Through this page I will document my costume construction, tours, and general behind the scenes magic making for your viewing pleasure. I\u0027ll even sprinkle in unreleased photo sets exclusive to Patreon. If you love watching my shenanigans on social media, and want to support by coming to shows, but simply can\u0027t, this is your place. Get a little closer to the inner sanctum of the mess that is my creative process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have named the reward tiers in relation to the hierarchy of rhinestones in the showgirl world. Each tier approximately pays for 1-2 regular sized packages of the rhinestones for which it is named, and since that\u0027s where a huge portion of my budget goes, it seems only right to name the tiers as such.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI welcome you to poke around a little bit and if you decide this is/I am a project you\u0027d like to be involved with, I invite you to join in and thank you for doing so."
