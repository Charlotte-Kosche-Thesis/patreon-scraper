    "summary": "(NOTE: \u003cbr\u003eI am aware of the fact that i don\u0027t work on my channel every single day of month. So i have decided to reward in a way that you still benefit even if i upload less frequently ( which hopefully won\u0027t happen often. But still you guys should not pay price of my absence.)\u003cbr\u003eAlso it will change absolutely nothing about the way i make my tutorials. Thay will 100% just like the way i have been making them. these are just extra added perks)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, i am Dhruval.\u003cbr\u003eThe guy who runs the youtube channel \u0027Tutorials junction\u0027. For 3 years i have been making tutorials teaching about photo editing in photoshop.\u003cbr\u003eThis is my full time job at the moment and i am very happy with it. I am not gonna pretend i can\u0027t afford food or housing or some other basic necessity. Thankfully that is all well. \u003cbr\u003eBUT\u00a0i think i can expend my field of content, do something more than standard photoshop videos which i am doing for years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSHARING MORE BEHIND THE SCENES INFORMATION ABOUT MY VIDEOS.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThing that really bugs me is i am not able to show the trial and error parts of the process. All the files and ideas that i scraped before i finalize something. My behind the scene thought process. Or something like \u003cem\u003e\"How i got the idea in the first place?\"\u003c/em\u003e Or \u003cem\u003e\"why this particular tutorial and not something else?\"\u003c/em\u003e Or my thought process behind selection of certain images. There is so much that i could share here which is not possible to showcase in regular tutorials.\u003cbr\u003e(in case i don\u0027t upload many videos a certain month, i will share stories about some old videos that might be helpful)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSHARING MY PERSONAL PSD FILES FOR PRACTICE.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow i know there are some tutorial sites and channels who share their final files for free and nice of them to do this but i personally believe in not giving away source files just like that. For me they are valuable assets which i don\u0027t want to share for free. By pledging just 5$ you can ask for any two files of your liking and also i will answer your couple of questions (in written form) related to those files. Anything you want to know that might be useful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePERSONAL TEACHING.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see the work people send me and first thing that comes in my mind that \u003cem\u003e\"This could be so much better with guidance in right direction.\"\u003c/em\u003e I can help someone more in one hour of personal teaching that i might not be able to teach in 5 separate tutorials. Not to mention that it will take so much less time and effort compare to regular videos. You can ask me about anything, not just photoshop. May be some general questions about arts or graphic design or business. Also you can ask for guidance about your client work. Whatever you want :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
