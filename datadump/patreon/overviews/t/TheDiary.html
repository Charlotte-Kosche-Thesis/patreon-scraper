    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eThe Story Behind The Diary\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch4\u003ea Rock Opera Musical by Dwight Mitchell Herdrich based on the Diary of Lillian Carroll\u003c/h4\u003eOn a sunny but cold Maine winter day in 1999, I was reading the Winter \u201999 issue of youth group \u201cYoung Life\u2019s\u201d magazine \u201cRelationships\u201d, and came across a story simply titled \u201cThe Diary\u201d. It was the actual diary entries of a high school girl from the early \u201880s that the author had sent in to the magazine as a \u2018thank you\u2019 to her youth leaders and the organization, so that they could see what a huge impact Young Life and Christianity had had on her life, and how it completely turned her around for the better. As I read the first entry, one passage hit me like a brick - \u201cWhere did You go? Are You even there? I\u2019m afraid to believe in you God, but then\u2026 I\u2019m afraid not to\u201d. I seriously had an \u201con-the-road-to-Damascus\u201d moment - I felt God tell me \u201cThis is why I gave you music\u201d I got up and ran over to my piano, and the song \u201cWhere Did You Go\u201d was playing in my head - I just started playing it on the keys, and then scratched out the notes as fast as I could on some scrap paper. After I got most of it down, I thought back on the few other songs I had written over the years, and realized that all of them would fit this story - which again freaked me out, since that meant that I already had 4 songs written, and had just had this idea come to me a few minutes beforehand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo as sometimes happens with me, I went a bit overboard (OK\u2026 maybe a lot overboard\u2026.) and spent the next 4 years writing more songs, building a recording studio in my basement, finding several guitarists, brass musicians, recording the various parts down there as well as in Michigan with my good friend and drummer Van Hunsberger, finding a Gospel choir, recording them also in Michigan, and then realizing I had spent way too much time and money on this thing\u2026 so I just needed to wrap it up. Because what I didn\u2019t mention here, is that our first 2 kids were born during this time\u2026 so\u2026.. yeah, it needed to wrap up. (see the overboard mentioned above\u2026) My original goal was to create a Rock Opera similar in style to Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cThe Wall\u201d or The Who\u2019s \u201cTommy\u201d, that followed the actual true story of Lillian Carroll, but instead of it being about a dark, downward spiral of despair, it would be the opposite story of someone who was lost, found Christ through Young Life, and then thrived. But I realized in 2002 that I had definitely spent too much time down in the studio, away from my new family, and also spent way too much of my own money - I needed to just finish with what I had. My friend Van - also an architect like me - had traded his design time for studio time, and offered to let me use it to have the songs mixed and mastered, which we did - and it came out very well, considering how we had pieced all the people and parts together. We also put together several live shows, including a huge production in 2004 at the Ypsilanti Untied Methodist Church with the Eastern Michigan Gospel Choir who sang on the album, along with a 12 piece band.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I\u2019m not a singer - at least not a lead vocalist, so once the CD came out and I tried \u201cshopping\u201d it to the record labels and radio stations, I was told by many different people that the male vocals were weak, that it wasn\u2019t really \u201cproduced\u201d to be radio-ready, and that at only 12 songs, it didn\u2019t really tell the full story like a real rock opera. I had also decided not to record the diary entries, which made it impossible to understand the story of the Diary from just the songs unless you read them in the CD booklet. Everyone loved the songs, the music, the lyrics, the story, and especially the message, but it wasn\u2019t ready for mass-consumption as a CD or marketable product - it needed more songs, the diary entires, and it needed to be polished.\u003cbr\u003eDeep down inside I knew they were all right - and for some reason, it didn\u2019t crush me, since I knew God had a plan - I had already done more than I was really supposed to, and when it was time to do it the right way, things would line up, and God would make it happen.\u003cbr\u003eI believe that time is now. (cue dramatic music\u2026.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCONNECTIONS\u003cbr\u003eIn 2004 we moved down to Florida to be closer to all the grandparents, I started my own design-build firm along with a home furnishings store, played keyboards in a couple of amazing church\u2019s Worship Teams that grew into mega-churches, and then had everything come crashing down in 2010 in the great recession\u2026 lost everything except for my family, but somehow through all that my faith grew stronger than ever\u2026 we then moved back up to Maine in 2011 to our old jobs and friends. Surprisingly, in the past 6 years here in Maine, I\u0027ve actually made more connections in the music industry than ever before - even though I had not even been thinking about The Diary. One of those people is recording artist Kate Schrock who is our neighbor across the street - her son Rosie and my youngest son Noah are best friends and go to elementary school together, so we\u0027ve shared lots of musician stories while waiting at the bus stop. She\u2019s run into a lot of people I\u2019m fans of over her years touring the world, and told me of how Bob Lanois - brother of mega-producer Daniel Lanois (U2, Peter Gabriel, Brian Eno) is her harmonica player whenever she gigs in Canada. Recently, she told me of how she is back in the studio working on a new album, and that she is excited that Daniel Lanois\u2019 protege\u2019 and Grammy award winning producer Malcolm Burn was most likely going to mix and produce her new album\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e ENTER FACEBOOK\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/753/358/0b442c5b90b4e88aadbd1fcbefe880c2_original.jpg?w=680\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;v=1488765228\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;q=92\u0026amp;s=aeb9b1a4b21b517dfbcf41e1ab77a5fa\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-weight: inherit;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo of course, being the groupie I am, I friended Malcolm, and have since learned that we have a lot more in common than I assumed\u2026 not the typical record producer\u2026 and he actually married an Australian singer who grew up playing in Christian rock bands. He also produced some of my all-time favorite albums and bands including Peter Gabriel\u2019s \u201cUs\u201d, Midnight Oil\u2019s \u201cBreathe\u201d, John Mellencamp\u2019s \u201cHuman Wheels\u201d, Iggy Pop, Neville Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Chris Whitley, along with some guy named Bob Dylan, Patti Smith, and many more. So on a whim, I sent him one of my songs from The Diary called \u201cThink On Such Things\u201d, which is basically Phillipians 4 put to music\u2026. and HE LIKED IT. Which, to be honest, I wasn\u2019t expecting. At all. So I actually took a step back, and prayed about it, and started re-thinking The Diary\u2026. and how God had told me that He would tell me when it was time to finish it. I was also reminded of another new friend in the music industry - Dan Russell, the co-creator of the huge SoulFest Christian music festival in New Hampshire. Dan just decided at 60 years old to start his first album - after 35+ years helping other artists, he felt he really was supposed to do this, and launched a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the project. I talked with him at the recent Switchfoot concert here in Portland a few weeks ago about it, and he encouraged me to do the same. And I heard a voice ask me \u201chow long are you going to wait?\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLAUNCH\u003cbr\u003eSo I believe it\u2019s time to finish what I started 18 years ago\u2026 which actually, seems insane even realizing it was 18 years ago\u2026 Malcolm has agreed to produce and mix The Diary for a very reduced fee - and we are also planning on producing The Diary as a live concert starting in Portland, hopefully at Merrill auditorium, and then possibly New England or beyond. But this time, I can\u2019t do it alone this time - I need financial help as well as help with all of the logistics, since this is a fairly large undertaking.\u003cbr\u003eThe Diary is a true story of hope - of God rearranging a heart, and rescuing one of His kids from the traps of this world. It\u2019s also a story of how powerful an effective youth group like Young Life can be. One of my favorite parts of this whole story is that my oldest Zac was born just before I first read Lillian\u2019s diary 18 years ago, and Sophie was born just before it was completed - and now, this past summer, Zac volunteered on the wait staff at Young Life\u2019s Lake Saranac camp in the Adirondacks after 4 years of being in club, and my daughter Sophie has been in Young Life for 3 years now - we also hosted club at our house for 2 years, and my wife and I are on the local committee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePortland Maine is the second least churched city in the US - and New England is the least churched region - meaning, there are literally millions of people here that have never heard who Jesus is, and very few people go to church here. The Diary is an evangelical tool unlike a lot of others out there, in that it actually follows the true story of salvation of a current day kid - using music and the pain and joy of personal diary stories to convey the message of hope that comes from knowing Jesus. It brings the story of Jesus to modern day in an accessible, relevant way.\u003cbr\u003eAfter we performed The Diary for the very first time in Portland back in 2003, a high school kid from the audience came up to me and said \u201cyou know when the girl sang \u201cI Give My Heart\u201d\u2026. I just did that. I just gave my heart to Jesus\u201d. I will never, ever forget that. Somehow, God used this girl\u2019s story in her Diary, and the music, to speak to this kid\u2019s heart, and win his soul. I was speechless\u2026 I just stared at him, and then finally figured I should get his phone number or something\u2026. he ended up becoming a Young Life kid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE DIARY\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/753/346/59531d959839ee9c5ff1d6c93aff5324_original.jpg?w=680\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;v=1488765168\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;q=92\u0026amp;s=4914a0c43211ec61a8abb1e7e2784e01\" style=\"margin: 0px; font-weight: inherit;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"The Diary\" is an actual, true diary by Lillian Carroll, which was printed, in the Young Life magazine \u201cRelationships\u201d Winter 1999 issue. It is her story of a troubled High School girl and follows her involvement in the Christian youth group Young Life and her subsequent conversion to Christianity. However, instead of that conversion being the happy ending, this follows her very real and difficult temptations and emotional struggles which followed her conversion, as well as the victories and hurdles she overcame.\u003cbr\u003eThe songs all follow her story, as in an opera, and some songs are actually the main character (Lily) singing her diary. Other songs are sung by friends or Young Life leaders in response to her.\u003cbr\u003eSONGS \u2014 The songs hold true to the classic opera format by composing different \u0027themes\u0027 for different meanings. For example, at the very end of \"Where did You go ?\" there is a 4-note woodwind part, which is used throughout the opera as the Holy Spirit theme. There is also a 3-note theme, which begins \u201cThis Present Darkness\" and \u0027Conversion\" which is the theme for evil. These good and evil parts get played against each other, especially in \"Conversion\" which is an instrumental song about evil trying to take over Lillian\u0027s soul, and then being pushed back by the Holy Spirit, with the Holy Spirit winning her soul. Below are brief descriptions of the songs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Where did You go?\"- the opening song, basically posing this huge dilemma: \"Where did You go? Are You even there? I\u0027m afraid to believe in You God, but then \u2014 I\u0027m afraid not to.\" Again, the end of the song has a glimmer of musical \u0027hope\u0027 with the Holy Spirit theme.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cThis Present Darkness\"- This song introduces the evil musical theme and is a slow, but driving song that coincides with the suicide of the character Brad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Holiness\" \u2014 This song is sung by an adult Young Life leader in response to Brad\u0027s death from a Christian\u0027s point of view. It describes the pain of the death, but of the hope in Jesus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomeone \u2014 This is sung by one of the Young Life leaders to the main character. \"There\u0027s someone trying to get your attention His name is Jesus.\" This song has a gospel choir singing along with the chorus throughout the second half of the song.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJesus was a Carpenter \u2014 A song similar to the Broadway show \"STOMP\" in that all the percussion is actually computer sampled woodworking tools and not real instruments. Lyrically a very condensed version of the Gospel. The second half of the song is sung by the Gospel Choir, repeating, \" Jesus is coming back \u2014 Halleluiah!\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConversion \u2014 explained above. The tempo is double that of the song \"Darkness\" though, as if the enemy (Satan) is panicked about losing Lily\u0027s soul to Christ The second half is actually an orchestral version of \"Know Your Love\" and is inspired by the 3rd movement of Beethovan\u0027s 5th Symphony. The Holy Spirit theme is inserted in the quiet parts of the first half of the song as if it is God speaking to her, and then God\u0027s victory is the 2nd half.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI Give My Heart- sung by Lily, talks about her new found life and hope in Christ \u2014 \"I give my heart \u2014You hand me a new start \u2014 I call on Your name \u2014 Your love heals my pain.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChanging \u2014 Talks about how difficult it is for Lily being caught between old non-Christian friends and new Christian friends who don\u0027t really know her.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink on such things \u2014 This is sung by one of the Young Life leaders to the main character in response to her having trouble changing her old ways and not fitting in. The lyrics are Phillipians 4:4-8.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Why do I?\"- sung by Lily, tells of her difficulty in falling to temptation. \"Why do I- do the things that I don\u0027t want to do, but then I - cannot do what I know I should do, and then I- keep on doing what I shouldn\u0027t do \u2014 Oh Lord please help me \u2014 Jesus please save me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Race \u2014 An instrumental that is supposed to be a musical version of a person\u0027s walk with God \u2014 \"the good race\" as talked about in Hebrews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnow Your Love \u2014 This is sung by the main character near the end of the diary when she is totally in love with Jesus. This corresponds with the July 18th 1981 entry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGod\u0027s Side \u2014 The grand finale. I actually wrote the music to this 17 years ago before I was a Christian. The Chorus used to be \"When you come outside\" and right after I became a Christian, this friend of mine who was dicipling me said \"Why don\u0027t you change it to When you\u0027re on God\u0027s side?\". So I did, and it is basically a summary of this whole story. This is one of the songs that I felt God told me was written for the story even though I wrote it years before I read it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
