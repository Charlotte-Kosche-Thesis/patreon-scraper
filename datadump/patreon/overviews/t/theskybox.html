    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is this comic?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Skybox is a webcomic in a storyboard-animatic style, updated every Tuesday. The story follows Shanti, a skeptical and overworked high schooler whose plane crashes en route to India. Shanti is saved in midair by Phoebus, a creature that calls itself a Gryphside. Phoebus insists that he cannot land on the ground, but he will bring her to the one and only place he can...a mysterious, roaming cube that his kind call the Skybox.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat the Skybox is, how it got there, and how it changes the fates of all its inhabitants are all for Shanti to figure out\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho\u2019s making this, anyway?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m currently working in the animation industry, and have done storyboards and background design on such series as Axe Cop, Major Lazer and My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. Even then, I\u2019m always drawing on other fun things. The Skybox isn\u2019t my first webcomic...my previous comic, Lunargyros, ran for over five years before concluding the story. The Skybox has currently been running for almost two years, but still has aways to go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is this Patreon for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, your Patreon support will go towards other means of producing the comic, including for mobile devices, print comic books, or perhaps even moving animatics! Your Patreon support also helps cover the time it takes to produce, so that I can focus on The Skybox instead of other freelance work. Being presented as a storyboard-style comic, The Skybox involves almost three times as much drawing as a normal comic...it\u2019s very time-consuming!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hGTV2US.jpg\"\u003e"
