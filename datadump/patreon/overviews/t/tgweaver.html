I\u0027ve been producing art for the internet for over 12 years now.\u003cbr\u003eI make comics, run quests (which themselves are basically interactive comics), draw cartoony monsters, and create little worlds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 227, 188);\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://w.secret.graphics\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThanks to the generosity and continued support of all my fans, The Website is finally here!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Come join the fun, but please -- you must be 18 or older!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo come check out the site for a selection of the many things in store!\u003cbr\u003e Some of these things:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5F9xnOa.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also find updates, news, and other such posts here on \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://tgweaver.tumblr.com/\"\u003emy blog (18+!)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may know my work from quests and web series like RubyQuest, DiveQuest, and NanQuest, or comics like Boxdog and Aganomad. You may just know me from the various weird monsters I doodle, or the assorted fanart I draw, or even the old drawhores of /b/ like Epic Fail Guy. Or you may not know me at all. That\u0027s fine too. Now you do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut whether it\u0027s continued and serious narratives, or just doodles in the margin, I\u0027m drawing every day. And I hope to keep it that way forever, for myself, and for all of my gracious fans who enjoy and support what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Future: Where Does the Money Go\u003cbr\u003eShort answer: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe website, and keeping me alive!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLong answer:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 227, 188);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(235, 241, 221);\"\u003eOne question I heard a lot was \"where can I find all of your work\"? Well, until now, I didn\u0027t have a single answer for that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut thanks to everyone\u0027s support,  \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://w.secret.graphics/\"\u003eI now finally have a website \u003cem\u003e(18+!)\u003c/em\u003e -- a single, centralized repository for ALL my work.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\nIt comes complete with a searchable and comment-ready database of comprehensively-tagged pictures, plus a bunch of fun little features like a Tegaki board, a gachapon machine, an interactive stickerbook, and more. At long last, a place to put every single thing I make, which has notoriously been scattered to different sites, as well as plenty of stuff \nthat\u0027s never been posted before. As of now, the site\u0027s archive is still \nbuilding up, but it will be added to in large batches.\u003cbr\u003e I owe all \nthis to the people who\u0027ve supported me so well for so long. I can only \nhope it one day becomes good enough to deserve all you\u0027ve given me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that this is done, I can host all of my own works, and I mean \u003cstrong\u003eall\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eof my works, from early drawhoring days to present, in one convenient location! Quests and comics will be rehosted here with a coherent interface eventually, ready to browse in a format more friendly than the simple chan board structure. New comics and adventures await as well! No more rehosting on third party sites just so people can catch up with stories, no more months of downtime when a host goes out. Further, possible merchandise and commissioning options could be available! It\u0027s my chance to branch out and establish something bigger, that will benefit everyone.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m serious about this website! It\u0027s taken a long time, but it\u0027s here! Some funds will go towards hosting/domain, and keeping the website running!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I won\u0027t lie! The truth is most of it will go towards simple things, like food, utilities, rent, and just getting myself by. Building the website will continue now that it\u0027s gone public, but I continued survival is a priority too. I\u0027m transparent that way. And for the sake of full disclosure, I am making public that my monthly rent and bills, and all fees included, comes to about $500 USD. Used to be way lower, but this is the world we live in. So hey, now you know that about me.\u003cbr\u003eBut that means I have more time and more ability to focus on my work and my art, and as a result, I should be able to keep a better update schedule on my primary projects going forward! That, I think, would go a long way.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause much of my work may sometimes be adult in themes of violence or sexuality, I will be playing it safe and not hosting material directly on Patreon or other sites that have careful guidelines about \"not safe for work\" material. So be forewarned that any content from this point on may be not safe for work, and be aware of adult content!\u003cbr\u003eOf course, the best place to go is \u003ca href=\"https://w.secret.graphics/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emy new website, TGWeaver\u0027s Trash Pile!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0027s got everything, and while the gallery is still being built, I\u0027m adding to it all the time, stocking in old pictures and updating new ones!\u003cbr\u003eYou can find other general purpose work, news, updates, and personal feed on \u003ca href=\"http://tgweaver.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy blog\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eFor comics and quests, check the following links for \u003ca href=\"https://w.secret.graphics/custom-pages/NanQuest\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNanQuest\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://w.secret.graphics/custom-pages/DiveQuest\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDiveQuest\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://w.secret.graphics/custom-pages/RubyQuest\"\u003eRubyQuest\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://w.secret.graphics/custom-pages/Boxdog\"\u003eBoxdog\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://w.secret.graphics/custom-pages/Aganomad\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAganomad\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eFor specific pools of fanart while the gallery is made more complete, your best bet is \u003ca href=\"http://www.derpibooru.org/tags/artist-colon-the-weaver\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere for My Little Pony\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://5naf.booru.org/index.php?page=post\u0026amp;s=list\u0026amp;tags=weaver\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere for Five Nights at Freddy\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you pledge to me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not sure!

And with your help, I pledge to draw even more of those things, forever. For that, you have my eternal gratitude. Getting that website thing working would sure help too, for everyone involved.\u003cbr\u003eBesides, giving away your hard-earned money to a stranger over the internet so that this stranger can keep doing what they\u0027re already doing for free is not just smart, it\u0027s cunning.
