Talking Bout The Blues provides intellectual conversations, historical facts, and necessary coverage of the African American experience that uplifts our community while working toward a more diverse media outlet. \u003cbr\u003e\n Located in New York City with an audience reach of \u00a0just over 44k and 3750-4000 listeners per week on our live stream podcast, Talking Bout The Blues, holds a very important ingredient - it is a targeted, niche audience predominantly covering families 28 to 55 years of age. Out of the 44k listeners , more than half are located in the United States. Because our main focus is to celebrate the African American Heritage and preserve Blues music and culture, the educational portion of our media and broadcast caters to families, schools, and mom and pop businesses. As servants of the African American community, we push literacy, and music appreciation. Majority of our audience are working families, whether one or two parent homes, and they fall in between the range of middle to upper middle class.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e Our goal is to enlighten and reconnect our community to the original American music that was birthed through the Black Experience on this land, so we can encourage our community to reclaim our history,\u00a0utilize our voice to tell our story, and pass our heritage and culture through generations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTalking Bout The Blues Podcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTalking Bout The Blues\u003c/em\u003e podcast is our featured program that took the brand from a hobby to a business.
