Our long form, on-going actual play series are called The Campaigns. Our one-shot just for fun episodes are called Field Trips. We also feature new RPG\u0027s (either new to us, or brand new) in shows called The Trials. We also have shows that features guests called Show \u0026amp; Tell and lastly we have on occasion done some episodes where we review RPG themed movies called Movie Day.\u00a0 Our Twitch channel runs a highly improv D\u0026amp;D crime procedural show called Lawful \u0026amp; Orderly and a lightly RPG themed talk show called Detention.\u00a0 Our Youtube channel hosts DMing 101 videos as well as Synergy videos where we take a pack of Magic The Gathering cards and use them to outline an adventure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGot it. You do Gaming Podcasts and such. So what is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowd funding site, similar to a Kickstarter. The main difference is that a Patreon page is tailor made for creatives that do a bunch of small things, while Kickstarter is better suited for somebody doing a single, larger-scale project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe other big differences are that Patreon pledges are recurring, and they are only paid AFTER content is delivered.\u003cstrong\u003e Think of it like a future \u201ctip\u201d for us releasing stuff you like.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo basically, \u00a0you\u0027re\u00a0begging for money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo! \u003cbr\u003eWell, sorta.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started the website and podcasts because we thought it would be fun. And it is. Lots of fun. But it also takes up a lot of time. We our previous Patreon support we\u0027ve had the luxury of upgrading our recording equipment and now we have some of better audio quality you\u0027ll find on a \u0027hobby\u0027 podcast. We\u0027ve also upgraded our computer systems and software to make editing easier and faster. But with each new toy comes the yearning to do bigger and better things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you, you ask?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start, The Rpg Academy podcast will remain free, regardless of the amount of pledges we get. \u00a0We average 6 or 7 episodes a month. If you back us at the lowest level \u00a0of $1 a month is equivalent of paying .15 per episode!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you are already getting those episodes for free now, then that\u0027s still not a great deal, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach reward level comes with its own \"THANK YOU\" package. At that lowest level, it is a literally big THANK YOU on the podcast and unlimited high-fives. At the second tier you get access to a special Campaign series that is exclusive to Patreon Backers.\u003cbr\u003eTo the left, we\u0027ll be adding Milestone Goals as we receive more donations. These goals affect everyone because if they are reached we\u0027ll be able to do even more each month and everybody gets to benefit, regardless of individual pledges!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that\u0027s the deal! If you like our show and want to support us, you can. Tell other gamers to give our show a listen. Leave us a review on iTunes or Stitcher radio. Use our website links to buy merchandise from Amazon or Drive Thru RPG. And, of course, If you are willing and able to pledge some cash, it will be much appreciated and wisely invested (Bitcoins are still a thing, right?) in the show and our various projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there is anything else you would like to know, feel free to email us at \u003ca class=\"__cf_email__\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e[email\u00a0protected]\u003c/a\u003e\n/*  */ or send me a Tweet @TheRpgAcademy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!!\u003cbr\u003eMichael\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
