    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m TheNathanNS, I\u0027m a content creator on YouTube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of my videos revolve around creating in-depth content for Bully: Scholarship Edition (aka Canis Canem Edit) and I prefer to make content based around content people may not know about it, like the cut content and the lore surrounding Bully. Sometimes I\u0027ll do videos about other Rockstar Games, but 95% of my content is strongly centered around Bully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I have the following series going on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBully Beta:\u003c/strong\u003e Where I analyse the cut and changed content for Bully, this varies from storyline changes, features, characters and much more. In this series I do my own analysis and try my hardest to source as much material as I possibly can, be it from the game files, or pre-release stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBully Mysteries:\u003c/strong\u003e In this series I try and dig quite a bit into the lore of Bully, analysing Bullworth and what secrets we may not know.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMobile ripoffs\u003c/strong\u003e: A slightly more laid back series where I play through some horrendously bad knock off games based off Bully on Android.\u00a0 (by based off, I mean stealing artwork, the name or even game assets)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacter Critiques:\u003c/strong\u003e This series is where I try and analyse characters from different Rockstar Games and how I feel they were portrayed, how well they were written and any improvements that could\u0027ve been made to them amongst other criticisms. I try to go quite in depth with them.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor scheduling, I \u003cstrong\u003etry\u003c/strong\u003e to get a video around once every 2 weeks (at maximum) this is because of college scheduling and (for my main series) I would like to spend more time editing, as opposed to \"generic gameplay with commentary\" (unless it\u0027s a beta mission/feature showcase etc)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOccasionally I might showcase off some mods, or a shitpost video, which doesn\u0027t require much effort to make so they will probably be uploaded a week from the last video or so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce you\u0027ve made one payment, you\u0027ll start getting credited in my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
