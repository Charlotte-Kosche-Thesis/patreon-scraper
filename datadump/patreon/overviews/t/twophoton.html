We met almost four years ago at a summer research program and became immediate friends. However, it wasn\u0027t until the summer of 2015 that we transformed our casual doodlings into a project with purpose. A trip to Nicaragua inspired us to create our first zine Volcanoes. Since then we\u0027ve covered topics in neuroscience, math, conservation biology, and more. We\u0027ve also ventured into the fashion scene by creating science and nature themed pins and patches. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe science doesn\u0027t have to end in the lab. Our goal is to creatively communicate science in ways that are accessible and fun, no matter your background! We have shared our love of science with artists and nonscientists by tabling at zine fests up and down the west coast and even in Berlin. One time, we even brought our zines to the largest neuroscience conference in the world and shared art with scientists! We are all about combining art and science in unpretentious ways that inspire people to create their own art or pursue scientific topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[You can read more about our zines on our \u003ca href=\"http://www.twophotonart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e and find our pins, patches, and zines for sale in our \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/TwoPhotonArt\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eShop\u003c/a\u003e!]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f330/terapauline/Why%20we%20need%20your%20help_zpsm47yvkn7.png\" style=\"width: 365px;\"\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur time is divided between our scientific day jobs and our efforts with Two Photon Art. Christine is a neuroscience PhD student, Tera works at an environmental non-profit. While time is a resource we can try to manage, money isn\u0026#8217;t as easy! We use all of our extra time and cash to make zines and wearable goodies related to science and nature. As we grow, it feels like all of our extra time and money still isn\u0026#8217;t enough. We need your help to expand our creative potential! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your contribution, we will churn out more zines and pins. We\u0027ll also invest in quality materials. Our first zines were made using black ink on standard print paper, but with additional funds, we can step up our game and print with color and a risograph!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditional funds also means more learning opportunities. With your support, we can afford to take workshops including screen printing, woodblock printing, and digital animation, so that we can make cooler, more diversified educational materials. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first goal is to raise enough money to attend riso print workshops and pay for materials so that we can make a full color zine about synesthesia, the crossover of senses that allow some people to hear sights or match colors with numbers and letters. A close second is to hire an accountant so we don\u0026#8217;t screw up our taxes, but where\u0026#8217;s the fun in that? Our world - our universe - is filled with endless curiosities and surprises. Help us explore scientific topics you\u0027d like to know more about and support the synthesis of science and art as a tool for accessible education!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f330/terapauline/Thank%20you%20so%20much_zps1oxeilmm.png\" style=\"width: 288px;\"\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eChristine and Tera"
