A listener approached him and asked if he wanted to perform at a Renaissance festival.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA bit terrified of performing solo, he asked college dorm friend Andrew McKee to join him. The result was magical. The Original Celtic Renaissance duo was born!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithin a few short years, the Brobdingnagian Bards attracted Celtic music fans from around the globe. They were one of the Top 20 most-downloaded bands on the original MP3 .com. They performed at a Lord of the Rings Oscar Party for the final award-winning film. Their album, Brobdingnagian Fairy Tales, was the #1 album on CD Baby when it was released.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2008, they parted ways. It didn\u0027t take long before they started performing together again, first at DragonCon and then at other venues like Sherwood Forest Faire. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt every show, they delight their audiences with fun, engaging music and banter that win over music fans everywhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWHY PATREON? \u003c/h3\u003eFor a number of years, we have threatened to release a new album. We just haven\u2019t had time to complete one. We both have solo careers. Taking the time to record a full album for only one or two shows a year is difficult to justify. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen the bagpipes went off in our heads. Ouch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe music business is always changing. So why not change with it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLets take our time. Do it right. We\u0027ll do it through Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon offers a unique model which allows us to create new music and share it in a new way. Instead of releasing a new album, which is a bit daunting with our time constraints, we release a new single every month or two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen we share our recording and thought process behind each song.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince nearly the beginning, we recorded many of our live shows. We can share those live \"bootleg\" concerts exclusively with patrons only.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe share new and old videos of us performing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest of all, we give you an incredible and easy way to interact with us and your fellow Nagians (fans of Brobdingnagian Bards).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get all of this for just $5 per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure. You can pledge any amount. But it\u0027s all the same. There are no different tier levels. It\u0027s all just five bucks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh! And if you\u0027re wanting CDs, we will release those too. But you can enjoy the music before anyone else!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon offers an incredible service in general. We are excited about this opportunity we have to create new music, to breathe new life into the Brobdingnagian Bards, and to continue to serve the Nagians who have followed our music so faithfully for so many years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your generous support!\u003cbr\u003e"
