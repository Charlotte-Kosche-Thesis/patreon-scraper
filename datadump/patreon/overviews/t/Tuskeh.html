    "summary": "Hello there! My name is John Morris (otherwise known as Tuskeh), and I create professional \u003cem\u003eWorld of Warcraft \u003c/em\u003evideo guides. No-one creates better-presented, edited, and clearer tutorials than I. I work completely independently; from script writing to recording footage to editing everything together, I\u0027m a solo creator, and I\u0027m not sponsored or in any partnership with anyone. It\u0027s all me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been thinking a lot about what I\u0027d like to write into this box, and there are a lot of reasons I feel I could cite to try and convince you to to part with your hard-earned money; the satisfaction of directly supporting a form of content that you enjoy watching, the difficulty of running a YouTube channel that focuses on teaching folks rather than entertaining them, and the uphill battle of working for essentially nothing as I try to balance helping my viewers with getting eyes on my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Gushy Emotional Part\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of rambling about that, I\u0027ll be blunt: I need support to survive. Specifically, yours. My channel is not - and frankly, will never be - large enough to support myself and my family, and it requires full-time dedication to create the content that I release. I make the videos \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e want to see and I want to help people - I want to teach them about the joys of being a learned, experienced, optimistic gamer, and I want to help them master a game that they love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, when it comes down to it, that optimism doesn\u0027t put food on the table. It doesn\u0027t stop my family members from accruing medical bills as they get older, it doesn\u0027t pay for the medication that I and those close to me need to live productive, healthy, happy lives, and it doesn\u0027t stop the dread that one day, the people that I\u0027m leaning on to try and turn my YouTube channel into a career will be unable to support me. Those are the kinds of thoughts that run through my head every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, I hate - with every fiber of my being - not being able to support my family. I\u0027ve often thought of - and even \u003cem\u003etried to\u003c/em\u003e - step away from YouTube and find one of those \"real jobs\" that older folk sometimes tell me to get, and every time I\u0027ve been talked into continuing my course and doing what I love - teaching people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Content I Create\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs mentioned earlier, my passion is for teaching people. I love learning, and I love helping others learn. I\u0027m an optimistic person - even when surrounded by negativity - and I\u0027ll do everything I can to help you and others learn about how to play \u003cem\u003eWorld of Warcraft\u003c/em\u003e and I\u0027ll do my best to remind you what it\u0027s for: \u003cem\u003efun\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are some of the tutorials you can expect from me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClass Guides\u003c/strong\u003e - \u003cem\u003ein-depth, well-presented and edited guides for how to play your class and specialization\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRole Guides\u003c/strong\u003e - \u003cem\u003eMulti-video series regarding the intricacies of performing your role as a Tank, Healer, or Damage Dealer\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRaiding Guides \u003c/strong\u003e- \u003cem\u003eA lot of people want to raid, and there are a multitude of ways to start, improve upon, and master your time spent raiding\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTea Time with Tuskeh\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e- \u003cem\u003eA more relaxed format in which I spend time with you folks with a nice cup of tea and discuss something, be it World of Warcraft, myself, my channel, or anything else that I feel would make for a good, entertaining video!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiscussions\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- World of Warcraft\u003cem\u003e\u00a0tends to court controversy, and there\u0027s never a shortage of topics to discuss through my lens as an optimistic gamer with years of experience studying debate and the media industry\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther Guides\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- \u003cem\u003eIf I feel I could teach someone, I\u0027ll make a video about it!

I will \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0gate any of my content behind any sort of pay wall or offer advice or content to those who support me over those who do not.
