    "summary": "Hi y\u0027all,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out my Patreon page. I love what we\u0027re doing with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://therapy101.tumblr.com\"\u003eTherapy101\u003c/a\u003e, and want to continue growing to make things bigger and better!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started Therapy101 early in my grad school career. I wanted it to be a place filled with honest, accurate, and thoughtful information about psychology, mental health and therapy. I wanted it to be a community where people could learn from each other. Where I could learn and become the best psychologist I can be. I\u0027ve made such great strides to achieving all of this, in great part because of wonderful followers like you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to start using Patreon for two reasons. The first is that given what\u0027s going on politically, it\u0027s more important now that ever for people to be able to access accurate information about psychology and mental health. There are so many places to get misinformation, and so many places that promote mental health stigma. We have to counteract that with consistently evidence-based information and resources. Because of that, I want to continue do what I\u0027ve been doing with Therapy101 for a long time now- write posts, answer asks, and find good resources using science and compassion, and make all these things available to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second reason is that given where I\u0027m at in my career (I\u0027m a postdoctoral fellow), I\u0027m low on time and low on money. I need to spend my limited time making enough money to support myself. I\u0027m not certain I can keep Therapy101 going, at least at the same pace, as I have. I really want to- it\u0027s one of the best parts of my life. So, if I get monthly donations, it would make my life easier and free up time to spend on the blog, which is what I\u0027d rather do, anyway.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate all that you\u0027ve done for me and the blog so far. Your choice to follow, to interact, to send me messages, and to call me out when you disagree- that\u0027s enough for me. If you don\u0027t want to pledge, that\u0027s fine. But I hope you consider pledging if you can. Your contributions will go to supporting the blog and helping increase access to useful and evidence-based information about psychology, mental health, and therapy, for you and for thousands of other people worldwide. It\u0027ll help me keep my feet on the ground so I can provide content for you and so many others.\u00a0"
