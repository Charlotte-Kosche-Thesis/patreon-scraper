At the same time, many (all?) of us crave to live that ideal of the lone warrior, the master of our craft, alone in our excellence.\u003cbr\u003eSeeking further independence, I am attempting to turn writing into a full-time (and by that I mean, full bill-paying) job. Your patronage may help me do that - it\u0027s an experiment for me. Asking to be paid for what I\u0027ve done my entire life for free is a little strange. Yet, I know people enjoy my writing, it feeds a certain corner of their soul that needs my particular style of food, and if they could, they would have me deliver more regularly and consistently.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI know there are plenty of other writers out there to support. Maybe you yourself are a writer. Consider supporting me through Patreon as a step toward getting us all what we need. It starts with you.\u00a0",
