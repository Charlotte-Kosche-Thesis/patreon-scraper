I thought getting my name in big places like The New York Times and Scientific American would change that but unfortunately it hasn\u0027t. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write about living with schizophrenia because it\u0027s what I know and I have valuable insight into the myriad facets of the illness having experienced it since I was twenty years old. Schizophrenia is the niche I\u0027ve found for making a living as a writer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately that niche can only do so much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy contributing to this project you\u0027ll be helping me pay my rent, buy food and hopefully get off government assistance so that I can support myself as a person living with disability.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange, you\u0027ll get a fresh, never frozen essay about living with schizophrenia (or something generally psychology related) every Monday on theschizophreniablog.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means the world to me and even just a dollar an essay would be extremely appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks and hit me up if you have any questions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Mike\u003cbr\u003e"
