We guess you\u0027re here because you know about us, maybe you\u0027ve seen us, and know that we write songs inspired by books and tour bookshops. It started as an artistic songwriting collaboration with our local independent bookshop Mr Bs Emporium of Reading Delights (Bath, UK) - one of the best bookshops in the world - and almost 7 years and 13 albums down the line it has grown into a very nice little monster indeed, taken us all over the UK and Ireland, and has led to meeting and collaborating with loads of amazing authors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo, what\u0027s Patreon? If you\u0027re just showing up here for the first time....here\u0027s what\u0027s happening:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eIf you\u0027re a fan of us and want to support us writing songs in the way we do, making music videos and releasing book-inspired albums, this is the place to be. Making and selling music is a really hard thing to do, but we love it. However, despite all the press we get, the great reviews, the lovely crowds at gigs, hardly anyone actually buys music now, so it\u0027s pretty tough to keep doing it, and we REALLY want to. This site is a space for modern day true patronage - you subscribe as a patron of ours for $1, $3, $5, $10 etc.... what ever amount you like which is paid every time we create something (don\u0027t worry - you can cap it, so if we have a massive creative streak we won\u0027t fleece you ;) and that gives us budgets to invest into what we do, pay people, up our game, up our production values and pay the rent. We\u0027re just figuring this out as we go, but it\u0027s a REALLY awesome way for you guys to help us make the things we do and get them out into the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHere\u0027s our first music video,\u00a0inspired by Alice in Wonderland (Patreon budget - $80).\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UUAm-e2Pduc\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp us do more. All the videos we make will be freely available on YouTube to everyone, we really want it that way. You are the people that make it happen, that give us that kick to do it, that give us the budgets when no one else is investing in art, and we are so thankful for you all. There are a few perks we can offer- \u00a0like we\u0027ll post to you first, we can credit you, we can get you tickets to gigs and open a behind the scenes forum for you to find out what we\u0027re up to as well as have a discussion with us about what we\u0027re doing, ideas for how to do it, places to go and ways of growing this together. We\u0027re all in this. This is a huge EXPERIMENT and we\u0027re figuring it all out as we go.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you everyone. Let\u0027s do this....\u003cbr\u003eBen \u0026amp; Beth\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe Bookshop Band\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
