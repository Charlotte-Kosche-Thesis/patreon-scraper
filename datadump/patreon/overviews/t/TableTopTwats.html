    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eTabletop Twats\u003c/strong\u003e is a British RPG (pronounced arp-guh) podcast all about tabletop role-playing games. It features two kinds of main episode for your ear-enjoyment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Tabletop Twats\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Tabletop Twats we do in depth reviews of RPG products, discussion, competitions, play reports, and listener discussions and (perhaps our favourite) we cover the RPG products so weird and gross that no-one else wants to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to all of this, it features many features alongside these features, such as;\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Song Fight: where two hosts make RPG related songs and battle them to the death.\u003cbr\u003e-The chamber of Challenges: The hosts set strange challenges for oneanother.\u003cbr\u003e-Adventure Call: Yes, we know pranks calls are immature, but we do them anyway (and get dominoes pizza to roleplay).\u003cbr\u003e-The game design guys: The hosts design amazing new games right before your eye-ears.\u003cbr\u003e-Into the mind of masters: Exclusive (definitely real) behind the scenes documentary footage of the biggest companies in RPG history as they work and come up with ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Foreign Beggars Actual Play Series\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly the Tabletop Twats has an award winning cinematic actual play series \u0027The Foreign Beggars\u0027 (the award was given, by themselves).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a series of edited actual plays of DCC RPG featuring sound effects, music and has a heavy emphasis on cinematic qualities, whilst keeping our audience in mind.\u003cbr\u003eIt features two characters Grimald and Minoc; a Hobbit and a Dwarf respectively, from a mostly human city. Where they have to beg for scraps.\u003cbr\u003eThis city is under-educated, stupid about outsiders, and it\u0027s residents barely travel 20 feet outside the borders most of the time.\u003cbr\u003eEach episode is self contained, (makes attempts at humour) and shouldn\u0027t require much knowledge of the last, and what little you do need to know is explained, very quickly at the start of each.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBonus Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the time this show has been going, the hosts have been committed to giving you as much content as we can, but have also striven to release as much bonus content as possible. Some Including celebrity guests, some including actual mental breakdowns (see Starkit\u0027s prophecy).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe hosts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eName: Harrison Hunt\u003cbr\u003eLikes: Old School Dungeoneering, Maid RPG\u003cbr\u003eDislikes: Fuzion, Social interaction\u003cbr\u003eFavourite food: Curry\u003cbr\u003eBio: \u003cbr\u003eHarrison Is basically the best one, he\u0027s so powerful and the other two hosts wish they were him. For real though, Harrison edits the show, so despite his obvious shortcomings as a host, and lack of personality, he is here to stay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eName: Nikk \u0027Lambslice\u0027 Lambley\u003cbr\u003eLikes: Call of Cthulhu (or anything spooky), Fat Vape Clouds\u003cbr\u003eDislikes: Shitty Kickstarter Rewards\u003cbr\u003eFavourite food: Ham, cucumber and salad-cream sandwich\u003cbr\u003eBio:\u003cbr\u003eNikk is the hipster. Complete with beard, vape, penny farthing bike and solar-powered vinyl player made from drift-wood. However, we can overlook that, because Nikk\u0027s enthusiasm and love for the hobby are second to none. (If only his enthusiasm for shutting the fuck up once in a while were so high)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eName: James \u0027Pumpkin\u0027 Clarke\u003cbr\u003eLikes: Pathfinder, killer Genies\u003cbr\u003eDislikes: Loud eating at the gaming table\u003cbr\u003eFavourite food: Chicken\u003cbr\u003eBio:\u003cbr\u003eThe praise for James as a host since he was brought on mid-way through the show\u0027s life has been overwhelmingly positive. Which is really bloody annoying, because if you met him in real life you\u0027d understand that there\u0027s a good chance he\u0027s a criminal of some kind. James\u0027 love for food (mainly chicken) is second only to his love for role-playing games, which is why we have him on this show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we do with your donations\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYour donations do not go towards hosting fees. Nikk, very kindly, still pays those.\u003cbr\u003eInstead, what we prefer to do, is make sure every penny of the donations go toward making the actual content of the show better. This will usually be in the form of content for reviews, for example \u0027Testament: Roleplaying in the biblical era\u0027 or \u0027The book of erotic fantasy\u0027. Additionally: we will also spend the money on content for our actual plays: which are still ongoing. For example: all the adventures that have been played in the \u0027foreign beggars thus far\u0027 (and some up-coming bonus actual plays).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short: the content of this show would be nowhere near as good if it were not for your donations; and we have many many more things coming up thank you to your kind contributions. I will not spoil the surprise, however we will continue to make better and better content as you guys continue to show us your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
