    "summary": "First of all, thank you for making it this far. Maybe you have bought a ticket to one of my dance performances. Maybe you follow my photography on Instagram. Maybe you have subscribed to my weekly blog. Maybe we are meeting for the first time. To be an artist and to have anyone listen or pay attention to what I am doing is an amazing gift. I appreciate you very much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been itching like mad to do something new. To interact in a new way. To do something that feels authentic to both who I am as an artist today and to this moment in time. I love making dances and full-tilt projects with a million moving pieces, but those are things that can take years to come into life. Sometimes by the time they come to fruition, I\u0027m not the same person. I\u0027ve been steeped in the culture of traditional arts presentation for most of my life, but I have so much more to say. There are so many authentic, beautiful moments that are zipping by every day. I want to take each and every one of them, chew on them, understand them, and share them in a new way. I want to make something that is of this moment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to try this grand experiment with Patreon because it is uniquely different from the kinds of constrictions I have experienced traditionally. I am going to write, observe, take photos, make short films and art. I\u0027m going to do things I have never done before. There are thoughts and ideas that exist in just this brief, shining moment, things that I can only have the perspective to understand for a short time, and then they\u0027re gone. Patreon gives me the vehicle to work from the center of that place and not just watch them disappear. Without the deadline and restriction of a future outcome I can capture and interpret and share the process with you real-time. I don\u0027t think that art in the future is going to be consumed in museums and in traditional theaters or even look like what we conceive of today. This endeavor feels like a big step in that direction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA WORD ABOUT PATREON: If you\u0027re scratching your head about the nuts and bolts of what this actually is, then read this part. Patreon is a monthly subscription service where you can subscribe at whichever level feels good to you. You pay x amount each month and the content comes directly to you. I could have 10000 subscribers, I could have 1. Doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027ll keep making work regardless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKNOW THAT THIS WILL BE AN ADVENTURE. I am not married or committed to any particular path. If you know me, you know that my hand is in 100 different pots at a time and I want to do all of it. If you\u0027re up for that adventure, then I hope you will come along with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIT ALL BOILS DOWN TO THIS: if you like the things that I do and think more of it needs to be in the world, then Patreon is the way to make sure that happens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSO WHAT NOW?\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve started by dividing it up into three levels that I think might be interesting to three different audiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLevel 1 - THE PHILANTHROPIST - is all about process. I\u2019m going to download at least once a week about what I am working on and what I am discovering while I do it. I\u2019m going to write. I love words. I didn\u2019t really know how much until pretty recently. I always thought I was at war with them. But what I found out, is that I LOVE language. All of those years of being disconnected from my voice have created a wildfire.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLevel 2 - THE ARTIST - is all about product. You will receive access to all of the material from Level 1 plus the outcome from that process. I\u2019m going to start out focusing mainly on photography, but will expand what it can be over time as this experiment evolves. The style of photography will begin in the style I have been sharing on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/treymcintyrephoto/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy Instagram account\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLevel 3 - THE ADVENTURER - is all about having no limits. You will receive everything there is on my Patreon. Other platforms have practical limits that won\u2019t let me include nudity. There will be nudity here. And more than that I am just keeping this level open to explore and not worry about an expectation that you might not like it or be offended. I want to take risks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT THE MONEY: There are expenses involved. Location rentals, travel, time. Things that have inhibited me from going all the way with it. I came here to see if I can set up a system of support that will allow me to always say yes when inspiration strikes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT AM I GOING TO MAKE? The first project I want to tackle is a multi-media series on The Seven Deadly Sins, called \"In Defense of Sin\" that will feature a series of essays and a photo collection I shot over three days in Vancouver with Canadian dancer Lucas Wilson Bilbro. I have been thinking a lot about what these particular warnings mean and how, as a person who values the grey-ness and complexity of life, I can make sense of them. So that\u0027s the first idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIN THE END, this is an experiment. I do not know where it will end up. I\u0027m looking forward to interacting with you and hearing about what\u0027s working and what\u0027s not. What you want to see more of. What you think is interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u00a0know that there is something I can uncover through this discovery. I know that there is something that I can learn from exploration that is not confined by the limits and rules of reality. And I know that art can make us feel when we need to feel. It can make us feel joy when the world seems completely squashed. It can make us feel hope when it seems there is no more. It can make us release our pain, when seeing it opened up with fresh eyes is just the thing we need. I spoke with a friend yesterday who had been obsessed with the state of affairs in the world and was feeling the pain intensely. But her remedy had been to return to art. To re-affirm her bond with the thing that can keep getting us back to our higher selves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am committed to this process in the wholeness of my life and have to be on this path no matter what. But I hope you\u0027ll come along with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e--------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne more note about the images. Please do me the kindness of not saving or sharing the photographs I post. I want to feel confident really putting a lot into this page and intellectual property has a way of spreading far and wide. All of the images are copyrighted. Thank you so much for your help with this.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
