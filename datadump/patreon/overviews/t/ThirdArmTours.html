Visit the frozen Epsilon Eridani system. Seek out the daring fun of lava worlds, or dance the night away on dark rogue planets.

That is, words inspired by today\u0027s ongoing search for exoplanets, with a slight retro twist!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re creating monthly interstellar vignettes, travelogues, short stories, and digital greeting cards we call \"exopostcards.\" Imagine a future where stellar cruise liners visit exoplanets, or the space stations orbiting them, and the adventures and intrigue you could read about: Families on space vacations. Politicians playing games with colonies. Chefs trying out exotic concoctions between star systems. Crazy captain hijinks. And, of course, a good dose of science news blogged in between.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(151, 72, 6);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\"Adventure, intrigue, beauty, passion ...

In fact, as of July 2017, astronomers have confirmed 3,498 exoplanets orbiting both nearby and distant stars, some in the so-called \"Goldilocks zone,\" which may harbor life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, it\u0027s a new age of space exploration and, with Third Arm Tours, we offer a creative way to sift through the discoveries and imagine what it might be like one day for humankind to travel among these exotic worlds. We\u0027ll keep the tales rooted in the science as much as possible, although we\u0027ll take creative license from time to time to keep it fun. For instance, we have no viable way, yet, of reaching these stars, so you\u0027ll just have to imagine that bit along with us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the end, we want more than just to entertain. We want to awake greater understanding of our universe, to again create excitement about space exploration, like we remember when the first space shuttle launched. Surely, exoplanets will excite the world. Maybe they can even bring us all, finally, together. They\u0027re our future.
