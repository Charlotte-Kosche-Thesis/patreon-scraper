We\u0027re Tatsu and Micaela, and we are video creators based in Southern Japan.

With his snappy edits, fast transitions, and an eye for natural beauty, Tatsu has spent the majority of this year on the road. Most notably, he has produced several videos for the Japanese Travel website, \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/EywWyn\"\u003eOdigo\u003c/a\u003e\u201d, and for Fukushima Prefecture\u2019s inbound resurrection campaign, \u201c\u003ca href=\"http://www.diamondroutejapan.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDiamond Route Japan\u003c/a\u003e.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ciaela\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://imageshack.com/a/img922/2527/gUVb6r.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, \u003cstrong\u003eMicaela\u003c/strong\u003e has been producing and editing her own travel and lifestyle video blogs through\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ciaela\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e since 2006. Born and raised in Canada, Micaela first moved to Japan at the age of 17 on a high school exchange program. After finding herself deeply connected to the lifestyle on the southern island of Kyushu, Micaela spent an additional 12 years in Japan, blogging about life in Japan, and particularly, about her love for her second-home, the city of Fukuoka.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Need Your Help:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sgKPzHJkhQk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTatsu has built an incredible portfolio of travel cinematics, thanks to his time working for brands, and to his experience being a part of the highly esteemed Diamond Route Japan project. Meanwhile, Micaela has spent this year taking care of logisitics -- from relocating the home to central Fukuoka, to building presentations, and meeting with foreign and local tourism boards to get an idea of what kind of partnerships can be formed between us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we learned? Well, to put it in simple terms, \u003cstrong\u003eJapan does not currently have a significant budget for video creators\u003c/strong\u003e. While many local destinations would like more publicity and visibility in a foreign market, there is not enough budget distributed amongst these destinations to allow for them to budget for videography. As a result, many destinations ask us to travel and make these videos at our own expense. This is very different from the relationship that destinations have with content creators in foreign countries, where even smaller destinations can offer to cover logistics or even room and board in exchange for licensed visuals. \u003cstrong\u003eThis makes it very hard for us financially to explore all the places we wish to go, \u003c/strong\u003eunless we are paired with a paying sponsor or brand, who will in turn, control the direction and the tone of the content produced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTatsu has spent this year making stunning videos for paid clients, but the result is that \u003cstrong\u003ethese videos end up on smaller platforms where their visibility is minimal\u003c/strong\u003e. While many people are happy with his work, the lack of visibility feels like a waste of his talent and skill. Our hope is to work together to create videos for a broader audience--starting with the \u003cem\u003erebranding\u003c/em\u003e of Micaela\u0027s YouTube Channel which has a subscriber base of 285,000. \u003cstrong\u003eWe want to bring you the type of content that YOU want to see, not what the third-party advertisers \u003cem\u003ethink \u003c/em\u003eyou want to see.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy working together, we hope to make sure our work is seen by a larger, more receptive audience, however, without brand sponsorship, we will be paying out of pocket for transportation, hotels, rentals, experiences, food, and whatever else is necessary to make our videos. For reference, we recently travelled around Kyushu, and racked up nearly $2200 in logistics, including flights to a remote island, bullet trains, ferries, a car rental, meals, and 10 nights of room/board. These things add up, and \u003cstrong\u003ef\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003einancially, it does not make sense to go forward on our own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBut for 2018, we\u0027d like to try anyway. We value your time and attention online, and your support will help us better create the kind of stories that are worth sitting down and watching.
