It wouldn\u0027t just be a re-print of the TAPA blog, either. That\u0027d be silly. Some of it is out-dated, and there\u0027s no order to it at all, beyond what I thought would be interesting to write about on a given day.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInstead, I\u0027ll use old posts as a foundation, re-working, updating, and organizing it, as well as creating new material.

Typically, patrons pay by the item (like, for each video produced). But I blog too regularly (several times a week) for that to make sense. Instead, it\u0027s a monthly subscription.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd don\u0027t worry, the blog isn\u0027t going anywhere. I\u0027ll still be posting six to twelve times a month, and the blog archives will always be free.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBut if you do decide to sponsor TAPA, you\u0027ll get \u003ca href=\"http://www.anonymousproductionassistant.com/2013/02/20/its-about-time-or-yes-im-back/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eearly access\u003c/a\u003e to things like the joblist, as well as an early peek at the book in progress.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s all up to you.\u003cbr\u003e"
