    "summary": "Hello! My name is Tom Smith. Together with my wife Susan and our friend Myron, we bring you The Merry Jaynz, a 3-piece indie rock band from Knoxville, Tennessee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a TON of great people to thank for us getting to where we are now, musically. Particularly, those who helped us get out our last CD \"Love One Another\" (\u003ca href=\"http://themerryjaynz.com/index.php/index-phpindex-phpmusic/love-one-another-2017-album/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estream it HERE\u003c/a\u003e) showed us just how much support there is out there for us and independent artists in general. To you and all the folks who gave us a kind word at one of our shows or online, we say Thank You!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile also supporting our families, we are driven to create and produce quality Underground Swamp Rock music with a message (sometimes) or just to raise a smile and some goosebumps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, unless you\u0027ve been under a rock for a decade or so, you know that music is essentially free. You can stream, or sometimes even download just about any music you want at any time via the good ol\u0027 internet. And yet, independent musicians like us are still able to make ends meet with their music careers alone, and with their morals intact as well! How does that work, you might ask?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll tell you: Those artists aren\u0027t really selling music. They are selling a connection, a relationship, they are selling access to a glimpse of their personal lives and creative processes. The music is just the tangible product fans buy as a way to show support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I could hang out with Derek Trucks while he was practicing slide guitar, or Chris Stapleton while he was writing a song, or David Byrne while he was spray-painting a cubist rendition of Kermit the Frog defeating Napoleon at bocce, I would jump at the chance!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create that kind of access for you, but even more, my goal is to foster the kind of inter-activity with you that literally gives you input and insight into our creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe songs that are generated along the way will be on CDs eventually, of course. But you can be there every step of the way, all while helping us make the music our full-time focus and a sustainable career. As such, you\u0027ll be listed on that CD\u0027s artwork as a supporter and get early pre-release access to it as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo become one of our supporters, Patreon provides a way for you to pledge a monthly tip amount. There are several levels of rewards to choose from, but for as little as $1 a month, you are basically IN!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, no, the obsolete Music Industry does NOT get to tell you what to like or dictate who you listen to anymore!\u00a0 \u00a0If you want more of The Merry Jaynz than just our music, come on in as a Patron!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Tom\u003cbr\u003e"
