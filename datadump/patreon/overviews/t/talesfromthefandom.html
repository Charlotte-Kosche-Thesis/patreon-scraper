    "summary": "Tales from the Fandom podcast started June 6, 2016 as project for me to be able to talk fandoms with people around the world.\u00a0 As of March 5, 2018, we have released 139 episodes.\u00a0 These have ranged from our standard fandom discussions with weekly guests, to movie and show reviews, as well as convention and Kickstarter reviews. We have already recorded episodes well into July and August of 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTales from the Five Nations is an actual play podcast using the Eberron campaign setting and the Savage Worlds game system. It is the only one of its kind and we release episodes bi-weekly as of January 23, 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, there would be no podcasts without the gracious people who have given up their time to record with me for Tales from the Fandom, my players for Tales from the Five Nations, or those who listen each week.\u00a0 So thank you to everyone who has participated or listened.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy humble hope is to be able to cover the very basic costs of the podcasts as well as to be able to branch out with some other podcast projects.\u00a0 These projects would be heard here first before release.\u003cbr\u003e"
