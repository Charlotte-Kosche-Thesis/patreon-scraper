Back in 2005, I discovered my passion for creating music and online content. Since then, I\u0027ve spent my time developing my ability in doing these things, working with some smaller freelance jobs and making videos on YouTube. Though this isn\u0027t economically sustainable as the time it takes to compose even a minute of music averages at 10-12 hours, the freelance jobs are far and between, meaning I have to take on dayjobs to bring food on the table while trying to do as much as I can on the side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream would be to compose music and run my YouTube channel full-time. In details, that includes building on my music library (which is included in several Patreon tiers), stream gameplay and put up reviews and tutorials on the channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is what this Patreon is for. By supporting me, you\u0027re not only making my life less stressful, but you\u0027re also helping me produce more content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does your money go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSame place as most of mine goes; Working on the content I make for you. Each penny carries its weight in keeping me fed and the wheels spinning. Once the economy becomes sustainable, it goes towards expanding and improving the quality of my setup. Eventually, it may help covering the costs of external work to further improve my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach patreon and donation (stream donations) can also specifically request what it goes to if they have particular wishes. Or even just for a beer, who doesn\u0027t want a beer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want some of the higher tier content, the content currently available at the month of your contribution remains yours to use forever. You do not need to keep a monthly subscription, even though I really appreciate it. New content is added to the library as I keep on making it though, you only have access to new downloads through an active subscription.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me, you give me the opportunity to spend less time working a dayjob and put more focus on content creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for even being here to consider supporting me. If you do choose to, I appreciate it more than you can imagine and it really, really helps.\u003c/strong\u003e"
