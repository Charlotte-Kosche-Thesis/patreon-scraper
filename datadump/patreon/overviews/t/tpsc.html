     "about": "I am Leo, the main host at The PC Security Channel (TPSC).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main interests include gaming, technology, science and of course, security. I am curious about things, and always willing to learn. I am one of those people who never run out of enthusiasm. I still have my childhood fascination for the world and I always keep asking questions.\u003cbr\u003eI have Dinosaur figures on my desk. When I have the time, I like to contemplate the universe, matter and light, time and space. I guess I would qualify as an armchair physicist. I like talking about all sorts of issues, technical and philosophical. I like thinking about possibilities, of what can be, and how we can do it. Wonder and imagination have always been an important part of my life.\u003cbr\u003eWhen it comes to dealing with people, I hold ethics in high regard and believe in brutal honestly. I don\u0027t like making things up only to have everything break apart because of them. I try to treat everyone as fairly as I would want to be treated myself. I follow the golden rule: \"Do as you would be done by\".\u003cbr\u003eMost people who know me perceive me as an introvert. I was never a stage person. My YouTube journey, if anything, has been quite unexpected. My fascination drove me to do cool things and it made relatively mundane tasks quite entertaining, for me and I guess, for others too, but I had never imagined that I would end up as a content creator, and I have been quite pleasantly surprised. For me, work is play. I enjoy making videos, playing around with things, learning, finding things out for myself, and there is nothing better than to have so much company when doing so.\u003cbr\u003e",
