    "summary": "An award-winning writer, my work is published internationally in over 100 publications and was displayed at the Smithsonian, the London Olympics, the Poetry Foundation, and others. In over 26 years as a writer, I never shied away expressing my roots as a Lao American, even as I know our journey rebuilding our traditions after the wars of the 20th century is a complex one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy personal passion is\u00a0creating great poetry and stories for the next generation of Lao American readers, particularly science fiction, fantasy and horror, which is still largely uncharted territory for us. It takes time and funds to commission other great artists and illustrators to really bring these ideas to life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help for basically the price of a good cup of coffee or a nice dinner once a month to make this possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/e536deb7025874f0a564f44d8aff558e/tumblr_nkpzivoQuH1r821uyo1_500.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will afford me the time to create more works each month that explore the outermost limits of our possibilities and to create more awareness of the journey and imagination of the Lao people. I hope you\u0027ll see I\u0027m not asking for much to help start the great conversations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited by the tremendous support and feedback I\u0027ve received from many of you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA refugee community that doesn\u2019t have the ability to see a future for itself becomes fixated on its past and ends up aimless. We must create a body of science fiction that empowers ourselves to imagine a future we are present in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Lao life is a m\u00e9lange of displacements and encounter,navigation and negotiations. Most of my generation is a stranger to\u0027our own country. A country that after 600 years still struggles to unite over 160 diverse ethnicities as a nation in a healthy way. Since the end of our civil war in 1975, my past work has been a persistent effort to demonstrate the preservation of Lao values as we transition from a monarchy to a democracy can be compelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/b42ba679eaca6ec25bd7b57fd4b68aed/tumblr_mpvz1mzKsY1qipv9ao1_500.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve spent over 20 years creating some of the first works in the Lao community that explores our traditions and history through the lens of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. This has been important for the Lao refugees because for a long time, we had fewer than 40 books in our own words, on our own terms. But now we\u0027re turning it around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLao arts embody almost a millennia of intergenerational dialogues on peace, harmony, the pursuit of wisdom, diversity and the rejection of violence. At our best, Lao arts encourage unique voices and approaches to living as a people. With so many ethnic groups living in the borders of Laos, it was vital to embrace these many diverse stories and to see them as strengths. When we do, we can see our world not only in terms of what has been, but what it can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, there are also some gaps in our contribution to world arts and letters, particularly in genre literature. It is very difficult to find examples of a Lao Edgar Allan Poe or H.P. Lovecraft, a counterpart to Nathaniel Hawthorne or Gabriel Garcia Marquez. We do not yet have a particularly robust body of literature that responds to the works of Isaac Asimov, Octavia Butler, Anne McCaffrey, Robert E. Heinlein, Larry Hama, Arthur C. Clarke, Philip K. Dick, \u00a0Stephen King or Margaret Atwood. But I believe we would all benefit from Lao writers and artists adding to that conversation. A significant part of my work has been to encourage our writers to take these risks, and write to the limits of their imagination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you for any support you can provide \u00a0to make this happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
