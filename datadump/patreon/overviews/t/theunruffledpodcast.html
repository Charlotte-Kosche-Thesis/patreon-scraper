When an addiction is removed, there is a void that is left and this show digs into all of the ways to fill that void. The Unruffled is passionate about creating and making and how those pursuits fuel recovery, specifically from alcohol. Come with them as they unruffle the old stories and write new ones, to not just exist but thrive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have produced a year\u0027s worth of content and have approximately 132,000 downloads to date. We can hardly believe it! We would like to give you, our listeners, the opportunity to help us continue to put out quality, meaningful content but we have a big ask. We are both mothers and creative soulmates. We are multi-passionate and have many projects going at once and feel like the time is right to ask for some support. We talk a lot on our show about valuing your creative work, and it\u2019s time we walk our talk. This is where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour generous Patreon donations will help us to pay for hosting fees, better equipment and assist us in our dedication to keep showing up here every week. In the future, we hope to take our show on the road and offer creative workshops in select cities across the United States, maybe even interview a few of our guests in person. In order to make any of this happen, we foresee the need to generate some revenue from the show. We believe that our listeners want to support us, so we\u0027re hoping you can help us make these dreams become a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur ask isn\u0027t huge. We\u0027re sensible gals, you know? We\u0027re really just asking for a $1 pledge per episode download. That\u0027s $4 per month, less than a large decaf vanilla latte from Starbucks. A total steal, if you ask us. We\u0027d love to offer some perks in the future, but first we need to get this campaign off the ground. We can circle back and check in with all of you later this year to see what, if any, perks sound good to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this far and for helping us to realize our creative goals with the podcast.\u00a0We are so grateful to you, our listeners, and hope we continue to earn your support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
