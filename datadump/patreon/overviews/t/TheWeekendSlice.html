I consider Twitch to be a gaming centric version of talk radio. There is a host, there is live audience interaction and there is also commentary on the game being played.\u00a0There is an amazing exchange of energies between the chat and the streamer which is what constitutes (for me) the backbone of the concept of streaming. It just so happens that we\u0027re playing and talking about one game or another. Quite often you\u0027ll find me and my viewers engaged in awesome conversations about books, movies and all sorts of other nerdy things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tI\u0027ve already invested and worked to have as good a stream as possible by getting a dual PC stream setup, a sound interface + dynamic microphone, custom channel art, buying games as close to their release date as possible and last but definitely not least getting some games to give away to my amazing audience. But I want to do more and I want to improve on my setup as much as possible as there are plenty of other ideas and projects that I want to put into place.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe purpose of this page?
