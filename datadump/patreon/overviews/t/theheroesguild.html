But role-playing games are so much more than just wholesome entertainment, their an alternative medium for education!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlaying tabletop role-playing games provide a multitude of social, intellectual, and creative benefits such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e- Players interact with each other across the table, giving input and acting out scenes; sharing thoughtful and engaged \u003cstrong\u003ecommunication\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e- They engage in \u003cstrong\u003eempathy\u003c/strong\u003e, placing themselves in the shoes of someone other than themselves and attempt to see the world through that lens. \u003cbr\u003e- Players flex their \u003cstrong\u003eimaginations\u003c/strong\u003e while envisioning scenes, scenarios, and entire worlds! There are \u003cstrong\u003eno screens\u003c/strong\u003e in tabletop roleplaying.\u003cbr\u003e-They employ \u003cstrong\u003etheatrics\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eimprovisation\u003c/strong\u003e, and often incorporate other arts into their games such as \u003cstrong\u003eillustration\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003emusic\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003epoetry\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Though the Game Master moderates the game, the rules exist in the form of books, meaning \u003cstrong\u003eplayers are required to read\u003c/strong\u003e to better understand their character and the game itself.  \u003cstrong\u003eStudying\u003c/strong\u003e and\u003cstrong\u003e information referencing\u003c/strong\u003e are reinforced in roleplaying games. \u003cbr\u003e- Players are \u003cstrong\u003eexposed to other cultures\u003c/strong\u003e,\n histories, mythologies, and belief systems outside from their-own. Our \nworld is rich and full of culture, so is the gaming table!\u003cbr\u003e- Dice represent random chance in the game and a \u003cstrong\u003eregular engagement in simple mathematics\u003c/strong\u003e.  \u003cbr\u003e- Players must also \u003cstrong\u003emanage resources\u003c/strong\u003e of their character, \u003cstrong\u003eestablish goals and motivations\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003esolve complex tactical and social dilemmas\u003c/strong\u003e, all of which helps to \u003cstrong\u003ebuild self-confidence \u003c/strong\u003eand improve \u003cstrong\u003ecritical thinking\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e- Players get the opportunity to \u003cstrong\u003elive the myth\u003c/strong\u003e, while Game Master\u0027s get the chance to lead youth through meaningful stories packed full of lessons and morality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWhile RPG\u0027s can be can be incredibly rewarding, they come with a steep learning curve making entry into these amazing games daunting.\u00a0 That\u0027s what \u003cstrong\u003eThe Heroes\u0027 Guild\u003c/strong\u003e is here to fix.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last year, we\u0027ve introduced over 100 kids in the Nashville area to RPGs by volunteering at local community centers.
