    "summary": "\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eHi guys. I\u0027m Jon Williams, also known as \"Turbo Button\", and I make video essays on games like every other schmuck on YouTube. I\u0027ve covered a variety of topics, including \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZCZh5cb6s\"\u003ewhy Credo is such a brilliant boss fight in Devil May Cry 4\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gyw_Z1Ol6Gk\"\u003ea structural comparison of Super Metroid and Metroid Prime\u003c/a\u003e, and a video on \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBnxbHndCw8\"\u003eone of Nintendo\u0027s most underrated designers\u003c/a\u003e. In addition, I also periodically make videos focused entirely on level design, I highly recommend checking out the video I did on the latest \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5wIIwBL784\"\u003eDonkey Kong Country\u003c/a\u003e, as it\u0027s my personal favourite. I try to tackle all sorts of subjects, from story to pure game design, however I can only do so much with limited money and time on my hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy be a patron? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eVideo games are unfortunately quite expensive. Patreon really helps a \nlot with allowing me to buy games to talk about and analyse without my \nwallet dying on me. In particular this will help fund much larger videos\n such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2vCko6V4pQ\"\u003eAnimation in Action Games\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxRxh8Ka5H8\"\u003eDefining Depth\u003c/a\u003e\n which require researching many different games often found on different\n systems that I might not own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately, thanks to Patreon money I\u0027ve been able to make a video examining \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWAU6TDGYG4\"\u003eSet Pieces\u003c/a\u003e in games, as such an endeavour involved buying a Playstation 4 as well as some games I did not previously own. More recently it has allowed me to make an extensive, in-depth take-down of \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSGSj-evneo\"\u003ecover mechanics in third person shooters\u003c/a\u003e. It has also allowed me to make the jump from Sony Movie Studio to Adobe Premiere as well as commission the logo that you can see both on my Patreon page and as an animated intro in all of my newer episodes. This has really helped me up the professionalism and overall quality of my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, it\u0027s up to you, this page is just here for those who\u0027d like to put a little money towards helping me make more of these videos, so don\u0027t feel guilty if you can\u0027t afford to pledge or simply don\u0027t want to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does being a patron involve? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re up for it, you can pledge from $1 every time I upload a video. You can choose to pay more if you want, as some kindly do, but don\u0027t feel as if you have to, every little bit helps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set this thing up for \"per creation\" payments seeing as I rarely make videos more than once a month anyway, so if real life circumstances arose and I got no content out one month then I wouldn\u0027t be just taking money from you guys. You can also set your own limit for how many creations per month you pay for, just in case I suddenly release a bunch of videos in one month, so you won\u0027t be paying for every one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get for it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eThis is a little tricky, because I don\u0027t want to withhold content, but at the same time I want to thank everyone who donates anything at all. As such, for any donation you\u0027ll receive an additional write-up vaguely related to the topic at hand. \u003cstrong\u003eNote: this is not \"on-Patreon DLC\" that should be in the video. \u003c/strong\u003eI try to make my videos as concise but packed as possible, with as much relevant information as I can. As such, anything that goes into \"Additional Thoughts\" will just be excess, perhaps elaborating my thoughts on a game\u0027s story or its music, whatever. Level Design videos may come with a write-up of me just briefly mentioning other levels I like. I feel like this is important to mention as I promised myself I\u0027d never willingly withhold meaningful content behind a paywall. On top of that, it\u0027s just impractical, doing this analysis takes a lot of time both to research and properly clarify, there\u0027s not much point going through all that effort to have it reach a much smaller audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe $3 reward is pretty self-explanatory, you\u0027ll get to see new episodes 24 hours before they appear to the public. This one is a bit more substantial, but again it takes nothing away from the actual video for those who aren\u0027t Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, the $5 reward gets your name in the credits at the end slate of all of my subsequent videos for however long you pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t feel obliged to pay a huge amount or even anything at all, but of course I appreciate it so much if you decide to. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
