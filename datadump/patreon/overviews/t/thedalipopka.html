    "summary": "Hey everyone, my name is Jay aka \"The Dali Popka\" and like many of those in the world of the internet, I make and enjoy making videos about gaming! My first and most passionate project is \"Viridian Flashback\", a review/collector\u0027s guide for the original Xbox (you know,that paperweight that plays Halo!), although I have started to branch out into other things, this show is my first priority. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe big question you might have is \"Why should I give you moneydollars for this, what\u0027s in it for me?\" I can assure you that for me, this is more than a little hobby. Creating videos, whether they be just game reviews, or something bigger down the road, is a passion of mine and while my content is and will always be free to view, it can be a little costly to obtain things needed to keep it going (better lighting, new camera,etc.). But with a little boost, it would help out immensely.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know for a lot of big Youtube/Twitch guys who are Patreon users, they can offer you big perks for big bucks, sadly i\u0027m not that big. But, even just a buck, helps me out greatly, because I wouldn\u0027t be able to do any of this without the support of the viewers. Whether you donate or not, I\u0027m incredibly grateful and want to give the best i can. Also, if you support me, you\u0027ll be supporting other great content creators who haven\u0027t gotten a fair shake in the game as I would like to help out with this small community and give to them as well.\u003cbr\u003e"
