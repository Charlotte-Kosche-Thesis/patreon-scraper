    "summary": "Hi there! I\u2019m Kathryn Tarko. I started playing the cello at the age of three with famed Boston Suzuki teacher, Nancy Hair. I followed my long time music camp teacher, Dr. Ashley Sidon, to Drake University to pursue a degree in cello performance. While at Drake I won the Fort Dodge Young Artist Competition playing my favorite concerto by Shostakovich, and was a member of the Des Moines Symphony, Waterloo Cedar Falls Symphony, and Orchestra Iowa. After graduating Magna Cum Laude in 2013, I moved to Chicago to study with Chicago Symphony cellist and teacher, Richard Hirschl. I graduated from the Chicago College of Performing Arts Magna Cum Laude in the spring of 2015 with a masters in Cello Performance.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\nI am currently continuing my studies with Richard Hirschl in order to prepare for upcoming orchestra auditions, while providing solo cello and string chamber concerts to the public of Chicago. My greatest joy is sharing my passion for classical music with the public, and helping this incredible art form continue to grow and thrive in our ever changing world. This however, is not an easy task. I am working to perfect my art and ability in order to work full time, as well as provide music free to the public. My favorite thing to do is to play in a Symphony Orchestra, and it is a dream for me to do this full time, and help the symphony to evolve and reach more people as society grows and change. Help is greatly needed! Monthly costs, in addition to living costs, include monthly cello adjustments, weekly lessons, as well as supplies such as strings, rosin and music. Recitals are a great financial cost and include the rental of the recital hall, recording and live streaming services, and piano accompaniment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI would not be able to have gotten this far without the support of family and friends, and I am setting up a system for friends and fans to continue to support my goal of working full time, and sharing my passion for classical music to the public in new and innovative ways. This not only helps me share my process and work with supporters, but also keeps me accountable as I work towards these goals. Through Patreon I hope to achieve new goals, and be able to share my journey with friends and fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon Goals and Rewards\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eReach 100 - covers the cost of monthly cello adjustments. I will send out a personal thank you note and signed copy of my Russian Rebels recital flyer (a personal favorite).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nReach 280 - covers the cost of a lesson with my professor once a month. I will send out a personalized cd of my latest recital.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nReach 460 - covers the costs of two lessons with my professor a month. I will send out a cd set of my favorite cello repertoire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nReach 820 - covers the costs of taking weekly lessons. Monthly personal development and cello costs are now completely covered! You have made it possible for me to work towards my goal of becoming full time indefinitely! As a huge thank you I will work with each supporter to send out a cd of classical music personalized to each supporters tastes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nReach 1000 - covers all of the above, in addition to recital costs for seasonal recitals. I can now not only continue my development, but also provide recitals to the public free of charge each season. I can not thank you enough, you are making my dream come true! Each supporter will get a personalized music history lesson (one hour long) on a topic of their choice. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy People Support Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I love hanging out with Kathryn when she plays at cons, it\u0027s always so free and informal, it\u0027s friends enjoying each other\u0027s company and exploring music without making it a formal affair. It\u0027s raw and honest, and I can really appreciate that.\u00a0I like her music because it feels honest, and she pursues her passion.\" -Philip Hartzell, ADN\u003cbr\u003e"
