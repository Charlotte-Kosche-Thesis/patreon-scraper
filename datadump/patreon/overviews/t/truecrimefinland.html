This podcast covers both legendary and forgotten Finnish crimes and criminals straight from the land of a thousand lakes. I hope to bring you the best podcast I possibly can. If you made it this far, it means you might be enjoying the podcast - thank you so much for listening! The listeners and all the support is what keeps me going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge will help to cover the costs of making this podcast. That means for example hosting and analytics costs, equipment and research material. Any amount is highly appreciated, and you should not feel pressured to donate! If you do decide to, thank you so much! In return, I will offer you some rewards like extra content and merchandise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you interested in Finnish culture and customs beyond this podcast? Do you want to know more about Finland and Finnish people? If so, you have come to the right place! Every tier will receive access to bonus episodes that will cover various aspects of Finland, including culture and traditions. There will also be crime minisodes (that are not long enough for the normal feed), blooper minisodes and AMAs. On the higher tiers, you can receive either a True Crime Finland shirt or a mug and a hand-drawn card from me! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S., if you do not like Patreon, you can also set up a recurring payment on PayPal - send me an email or contact me on social media so we will get it set up. It is also possible to make a one time donation, but please contact me so I can get you your reward (depending on the amount you donate).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKiitos and thank you for all your support!\u003cbr\u003eMinna"
