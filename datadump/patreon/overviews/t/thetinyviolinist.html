He has been playing violin for as long as he can remember. His great grandfather from Germany cherished violin playing, and inspired his twin daughters with his playing. Jonathans Grandmother and twin sister Barbara Unruh were some of the earliest violin players of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. Jonathans Uncle, Dwight Anderson, currently teaches cello professionally, and plays regularly with the most accomplished symphony orchestras in the Dallas area. Jonathan spent time studying and playing at the Pan-American University of Texas at the age of 14. He has traveled extensively in Mexico and Guatemala working with his family to create Symphonies of Hope, a major christian volunteer orchestra training effort in Central and South America. He works together with his father, Chris Anderson, orchestrating and arranging music for volunteer orchestras, as well as for his own violin performances. \u003cbr\u003eJonathan has always enjoyed inspiring young players, and takes great satisfaction from their success. With this in mind he has most recently created The Tiny Violinist. He is currently preparing various hymn and cinematic theme arrangements to present on The Tiny Violinist channel, and is preparing for a performance tour in 2017-2018. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=554667\u0026amp;rid=922044\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fgua1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/30713109_877055982495834_7358799678584651675_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0\u0026amp;oh=b982838cb9216b1b1e95b7b686c5b313\u0026amp;oe=5B279063\" style=\"width: 273px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePledge $3 or more per Music Video.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u00a0Thank you so much, your generosity is sincerely appreciated!!

Jonathans Grandmother and twin sister Barbara\nUnruh were some of the earliest violin players of the Milwaukee Symphony\nOrchestra.  Jonathans Uncle, Dwight\nAnderson, currently teaches cello professionally, and plays regularly with the most\naccomplished symphony orchestras in the Dallas area.  Jonathan spent time studying and playing at\nthe Pan-American University of Texas at the age of 14.  He has traveled extensively in Mexico and\nGuatemala working with his family to create Symphonies of Hope, a major\nvolunteer orchestra training effort in Central and South America.  He works together with his father, Chris\nAnderson, orchestrating and arranging music for volunteer orchestras, as well\nas for his own violin performances.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\nJonathan has always enjoyed inspiring young\nplayers, and takes great satisfaction from their success.  With this in mind he has most recently\ncreated The Tiny Violinist.  He is currently\npreparing various hymn and cinematic theme arrangements to present on The Tiny\nViolinist channel, and is preparing for a performance tour in 2017-2018. \u003cbr\u003e",
