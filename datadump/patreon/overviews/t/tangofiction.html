    "summary": "Hello, my name is \u003cstrong\u003eTango \u003c/strong\u003eand I am a writer that wants to tell engrossing and erotic tales of fiction.  I have been passionate about writing since I was a child and I have always been an avid reader and lover of a variety of genres like Sci-Fi and Fantasy.  Currently I am attempting to complete an interactive fiction story called \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eTransfigure\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e that is about Taylor Roux, an unfortunate university student that inexplicably switches gender and has to unravel the conspiracy of his transformation while adjusting to his new life as a woman (while dealing with situations and participating in sexy antics along the way.)  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to tell a large, incredibly ambitious story that is both familiar to fans of the genre but that also takes the story arcs to new and interesting places - all while being woefully erotic and concluding in a satisfying manner while catering to many tastes.  This project started small but quickly took on a life of its own and became very large and complicated, requiring 100s of pages of notes and flowcharts along with a big story board and several checklists\u2026 and to top it all Transfigure was the first game I have made on twine, so I have had to learn a lot on the way.  When this is complete I am certain it will be one of the best written stories on websites such as tfgamessite.  If I ever get the time and money to make unique graphics (or partner with someone else) I am sure it can be one of the best erotic games ever.  Yet with such ambition comes a price: mainly a large one in time.  I want to share with people and finish my projects ASAP but I am limited in the hours I can put aside...and this project seems to suck them away like a time vortex.  Before I knew it I had written nearly 200 pages but that was only part of the battle.\u00a0 Editing it all to a passable level and putting all the pieces together takes way longer than I thought.  I wanted to make something good and have it decently polished and that took even more time.  It quickly became apparent why so many ambitious projects fail and so many of these games languish at low levels completion: it is hard work.  I just kept pouring my love into the story and it gobbled it up.  I hope it shows and people enjoy themselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please feel free to join me and help make this as awesome as it should be.  Thanks for your time and consideration.  I intend to finish this project no matter what but throwing a couple bucks my way and getting access to some neat stuff along with some some influence in polls will really speed us on our way and help you shape the story\u2019s evolution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent public and Patreon: Transfigure .4780085 updated 20/05/2018 for patrons, 26/05/2018 for the public @\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tfgamessite.com/index.php?module=viewgame\u0026amp;id=1609\"\u003eTfgamessite\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore about \u003cstrong\u003eTransfigure\u003c/strong\u003e: It is an adult game currently written in Twine (plays in modern browsers) focusing on the male to female transformation of its main character.  The story caters to a variety of subjects and tastes.  The entire game is fairly large and has many planned and partially written endings, with routes ranging from romantic and frisky, to downright hedonistic debauchery and submission.  Transfigure has about fifty envisioned endings but finishing the current core story is priority. Some content and themes include FF, MF, involuntary M2F transformation, blackmail, corruption, best friends, variety of standard erotic fair (hj, bj etc) etc Plus a whole bunch more planned down the line as I complete the early portions of the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome upfront warnings: This is an adult game.  There is humiliation and drug use in some routes.  Taylor Roux also has a notorious potty mouth, so if that fucking bothers you, steer clear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI pledge to my patrons that I will try and be as upfront and transparent as possible in both development and the patreon scheme.  My income will be public (I find it weird so many hide this number from the very patrons that support them).\u00a0 My goal is to have at least one decent sized update per month and have a public release version that is one update behind but I reserve to the right to release public versions early/after a brief exclusive period if I feel I am slow on updating. Every buck will make this a better game, but monthly pledges add up so be aware of what you are doing. You probably won\u2019t miss $5 but it will help me immensely and improve Transfigure in the process.  As a hobby writer, even a very small amount of money and encouragement is a huge motivator.\u00a0 I want to tell great stories and I want to do it for you.  So please join me and become a patron.  Either way, thanks for your interest!\u00a0 That you made it this far shows you care.\u00a0 Have a great day \u0026lt;3 Tango\u003cbr\u003e"
