Despite my lack of experience in the art world, I will give it my all to make sure what I do is not only good for everyone, but for myself as well. Along side of art and school, I have a crippling addiction. An addiction that can never be cured. It\u0027s called... a Gaming Addiction.\u003cbr\u003eBut in all seriousness, I do love to game and draw, like most teenagers, even if I do so with awkward pride! So, I hope to get to know y\u0027all a lot more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main ambition and goal in life is to make people smile, a simple goal that I will do until the day I die.\u00a0",
