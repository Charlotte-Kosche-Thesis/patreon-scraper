    "summary": "As most of us know, amplifier power ratings are all over the board. \u00a0Some amp manufacturers rate their products extremely high, slap huge numbers on the amp and box to basically trick unsuspecting buyers into purchasing their amplifier over another that may be priced equally, but has a lower rating on the box because they don\u0027t feel the need to lie to their customers. On the other hand there are many companies out there that drastically under rate their amplifiers. \u00a0Some will, or are at least rumored to produce much higher output than advertised. \u00a0Wouldn\u0027t it be nice to know what they are really capable of?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEven a pledge of $1 goes a long way! \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWith the help of your contribution, I will be able to continue to improve the Amp Lab and my equipment to handle larger amplifiers, and get more accurate information on each one I test.\u003cbr\u003eI will continue to produce test videos either way, but your pledge will help offset the cost it takes to produce each one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 My Youtube channel does not just include amplifier test videos. \u00a0Sometimes I will release a video that is not a true test. \u00a0It may be a preview video for an upcoming test, me just messing around in the shop, or something totally unrelated to amplifiers or car audio all together. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThese videos will not be counted as a \"released video\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and you will \u003cstrong\u003eNOT be charged\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0Your Pledge will not count towards\u00a0\u00a0these videos. \u00a0Only actual \"AMP TEST\" videos will count as a pledged video.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Welcome to my Patreon page.\u00a0 My name is Troy Dionne and I run a small amplifier repair and testing shop out of my house.\u00a0 I have been in the mobile electronics business since I was a teenager with my first car, but started working as a full time installer at a local shop in 2005, in which I currently still work full time.\u00a0 In late 2013 I decided to start a side hobby repairing car audio amplifiers.\u00a0 That quickly sparked the interest to start doing real world testing of the amplfiers I was working on.\u00a0 I was tired of companies putting huge power numbers on the front of their\u00a0products to lure in un-educated customers with no way to accurately dispute the claims.\u00a0 So I built my own electronically controlled, non-reactive dummy load bank, and with the aid of a few other components such as D\u0027Amore Engineering\u0027s AMM-1 to accurately measure TRUE RMS Wattage (not Volt-Amps which conventional clamp testing measure), as well a DD-1 to measure distortion ratings, I am able to put these claims to the test and try to educate buyers what they are really getting for their money.",
