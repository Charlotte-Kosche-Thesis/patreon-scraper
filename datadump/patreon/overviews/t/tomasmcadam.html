    "summary": "Hello! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Tomas McAdam and I\u0027m a model maker, sculptor, painter and all round creative person. I have a serious passion for sculpting, painting, games, animation and making things in general. I tend to make mainly creatures, monsters, mutants and other weird and creepy stuff like that, but making is making to me, so really, anything goes! I\u0027m inspired by the depths of my mind, my fears and phobias, as well as video games, films and other artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a child I remember feeling alive with a lump of clay in my hands, but as I got older I was distracted by other arts, such as music, design, writing, photography and film. I enjoyed all of them, but I never felt that same affinity that I felt when moulding a lump of clay into a life form.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently making commissioned pieces and generally sculpting and painting as much as I possibly can to improve my skills and build my portfolio. At the moment I\u0027m making mainly 6th scale maquettes, 6th scale head sculpts and painting miniatures for board games such as Blood Rage and Games Workshop. I\u0027m also teaching myself digital sculpture, using Zbrush and Blender. I don\u0027t enjoy this as much as traditional sculpting, but it\u0027s becoming more and more essential in the industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share my journey and the skills I learn. I get so much joy out of creating, I want to encourage everyone to take that step and begin making things of their own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat to expect from me:\u003c/h4\u003eI\u0027m always making something, whether it\u0027s a private commission, a large project for a film or game, or just something for myself. I\u0027m trying to show as much as possible via Patreon, but it\u0027s going to take me some time to get everything set up. Ideally in the future I want to give my Patrons as much as possible, including freebies and giveaways, but for now I can only do so much, so please be patient.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBi-Monthly Prize Draws (Once I hit 20 Patrons)\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- Once every 2 months I will offer free prize draws. This will increase to monthly once I have more Patrons. The prizes will vary depending on what I\u0027m currently working on. All my Patrons will receive a free entry to the prize draw, the higher the tier the more entries you will get. The prize draws are exclusive to my Patrons. The value of the prizes I cannot say, but it will be something cool I promise!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProducts -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eI currently have 3 main product areas that I\u0027m working on, some are free and some are for sale, and I will be adding more as I go.
