    "summary": "Our sanctuary started privately in 2012, when we rescued 2 draft horses, Tonka and Levi, from shipping to slaughter. Neither one was sound for riding or working. They were both dumped by their previous owners and deemed useless. After bonding with them and watching them flourish under our care, I knew that this was only the beginning of our journey. Since then, we have rescued over 30 \"unadoptable\" horses from being slaughtered and given them a safe place to live out the rest of their lives, no matter how long or short that may be. \u003cbr\u003eA lot of people wonder why we take in horses who are only pasture sound and who may not have much time left on this Earth. You see, these horses spend their entire lives serving people until they can no longer perform. Then they are tossed away, broken not only physically, but often times mentally and emotionally as well. When they come here, its our way of giving them their life back. They get vet and farrier care, good food, treats and a whole lot of love for as long as they are comfortable. It doesnt matter if they are only here for a week or 5 years. This might be the only time in their whole lives where they actually get to enjoy it and THAT is worth every penny. Every tear. Every single time.\u003cbr\u003eAlong our journey, we have also rescued many farm animals from neglect, abuse and slaughter. Once afraid of humans, they now live here, peacefully, knowing only love and kindness. We give them a new life and the freedom they deserve and we strive to show people how incredible they truly are.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to help spread compassion and educate others about a cruelty free lifestyle. Our dreams of expanding in the future and saving more lives will only be possible with your help. I cannot thank you all enough for your support over the last few years. YOU help us make all of this possible!"
