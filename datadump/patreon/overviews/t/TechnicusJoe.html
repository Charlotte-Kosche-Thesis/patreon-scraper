With enough support, I will have the oppotunity to share this exploration of the world of forging with you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEventually, I hope to develop this towards an international scale, where I can also visit other fellow smiths and share their passion with you and do collaborations.\u00a0"

It\u0027s a puzzle and an interesting challenge to work out artifacts without drilling, welding (electrically), shaping by grinding or other methods that don\u0027t displace the material.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recognize there are also many people who are interested in this craft and would also love to learn the technical aspects of it, or simply for relaxation and enjoyment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to create videos and take you on a journey into the world of forging. In this world we can visit many places such as: techniques, problem solving, various styles, material studies, observations and more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI believe that all information about this craft, that is blacksmithing, should be widely available for everyone who is interested! \u00a0",
