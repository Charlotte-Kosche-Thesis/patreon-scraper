    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eWe are the spirit of heaven, birthed to this world, freed from our own corpses by the twin flame journey. We are burnt to ash by the fire, but re-birthed by our faith, resplendent like the phoenix, to rise again and light up the world with all we have become\u003c/em\u003e. - Samantha Lucas\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI met my the man I thought my twin flame in March of 2012. It was the most romantic, overwhelmingly passionate encounter I\u0027d ever had. In him I saw everything I\u0027d looked for all my life, and he said he saw the same in me. We shared a connection the likes of which I never truly thought existed. We awakened one another to deeper levels of consciousness and spirituality...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen he met someone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy story isn\u0027t all that different from anyone else who\u0027s been through this, but where I\u0027ve ended up is quite different from where most seem to. I am in a place of strength and happiness. I\u0027ve found complete healing for this experience. I\u0027ve taken the gifts and the awakening and I\u0027m using that to create the life I\u0027m meant to live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel for those of you seeking some sense of power, normality, your own strength back, I dare say, for those seeking \u003cem\u003erecovery\u003c/em\u003e from the twin flame experience. Where do you go once this experience has ripped you open and left you in the ash?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in you. And I \u003cem\u003eknow \u003c/em\u003ethis relationship will not end you,but in truth, rebirth you into who you are meant to be. More, years on the other side of this relationship, there is another chapter, another man, another connection. I\u0027m on that journey now and share that journey as I seek answers and home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know the depth and the pain of this journey, but I know the heights to which you can soar on the other side. I will provide you with as much of my own\n story as I can along with all that I\u0027ve learned, all that I\u0027ve \nbecome, and all that is happening now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNamaste and many blessings dear kindred twin flames. - Samantha"
