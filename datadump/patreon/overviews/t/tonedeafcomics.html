And Patreon is the way for that to happen.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon allows you, my loyal readers, to become a patron of Tone Deaf Comics, by making a monthly donation of your choice. Patrons of the comic will get access to the comic before anybody else sees it, as well as free PDFs of the comics, and other fun stuff. Think of it as a way to not only say thanks but to also support the comic at the same time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Tone Deaf Comics?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTone Deaf Comics is a comic about, and for, anyone who has ever been in band. I have been creating it since January 2010. It follows Ed Harmon, a band director, and Thom Talbott, the assistant band director, and their struggles with the band and each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am able to create Tone Deaf Comics one time a week because of a select few people buying my merchandise, and because of a full time job where I work \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e of hours. However, I want to create more Tone Deaf Comics for you guys. Five comics per week has been my goal from the start. Five comics will allow more thorough storylines and will allow us to get to know the characters a lot better. Such as, did you know that Ed has a baby boy? Or, why does Principal Palumbo hate the arts so much? Or, does Thom still have a crush on Alma, the choir director? Why \u003cem\u003ehaven\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e we seen more of the choir director? All of these stories, and more, can be told with a five comic a week update schedule.\u003cbr\u003e"
