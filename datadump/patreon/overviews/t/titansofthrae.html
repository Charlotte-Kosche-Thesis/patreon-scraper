This covers a decent amount of time time required to produce a good-quality, clean piece of artwork or illustration of up to medium-high complexity. Environments may have perspective techniques applied to enhance the depth of a piece. Background/secondary subjects included in the price, for those full-scene/environment requests.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdvanced Colourwork $25\u003c/strong\u003e: Commissions in full colour cost extra, however this extra includes various shading/shaders including experimental (but optional) uses of digital painting where appropriate.

These tend to require a lot more effort than singular commissions however I can negotiate you an appropriate price to the workload. You will have to discuss the terms and conditions if you want a comic drawn up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy best estimate is that \u003cstrong\u003ea comic will be more expensive than an individual commission, but much cheaper than buying many individual commissions of the same quality.\u003c/strong\u003e This offer cannot be circumvented to allow multiple unrelated commissions at discounted pricing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSimple Mode Discounts\u003c/strong\u003e: If your request is simple to draw or easy to produce, a discount may be applied to a piece to reflect this. If you\u0027re not bothered about shading or colouring everything, a \nflat-colour across the page can be applied instead, helping make things \nstand out without going too crazy with the shaders.\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor base commissions, a maximum discount of $7 off\u003c/strong\u003e can be applied depending on how simple the subject matter is, or if it\u0027s an icon or other low-complexity piece. Stuff like no backgrounds or artistic licensing can help towards simple mode discounts.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor Colourwork commissions, a maximum discount of $12 off\u003c/strong\u003e can be applied where tons of colour isn\u0027t required, you just want things to stand out on a page instead.
