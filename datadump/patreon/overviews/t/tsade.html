    "summary": "Ever since I was in my late teens, I\u0027ve loved to write about sex and violence. It wasn\u0027t just one facet, but every thing from epic hate sex, drunken fucking, and even the blood-smeared loving of two warriors who finally worked out their issues with swords and guns. There is something about those two intense aspects of humanity that appeals to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been developing a number of worlds since the early eighties: Nine Sisters is my anime-inspired fantasy world, Shadowed Earth is my version of paranormal reality, for sci-fi I have Web of Stars, and a smattering of others that appealed to some fetish or the other. I have developed these worlds through role-playing games, stories, and novels. Nine Sisters is my primary one and the one I love most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp to this point, my writing has been supported by commissions and my two novels, \u003cem\u003eThe Mummy\u0027s Girl\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eEliza and the Raptor\u003c/em\u003e. The commissions are the hardest since I write novellas every few months but most of them remain private, never to be posted. I\u0027d like to come back to my worlds and write more stories and novels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create epic stories like \u003cem\u003eOmelas\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003ePuppy Mill\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eDerik\u0027s Luck\u003c/em\u003e. To do that, I\u0027d like the help and encouragement of subscribers. \u00a0For those who know my full body of work, I\u0027m not planning on writing the darkest themes, but I\u0027m willing to graze the surface of those depths.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon is set up per submission. I\u0027m considering a submission to be 10-15k words worth of stories which may be multiple chapters of a serial or a short story. Some months there may be more than once, so if that bothers you, consider using the maximum per month.\u003cbr\u003e"
