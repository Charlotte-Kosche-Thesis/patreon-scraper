Our platform: Youtube. Our location: Tokyo, Japan. The aim is to bridge the gap between west and east, becoming the access point for constructive conversation on street culture from an international perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we\u0027ll do with your support\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe plan is simple yet arduous. With your support we build. Build bigger and better. Better equipment, better content, and better access. The commitments gathered on Patreon will go directly toward making The Casual a place not only where you can receive info on the latest in street fashion from Japan and around the world, but ultimately a place where you gain physical access to it through our ambitious end-game outlined by the following benchmarks:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 First we\u0027ll upgrade our equipment and create a more streamlined internal experience allowing for faster and better content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Second, we\u0027ll procure partnerships with creatives and businesses here in Japan to gain even deeper access to more in depth analysis with that content. This often requires monetary obligations and we plan to fulfill them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Third, and most important, The Casual aims to create an online marketplace that frequently stocks the collections and brands that we feature on the show. The aim; to create an entirely new market experience that gives you access to what Japan has to offer without the incredibly unfair price mark-ups. But it doesn\u0027t stop there. We\u0027re going all out with plans to develop apps and services that create additional avenues to procure what you want from Japan so no stone is left unturned.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmbitious?

We can make this happen, and you can be a part of building something special. Something that can change the entire scope of street fashion because dreaming big is what we do and we would love to share that dream with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus you\u0027ll get some pretty swanky benefits in the future if you do;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, KEEP IT CASUAL.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/thecasualco\"\u003eSUB TO THE CASUAL HERE+\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
