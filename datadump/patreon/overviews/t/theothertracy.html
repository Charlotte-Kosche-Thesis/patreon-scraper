    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eA World From the Inside, Out\u003c/h2\u003e\nSo many tabletop RPGs give the advice of \"start small\" when it comes to building your own setting material. So that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m going to do here. This Patreon is dedicated to building an entire campaign setting, starting with one person and expanding from there until the world is a fully fleshed-out creation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePowered by Fate\u2122\u003c/h2\u003e\nOne of the core concepts of the Fate\u2122 RPG (by Evil Hat Productions) is that anything in a setting can be expressed in the same way as a character: Aspects, Skills or Approaches, and Conditions or Stunts. This Fractal Setting is going to be created with that in mind. From the starting person, to their house, their street, their neighborhood, city, kingdom, and world, everything will be build using the \u003cstrong\u003eFate Fractal\u003c/strong\u003e. This means usable game material no matter which level you choose to zoom in on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFocus on Collaboration\u003c/h2\u003eAll of the development of the elements of this setting will be done out in the open: Twitter, Twitch, Google Drive, etc. I\u0027ll be conducting polls for inspiration and writing character threads based on follower feedback (#FractalWorlds), and infrequently streaming writing sessions on Twitch where I\u0027ll get feedback from anyone who drops by the chat.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow Does This Work?\u003c/h2\u003eThe entry level is $2 per paid post. A paid post will have a detailed chunk of setting content They will be initially presented in bare-bones form, with simple headers and formatting. As we proceed, each will be edited by Megan Knouff, and will get more extensive layout using Adobe InDesign.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also going to do my best to create useful images for the published posts. I\u0027ll use openly licensed art and pictures, and continue to teach myself to do more in Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. It won\u0027t be the best-ever, but it\u0027ll always be the best I have to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m choosing to do this through Patreon for a few reasons:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eI believe creators should be paid for their work, and I include myself in that. It\u0027s my job here to make sure the content I create is worth your time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI want to have a project I can jump to in the middle of whatever else I\u0027m working on. It\u0027s a great mental break for me to work in this system and to work on this world.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI love collaboration, and bouncing ideas around in public is one of my favorite ways to work. In many ways, it doesn\u0027t feel like work to me, which might be what\u0027s best about it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThank you!\u003c/h2\u003e\nI love this idea, and I\u0027m hopeful that other people will as well. Your support helps me maintain an additional revenue stream, getting me one step closer to being able to make tabletop games full-time. Thank you, so much."
