I\u0027m an ambitious artist with hopes and dreams to accomplish so much more in the realm of art and science and so much more for the world that I simply cannot do it all alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u0027ve always been fascinated with words and stories, writing and dreaming- they kept me going in my lowest of times, they keep me alive through the roughest. Imagining and creating have always been essential to my survival; whether it were in times of distress or times of great happiness- writing and storytelling have proven to be the guiding forces that helped me persevere through it\u0027s expressiveness and therapeutic value . While mostly keeping these personal works to myself, I knew that my duty for this world was to get my stories out to readers. So it really is about time I shared my work online and try to foster in the moving community of diverse and friendly individuals I always said I would establish. I\u0027ve always thought that sharing work on the internet would lead to a more interesting and complex creations over time thanks to community input and suggestions. Patreon provides a practically perfect platform that allows for creators to get their work out there as working artists while also fostering close creator-fan relationships.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really hope the Kingdom of Sparklot can draw in some interesting people who want to do something worthwhile \u00a0for the world. This webpage will be a hub-world to epic science-fiction and fantasy adventures and also a space where people and fans can come together. As we embark on this journey alongside one another, I hope that we can maintain a welcoming and open-minded atmosphere where anyone can be appreciated and accepted. Though topics may be tense and controversial at times, I hope my work can highlight the importance of contemplating and discussing \u0027nightmares\u0027 and just about anything in order to cleanse the mind so we all can have \u0027sweeter dreams.\u0027 Let us express our feelings and be artistic, share our opinions and find commonalities. My destiny has always been to entertain and enlighten through real conversation and imaginative storytelling, so look forward to a lot more stories and features in the future as this page and myself really lift off the ground.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u0027m ambitious and wish that I could create something new everyday. Technology, time and money being the limiting factors- the imaginative process is ongoing, my ideal artist rhythm is not yet playing. My promise to you and to myself is that I will always develop and grow each and every day. I aim to keep this page active with 3-5 planned posts each and every week- be it an excerpt from my story, poem or a picture, I yearn to maintain or exceed that steady flow of content indefinitely unless otherwise communicated. I want to work closely with others who have a constant stream of work to read, so writing and storytelling will continue to be my number one priority. I hope to find a really engaged audience here and meet some truly fascinating people. I can\u0027t wait to share much of what I\u0027ve kept away for far too long.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI welcome you to the Kingdom of Sparklot and thank you for any support and kind words that may have.
