When we started out on this podcasting journey, all we had in mind was connecting with like-minded fans from across the globe. Suffice it to say, we have connected with a bunch of AMAZING people and couldn\u0027t be more grateful to have such a supportive and interactive group of listeners, and friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve devised a program that allows the people that are most invested in our podcast to get a little extra for their hard-earned dollars, while spurring us along as we endeavour to create even more. Pledges received will go directly towards covering web hosting fees, and prizes for our Powerful Friendz. As we gain more Powerful Friendz, we\u0027ll be able to upgrade equipment, and make the prizes even sweeter. We all win!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what are you going to get for your generous support? Powerful Friends will get exclusive access to Sith Disturbers, our R-rated babble-fest of Star Wars and other random musings. You\u0027ll also be invited to have a more direct say on what we talk about on Sith Disturbers, so the show will become even more custom-tuned to what you want us to talk about! You\u0027ll also get early access to Journals of the Whilling, and Worthy of Recognition. At our $5 tier, you\u0027ll also be invited to guest host Saber Rattling to promote your projects, and you\u0027ll get early access to that podcast. You\u0027ll also get some swag at this level. What\u0027s not to love?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re excited for this next phase of our podcasting journey, and we hope you\u0027ll be a part of it by becoming a Powerful Friend!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur sincere thanks \u0026amp; gratitude!\u003cbr\u003e Kyle \u0026amp; the TumblingSaber Team\u003cbr\u003e"
