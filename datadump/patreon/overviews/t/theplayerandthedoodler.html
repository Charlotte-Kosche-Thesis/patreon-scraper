    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIf YOU\u0027VE enjoyed watching the Player and the Doodler, support our Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisit our website at \u003ca href=\"https://theplayerandthedoodler.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etheplayerandthedoodler.com\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: So what is this Patreon all about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Player (Jeff Parkes) and the Doodler (Johnathan Whiting) is a duo\n that produces Let\u2019s Play videos with (hopefully) humorous and \n(occasionally) informative commentary, but with a twist! While the \nPlayer is playing a game, the Doodler is drawing things based on it, and\n at the end we post both the gameplay videos and the doodles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: So are these doodles just drawings of screens from the game or something?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: Some of them are, but sometimes they\u2019re based on jokes that pop up\n during the stream, or scenes inspired by the game without being \ndirectly lifted from it. They run the gamut!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What kind of games do you guys cover? Endless \u003cem\u003eMinecraft\u003c/em\u003e videos, like most other Let\u2019s Players?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: Bah! We scoff at \u003cem\u003eMinecraft\u003c/em\u003e! (Well, not really, but it\u2019s \nnot our scene.) Potentially we could cover any game, though our main \nfocus has been on games published before the mid-90\u2019s, particularly from\n Sierra Online\u2019s adventure game series such as \u003cem\u003eKing\u2019s Quest\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eQuest for Glory\u003c/em\u003e.\n We also open many of our streams with a short playthrough of a \nmultiplayer Atari 800 game that most people under 33 (and many over) \nhave never heard of (including the Doodler; the Player grew up with an \nAtari 800XL), and have done a smattering of Nintendo games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What, so they\u2019re, like, videos of games that are decades-old that nobody knows? Why would I want to watch those?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: They\u2019re fun! We grew up with a lot of these, but even the ones \nthat have no nostalgia filter are still fun to play (and make fun of). \nThe Atari videos, in particular, end up being pretty madcap and fun to \nwatch, as half of the fun is figuring out just what\u2019s going on back when\n graphics and good game design were in their infancy. Besides, they\u2019re \nunique! You can see thousands of people online streaming \u003cem\u003eFallout 4\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eLeague of Legends\u003c/em\u003e or whatever, but how many videos have you seen with people playing \u003cem\u003eWizard of Wor\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eBallblazer\u003c/em\u003e? I\u2019d reckon not a whole lot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Are you ever going to do some modern games?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: We\u2019ve started doing some, like \u003cem\u003eDokapon Kingdom\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eKing\u2019s Quest\u003c/em\u003e (2015). Beyond that, possibly, some day, if we find the right game. We tried doing some more modern games like \u003cem\u003eMass Effect 2\u003c/em\u003e\n during our first stream, but found that we didn\u2019t have nearly as much \nfun or inspiration with them as we did with the older games, so we \ndidn\u2019t save the footage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What is your update schedule?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: A new video goes up every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday on our \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPwumTtbHaUlhIV3fqrbkVg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYoutube channel\u003c/a\u003e and also here, with a new entry into our long-running \u003cem\u003eDokapon Kingdom\u003c/em\u003e series posting on Saturday. At the\n end of a series, a compilation post of all the videos will appear on our website, with a companion post showcasing the doodles made for that\n game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What will you be posting here on the Patreon page?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA: Currently we\u0027re only hosting Patreon-exclusive content on this \npage, mostly because importing our archives would be a massive \nundertaking (and somewhat redundant, since everything\u0027s already posted \non our own website as well as Youtube, tumblr, Pinterest, etc.), so if \nyou want to see our publicly available stuff, visit one of those sites.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eThe schedule for Patreon-only stuff will be a little more sporadic, though the monthly caption contest will happen, well, monthly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What about your livestreams? Can I get in on some of that sweet action?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: You betcha! We stream on \u003ca href=\"http://twitch.tv/mister_kerr\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etwitch.tv\u003c/a\u003e, and we love to have an active \nchat. We interact a lot with our chatters, so the more the merrier!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What\u2019s the schedule for those?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: That\u2019s a bit trickier, as we have to squeeze those in around our \never-changing real-life schedules. Lately our average has been about two\n livestreams per month. They normally get announced on our \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theplayerandthedoodler\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e\n as well as here on Patreon a few days in advance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Who wrote your little theme ditty? It sounds pretty good!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: That would be the Player, who is also a musician. You can check out some other stuff he\u2019s done on \u003ca href=\"https://parkesmusic.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehis music blog\u003c/a\u003e and his \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/jeff-parkes-160457444\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSoundcloud page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Where can I find more artwork by that Doodler guy?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: Several places! You can find a lot of his work on his \u003ca href=\"http://mrreese-mysteries.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edeviantart page\u003c/a\u003e, his \u003ca href=\"http://johnathanwhiting.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003egeneral art blog\u003c/a\u003e, or his \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mrreesemonsters/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFacebook page\u003c/a\u003e. You can also buy his book \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/ABC-Monsters-AAAAAAHH-Z-Zither/dp/1491249838\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eABC Monsters: The A Is For AAAAAAHH!!!

Contact the Doodler using the links above or \u003ca href=\"mailto:epicofeternity@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehis email\u003c/a\u003e and he can let you know what the availability and pricing is (normally about $20 including shipping).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: So why are you running a Patreon account? What are you going to do with my money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eA: With your money we will buy a giant inflatable bouncy castle and stream from in there! (Not actually.) We\u0027re mostly looking for a bit of compensation, as recording and editing all these videos takes some time, and the equipment ain\u0027t cheap! If we get some funds we\u0027ll be able to put together more videos of what you want to see, in terms of games we play and other videos we do (compilation videos, extra Patreon-exclusive content, etc.) and also upgrade our equipment when we can. This will also cover some travel expenses, as the two of us don\u0027t live near each other anymore. This is just a hobby for us, but every bit helps!\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the best way to really support us is to spread the \nword! Pledge your support and spread the links, so that we can grow our audience, and soon \ndozens, nay, hundreds of people will be loving Gray Chang as much as we \ndo!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: OK, you keep mentioning this Gray Chang fellow; who is he?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: Gray Chang was a game developer in the early 1980\u2019s. We happened to notice his name in the credits for both \u003cem\u003eClaim Jumper\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eDog Daze\u003c/em\u003e along with a big spiel including his P.O. Box in \u003cem\u003eDog Daze Deluxe\u003c/em\u003e,\n so we looked him up online and found a picture of him with a giant \ncardboard pinhole camera the size of his torso. Since then he\u2019s become a\n bit of a running gag, especially in our Atari videos. He seems like a \nnice guy, though the only comment he had for our videos was that we cut off the score on the screen. You can visit \u003ca href=\"http://ataridogdaze.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehis website\u003c/a\u003e if you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why do people keep mentioning square castles?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: In our first stream (\u003cem\u003eKing\u2019s Quest I\u003c/em\u003e), the Doodler saw \nCastle Daventry and remarked that he really liked the design. \nUnfortunately, it was a view of the castle from far away and was little \nmore than a rectangle with bumps on it:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://theplayerandthedoodler.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/castle.jpg?w=652\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe chatters kept making fun of him for it as he tried to defend his position. He\u2019s never been able to live it down since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What about that troll drawing of Valanice that keeps \npopping up? That weird song about Gavroche? The squeaky Patrick Stewart \nmouse voice? \u201cBut sometimes when you walk in\u2026\u201d? Hot pixel action? \u201cAll \nthe knowledge in the universe!\u201d? Yawn I. Tor Fred? Limericks? What does \nthe 1992 USA Men\u2019s Olympic Basketball Team have to do with \u003cem\u003eChrono Trigger\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: Look, I\u2019m not going to explain all of our running gags here. \nSomeday we may get popular enough to earn a tvtropes page, and then you \ncan look them all up. In fact, somebody get on that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Are you guys racist?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA: No, we\u2019re just terrible with accents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(The preceding is taken mostly from the \u003ca href=\"https://theplayerandthedoodler.com/f-a-q/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFAQ section of our website\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e"
