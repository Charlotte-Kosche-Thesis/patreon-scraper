I have a \u003ca href=\"http://trollitc.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e dedicated to games played between at least two people on a table. Multiple authors cover lots of stuff, from RPGs to board and card games. Through that website I also publish a bi-weekly podcast called \u003ca href=\"http://trollitc.com/category/indie-talks-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIndie Talks\u003c/a\u003e. There, I talk with other creators, publishers and the occasional actor or movie maker about games, crowd funding, the creative process and what they consider to be the prime gaming snack.

I\u0027ve had some fantastic guests on in the past and plan on having more fantastic guests on in the future - but the cost of equipment to be able to produce more reliably and create better sounding content is a barrier. I\u0027d love to be able to do this without seeking advertising and sponsorship for the podcast.

I drifted through Europe with a group of ex-pats doing odd jobs and eventually we pooled together and bought a chicken farm. After making a significant amount of Euros from the sale of eggs I migrated back to the east coast of the USA where I invested all of my savings into a kite manufacturer. In my spare time I enjoy lobbing eggs at kites. Currently I work with a whole host of brilliant people who do horrible things to their computers and then turn to me with a pleading look on their faces.",
