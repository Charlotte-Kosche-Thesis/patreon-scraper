Where we live, the Institutional Jewish Community favours reactionary right-wing perspectives, in tacit support of white supremacy and settler colonialism. We created TREYF with the hopes that it could offer a viable alternative to these politics, and highlight the work being done by leftist Jews putting these ideas into practice.

And as TREYF has grown, so have the opportunities to travel and talk with more people about the ideas that we engage with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we look to the future of TREYF, we\u2019re asking for ongoing financial support so we can cover our basic costs, expand the topics and issues we cover, and improve the quality of the show while sticking to a consistent release schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe possibilities for this radio show are pretty vast, and we have a lot of dreams that we\u2019re aspiring toward. These include: finding and airing more archival footage, speaking with elders (more intergenerational dialogue!), engaging with the historical \u0026amp; current role of Jewish communities in North America as settlers, travelling to cover events, working with others to build a new Radical Jewish Media Network, and producing narrative nonfiction in the style of our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/treyfpodcast/war-on-christmas-2016\"\u003eWar On Christmas\u003c/a\u003e episode!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere will the money go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTier One\u003c/strong\u003e - basic costs: $100/month\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWebsite and Soundcloud page ($200/year)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGraphic design \u0026amp; website maintenance ($500/year)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMicrophones and other equipment (one-time purchase)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTier Two\u003c/strong\u003e - moving the show forward: $225/month\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccessing and digitizing archives ($450/year)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdvertising in Jewish Media Outlets ($1000/year)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTier Three\u003c/strong\u003e - expanding the show: $500+/month\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA travel budget ($2,000/year)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA Solidarity Fund for Rad Jewish Radio makers (sky\u2019s the limit!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho We Are\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavid\u003c/strong\u003e : I\u2019m a white genderqueer weirdo, currently living as a settler in occupied Tio\u2019tia:ke (Montreal).
