    "summary": "Hey everybody! My name is Travis McCollum, but on YouTube I go by TJMac.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my channel back in May of 2014 as an outlet to share my thoughts on video games without editorial mandates or other people telling me what to write or how to score games. You see, I\u0027ve worked as a journalist now for close to seven years, working in everything from film to comic books to even video games, but I wanted something that was wholly and completely my own, hence my channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel focuses mainly on three types of videos:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Really Geeky Reviews:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are the bread and butter of my channel. This is where I\u0027ll take any game that was recently released (regardless of platform) and give my two cents on the game in 5-8 minutes. Actions speak louder than words, so I\u0027ll leave you with an example:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVDzYcsrAKI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Sarcastic Game Trailers:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSarcastic Game Trailers is essentially my poor attempt at parodying an upcoming or already released game in the most flippant, sarcastic and sometimes eerily dark way that I can. I usually do these videos once or twice a month depending on my schedule, but I have a blast with them, even if sometimes people think otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ldynRkwIR0g\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAni-Game:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis one of my original programs in which I review an anime that has had a game released based on the show. The opposite could work as well, but generally speaking that\u0027s what the show is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iH5AlIN-MGw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing that I\u0027ve always strove for in my content is to be as honest as possible while giving every single game a chance. Whether I\u0027m overly positive or overly negative, or even if I say something you don\u0027t agree with, I stand by every single video I\u0027ve written and believe wholeheartedly in what I say. That\u0027s why I\u0027m going to be honest with you now: I created this account for the sole purpose of giving back. Whether it\u0027s $1 or $20, every dollar donated will go to help my channel and make it better and better with every coming month. This is not for me, but for you and I want to make sure I can give you the best possible content each and every time I upload a video. I want you to proud of the content I make and I want you to enjoy yourself every time you watch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking time to look at my Patreon page and I wish you nothing but the best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-TJ"
