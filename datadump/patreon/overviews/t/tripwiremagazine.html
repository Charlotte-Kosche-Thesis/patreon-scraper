    "summary": "Tripwire has been covering the world of comics, film and TV since it was started back in 1992. As a magazine, we would spotlight creators and titles that no one else would. It was Tripwire who brought the ground-breaking work published by DC\u2019s mature imprint Vertigo to the attention of a wider audience. We were among the first publications to highlight writers and artists such as Grant Morrison, Peter Milligan, Frank Quitely, Mike Mignola and many more. We place an emphasis on quality journalism and irreverent interviews, reviews and features.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComics and genre have increased in cultural significance and impact since we first started publishing. We have the expertise and the knowledge to provide coverage that is accessible, intelligent, well-written and accurate. We apply the same professional principles to the website that we have always applied to Tripwire, whether we are putting content on paper, on the web or in an app. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Tripwire has that many other websites do not is our history. In 2016 we celebrate our 24th anniversary and so we are able to look to our history to represent content that many people who now visit the site have never read before. But we have no intention of resting on our laurels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn under a year, Tripwire has increased its audience on the web by around 4000% and we are very proud that we are continuing in our tradition to bring the best and most interesting content from the world of comics, film, TV and genre However to bring things up to the next level and offer even more original content like the Guillermo del Toro interview and the studio visits we have been putting up, we continue to need your help. Even a little contribution each month would be a huge help to us, so we can make Tripwire better and better until it becomes the best website devoted to comics, genre and related media out there.\u003cbr\u003e"
