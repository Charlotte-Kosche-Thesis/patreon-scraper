     "about": "The Real DMT is a conscious emcee determined to bring the old soul back into Hip Hop.\u003cbr\u003e\nDMT\u0027s childhood was characterized by change. Born in \nVirginia in April, he and his family have lived in a variety of \nlocations along the Atlantic coast. His parents divorced when he was 3, \nand he has lived with his mother and brother ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDMT had a very rebellious childhood. Mostly \nunsupervised, he was comfortable getting into trouble; spending lots of \nhis time in the principal\u0027s office. When he wasn\u0027t getting into trouble \nin school, he was causing mischief out of school.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDMT and his family moved to Virginia for a year when \nhe was 11, where he hung out with a much older crowd and continued to \npush the envelope. The trouble came to a head when he was expelled from \nschool for carrying a knife in response to a threat on his life. He was \nescorted out of school in handcuffs. It was deemed that the grass wasn\u0027t\n always greener on the other side and DMT, his mother and brother moved \nback to New York when he was 12 years old.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDMT\u0027s trouble spree was far from over.\u003cbr\u003e\nHe got expelled from Middle School in 8th grade and \ncontinued to get into trouble with the law. His parents didn\u0027t know what\n to do with him, so they found what they thought to be an answer to \ntheir prayers. \"The Program\" promised to turn problem children into \nwell-behaved productive members of society. DMT was sent to the island \nof Jamaica for 7 months.\u003cbr\u003e\nUnbeknownst to his parents, conditions there were \ninhumane, and the facility was shut down for child torture in 2009. DMT \nleft long before that, being transferred to another facility in Utah \nwhere he \"graduated\" and was sent home at 15 years old.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nDMT had been writing rhymes recreationally since he \nwas 12. By the time he was 16 they were starting to sound professional \nand he began to record his first songs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPaying for studio time was proving expensive, and DMT \nknew that he needed time to develop his talents. He began purchasing \nequipment for his own recording studio, spending a lot of time learning \nhow to get a good sound through trial and error. His first \"studio\" was \nset up in his bedroom, where he would typically have 7 people crammed \ninto, all writing rhymes to rudimentary original instrumentals. He then \nbuilt a studio in his garage, which he owned and operated for 6 years. \nHe later built another studio in the apartment behind their garage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMuch of DMT\u0027s story is untold, and although it cannot \nbe summarized in the about section of his website, it will be revealed \nover time through music and media from the mind of DMT.",
