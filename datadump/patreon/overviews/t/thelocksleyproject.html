Where you will find meaningful film creations focusing on positive stories of exploration, reeducation and advocacy for small businesses, entrepreneurs, and creative community members.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I would also like to express my gratitude to all you viewers who find my use of time to be valuable for your community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eA little about me.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e I spent the better part of the last 18 years traveling the world and being an entrepreneur.\u00a0 I\u0027ve had the privilege of visiting over 25 countries. Figured my way to live on multiple continents and experienced some amazing cultures - many of which began before a new culture absorbed the social media and selfies craze that consumes a growing number of our communities today. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m what millions now call a Multipotentialite. This tedtalk will explain what that means.\u003ca href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling?utm_campaign=social\u0026amp;utm_medium=referral\u0026amp;utm_source=facebook.com\u0026amp;utm_content=talk\u0026amp;utm_term=social-science\"\u003ehttps://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0In short I\u0027m a person who channels experiences from a variety of ventures and converts unrelateable lessons into practical solutions for my current project. I\u0027ve worked in all kinds of industries..from a ski instructor in Colorado, to giving off road jeep tours in the Alaskan National Forests. From a fire spotter in the ship yards of Scotland to a professional athlete in New Zealand. I\u0027ve served on Community Boards and started successful businesses. And, even have been a featured guest on Esquire TV Best Bars in America. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, A few years ago, my life changed from it\u0027s once nomadic adventure, to a life focused on community building. In the midst, making short films had turned into a creative outlet for me. I was humbled to learn how my\u00a0 films were impacting the communities around me. And just like that The Locksley Project was conceptualized and is what it is today, a conglomeration of videos that feature awesome people doing awesome things in their community. The future looks bright!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat type of content will you find here at Locksley?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eLocksley is currently working on an ongoing video series which features individuals and organizations who are creating sustainable communities.

These people are in many ways are teachers and in the heart of this project you will find that I am just as much a student as anyone. My bloggin is really my report. An extraction of what I learned from my experience. With a background in Philosophy, Education, and a ton of Health Care, my publishing\u0027s dive into the nitty gritty of life and you can expect about a 5-10min read in each completed piece. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhat do I hope you get out of becoming a Patron?\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eHowever you choose to grow within The Locksley Project, I want everyone to feel that they are receiving something of value.\u00a0 Perhaps you\u0027re stuck on how to be more conscious about where your food is sourced?
