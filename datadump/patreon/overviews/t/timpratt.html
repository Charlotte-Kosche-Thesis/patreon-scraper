    "summary": "I want to send you a new story every month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI typically write about love, monsters, secret societies, romance, trickster gods, terrible decisions, punching, metaphysics, nostalgia, entropy, magical anthropophagous cars, bridges to implausible realities, libraries, demonic thrift shops, cryptids, and breakfast foods, among other subjects. Most of my stories involve magic, or science, or science that could be mistaken for magic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m pretty good at this stuff. I won a Hugo Award for one of my stories a while back, and my short work has been \nnominated for World Fantasy, Nebula, Sturgeon, and Stoker Awards, too. My stories \nhave appeared in the \u003cem\u003eBest American Short Stories\u003c/em\u003e (I know, fancy), the \n\u003cem\u003eYear\u0027s Best Fantasy\u003c/em\u003e,\u003cem\u003e The Year\u0027s Best Fantasy and Horror\u003c/em\u003e, the \u003cem\u003eMammoth \nBook of Best New Horror\u003c/em\u003e \u2013 you get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am mostly a novelist these days.\u00a0I write and edit for a \nliving now, and writing novels makes more sense financially. I have all the usual \nbills and expenses, including a child who expects to be fed multiple \ntimes \u003cem\u003eevery day\u003c/em\u003e .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut short fiction is my first love, and the kind of writing I do \nbest. (True facts time: I\u0027m a decent novelist, but at my best, I\u0027m a \u003cem\u003egreat\u003c/em\u003e short fiction writer.) I want to write more stories, if I can do it without going broke. I just need a reason.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo: help me do more of what I do best. Supporters will get to read a previously unpublished story by me every month\u00a0\u2013 usually science fiction, fantasy, \nhorror, or otherwise weird. The more support I get, the more time I can \ndevote to writing these, which will lead to longer stories (or clutches \nof short ones). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I want to focus on the writing, I\u0027m keeping most of the rewards fairly story-centric, though if you support at higher levels I\u0027ll send goodies like \nillustrated chapbooks (I love doing those) and offer access to occasional other content (novel excerpts/sneak peeks, horror movie reviews, poetry, and so on).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of the stories will be exclusive to this Patreon, and you\u0027ll always get to see everything first. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.timpratt.org/?page_id=10\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIf you want to sample my work, there are free stories here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(People particularly seem to like \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/07/impossible-dreams/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eImpossible Dreams\u003c/a\u003e\", \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/cup-and-table/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eCup and Table\u003c/a\u003e\", and \"\u003ca href=\"http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/winter_2009/fiction_her_voice_in_a_bottle_by_tim_pratt\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHer Voice in a Bottle\u003c/a\u003e\")\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you say?
