But that show was nowhere to be found.\u00a0 \"There\u0027s a conversation that\u0027s missing here,\" I thought, \"How come no one is having it?\"\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I decided to start it myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe concept for the show is simple.\u00a0 Every month, I record a single conversation with a songwriter that I admire.\u00a0 That conversation is buttressed with a thumbnail biography, spoken essays, and relevant poetry to put their work into context.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, I set up the interviews by just texting the guest and gauging their interest- no publicists, no managers, no go-betweens.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always intended TWS for two distinct audiences.\u00a0 First, the show is for passionate music listeners who want insight into their favorite writer\u0027s life and craft.\u00a0 Second, it\u0027s for the community of songwriters ourselves; a water-cooler that we can gather around once a month and hear the story of one of our fellow writers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you dig TWS and a modest monthly subscription is a pinch you won\u0027t feel, thank you for considering supporting the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Joe\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarch 2018\u003cbr\u003e"
