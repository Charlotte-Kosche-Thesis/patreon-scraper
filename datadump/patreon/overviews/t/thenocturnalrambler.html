    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been running\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thenocturnalrambler.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Nocturnal Rambler\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, a modest blog that I use to publish my reviews and thoughts on the video games that I play, for nearly seven years. I\u0027ve always put my articles out there for free, but they\u0027re not exactly free to produce. Let\u0027s be real: games cost a lot of money, especially if you\u0027re buying new releases, and it\u0027s even more expensive upgrading your hardware so that you can continue playing newer games. Besides the financial cost, writing these reviews also takes a lot of time and energy. With my reviews typically ranging anywhere from 5,000 to 25,000 words in total length, they\u0027re usually longer than most college research papers and take just as much time and effort (if not more) to produce. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a hobby that I enjoy, I\u0027m going to be spending the money anyway, and I also get a good deal of satisfaction out of writing reviews, so I\u0027m happy to continue everything at my expense. That does limit me, however, in terms of what games I\u0027m capable of playing as well as how much time I can dedicate to playing games and posting reviews. As my audience has grown I\u0027ve gotten a lot of requests to review certain games that I just haven\u0027t been able to accommodate because I couldn\u0027t justify spending the money on a brand new game or buying an entirely new console. I also have a limited amount of free time, and simply don\u0027t want to cut into my other hobbies and interests any more than I already am without good incentive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way for everyone to get more out of my work. For those of you who show your appreciation on Patreon, I\u0027ll be posting extra articles keeping you more up to date on what I\u0027m playing and what I\u0027m writing, while also sharing more frequent thoughts, observations, and impressions on the games I play. In other words, you\u0027ll get extra, exclusive content between reviews. For me, the benefit is obvious: I get paid for the work I do, which allows me to buy newer games and accept fan requests more frequently. The money that you put into Patreon will go directly into my review output; the more patronage I receive, the more I\u0027ll be able to review. With enough support and interest I\u0027ll even look into expanding my repertoire to include video content like live streams, let\u0027s plays, and video reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t have the funds or simply don\u0027t want to contribute, you don\u0027t have to; my reviews have always been free to read, and they will continue to be posted over on the blog for free. What I post on Patreon will not replace anything I would normally post on the blog; it\u0027s all supplemental material meant to fill in some of the gaps between reviews and other major posts. I don\u0027t intend for Patreon posts to be anything major; it\u0027s just a way to satisfy anyone who desires more of my insights while waiting for reviews, and a way to both thank and reward those of you who decide to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all of that being said, I want to give a special thanks to all of my readers; the appreciation you\u0027ve already shown in comments and emails has been encouraging, and has been a primary reason I\u0027ve continued writing reviews these last seven years. Without you all, I probably wouldn\u0027t even be in this position in the first place, to be considering trying to make reviewing video games a main priority in life. If you\u0027re here and reading this, then I hope you\u0027ll consider becoming a Patron, because I feel like this can be a good thing for everyone involved. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again,\u003cbr\u003eNick\u003cbr\u003e"
