We are The PBJs! \"I\u0027m Nalani!\" \"And I\u0027m Jason!\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s answer some who, what, where, when, and why questions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are we?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are an independent, diy, pop-folk, singer/songwriter, silly duo of best friends who love to make music, talk about food, be introspective from time to time, and eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. We came together a couple of years ago to start making music as a side project, but it soon became our purpose to \"spread\" our music to the masses. Get it? Spread? Sorry, our humor can be a bit dry. Like bread...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this all about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, we are both independent musicians, who do our best to stay musically busy and continue to better ourselves and our work. However, sometimes we do not have the ability to work as hard on the music as we\u0027d like to, limiting our creations, while keeping our bellies full, our pets alive, and our homes warm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere are you guys from?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m glad you asked! We\u0027re both from small towns in Southeast Iowa, connected by train tracks, and highways, and farmland. Because of this project, we\u0027ve had an amazing chance to see a bit of the United States through our music, and our reaching for new places is ever expanding.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? (And when?)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you may well know, musicians in the past often were not able to live without patrons. The act of creating music, composing symphonies or hymns, were funded by the support of those who wanted to hear them. Much of this act of patronage still holds true today for many organizations and creators. The internet has allowed small town artists like us to create and share with the world. And we want to continue creating and sharing what we can with not only our close friends, but our world friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, you\u0027re allowing us to take more time for the music, creating songs that might not have seen the light of day, or even left our brains. \u00a0The gifts we receive from you may go towards new equipment, repairs, or just time to sit and allow the process to come through for the particular piece of music. In return, you receive those creations, and other works of art, or knick knacks, or whatever might fall from our faces (probably not our noses, though. We like to smell things).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSeriously?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe do what we love, no matter the cost. We\u0027ve been creating, and will continue to create. Music is intrinsic for us. Patreon is a solution to helping us live and allowing us to create more for us and for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1 - 2 items (song, or video, or both) per month is our initial goal. If we can, we will provide more content. Of course, Patreon is super cool and allows you to make the choice of how much to give, \u00a0capping your gift at a certain amount so you don\u0027t pay past your budget, and you may cancel anytime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we first started the band, we were putting out 5 song EPs every 3 months (or 1.67 songs a month). Since the release of our first album in June 2014, we have slowed to no new songs released. That doesn\u0027t mean we haven\u0027t been writing and critiquing and re-writing. We just want to continue to do what we love. And sometimes, life can get in the way. Patreon has inspired us and will allow us to contribute more to the world, musically.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
