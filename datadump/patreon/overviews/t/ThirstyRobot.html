    "summary": "Thank you so much for coming to my little corner of the web, no matter how you found your way here. I know everyone and their hamster has a Patreon at this point, so I appreciate you giving me your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Cooper Bibaud, and\u003cstrong\u003e I\u2019m making video games \u003c/strong\u003eunder the indie label,\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eThirsty Robot.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy first game is called \u003cstrong\u003eBilly Saves the World. \u003c/strong\u003eI believe it is a unique blend of genres that somehow feels very familiar, yet strangely one-of-a-kind \u2014 wrapped up in a super silly sci-fi love story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt has the spirit of a classic point-and-click adventure game like \u003cem\u003eMonkey Island,\u003c/em\u003e even though you never point, and never click. Instead, you\u2019ll explore a beautiful 2D open-world. It\u2019s sort of a Metroidvania kinda thing, without exactly being a\u003cem\u003e\u00a0Metroidvania kind of thing.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eTalk like Telltale through conversations that change the story based on what you choose. Changes may be as small as hearing a different joke, or as big as ending up in a completely different area than someone else playing the game.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is all accomplished with what I think are simple controls that will have you feeling like your favorite retro platform hero.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eBSTW\u003c/em\u003e was designed to allow you to craft your gameplay experience. If you prefer traditional, challenging \"levels\" \u2014 you\u2019ll find those. If you prefer to progress by solving puzzles \u2014 you\u2019ll find that. Maybe you enjoy taking things slower, for a more casual explorative experience \u2014 we\u2019ve got you covered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to play this game, but want to play it \u003cem\u003esooner\u003c/em\u003e, then please consider donating \u003cstrong\u003e$1 a month\u003c/strong\u003e which will give me the time to do exactly that. With enough support, I could work one less day serving tables, and one more day serving \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e by finishing this game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u2019t have a buck to spare but like the game? Join me anyway! You can still be involved in a crucial way by commenting on posts and telling me what you like (and what you don\u2019t), and sharing this page with other people who might like it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ll be here regardless making this little game, so I hope to see you around in any way you see fit. For more details on how my Patreon works, please see my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/5072868\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/a\u003e!
