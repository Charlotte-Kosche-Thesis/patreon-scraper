    "summary": "Hello Everyone! I\u2019m Matt, and together with my wife, Amie and our dog, Jaeger we have created The Traveling Together Journal, an ongoing video series that follows us on our travels. We want to show people what it\u0027s like to long-term overland. Hopefully we will inspire some people along the way and give you some information that will help you plan and enjoy your own journey.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe are reaching out to patrons to help us produce more content and better content for your viewing pleasure. We\u0027ve left our home in Hawaii to drive from California to Panama down the Pan-American Highway and document the experience to share with you all. We have budgeted and saved for the past three years to fund this trip and are thrilled to be doing it. With your help as a patron we will be able to slow down, get connected more often, and make even more awesome videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, we produce an episode every other week and occasionally some auxiliary content like gear reviews, how to\u0027s, and interviews with other overlanders. Our Patron page is set up as a contribution to each episode. We do not charge our patrons for the auxiliary\u00a0content. So most months you will only be charged for 2 episodes. There is also an option to cap your monthly contribution if you are concerned we might go on a video making spree.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stoping by and joining the expedition support team.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eP.S. If you\u0027re still not sure what Patreon is, you can watch this flashy video they made that explains it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/rwvUjAv6pxg\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/rwvUjAv6pxg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

We are saving up money as quickly as we can to get back out on the road before our stockpile of footage runs out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we reach this goal we will be able to immediately get back out there to capture more footage, and the really exciting part is that we can do it full time, indefinitely. We will be able to invest in new and better gear for recording, editing, and uploading more awesome videos. Plus, we can replace and upgrade equipment as it inevitable wears out and breaks in this line of work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt would be so amazing to continue pursuing our goals as full time YouTube creators and to bring you all with us... around the world!",
