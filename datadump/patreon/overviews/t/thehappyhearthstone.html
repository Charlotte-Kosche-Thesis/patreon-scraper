With myself as the only main host, members of our community come on to cohost each episode. Which means a ton of variety and fun as we talk about wacky decks, deep strategy, and... well, anything the cohost wants to talk about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re here on Patreon to not only give fans more access and options for how to grow the show but also to allow you a direct way to support and make the show better. With every dollar you pledge, you\u0027re first covering costs that it already takes for me to create the show in its current form. But after that, it gets really exciting. :) You\u0027ll then be creating more margin for me to expand and grow the show, and that means more guests, more content, and more fun for all of us. I\u0027m really excited about some of these goals and hope they make supporting the show even better for you!"
