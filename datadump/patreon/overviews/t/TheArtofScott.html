    "summary": "Hello, and thank you for visiting my Patreon Page. My name is Scott Zambelli. I am a freelance illustrator and storyboard artist who started as a professional artist back in the early 90\u0027s when I began working for a local animation company creating animations for TV commercials. Over the years, I have created licensed art for many well known brands such as Star Wars, Transformers, Red Sonja, and many others. In addition to my illustration work I also self publish my own Bible-Based comic book series titled, \"Immanuel: God with Us\", as well as create storyboards for the advertising industry. I can also be found as a regular guest at numerous comic cons around the country each year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon, I hope to create a relationship with those who would like to support my efforts to create fun art for the fans, without them having to wait for me to attend a comic con near to where they live. \u00a0It is also my hope that we can build a large enough following that I can focus on making you, the fans, happy with even more art at affordable prices. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe primary focus of the artwork I create through this Patreon project will be what I call \"The Helmet Series\". \u00a0\"The Helmet Series\" is a series I started at the end of 2016 where I focused primarily on the helmeted characters of the Star Wars universe (Boba Fett, Stormtroopers, etc...). What is unique about this series isn\u0027t necessarily that it featured helmeted characters, but rather the view we see of the characters. Each piece is cropped so you can only see each character from the waist to shoulders with only one visible arm in the frame holding their helmet at their side. This cropping makes it so you never actual see the character\u0027s true face....keeping it a mystery. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe response for this series was great and quickly grew beyond just Star Wars, and also beyond the characters holding only helmets. It now includes other characters holding objects or items that hold key meaning to the characters holding them while maintaining the cropping that keeps their face unrevealed. \u00a0Some examples include; Indiana Jones holding the Golden Idol, Homer Simpson holding a half eaten donut, and Negan holding Lucille.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to create anywhere from 2-4 pieces of art per month (depending on how busy each individual month is) and share this art with those who back my Patreon and reward them based upon the listed reward levels they choose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to consider this project.\u003cbr\u003e"
