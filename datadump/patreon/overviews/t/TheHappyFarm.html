Volunteers and retreatants in the Plum Village Meditation Practice Centre experience first-hand the interconnection between earth, rain, sun and seed with the hand and food of the farmer.\u003cbr\u003eThe farms in Upper Hamlet and Lower Hamlet use a variety of organic methods. The Happy Farms\u0027 volunteer teams practise mindfulness in our work as part of our vision of promoting wellbeing for individual, society and the earth.\u003cbr\u003eThe Happy Farm project is the concrete expression of Thich Nhat Hanh\u2019s vision of meditation engaged with action in the particular area of sustainable and ethical food production. The project currently comprises two plots of organic vegetable cultivation within the Plum Village meditation practice centre.\u003cbr\u003eWe intend to demonstrate that productivity, environmental sustainability and personal happiness are not conflicting aims, but rather are three essential pillars leading to and strengthening each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe three main aims of the farm are:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo grow healthy organic vegetables for the Plum Village community;\u003cbr\u003eTo train people in applying the principles of mindfulness into a working environment;\u003cbr\u003eTo offer education in organic growing, sustainability and mindfulness practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thehappyfarm.org\"\u003ehttps://thehappyfarm.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to thank you for helping support us and making Thich Nhat Hanh\u0027s vision come to fruition. Without your support, your patronage all this would be impossible. \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Here at the Happy Farm, we don\u0027t sell our produce or create any income. We offer our community service meditation and finest organic produce to our community for free. However it takes approximately \u20ac20,000/ $23,850 to keep the farm running each year. \u003cbr\u003eWe organise events here in Plum Village on the farm that help to generate some funding for the annual farm budget but we need your help.\u00a0So we ask you for your help and patronage. We welcome all and any pledges to help us keep this unique project alive and growing.\u003cbr\u003eWhat will we use your hard earned cash for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBuying new fruit plants and trees- this winter and spring we will purchase and plant new strawberries, raspberries, rhubarb, persimmon trees, apricot trees, fig trees and guava\u0027s.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis winter we are stocking up on bulk orders of compost and manure for bed preparation for next years planting. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe will be placing our big annual order of organic seeds for sowing next spring.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOur irrigation system needs a little bit of T.LC so will invest a little in that to be sure the plants are well watered this summer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe are an organic farm so use only organic fertilisers and products such as seaweed sprays that we apply each week for our plants to grow up big and healthy. We need to replenish our stocks of fertilisers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAs we welcome thousands of people onto the Happy Farm each year to  to practice mindfulness and farming there is a little bit of \u2018wear and tear\u2019. We need to maintain many and replace some of our hand tools such as broad forks, hand forks, rakes and buy new equipment such as garden string, gloves, sun screen and sun hats.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach winter we also send our humble machinery for a bit of spa treatment at the garage. Our lawn mower, tiller and brush cutter will get a bit of pampering during their winter service making them ready for use in the spring.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0027The Happy Van\u0027 is an old but reliable Toyota van that has been with the Plum Village Community for many years. We use it to transport the beautiful organic produce to all of our Hamlets- that is Upper Hamlet, Son Ha Temple, Lower Hamlet, West Hamlet, Middle Hamlet and New Hamlet (approx\u0027 50km round trip). We also use our sturdy van to go out and get all the tools, materials and equipment we need from local suppliers in the region- supplies such as irrigation, compost and plant nursery materials. Our little van is a gem, but it takes money to keep the gas tank full and for essential maintenance.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThen there is the boring stuff like printer paper, printer ink and office supplies.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
