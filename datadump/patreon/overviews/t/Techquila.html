We try to keep the podcast to around an hour but sometimes go over or under (usually over). We cover a wide range of topics including consumer electronics, developing technologies, gaming, science research, as well as how they intersect with social, racial, gender, economic, and environmental justice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s this page for?\u003cbr\u003eProducing the show has had some one-off costs and some recurring costs! I\u0027ve bought hosting for the podcast, me and my guests almost always have proper microphones, we occasionally buy new products to review on the podcast (and to play with), and I (the host Daniel Regueira) take the time to edit every episode myself (which is very time consuming). This page is to help listeners and supporters help us cover our costs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s Patreon?\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an established online platform that allows fans to provide regular financial support to creators.  Patreon was created by a musician who needed a easy way for fans to support his band.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you need?\u003cbr\u003eAt this stage just $1/month from our listeners. (Once our $30/mo goal is reached) Branded Techquila shot glasses sent to you as your reward!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from that we have other great rewards ideas for our Patrons in the works. The first step is to get $30 recurring monthly!\u003cbr\u003e"
