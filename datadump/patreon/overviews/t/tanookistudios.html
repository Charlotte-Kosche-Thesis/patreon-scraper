Just like you, we have a wide range of gaming interests, and we want to talk about all of them! So we\u0027re going to make a bunch of shows to cover all our bases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou may have seen The Post Game Zone. You might have heard of the Serenes Forest podcast. We make these shows out of our love for gaming. With your support, we can take things to the next level. New production equipment means we can stop recording shows on our smartphones. New servers means our website will be able to handle the traffic. Actual budgets mean we\u0027ll be able to meet up with and interview special guests or perhaps give away great prizes on a regular basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of our productions are available to you to enjoy for free, and we don\u0027t have any plans to change that. But by supporting us through Patreon, you can help to give us a boost to become even better. When you pledge, you help support not only your favorite show, but all of our shows. You\u0027ll even help to fund new shows. The best part? This is only the beginning of our ambitious plans!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s all up to you. You can help us grow as little or as much as you want. Thanks for giving us a chance, and regardless of whether or not you pledge to support us financially, we hope you\u0027ll continue to enjoy our shows as much as we do.\u003cbr\u003e"
