    "summary": "Hello there!\u00a0I didn\u0027t see you hiding behind that huge dragon! I am Rose (my name in Greek is \"\u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\" , it actually means rose tree) \u00a0and i daydream a lot! I will be your guide to a fantastic journey through the illustrations of my sketchbook\u0027s pages and paintings. You will be able to find them all soon as part of Rose Archives of the Elders\u0027 Library! My goal is to try to \u00a0enrich the magical and fantastic Library of the Elders (a totally imaginary library that exists in my thoughts so far) as much as possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Elders\u0027 Library was the jewel of the Thorn Kingdom. People from faraway kingdoms would travel for months, just to see this magnificent building, and even add a few pages to the enormous collection of books , scrolls and archives. One night, a mysterious burning crystal appeared in the sky and it fell near the Library. Not even the most clairvoyant oracles saw that coming..Strange dark flames engulfed the building, destroying almost everything that stood still after the explosion... The monks, soldiers and peasants, armed with water cannons and wet uniforms took out the fire, but in the end,they couldn\u0027t believe that all knowledge of Past, Present and Future was devoured in that fire..\u00a0A few weeks later, representatives from royal families of various kingdoms, held a meeting. Their unanimous decision was to help the Elders in any way they could, in order to try and restore as much of the lost wisdom. But the Elders are old and their health is too fragile, so it is my sacred duty, as a trainee Elder Librarian, to go on this epic journey! Join me on this search  for many creatures,myths and stories (as well as my interpretation of existing mythologies-history) and toss a coin or two \u00a0in my traveler\u0027s pouch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Drawing is like oxygen to me, i have been doing it for as long as i can remember.I have been through many rough years, full of loss and anxiety(still battling with panic attacks) ,and i found out that the only way i could relax and stay myself, was by grabbing a pen and a piece of paper, and just let my fantasy run wild.I love making art (or handmade items) for people, in order to spread some happiness and joy! There is a huge fantasy world in my imagination, all i need is time and proper tools to illustrate it and share it with the world! And this is were you (Patrons) come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Patreon is a great way for me to create and share my art ,starting with people who will truly value my work and all the time and effort i put into it! By becoming a Patron, you help me gather all the materials i need to complete my work and you also buying me more time with my lovely papers and pens! Even the smallest donations are important to me, so make sure you don\u0027t get overexcited with the way you choose to spend your money (and of course there is the age limit- Children! Don\u0027t steal your parents\u0027 cards and stuff! ). Of course i will give you something in return for your valuable offerings so make sure to check my list or rewards in every tie! I will be creating at least 4 illustrations a month plus a special illustration that patrons from tier 4 and above will get the chance to receive!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thank you for your time! Remember to always follow your heart and never give up! Dreams do come true! Unless it\u0027s a nightmare! Then i have a great illustrated book of dream-spells that you can read before you go to sleep!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
