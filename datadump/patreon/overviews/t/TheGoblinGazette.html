    "summary": "Hello and welcome! We are The Goblin Gazette and first and foremost we would like to say thank you to all of our followers! We truly appreciate your generosity and encouragement!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cem\u003eWho are we?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The Goblin Gazette was started 3 friends: Scott, Matt, and Cody. We have been friends since high school and love gaming in all of its forms. Most of high school was spent gaming late into the night in our parents\u0027 basements. We decided to start The Goblin Gazette because we wanted to bring the joy of gaming to others. Our hope is to eventually coordinate charity events in our hometown of Saint Louis around gaming. But right now, we are simply focused on getting our name out there and providing valuable information and insight. Due to our growth we\u0027ve added 2 additional members to the team to help us keep up with all of the reviews, Sam and David.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are we doing this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe decided to start a Patreon because since we\u0027ve started we have grown rather quickly, which is an amazing thing! But along with this growth comes certain things that we\u0027d like to be able to do better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Site\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOur website is the heart of everything we do, but it isn\u0027t free. We have a yearly cost of $70 to keep our site running. Spread out over 12 months this comes to $5.84.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReviews\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA big portion of the content we create are reviews, and this gets expensive when it is all out of pocket. We have been able to find some amazing Indie Game Companies who have provided us with their games free of charge and we intend to keep engaging this avenue, but we\u0027d love to be able to review more AAA games or games that may be hitting the store shelves. We would probably only do this once a month, and we believe $60 a month can be devoted to this cause. Additionally, we would love to be able to give away these games after they have been reviewed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGraphics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach of our posts has a customized image that Cody (Blunkers) creates for us. We would love to be able to purchase a Photoshop license for him so he can continue to deliver high quality images for every post. This license would cost $10 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis pretty much sums up our needs, we hope that this list will expand over the years as we are able to do more and grow.
