    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eDo please watch my introduction video, as well as read all the points below, to fully understand the aims of my Patreon project.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eSo why have I created a Patreon page?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter making good progress growing my channel in 2016, I\u0027d like to really kick on in 2017 if at all possible. With a fairly basic set of equipment and software, I think I\u0027ve massively improved on the production values of my content but being able to work more efficiently is going to be important to me as well. I am at the point where I\u0027d like to upgrade equipment and perhaps use more advanced software but the channel will have to fund itself now. Revenue from Youtube is increasing, but is hardly keeping me in champagne and caviar. I\u0027d ideally like to be able to make enough from Patreon to pay for hardware and software upgrades during 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat becomes of any funds raised on Patreon?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I can have no way of knowing if this will succeed. Some WoW related Youtubers earn a living wage from Patreon whereas most couldn\u0027t even buy a round of drinks at the pub with their monthly income. The money from Patreon will go directly to equipment, subscriptions and/software which will have a direct impact on the channel. However, it\u0027s impossible to plan exactly what that will be without knowing how much will be generated. I will keep Patrons updated at various points throughout the year on how the revenue has helped the channel via the Video Diaries series which all Patrons have access to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat content have I produced on Youtube?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDetailed \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eRetribution Paladin guides\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (for PvE). I mean really. Many people claim to produce good quality guides, but in reality are doing little more than just reading from the spellbook or stealing it from others.\u00a0I go over the details in a way that won\u0027t overwhelm beginner players but is also useful for veterans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eGeneral Raiding advice\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. My videos cover the various aspects of raiding in a progress orientated mythic environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWorld of Warcraft vlogs\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Discussions on whatever topics I feel I can contribute to the discussion on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWorld of Warcraft news\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. A weekly look at the latest news in the World of Warcraft.\u003cbr\u003eBut these are just general topic areas. See for yourself by looking up Thete Gaming on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eSo what will Patreon content look like?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first thing to make clear is that my Youtube content will remain as it is; I will not be putting my guides behind paywalls. I also do not want people pledging silly amounts of money. I have a medium and long term plan for Patreon which is covered in the intro video, but the initial pledges will be for the purposes of supporting my Youtube channel. Your main reward is feeling good about that. As such, only pledge if the absence of that amount makes zero difference to your life. Yes, getting hundreds of small pledges is not technically as good as fewer large pledges because a transfer fee is charged per pledge, but I\u0027d rather that and not make as much than people doing without something else they could be using the money for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I think a little extra support should be rewarded if I am able to do so. All patrons contributing at least $1 per month will have access to the Legion Video Diaries (exclusive Patreon content). Those contributing at least $2 per month will get advanced screenings of my feature series of videos (starting with the Preparation for the Tomb of Sargeras series). These will appear on YouTube for everyone to see several days later. Those contributing at least $5 per month will have questions discussed in the weekly Video Diaries. I try to answer questions from all viewers where I can, of course, but time is limited. I will now make a point of guaranteeing time to read and vlog discussions to any points or questions raised by this tier of Patron. This will be reviewed in the future if too many join at this point, but there will be advanced notice and I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any danger of that now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eGot a plan for the future?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is now the second phase of the Patreon plan, so to speak. I will be actively seeking ways to reward Patrons with more bonuses as 2017 rolls on, without of course diminishing the content on YouTube. Suggestions for this are always warmly welcomed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will carry out a full consultation with current Patrons at this time with a view to either altering the rewards or keeping them the same, along with a potential increase in the Patreon content if it goes well. No changes will take place without plenty of notice, however.\u003cbr\u003e"
