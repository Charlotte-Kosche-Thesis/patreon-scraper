    "summary": "The Gal-Lery is an arts and community collective based out of Manchester, New Hampshire. Formed in 2015, The Gal-lery\u0027s mission has always been to create space for marginalized people in the arts and DIY scene. This isn\u0027t your grandfather\u0027s punk basement! We are women/femme-aligned artists who are dedicated to promoting an anti-academic art space. In the past year, we have provided a space for people who are alienated from traditional gallery art and DIY music/performance communities to create art, make friends, and learn new skills. This has included, but is not limited to, poetry, zine making, fiber arts, figure drawing, music and more. Additionally, it\u00a0give us a work environment for our own art.\u00a0Moving forward with the space, we want to give our supporters the opportunity to fund our collective efforts towards improving the Manchester arts scene.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Gal-lery is made up of several kick-ass young people:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Adrian, a ceramist,\u003cbr\u003e-Gianna, a hand-letterer and illustrator\u003cbr\u003e-Chelsea, a zinester and craftsperson\u003cbr\u003e-Madeline a painter, poet, performer, and co-founder of the Gal-lery\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions will go directly towards the Gal-lery\u0027s rent and cost of upkeep, equipment and art supplies for future events and workshops, and the Gals themselves, who currently provide everything for the space out of their own pockets. We have worked tirelessly towards creating a much-needed welcoming and positive environment in Manchester. With your help we will continue to put forth good vibes and neat stuff!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove, The Gals \u0026lt;3"
