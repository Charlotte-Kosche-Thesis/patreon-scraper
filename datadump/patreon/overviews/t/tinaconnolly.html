(Check them out if you haven\u0027t!) I am restarting the podcast again, but I want to raise the rates I pay the authors. In order to do that, I am starting this patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy initial goal is to make Toasted Cake self-sustaining. I am planning to buy stories that are under 1000 words, and pay $10 for them. I will be running a story every week during the school year. Add in a bit extra for Patreon fees and the occasional guest narrator and we\u0027ll call that $50 a month to be sustainable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy secondary goal would be to raise both word count and pay rate. I would like to get back to stories up to 1200 or 1500 words, and I do like occasionally running \"giant\" stories (up to 2000.) I may also pay myself. Or upgrade my microphone. The possibilities are ENDLESS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I plan to toast the cake regardless (and that will take a chunk of time each week), there will not be a ton of extras other than my HUGE ENORMOUS GRATITUDE, at least for right now. However, this fall I will narrate a flash story and a short story of mine that have not been previously podcast, and will post them for different levels. (Easier to do mine because I have the rights to them!) I\u0027m also thinking that if we reach a certain dollar mark, that I will post some more podcast bonuses--both fiction and non-fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd again, thank you so much for being here. Toasted Cake has been one of the most rewarding experiences I\u0027ve worked on, because of the interaction with writers and with listeners. Thank you all so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exo tina\u003cbr\u003e"
