I have had a number of tremendous setbacks in my life. Each time I achieve a peak or pinnacle of success and fame in my life and I choose to continue to explore the unknown I am thrown back into the cycle of the hero\u0027s journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis particular journey started in the winter of 2001. Many years ago, and what feels like many lifetimes ago, I started a project called the anime_rose tarot.Just after the World Trade Center attack, I was prompted to start a newsletter about the Tarot. I convinced a friend who was an artist to design the card images. I wanted to learn more about the cards, to understand the Tarot more fully as a tool for self-mastery and spiritual development, as opposed to as a tool for divination or forecasting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe trigger for this journey of writing was to study the way that the Tarot could be used as a tool for enlightenment, according to the kaballah - the theory being that if you follow the steps of the major arcana, you can attain a level of enlightenment by completing all the major cards, including the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRather than write each newsletter and card description based on thoughts alone, I determined that the best way to test this theory and understand the lessons truly would be to apply the lessons of each card to my life, and then write about the cards as a result of my experiences. I created an online persona called anime_rose, and proceeded to jump in like the fool I was down a rabbit hole I had no idea existed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the process of writing and meditating on the first seven cards of the Major Arcana, within two months of starting the writing, I left my job and a seriously abusive relationship, travelled home to Orangeville Ontario and, from there, leapt into a series of adventures I could never have foreseen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was just before heading out on a new adventure to Vancouver that I had a dream - the most vivid and real dream - which showed me the journey I was about to embark upon. It culminated with me looking over the ocean, at the most beautiful sunset I had ever seen, next to my soulmate, and then turning around to see that everything was in an outdoor film set and there was a director\u2019s chair with my name on it.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI assumed this was metaphorical.\u00a0 Mostly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBased on guidance and wanting a new start, I travelled across the country by bus with two suitcases, fell in love, and got attuned to Reiki. Also, what started as a written newsletter evolved, the studies became more elaborate, and I started expanding my knowledge of web design and learning photoshop and illustrator. I found that the lessons of each card began to take over my life in very literal as well as metaphorical ways. And my personal transformation and growth continued, as did my understanding of the Tarot. I began to see how different aspects of different spiritual systems could fit within the construct of the Tarot system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my explorations from the Hermit (card 7) to Death (card 13) I started creating websites for each card. Each website was an art piece designed to be a metaphor for its Tarot card. Strength, for example, was a 404 website, totally devoid of images or design features, meant to stand on the power of the words alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Tarot never fails to amaze me in it\u2019s ability to speak to us, in its amazing structure and the ways in which the cards can have so many subtle meanings, depending on the images themselves. I ended up going back to school and graduating from college.During the summer of death, as I lovingly call it, I almost died, my puppy Bob almost died, and I decided to kill my online persona, but continue the studies on my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI moved to Mission, BC on 14th Ave when studying card 14 (temperance).\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI became a Reiki master, and started the \u201cwest coast centre for enlightenment\u201d with the help of a government self-employment grant. And it was finally time for me to symbolically leave behind the old person that I was. As a result, upon being reborn as Rayne, I realized that what I was trying to create was not meant to be in the location or time I created it, and I let it go.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI gave up most of what I owned, and spent the next period of time travelling around BC, studying shamanism, reading Tarot cards and having amazing adventures. This is how I ended up as \"one of Vancouver\u2019s Top Psychics,\" met loads of amazing people, truly understood the first chapter of illusions by Richard Bach for the first time, and gained a profound respect for the system and underlying structure of the Tarot.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIt is this structure and system that I began to study exclusively in relation to other spiritual models and systems, and which I attribute much of my understanding of the nature of the psyche to.\u00a0 Then tripping along into the tail end of the Major Arcana, I chased a boy (my personal devil) who I thought was important, to Croatia.  There I was bit by a tick.\u00a0 Anyone who understands anything about Lyme disease probably has a sense about what comes next. (The Tower).\u00a0 When I was struck down, I learned I did not have strong foundations in the people around me, and at the first sign of difficulty the boy ran away leaving me literally lying on the floor in my bedroom unable to walk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI disappeared from the face of the earth, had to quit my job, and go on welfare, could barely walk or leave the house and spent the next few years surviving as best I could with an unexplained and severe illness that kept getting worse and which I could get no doctor to take seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring my lowest point, I met the love of my life and changed my name to Tav Rayne.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had sworn off love and was focused on healing and trying to leave some form of legacy to support others in reaching their dreams (I was building a non-profit foundation) but instead he taught me how to love in a whole new way me and treated me like a goddess. And with his unconditional support, it took many years but I was able to achieve a level of healing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring that time - when I had no short term memory - I started photographing things and found myself as an official photographer for several film festivals and this progressed until I found myself one beautiful sunset over the ocean, filming Granny, the world\u2019s oldest living Orca. And suddenly I found that I was a filmmaker.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not recommend this path. If you can do ordinary or just study the cards I really really recommend it. But I started as the fool, ended with a tav and experienced a hell of a lot in-between.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(250, 192, 143);\"\u003eMy Vision: Make a movie and design a new type of interactive oracle\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI have been toying with an idea for a long time of designing my own deck, going back to the original cards and relearning/rewriting them now with fresh eyes. Looking back it\u2019s clear that I have truly gone through the whole cycle of the major arcana, I have a significant understanding of the minors and I have a thousand foot view that I know to be unique, as well as having been a successful professional psychic and Tarot reader.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eMy aim this time is a little more complex. Beyond studying each card in-depth and writing about them, I intend to capture each one - using film as my medium. My goal here is to create a series of film clips, each one representing a Tarot card, plus a body of written and other visual work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I feel really strongly about communicating with people to help them learn how to listen to themselves and develop greater self-awareness in their decision making process so each card will have a series of media and creative experiences attached to it to help you understand the cards better both on a subconscious and non-verbal as well as intellectual level.\u00a0 Music playlists, images and online interactive components will likely emerge as part of each card\u0027s development.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI will also share stories about my personal experiences, and some of the wider knowledge and wisdom I have gleaned for members here who subscribe and support my journey, and I will also be offering instruction and readings as incentives for people who are interested in higher levels of support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal, is to use Joseph Campbell\u2019s hero\u2019s journey to plot the journey of the tarot for an eventual film project. The exact format of that will emerge as part of this journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will create an \u201coracle app\u201d that allows someone like you to ask a question, and instead of getting a little image or series of images with an interpretation that may or may not speak to you, you\u2019ll get to watch a short film of clips that are randomly generated in response to your question. Each film sequence will be unique and give you a short viewing experience to help you with your personal quandaries and journeys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guarantee that no matter what my intention setting out, by focusing on experiencing the card meanings and writing about them I will be having some very intriguing adventures (see my history).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the world in the state it is in now, it\u2019s time for me to engage in another public experiment with the Tarot, allowing the art and the ideas to live in my life and permeate my waking and dreaming worlds.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI am still in recovery, I am not always going to be available because I am dealing with ongoing medical issues, but I feel the call from the world to be a fool again and take a new leap of faith without knowing exactly where it will go.\u003cbr\u003eI promise it will be a wild adventure. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(178, 162, 199);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eAbout Patreon:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003ePatreon is something I\u2019ve been wanting to explore for a long time, but I\u2019ve been waiting for the right project.

The support you give helps me film more documentaries and do work I love, as well as pay for actors and essential props or equipment for each video.

I\u2019m also planning to throw in some super fun extras, like footage of our southern resident orcas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd from an ethical standpoint you\u0027re supporting someone working to help our planet, so it\u0027s really the only ethical choice ;) .\u00a0 \u00a0Thanks so much for the love - and for jumping in to my crazy world.\u00a0 Wishing you adventures, and love and peace on earth and hey - how about a pony?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eRayne\u003c/strong\u003e"
