Please read below to see what rewards come with each level. Or you can just support to support. We hope you\u0027ll become an active member of this amazing community!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eProducing content for The First Layer channel on YouTube isn\u0027t easy, and I don\u0027t take the responsibility lightly. More often than not I am planning new topics a week in advance and try to deliver content that is both entertaining and informative. I am wearing all the hats with the assistance of others like Frank Ossm who works the controls for the Live Streams. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll though science has been able to clone animals, human trials are still out of reach. So, until I can make more of me I will have to keep being the producer, director, editor, host, and geek that you have come to know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am often asked \u201cWhy do I make these videos?\u201d, and the answer is simple! I love what I do and I love interacting with the community. I love 3D printing and the ongoing research and development that companies and individuals are making. I believe that this is a technology that will be a common item in homes much the same way the personal computer is now. The next generation will inherit this legacy and go on to improve and innovate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am finding my niche in the vast world of 3D printing and if you get something out of my YouTube channel, then I have done what I sought to do.  Based on the continued growth of the YouTube channel and Facebook group it would appear that has been a success.  Thank-you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunds generated from Patreon will be put right back into creating better content for this channel. I promise, that you are not obligated to contribute to my Patreon. If you like what I am trying to do here and have a few spare dollars a month, and you personally feel the content I create is of value TO YOU, then I appreciate the support. If my Patreon grows and I find this is something many people use, I will start to explore Patreon-only content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain THANK-YOU for subscribing to my YouTube channel and supporting my efforts. Never stop learning and keep printing amazing things.\u003cbr\u003e"
