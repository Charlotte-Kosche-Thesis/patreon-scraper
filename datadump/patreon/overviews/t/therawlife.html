    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page! I\u0027m Janiece and together with my service dog, Orion, we are spreading the word for raw feeding. What is raw feeding, you may ask? It is the most biologically appropriate way of nourishing our beloved furry family members (both cats and dogs alike). Giving your pet raw meat may seem taboo at first thought, but this diet comes with a wide array of incredible benefits!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRaw diets provide stronger immune systems, healthier coats, cleaner teeth, improved digestion, increased longevity and more. The sad truth is that kibble is chalk full of harmful preservatives and there is not enough regulation on what is/is not allowed in pet food. In the raw community there are two main diets: Biologically Appropriate Raw Fed and Prey Model Diet. I personally follow BARF, but I have knowledge on both ideologies and firmly believe that either are good options. On this page you will find information for both diets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand that jumping in to the world of raw feeding may seem a bit intimidating as there is a lot to know. But no worries, I am here to help! By pledging to be one of my Patrons, you will have access to raw diet tips and tricks, behind the scenes outtakes of The Raw Life family, meal prep ideas and more. For those who are interested in easy to follow meal plans and more hands on guidance from myself (including one on one Skype sessions), check out the various \"Raw Diet Consultant\" Patron levels. I will happily be your \"raw guru\" as you transition over and learn the ways of raw feeding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also be doing Private Vlogs for Patreon members Only, as well as other fun and exciting things like give-a-ways that only you as a Patreon members will have access to. This is my way of reaching out to each and everyone of you and having fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll contributions from Patreon will go to the goals that I wish to accomplish including donating to charity, so everyone will benefit from this page. Thank you so much for stopping by, Orion, Yori, Paul and I truly appreciate your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe names of the levels do not dipict the type of diet I will be helping you with its just a fun name i put to differentiate them."
