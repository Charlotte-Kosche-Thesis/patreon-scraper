    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m a video artist/filmmaker who has made videos which can roughly be described as experimental, but which I think are also entertaining and leaning more towards narrative. I\u0027m also a scriptwriter, trying to get some feature film projects off the ground. Right now I am developing a web series about Natives colonizing Mars, and am creating some \"infomercials\" for Better 2 Spirit Living.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of the work I create is made about my communities, Queer, Indigenous, Mental Health Consumers/Survivors, Women, 2 Spirit people, Non-Binary/Genderqueer kinda stuff. I\u0027ve screened in festivals internationally since 1995. But I am also extremely low income, and it shows in my work. I have been lucky enough to get funding now and then for projects, but MANY of my videos and films have been made with the budget of 100 dollars or so. And let\u0027s face it, artists are low paid. Some festivals, strike that, MANY festivals do not pay artist fees at all. I have screened a lot of work for free. And it\u0027s been fun when I can travel with my art to screen it somewhere, but that doesn\u0027t happen all the time. Usually it\u0027s just me writing down another screening in my resume and uploading a screening copy through Dropbox or Wetransfer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had a successful experience with GoFundMe when I was starting Grad School and waiting to find out if I would get student loans or not. I made enough to keep me going for a couple months until my funding came through. I\u0027ve thought about resurrecting that campaign, but I\u0027m done Grad School. Still, crowdfunding has some appeal for me. What draws me to Patreon is the ongoing support of friends and fans that might be able to help me continue as a full time artist. Even if I can make enough that I don\u0027t have to get a full time job, that I can get a part time job AND do this so I can keep devoting time to my art, that would be ideal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write a lot besides making videos. I have been a blogger for a long time and sometimes I have interesting things to say that I don\u0027t feel like making a video about. If you back me here, you\u0027ll be able to read some more exclusive blog content. Maybe even some angry rants, which let\u0027s face it everyone can appreciate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking me out! The more support I get, the more things I can make, and the more things I can make, the better the world will be for people from my communities. Representation of marginalized people is my favourite thing!\u003cbr\u003e"
