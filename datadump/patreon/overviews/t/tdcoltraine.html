D. Coltraine, writer, world builder, character designer, and general toiler in the field of letters and punctuation marks. \u00a0It is distinctly possible, depending on how you came upon this Patreon account, that you are perhaps familiar with my work. \u00a0Or you found interest through some other manner. \u00a0It\u0027s irrelevant how you got here; I\u0027m simply ecstatic to see you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the majority of things, I stay to the realm of somewhat short fiction--ten or twelve pages--working through my own addled brain\u0027s creations. \u00a0Fantasy, science-fiction, horror, even perhaps a soft bit of the slice-of-life with a touch of drama tea, I\u0027ve done them all, with all sort of characters and situations. \u00a0Prefer furries? \u00a0I\u0027m completely comfortable there. \u00a0Elves, dwarves, and other beasties of fantasy? \u00a0Sure! \u00a0Aliens? \u00a0Superheroes? \u00a0Medieval knights? \u00a0Heck, I\u0027ll even work with plain and simple humans, perish the thought.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(I should be direct and point out here: I do have something of a predilection towards pornography. \u00a0The dirty stuff. \u00a0Not all the time, and certainly if I do mention a work of such a nature it \u003cem\u003ewill \u003c/em\u003ebe marked clearly. \u00a0No brain-bleach shall be required. \u00a0You may also ask \u0027why monthly\u0027? \u00a0I don\u0027t have a predictable, stable production stream yet, so it seems fairer to work that way than per-work.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I ask in return, reader is support. \u00a0A few dollars a month from any number of people can make the difference between having time to spend working on stories and needing to dedicate much of my time to a \u0027real\u0027 job. \u00a0I hope, in return for your contributions I can bring you the finest product I \u00a0can, ah, produce!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sell a small number of works, including my first novel \u003cem\u003eChild of Stone \u0026amp; Other Stories\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0at my \u003ca href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/TylerColtraine\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSmashwords store\u003c/a\u003e, and if you\u0027d like to flip through a number of free works, I keep an archive right \u003ca href=\"http://sofurry.com/browse/user/stories?uid=7468\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eat Sofurry.com\u003c/a\u003e--there you\u0027ll find ongoing things like \u003cem\u003eLady Chatterlynx\u0027s Lover\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and the inappropriate behaviour of \"Maybe\" Monroe. \u00a0(This site may require a free login to view any content, as it is adult in nature. \u00a0My apologies, but it is the best way to prevent the young ones from seeing that which they shouldn\u0027t.) \u00a0An additional all-audiences story can be read\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/4441644/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon this page\u003c/a\u003e, no login required.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo carry on, and have a wonderful day, fair reader! \u00a0If you\u0027ve any questions or anything you\u0027d enjoy, feel free to send me a message--I\u0027d love to talk to you!\u003cbr\u003e"
