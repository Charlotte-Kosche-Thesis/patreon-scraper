I have some really big plans for the future and I am asking you to be a part of it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really want to make a success of my channel and be able to buy new equipment and make bigger and better videos for YouTube. I want to continue making vlogs about my modelling and comic cons but make them even greater!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver little bit will help, whether it\u0027s \u00a31 or \u00a3100! I l also don\u0027t expect anything aside views to be honest - just views and subscribers makes me feel more positive. But those of you that CAN financially help me, I have no words to express what that means to me."
