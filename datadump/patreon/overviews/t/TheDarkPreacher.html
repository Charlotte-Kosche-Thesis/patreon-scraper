    "summary": "Hey Guys, I\u0027m\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thedarkpreacher.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe DarkPreacher\u003c/a\u003e. I am an Iraq War veteran living with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx-3awrQu98\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePTSD\u003c/a\u003e. I also am a content creator on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCItleUMee_tpizC6kTgxxUw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e. I make videos to educate people, entertain people, and game to keep from getting too stressed. Sadly, I cannot go out and get what would be considered a normal job due to how bad my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx-3awrQu98\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePTSD\u003c/a\u003e is. I very rarely leave home, and when I do, I am only able to stand being out and about if my wife is with me. I have been making videos on a regular basis for almost 2 years now, and quite frankly, I barely make enough a month to buy a box of ramen. So here\u0027s the pitch: If you support me on here, you support my channel, by helping pay my internet bill, getting better equipment or games to make new content with, and taking less stress off me to try and figure out how I\u0027m going to keep doing this. Gaming and YouTube are ways I cope, and how I work through the issues that come from having\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx-3awrQu98\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePTSD\u003c/a\u003e. If you can\u0027t donate to me, then please consider donating to a charity that helps veterans, because we all need the help in one form or another, if not all the time, then from time to time. So go ahead, check out my channel, check out my videos, see if it\u0027s worth helping, and if not, I hope I at least entertained you for a little while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and also, before you ask, Yes, I am an ordained minister. I\u0027m more spiritual than religious, though. So don\u0027t expect a lot of actual religious content from me. Your faith is just that: Yours. I can\u0027t change it, so I won\u0027t try, because it\u0027s part of you. I accept it, and I accept you. Kinda big on the whole \"Love Thy Neighbour as you would love thyself\" and \"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you\" as well as \"An it harm none, do as thou will\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut enough preaching from me. I hope I at least have made you think, or if you watch my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCItleUMee_tpizC6kTgxxUw/videos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideos\u003c/a\u003e, entertained or educated you some."
