We were founded in 2010 but only started working actively as \u003cstrong\u003eTHTFHQ \u003c/strong\u003ein 2011. Since then, our website has grown to be an important spot for most male seiyuu fans across the globe (we\u0027ve got readers from the Philippines, Italy, Argentina, Japan, USA, UK, Singapore, Thailand and many other countries). 7 years later, and half a million views later, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Hand That Feeds HQ\u003c/strong\u003e continues to improve everyday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore we start talking about why we\u0027re on Patreon, get to know our team:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVanessa Silva\u003c/strong\u003e has DJ/music composition background. Music under her name as well as Mugen Naraku (side project) was produced from 2006 to 2012 (on soundcloud - both pages were closed in 2014). Was once Portugal\u0027s #1 DJ on Reverbnation\u0027s charts. When she enrolled in Law college, she decided to distance herself from music composition. She never thought that stumbling upon a random tumblr post about Durarara (damn you Shizuo!) would make her fall in love with seiyuu and seiyuu music. Since then, she started reviewing releases from OLDCODEX and Mamoru Miyano on a personal blog, hoping people outside of Japan would come across her posts and find that music interesting, in result, ending up supporting the artists. Without knowing, \u003cstrong\u003eTHTFHQ\u003c/strong\u003e was born. She\u0027s the founder of THTFHQ, as well as lead reviewer and social media expert. Goes by the name \"\u003cstrong\u003emidorin\u003c/strong\u003e\" in all matters related to the website. Has a degree in Law, worked previously as a K-Pop concert promoter, loves rock music and sweet, rich vocals. Favorite seiyuu include: Hikaru Midorikawa, Soma Saito and Daisuke Ono.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNadine Silva \u003c/strong\u003ehas been part of the team since 2012. With studies in music composition and translation, she\u0027s THTFHQ\u0027s secret weapon, as well as the resident reviewer for any releases by Kensho Ono, Mamoru Miyano, OLDCODEX, Daisuke Namikawa and more. Loves dark compositions, solemn piano pieces, slap bass and deep vocals. Would love to dedicate more time to THTFHQ but unfortunately, translation takes a lot of her free time.\u003cbr\u003eSoon to have a degree in Translation, hardrocker to the core, the gazettE and OLDCODEX\u0027s fan. Favorite seiyuu include: Mamoru Miyano, Takuya Sato and Yoshiki Nakajima.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth are co-workers, associates and sisters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur background and situation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e For 7 years our website has been hard at work covering the latest news about male seiyuu music and 2.5D units, something that, outside of Japan, wasn\u0027t that much talked about, with only a small portion of fans knowing about their favorite seiyuu\u0027s endeavors. Of course, that was in 2011 - when it wasn\u0027t common for seiyuu to endeavor to the music business and 2.5D units weren\u0027t that common.\u003cbr\u003eIn the past 7 years, the number of seiyuu with careers as solo singers has more than doubled and the number of 2.5D units has increased by almost 10 times. We initially covered a bit over 20 seiyuu/2.5D or seiyuu units/bands on our website, today, in 2018, \u003cstrong\u003ewe cover 317 seiyuu/2.5D projects\u003c/strong\u003e with the same two-cell team we did when we kicked off this website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the increase of projects we\u0027re covering, it\u0027s hard to support our website ourselves. What was back in the day a simple 40\u20ac/month bill for three, sometimes four CDs to review, today is an over 80\u20ac/month bill in digital downloads and physical copies (and that\u0027s because we\u0027re lucky to have people helping us with some releases, easing the weight on our wallets).\u003cbr\u003eWhile we want to review as many releases as most people ask us to, we can\u0027t due to the fact that our reviews aren\u0027t made based on pirated music, we have to spend a lot of money just to acquire each release + pay for any customs fees.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur expenses in euros and dollars:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWordpress premium plan: 99\u20ac/$119 per year (includes custom domain, ads, 13 gb of available space + other perks)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAverage monthly spending on music: 10 releases with final cost being between 50\u20ac to 70\u20ac / basically $60 to $84 (I.e: If those 10 releases are albums: 1 album = 3000yen (23.09\u20ac)/ 10 x 23.09 = 230,09\u20ac / If those 10 releases are mini-albums: 1 mini-album = 1400yen (10.78\u20ac)/ 10 x 10.78 = 107,80\u20ac / If those 10 releases are singles: 1 single = 1200yen (9.24\u20ac)/ 10 x 9.24 = 92,40 \u20ac)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCustoms fees in Portugal: 15\u20ac to 36\u20ac ($18 to $43) per package / over 36\u20ac/$43 if the package has over 2 kg.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe purchase 60% of the releases we review, the other 40% correspond to releases that are lent/sponsored to us by some of the website\u0027s readers or close friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur earnings (average):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWordpress ads (wordads) on website: 8\u20ac/$9 per month (money unavailable to us until hitting the threshold - 100 USD) - Last year\u0027s earnings - 1st year using this plan - $100.03\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCDJAPAN 5% commission for each purchase through affiliated links: 7\u20ac/$8 per month (money unavailable to us until hitting the threshold - 5000 yen) - Yearly around 70\u20ac/$84\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDonation button on our website (through Paypal) - $0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we\u0027ll use our money for:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eOur \u003cstrong\u003einitial goal \u003c/strong\u003eis \u003cstrong\u003e$\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e150/month\u003c/strong\u003e.

     "about": "First of all, for those that don\u0027t know us, long story short:\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Vanessa Silva and I founded the website in 2010. Initially it was a personal blog in which I reviewed any music that piqued my interest. Then, in late 2010, I came into contact with Japanese music, seiyuu (voice actors) and anime culture. I grew particularly fond of the seiyuu industry and when I noticed, I was already reviewing music releases from seiyuu projects.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2011 I moved the website to wordpress and shifted its focus from being a personal blog to making it a place in which seiyuu fans could get their daily dose of news about any music projects their favorite seiyuu might be a part of. All in English. The small blog was now a small website with a, sort of, professional look.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7 years have passed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, THTFHQ is a leading website when it comes to male seiyuu news and seiyuu music news - with over 150.000 views/year!\u003cbr\u003eThere have been a few changes in contents created and artists covered over the years, but our passion for seiyuu and their music projects has lead us to expand our covered artists from 20 to over 300 (between seiyuu units, groups, bands, solo projects).\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve always had a small team - basically just me and my sister - with me mainly running a major part of the show (social media, news coverage, 90% of the music reviews published, design, special Op-Ed articles, you name it) alone. Out of those 300 artists, I\u0027m in charge of over 200.\u003cbr\u003eSounds crazy, right?",
