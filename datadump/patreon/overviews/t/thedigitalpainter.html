    "summary": "Hi there and thank you for stopping by my Patreon page.  First, a little about me.  I\u2019m a husband, father of two, and college professor.  I teach theatre design.  So if you\u2019ve ever gone to a live theatre event, then you\u2019ve seen what I teach.  A large part of what I do as a theatre designer is draw and build models.  I am a collaborator, and the way I convey my ideas is through art.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI was a late starter to drawing and painting.  In fact, prior to grad school, most of my drawings sucked.  I luckily can be honest about that.  And even today I have trouble with the human figure, though I\u2019m constantly working on it.  Over time I got turned on to creating my art through digital means.  Then, a couple of years ago I created a tutorial about Procreate for the iPad.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, as they say, the rest is history.  I\u2019ve been producing tutorials on a fairly regular basis since that time.  Some deal with technology, others with the art of art.  I used to run a membership site, but I realized I was spending more time working on the backend of the website than I was on actually drawing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, I moved the membership part to Patreon, while still keeping the website going.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eHow Can You Help?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u2019s start with the dream first.  My dream is to create art and teach others art full time via the web.  Currently I get to do that as a college professor, but it is limiting in the sense that I cannot reach a wider audience.  So, the long term goal is to make online art teaching my career.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is where you come in.  With each small amount of support, I can expand what I am doing online.  My ideas range from increasing the amount of videos I produce a week to weekly free online classes.  And each level has awards associated with it.  So not only are you helping to increase the amount of content that I am producing, but you also get a special something from me to show my gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eGoals\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the top right you\u2019ll see the goals that I\u2019d like to reach.  For each goal I reach, I will be expanding what I can offer.  It means I can take less outside design work and focus a bit more on The Digital Painter brand.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much, and keep on painting!\u003cbr\u003e"
