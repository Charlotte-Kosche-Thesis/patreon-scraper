I agree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why I find the job of discussing literature so relevant.\u003cbr\u003eBy talking about the books we love, we dig deeper into their layers and get the most out of them. When a book is fun (and I definitely read for fun!) it makes no sense to make the fun stop just because you\u0027ve reached the last page.\u003cbr\u003eAnd sharing our experience with other readers - who have read different things, and love different books - means getting their unique approach too, and gaining ways of shedding ever more light on a book\u0027s complexities, on the intricacies of its themes and plots, on how damn fun it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s my approach to reviewing. It\u0027s not just about telling you whether you should buy the book (though there\u0027s an element of that). It\u0027s not about giving you the plot (I hate that with a passion).\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s about helping you get the most out of your reads - whether you have already read the book, or you still have to buy it.\u003cbr\u003eThat shit\u0027s difficult! But I try.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my book reviews, if I\u0027ve helped you discover new literary shores or look at your bookshelf in a slightly different way, consider helping me out.
