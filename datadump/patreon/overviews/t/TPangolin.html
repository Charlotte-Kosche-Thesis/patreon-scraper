If you\u0027re unfamiliar or confused as to what it is that I actually do, then you\u0027re most likely either one of my parents or are new to this page. For those in the latter category, I\u0027m a content creator specialising in producing new and original content mainly utilizing the Civilization V video game. Originally, I started out producing additional Civilizations that people can play as and to date the content I have helped produce as a part of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=512802\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eColonialist Legacies Modding Project\u003c/a\u003e has had over 260,000+ individual downloads since it\u0027s inception in January 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently however, I\u0027ve been investing vast amounts of time and energy in my latest and greatest project: \u003cem\u003eThe Official /r/civ Civilization V Battle Royale Mk.II \u003c/em\u003ehosted on both\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/civ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e/r/civ\u003c/a\u003e and it\u0027s own subcommunity -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e/r/civbattleroyale\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was the the Official /r/civ Civilization V Battle Royale Mk.I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe original /r/civ Battle Royale was an event created by yours truly, and it centred upon a simple concept; One enormous map of the Earth, and 42 AI civilizations located in their approximate historical locations. The Human player does not have any territory, and only exists to observe. The only victory condition is that of Domination, i.e one civilization needs to capture every other original capital to win the game. All Civilizations were chosen by the denizens of /r/civ and included both Modded Historical and Vanilla civilizations alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what happened to the original Battle Royale?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite my best efforts, after 318 turns the save file grew into an unstable, buggy mess that would not even load up on my computer. A cocktail of inherent game flaws and some bugs in the mods used required measures such as the annihilation of cities, just to keep the beast moving. Every time the game was loaded up, it required a great deal of luck, and my time, to work properly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOk, so what\u0027s new in the Battle Royale Mk. II?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the second iteration, some refinements have been made. A new .DLL file is in use that allows for a greater number of civilizations in a game, taking us to 62, including the elusive Babylonians. A more stable mod list is in use, the quantities of units (including archaeologists) have been toned down, and most significantly I\u0027m running the game entirely in one session, to work around Civ V\u0027s finicky loading system.\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find an extremely large amount of information pertaining to the Battle Royale here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/comments/3epuyb/battle_royale_mkii_frequently_asked_questions/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFrequently Asked Questions\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://redd.it/3gkegn\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMegathread 1\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://battle_royale_mkii_megathread2/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMegathread 2\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://civbattleroyale.imgur.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLinks to watch the BR Mk.II\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I asking for contributions?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBetween modding new civilizations, university and a life in general, time for scheduling when to do the Battle Royale has gotten extremely difficult.

I\u0027m not really the one to beg for financial support, but I feel that with some additional money to buy ramen and cans of tuna, I\u0027d be able to safely invest more time in growing this community and the project in general.
