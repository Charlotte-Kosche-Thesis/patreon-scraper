    "summary": "Hi friends known and yet to be discovered!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are Trope. An alternative female fronted rock band. Fans of melodic heavy rock music like A Perfect Circle or Tool could possibly find something they like here... although we are trying to forge new ground in the art rock genre.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re huge fans of music ourselves, so really want to create music that we\u0027re dying to hear, and also create another world, that we can lose ourselves in, and hopefully bring you there with us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe teaser vid is just a very small sample of the aesthetic and sonic direction we\u0027re heading in. It\u0027s a tip of the hat to 90\u0027s music that we grew up listening to and loving [bless the 90s] but with our own convoluted twist.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you like what you see so far! IF you do-- we can definitely use your help! We\u0027ve already laid down ideas for 9 songs, are writing and recording everyday, working hard to get the music to sound as good as possible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd in the process of doing so are incurring - equipment rental costs, studio costs, gear costs, marketing costs, and merch merch merch costs! We would like to provide you with cool looking merch [t-shirts, picks etc], while we work towards providing you with epic sounding music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve committed our lives to this act and are going to stretch it as far as we possibly can, take it on tour, rehearse it so we can blow you away live and not just with what\u0027s coming through your headphones.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe really want to make something memorable that will, ultimately, last longer than we do. And we need help and support for that, because we are putting all our time and finances into this project. Because not only do we love it, we believe in it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe so appreciate any contribution you are able to make. Seriously. Anything helps as we build this empire. We hope that we can share in all its glory with you, and have you join us on this adventure as we create this other sonic and visual world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we hope that you\u0027ll be able to grow with it as we do, and be there with us to rejoice in all the amazing moments we\u0027ve yet to experience with this team we\u0027re building.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again and again for your support. We love and appreciate you. It means the world to us, and we will personally make you feel that. We love you, thank you for all you do and for having faith in us, as we do in you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrope\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
