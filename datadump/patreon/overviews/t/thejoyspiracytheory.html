Nasty international banks, a handful of families controlling the world economic system for generations, black budgets, mind control programs, social engineering, chemtrails, manufactured wars, media and governmental corruption, NOT TO MENTION NEPHILIM, THE FLAT EARTH, OR INTERDIMENSIONAL BEINGS HARVESTING OUR ORGANS IN ORDER TO CORRUPT OUR GOD GIVEN DNA!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you believe in all of these, none of them, or...you know...something in between, the world can be a very stressful place.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Co-Host of Canary Cry Radio (with my good buddy Gonz) I\u0027ve spent years researching these topics, interviewing experts, and fully immersing \u00a0myself in the stuff.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSURPRISE! It can really start get you down. It only took a couple months before I started becoming\u00a0frustrated, hopeless, and down right\u00a0depressed\u00a0at all the non-sense of this world. Many of you know what I\u0027m talking about!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose of you who listen to the Canary Cry Radio podcast may notice that I\u0027m quite chipper (most of the time.) Well those who have been listening since the beginning know that I wasn\u0027t always that way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt came to a point where I had to make a change. And after years of working through the emotional muck and the mire, I\u0027m ready to start sharing what I\u0027ve learned!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to start a PODCAST channel completely devoted to spreading of Joy that can be found (YES ITS TRUE!) amidst all the nasties of this world. We\u0027re called to be a light in the darkness, so lets get together and let our lights shine!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe project is called \"The Joyspiracy Theory\" \u00a0...need I say more?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo whether you\u0027re a \"Truther,\" a \"seeker,\" a \"conspiracy nut,\" a \"prepper,\" or a \"troll,\" get some rest and respite and a whole lotta joy from \"The Joyspiracy Theory\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo nows the part where I ask for money..... hoooorrraaayyyyy.......\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel very passionate that this sort of project is EXACTLY what our community needs. And I believe that deep down you know it too! Thats right...those dumb ol\u0027 bills gotta get paid. \u00a0But if \"The Joyspiracy Theory\" can garner enough support from people who love it as much as I do, I hope to someday make \"The Joyspiracy Theory\" a full time job/ministry.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please consider helping spread the Joyspiracy!"
