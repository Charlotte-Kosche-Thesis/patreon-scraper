Read below for more details on how Talismonger works.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTalismonger is my attempt to increase the aggregate enchantment in the world by dispersing strange objects of occult and esoteric significance to consenting recipients. I love creating art inspired by the world of magical experience: witchcraft and sorcery, the manipulation of bones and twine, crystals, candles, twists of herbs, the pursuit of visions, blessings, and guiding spirits. The goal of the Talismonger project is to engender a sense of wonder and engagement with these neglected facets of human experience that are potent, intuitive, artistic, and mystical. I believe that tangible possessions can be an important link to the symbolic world, and that the language of magic is the native dream-language of that symbolic world. I hope that by creating connections to that magical realm, I can help inspire a sense of communication with a deeper sense of reality and to encourage others to look at the world and themselves as pregnant with untold possibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/4c98ea1a1a77fe7f6a864bcf640ab154/tumblr_n7okwyJoSF1tethsyo2_500.jpg\" style=\"width: 424px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/d3e714412d0b97a6d0fb11b40b561cc9/tumblr_n7okwyJoSF1tethsyo1_500.jpg\" style=\"width: 424px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe creation of a Solomonic wand\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTalismonger is an ongoing art project begun in 2014 to create original magical artifacts that draw upon traditional occult practice, mythology, and my own work experimenting with the use of esoteric themes in art as an avenue towards healing and understanding. These artifacts may take the form of individual worn jewelry, ink and papyrus sigils from\u00a0ancient\u00a0grimoires, hand-carved wands, rings, swords, bundles of herbs, or stranger things. Each\u00a0artifact is sent to a randomly selected supporter of the project. Usually one large, detailed artifact will be created, but sometimes several small ones will be created in a bunch. In these cases, a number of\u00a0different recipients will be chosen to receive one of these.\u003cbr\u003eAn average of four artifacts (or bundles of smaller artifacts) are created each month, but this number may be higher or lower, depending on the complexity of work involved and the vagaries of an unpredictable universe.\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the dissemination of esoteric gifts, a gallery of the work I\u0027ve done is maintained on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thetalismonger.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTalismonger Tumblr\u003c/a\u003e.

Every level of donation will guarantee an equal chance of receiving an artifact from the Talismonger. There are special rewards for supporting the project at higher levels, but the minimum donation amount is only $1.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIMPORTANT: Pledging $10 does not mean you will be charged $10 per month. If you pledge at $10, each pledge affords you one chance at an artifact. The confirmation page lets you set a cap on how much you want to pledge per month. Since the number of artifacts produced is unpredictable, this system lets you set a minimum charge of $0 (if no artifacts are produced) and a maximum of whatever multiple of your pledge level you choose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonations are used to finance the acquisition of supplies such as wood, ink, paint, incenses, varnishes, strange herbs, bones, old medicine bottles, and anything else a wizard might need to create weird talismans. Additionally, every dollar donated allows me to work more consistently on this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I receive an artifact?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a Supporter!
