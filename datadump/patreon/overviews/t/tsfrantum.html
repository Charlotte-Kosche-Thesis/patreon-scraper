    "summary": "Hey everybody!\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who aren\u0027t familiar with my work, I\u0027m a music journalist based in DFW. I\u0027ve been active since early 2016. I\u0027ve contributed to many local publications, and I love each and everyone of them. However, there are just some things I don\u0027t get to talk about, or there is a stipulation on what I can write about. I want to see to it that there is plenty of coverage of local, national, and international releases, concerts, and artists. In other words, I want to launch a comprehensive music blog that caters to people all over the world. I aim to bring premiere music coverage that is accessible to everyone. It won\u0027t be easy. It\u0027s demanding in both time and money. BUT, with your help, I can stay funded and see to it that I can dedicate all of my time to bringing the best music journalism right to whatever screen you have in front of your face. Anything you can give will make a huge difference, and will see to this project\u0027s success. I can\u0027t thank you enough for your time, and I\u0027m so excited to launch this blog.\u00a0"
