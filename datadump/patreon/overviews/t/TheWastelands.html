If our largest goals are met, there will eventually be \"free\" land that is fully funded by patrons for everyone! \u00a0At the same time we\u0027ll be showing SL that operating estates and hosting communities CAN be done differently.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIdeally, in a perfect world, I could work on The Wastelands full time; and that\u0027s why I\u0027m asking for you to become a patron of mine!
