     "about": "\u003ch2\u003eMichael William Denney\u003c/h2\u003eMichael William Denney is a Practicing Shaman, Author, Teacher, Vedic Astrologer,\u00a0Intuitive Relationship Consultant and Qigong Instructor. He has written 20+ books with more on the way, and he has also produced 35 instructional DVD\u0027s in Qigong, Shamanism, Meditation, Yoga and Mantra. He has also composed, performed and recorded three music CD\u0027s including: Healing Drums of Power, Healing Mantras and Healing Flutes.\u003cbr\u003eMichael currently lives in Manhattan Beach in Southern California where he surfs, writes, and has a thriving practice as an Shamanic consultant.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMr. Denney is also available for Vedic Astrological Readings geared toward Life Path Optimization and creating one\u0027s own personal ritual empowerments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMore About Me...\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been studying, practicing and researching indigenous spiritual disciplines for over 25 years. As a child, I had repeated visionary and shamanic initiation experiences. These experiences were challenging for a young American kid growing up in a protestant Christian environment where such abilities and experiences were not readily accepted. After a turbulent adolescence, I had a powerful spiritual experience calling me to a life of service. At that time, I turned to the only spiritual path I knew which was protestant Christianity. I entered a protestant bible college with the intention of becoming an evangelist. But, never being one to take anything at face value, I diligently scrutinized Christian scripture, practice and dogma. After an extremely challenging and lengthy internal battle wrestling with the inherent inconsistencies within that religion, I chose to abandon Christianity altogether.\u003cbr\u003eThis launched me into a period of darkness, doubt and searching. After a few years of deprogramming myself from the cult-like beliefs of dualist monotheism, I, unwittingly found myself thrust into various, traditional, indigenous, animist spiritual disciplines. A few of those disciplines include: Taoist Mysticism, West African Polytheism, Vedic (East Indian) Mysticism and most recently, the Pre-Christian European Polytheism of my ancestors. What I have found through personal experience is that there is a powerful and fundamental difference between modern religions and indigenous paths that retain an \u003cstrong\u003eunbroken connection into prehistory. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have bolded the above phrase for a very important reason. Up until very recently in the 100,000+ years of human history, all religions from all parts of the globe, including Europe, were originally animist (shamanic) in nature. They focused on practical solutions to human problems. The underlying assumption of these original, animist spiritual paths is that the Cosmos is assumed to be a diverse, nurturing, loving environment and that humans are a venerated and necessary integrated part of a holographic web of Life Force Energy. Life in all of its various forms are seen as expressions of the Cosmos\u0027 desire to learn and grow through experience. The challenges of incarnated life are merely experiential lessons we choose to learn in order to add to the evolution of all Life Force Energy in existence. This view is in sharp contrast to modern, monotheist religions that assume a schism between the physical and spiritual worlds where humans are presumed to be \"sinful\" and must appease a \"jealous\" god who is predisposed to judgement and punishment of humans who are supposedly created in \"His image.\"\u003cbr\u003eI have been authorized to teach others in various indigenous animist disciplines such as Taoist Internal Martial Arts, Qigong and Meditation, Kundalini Yoga and West African Shamanic Drumming. I have researched and studied other indigenous paths whose knowledge I have incorporated into my own teachings.\u003cbr\u003eIn my search to expand awareness of our original shamanic understandings, I have innovated (or if you choose to believe it, transmitted) my own forms of Qigong, Meditation, Energy Work and Shamanic Ritual in my quest to give to others what I yearned for as a young man lost in dualist Western society.\u003cbr\u003eThunder Wizardry is the culmination of all my previous study and experience. It is a modern expression of traditional, shamanic spiritual sciences presented without the trappings of ethnicity and culture while retaining the underlying universally applicable principles from which they all originally grew.\u003cbr\u003eThunder Wizardry is designed to give any modern person the necessary tools to re-awaken their ancestral shamanic connection to a living, breathing, diverse cosmos and allow their inherent, god-like status to shine in this amazing cosmos in which we live.\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "This first milestone will give me the resources to fully implement the first phase of my mission of bringing the knowledge of Syncretic Shamanism to the world. My first goal is to create the most informative, empowering and practical online learning experience possible. \u00a0Once this first objective has been reached, then we can begin creating other forms of Shamanic Education and Experience through group retreats, shamanic \"field\" work and other live events in Thunder Shamanism. Ultimately, my goal is to create an actual physical learning center for Shamanic studies. But, for now, we can focus on our Online Courses in Syncretic Shamanic Studies. Thanks for contributing,\u003cbr\u003eMichael William Denney",
