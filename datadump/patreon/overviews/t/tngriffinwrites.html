    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eWelcome! Thank you so much for visiting my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn spite of the year I insisted on dressing as the American flag for Halloween, no one thought that I - the shy, quiet bookworm - would be interested in politics.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom 2009-2011 I studied technical theatre in college, then dropped out and began working as a freelance journalist, interviewing up-and-coming musicians in Nashville, Tennessee. About that time, I also began watching The Young Turks - and because of this, in April of 2016 I shocked everyone in my life by dropping everything to join a 10 day march from Philly to D.C. to help bring attention to the issue of big money in politics. There, I was given the chance to assist TYT Politics in their coverage of the protests in D.C., and since then, I have continued to cover politics and how they affect every day people. From going undercover at a Trump rally in Nashville, to digging into the mess a corrupt mayor has made of a southern Chicago suburb, to observing the reality behind \"progressive\" conferences, I won\u0027t let anything stop me from speaking truth to power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInspired by the inspired, in January 2018, I founded\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://meridiancreators.com\"\u003eMeridian Creators\u003c/a\u003e. It is an online publication focused on sharing the stories of artists of all mediums who are working to effect real change on the world. I hope to eventually expand Meridian Creators beyond the artists I interview in Middle Tennessee, and be able to hire independent journalists in other cities who will write about artists local to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelping others share their stories is something that has always been a passion of mine.\u003c/strong\u003e Whether it\u0027s creative people who want to share their art and what drives it with a wider audience, or citizens of a community fighting corruption in the government who want the rest of the world to know what is happening, I want to be there to listen and help get the truth out. Moving forward, I will be focusing on reporting on the local community \u0026amp; government in Tennessee, as well as lifting the voices of creative people in the area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you subscribe to my Patreon, you will be able to help me do this on a wider scale.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy only source of income is driving for Uber \u0026amp; Lyft. Being able to pay for my bills in order to keep a roof over my head and food in my stomach means I have to spend most of my time in the car, working. I would love to be able to spend more time on my reporting, holding the local government accountable with independent, on-the-ground, investigative reporting, and supporting local artists by sharing their stories. Having Patrons would grant me more time to do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy contributing to my Patreon, you will be helping me free up time that is necessary for me to focus on growing my new publication \u0026amp; provide more independent, fact-based political coverage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeed a little extra motivation to donate?\u003c/strong\u003e If you become a Patron, you will receive access to exclusive, Patron-only, behind-the-scenes updates and messages from the featured artists, and updates on upcoming investigative reports. While I am motivated to do this, I can\u0027t do it alone - I need and appreciate supporters like you!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only will you be supporting creativity \u0026amp; truth, but you will also be helping to find a cure for Multiple Sclerosis.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/meridian.creators/videos/1625500710901406/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI have pledged\u003c/a\u003e to donate 20% of what I earn in 2018 to the National MS Society. At the end of the year, out of that 20%, 10% will be going to the Mid South Chapter, and 10% will be going to the Gateway Chapter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to grow Meridian Creators\u0027 reach as well as spread Multiple Sclerosis awareness, I am\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/meridian.creators/videos/1625500710901406/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etaking Meridian Creators on tour\u003c/a\u003e starting in September!

Depending on artist response, this will be about a 2-3 month long project that will span more than 3,000 miles!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStay tuned!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ve got more great things coming your way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eQuestions, ideas, story leads, artist introductions, etc.?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Shoot me an email at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:meridiancreators@gmail.com\"\u003emeridiancreators@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e"
