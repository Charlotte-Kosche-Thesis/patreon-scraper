    "summary": "In January of 1993, a 5 year old kid started a journey...\u003cbr\u003e25 July 1997, that kid is now 9 and earns an achievement many want but few obtain.... His black belt.\u003cbr\u003e31 May 2005. That young black belt is now a 3rd Dan and is out of high school. He leaves for Parris Island today.\u003cbr\u003e11 May 2007. That 19 year old Marine graduates Combat Marksmanship Coaches\u0027 Course.\u003cbr\u003e5 September 2008. While serving in the USMC Reserve, the now 21 year old begins bouncing.\u003cbr\u003e11 June 2010, the young black belt is now addressed as \"Master\" by his students, as he just earned his 4th Dan.\u003cbr\u003eJanuary 2012. The young Master is inducted into the Action Martial Arts Magazine Hall of Honors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way there was a lot more.... good and bad. Lessons learned. The past is my story. The training provided by my company is my legacy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the foundation of the training group division of Total Force Holdings, Inc. There is always more than one way to skin a cat. If you can only fight with one tool, you are limiting yourself. The true combatant should be able to seamlessly flow between the use of the empty hand, impact weapons, edged weapons, firearms long and short, conducted energy weapons, chemical irritants, and the use of weapons of opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a short coming, in my eyes, of many systems.... I started this business to address that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe founding of this company was spurred by tragedy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the 8th of December 2011, Moore County Sheriff\u0027s Office Deputy Richard Lee Rhyne was shot and killed by a coward whose name I will not mention. Rick was my friend and a mentor. I was not alone seeing Rick in this light. The Sheriff\u0027s Office Detective that investigated the incident is also a very good friend of mine and provided me a few details of the case to be used for training value. I came to the immediate conclusion that the standard of training provided to Law Enforcement Officers in my home state of North Carolina with regards to the use of firearms and the use of empty hand combatives is not given an adequate amount of time devoted to the subjects, the material used is either overly complex or woefully outdated, and I directly attribute Rick\u0027s death to this fact. I asked myself \"What if there was an opportunity out there for those officers that provided the level of training needed in an easily accessible format?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLocal officers are welcome to train in person with me, free of charge. Those who see this Patreon channel and would like to train face-to-face with me are strongly encouraged to contact me by telephone at (910)466-1506 (Identify yourself and state your purpose when prompted) or email at \"TotalForceCombat@GMail.com\" and we will certainly try to make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst Responders train either for free (if your jurisdiction is in North Carolina) or at reduced rates compared to private citizens. Military trains at reduced rates (I live an hour from the home of Army Special Operations and the entire 82d Airborne Division... If I offered free training to military personnel I\u0027d never make money and despite my desire to help folks out, this IS a business and the general idea of business is \"make money.\") along with private sector security professionals as well."
