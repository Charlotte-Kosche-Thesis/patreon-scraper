     "about": "What\u0027s there to tell really? Truckers FM was born out of an idea that could change the world... but then we woke up from our sleep! Truckers FM came about as a concept in Mid-August of 2015. After much late night brain storming sessions and planning of ideas, we decided that what we could offer the good people of the ETS2MP community the in game radio they deserve. Our aim, our ethos and our mission is to bring together all the things ETS2MP Drivers need to keep themselves trucking throughout Europe and beyond. Bringing you the latest forum stories, up to date traffic reports and as well as that music that puts a smile on your face. Our commitment to the community is further cemented by our offer of FREE VTC/Streaming/Special Event advertising. We\u0027ve no VTC Manager to keep happy, nor do we have our own special Stream to support and promote. We are completely neutral which is what the ETS2MP community really needs to get their VTC/Stream/Special Event out there! Your number 1 Truckers radio, we\u0027re Truckers FM!",
