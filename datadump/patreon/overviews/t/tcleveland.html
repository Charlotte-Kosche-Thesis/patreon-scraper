I\u0027m an Atlanta-based actress, filmmaker, writer \u0026amp; amateur photographer... and I love\u00a0making strange, sweet \u0026amp; silly things (that are sometimes a little sad and/or scary).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here to connect \u0026amp; create.\u00a0Please engage with me if you are moved to do so, and if you like what I\u0027m sharing, please consider becoming a patron at any amount. My perks start at $1 and include things like exclusive updates on projects, personal haikus written for you, credits on film projects (which will go on IMDb) and more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow, you\u0027ll find a bunch more info on what inspired this page, my commitment \u0026amp; vision moving forward, etc.\u00a0I LOVE interacting with friends \u0026amp; fans, so please reach out. I want to hear from you, especially if you have ideas for perks that you\u0027d like to see (The ones I posted are based on other pages \u0026amp; past requests from fans, so I\u0027m totally open to new suggestions).\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Creative Background \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve\nbeen creating various forms of art since I was a child.\nThis has spanned a wide spectrum, from working with clay \u0026amp;\ncrayons to spoken word to singing, acting, film producing,\netc. Whatever the medium, being creative is the one thing that I\u0027ve never been able to stop doing. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Vision: Filmmaking\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne\nof my greatest goals\nis to make films that reach large audiences. For years, I assumed that I\u0027d\nbecome a successful actor first, and use the money and connections\nfrom that to ease into directing, and producing a la Ron Howard, Angelina Jolie and others. I\u0027ve now come to realize that I can\u0027t sit\naround and\nwait for my acting career to hand\nme the reins. In this digital age, there\u0027s very little excuse for not making my own\nmovies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8\nyears ago, I produced my first shoestring-budget feature film, called \"Hollywood and Vine,\" from\nconcept to festivals\nto\ndistribution. 5 years ago, I produced my first no-budget\nshort, \"No Words,\" which\nI wrote \u0026amp; directed. It was also shown at festivals and received distribution. After producing 2 feature-length movies and 4 shorts, I\u0027m starting to get a knack\nfor how\nto nurture\na story and\nget it to the point where it is ready to share with the world... and\nI want to keep doing it.\nBigger and better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve already started sharing information about past \u0026amp; present film projects on my activity feed, so look there to see examples of my work and what\u0027s to come!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePics\n\u0026amp; Poems\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo art forms that I\u0027ve loved and created since quite a young age are photography and poetry. I don\u0027t remember how young I was when I got my first dinky little plastic camera, but I remember that the film looked like the telephone receivers of the time, and that I had to mail it in to get it developed... and I started writing poems almost as soon as I could write! I\u0027ve had visions of putting together a book or books of these creations. Yet, I\u0027ve shared my photography \u0026amp; poetry very little with the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuccessful\nartists of all disciplines will advise less-successful artists: create. Create\nmore. Keep creating. Keep creating more!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, it\u0027s not always easy to figure out how to find time to create when we have to feed ourselves, right? This\nis why Patreon is brilliant! A platform to share various forms of art\nwith the public. A\nway to\nbe seen and supported. A chance for artists to earn\na living\nfrom their art, without agents and publishers and other people that want you to fit their mold, and want to take a big piece of the pie. This\ncould be the answer \u2013 or at least part of the answer. At least it\u0027s\na place to begin, and I\u0027m happy to be a part of the experiment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy\nCommitment\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn\norder to offer my creations to the world on a regular basis and train\nmyself to create with commitment and discipline, I committed to\nsharing a picture and a poem every day for the first month of my\ncampaign. The only exception was if I found myself in an\nunforeseen situation where it was too difficult to do so. On December 10th, I finished that month. It was a great learning experience, and I took some time off to think about what I want to create next - it will likely be a new time/creation-related commitment, and it will be made before the end of the month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, I will keep working on my films/video projects \u0026amp; nurturing the performing career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Needed Now\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually,\nI may need a fancy office for taking meetings and millions of dollars to\nfund my films... but for now I\u0027ve got the\ntools\nto begin the process; I just\nneed the basics covered to start. I\u0027ve got writing \u0026amp; editing software. I\u0027ve\ngot colleagues with equipment \u0026amp; talent... and we want to create. I believe that the\nbigger \u201cstuff\u201d will come\nnaturally, once the creative flow is consistent. We\u0027ll cross those\nbridges when it\u0027s\ntime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what ARE the basics? Realistically. Well... everything helps, truly. $1000/mo would make a huge difference, allowing me to focus a significant amount of time on my filmmaking. $2000/mo would give me the ability to focus solely on creating, which of course is my main goal at this time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMoving\nForward\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the first month, I\u0027ll assess feedback and see what seems to work best for all. At some point, I may change to a per-post campaign. If so, I\u0027ll be in communication beforehand in case anyone needs to change their pledge. And remember, you can always have a safety net by putting a monthly cap on your pledge amounts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatrons Are Fairy God-angel-saints!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate hope is that I can keep\ncreating\nand that my art can bring something beautiful into the world. After\nmany years of straddling that fine line between supporting myself and keeping the art\nflowing, this presents itself as a potential dream come true. Thank\nyou and bless you for considering becoming a patron of my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany great minds, including Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, have agreed that art is the\nhighest form of human creation... and that storytelling is essential\nto what it means to be human. Those of\nyou who\nfund the arts, who support the storytellers and make it possible for\nus to thrive in a society that sometimes forgets our importance, are saints in my book. Or at very least, angels. Fairy Godmothers?\nYou\ncan choose what you want to be called. If I have my say, though,\nthere\u0027s a special seat reserved for you on the unicorn ride to heaven.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn creativity,\u003cbr\u003eT Cleveland"
