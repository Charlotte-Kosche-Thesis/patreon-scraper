As I like to say on the show, \"The love train is moving\nforward at full speed!\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition to my writing at places like Salon and AlterNet I\nwould like to be able to grow the podcast even more. As we approach episode\n200, we have something very special with The Chauncey DeVega Show and it is\ntime to take the next step. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help to do this.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming part of the Patreon family here at The Chauncey DeVega Show you will gain access to additional podcasts and other audio each month, my newsletter, and other exclusives. Your patronage will also also allow me to hire an audio editor and make the video podcast a reality as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe Chauncey DeVega Show will always remain free. Because\nof your help I hope to always be able to say \"no\" to the various\nadvertisers who approach me to run commercials during the podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you in advance. Board the love train, get a drink at\nthe virtual bar and salon, and let\u0027s defeat Donald Trump and the Republican\nParty\u0027s horde of befouled CHUDS and other assorted sycophants and cult members\ntogether. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n--Chauncey \u003cbr\u003e"
