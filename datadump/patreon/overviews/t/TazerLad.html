I\u0027ve been making content in some form now since I was in Middle School. I\u0027ve dabbled in just about everything, but it wasn\u0027t until I tried Let\u0027s Playing that I actually \u0027tried\u0027 at YouTube so to speak. I put in the work but it burnt me out and this was at the time when a new gaming channel was sprouting up every minute. So then I stopped YouTube for a while, focusing on myself, but gradually I was pulled back in. I decided to try and make shorter video-essays based on Geeky content. That was the biggest pivot, but I\u0027ve loved every minute of making these videos. And that love only increased once I dove head first into Anime this past year. It\u0027d always been a passing interest but after watching My Hero Academia, something just... I don\u0027t know changed. Now the majority of my content is based around the medium, and I\u0027ve started gaining some traction. I don\u0027t know where this all will go, but this journey has been fun and exciting. I\u0027d love to have this passion be my living someday. So that\u0027s where you come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am still, by all means, a small channel, but hey, everyone\u0027s gotta start somewhere. And ad revenue on YouTube is anything but consistent and for a channel my size, that might mean getting $1 for one video, and 20 cents for another with a similar view count.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWhat Does this Mean Content-Wise?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst and foremost, I will not be locking any content behind a paywall. All videos will still be put up on the channel. At most what this means is Patreon supporters may get videos a little early. If you don\u0027t support me then you won\u0027t notice any difference in my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWhy Support Me?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eI hope you\u0027ll support me because you enjoy the content I have to offer. But if you don\u0027t want to or can\u0027t support me here, I completely\u00a0understand. Just you watching my content, liking it, commenting, subscribing or whatever else you do is already enough. You guys are the only reason I am even able to consider making this in the first place. It means the world to me that you enjoy my videos and take time out of your day to watch them. This Patreon is for those who want to and can help me take my next step in this wild YouTube journey.\u00a0\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
