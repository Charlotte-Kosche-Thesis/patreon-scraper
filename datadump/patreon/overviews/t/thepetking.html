    "summary": "Hi everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Amy, translator of the\nnovel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.webnovel.com/book/7961097205002405\"\u003ePet King\u003c/a\u003e. Hopefully, if you are reading\nthis, it means that you would like to support me in completing my current\nproject.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, I would like to thank all the readers for your support of\nNyoi-Bo Studio and my translations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe have read a lot of novels about elves\uff0cbut seldom about pet elves in China. This book does not grab our attention at the first sight\uff0cbut since we are also true love fans of \u300cPokeman Go\uff01\u300d\uff0cwe kept reading and found it became more and more interesting. That\u0027s why we decided to tranlate it and share it with you. Hope you would also love it. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eAbout Nyoi-Bo Studio:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNyoi-Bo Studio was founded by two passionate fans of Chinese web\nnovels and Japanese/Chinese animation \u0026amp; games. In the past four and half\nyears, they have read more than 150 books, or about 600 million words. Now they\nthink it is the right time to introduce those excellent web novels to overseas\nfans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eIn the spirit of Nyoi-Bo:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuality translation is a\nmust at Nyoi-Bo, but in fact it is extremely time consuming. A chapter\nconsisting of2,000-4,000 Chinese characters takes a translator\naround 1.5 to 3.5 hours.The translator must convey the\nproper tone and meaning of the original in a style that is natural for readers\nin their own language, so non-mandarin-speaking readers can enjoy novels that\nare as close as possible to what the author is trying to portray. As\nlong-time fans, Nyoi-Bo translators totally understand the great effort the\nauthors put into every novel, and we want to do the same as we deliver precise,\nquality translations of the novels to our readers.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003eThe best\ntranslations show our respect to both authors and readers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here it is, my Patron\npage. Any pledge amount would serve as an additional form of motivation and be\ndeeply appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, and Happy Reading!\u003cbr\u003e"
