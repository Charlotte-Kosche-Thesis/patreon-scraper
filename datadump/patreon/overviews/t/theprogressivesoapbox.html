    "summary": "This channel is an honest analysis of news, culture, and history with a progressive view point. I started this out of annoyance with how news is explained, how the parties are scamming their voters, how the actual issues and problems in society are ignored in favor of trivial pursuits. This channel is to cut through the bunk, giving analysis and viewpoint that can be interrogated by the viewer. You can look over my content to determine if any particular perspective loses consistency, and I explain in enough detail for the viewer to understand the cognitive steps I take to reach a conclusion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy allegiance is to integrity. I have no party loyalities or entanglements that typically corrupt people\u0027s lens. I won\u0027t always be right, but I will always be earnest about whatever we\u0027re discussing."
