All of a sudden, we could turn our friends, near and far, into tasty piles of gibs. Playing games in realtime with people from other countries became feasible. Crafting fully 3D worlds, limited only by our imagination (and at the time, r_speeds) launched hundreds of amateurs into professional game development. These were more than just games - they were the cornerstones of the gaming industry we know today. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd today, players around the world are still kicking ass. We\u0027re here to celebrate all of them. At Tastyspleen.tv, we turn our eyes to the people who have kept things going for so long, and make sure that everyone knows just how awesome they are. From free-for-all events to duel tournaments, from mapping competitions to mod releases, Quake and it\u0027s family have so much to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd with your help, so do we.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/KUC5IPL.png?1\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst launched in 2009 (which looked like this, seriously), Tastyspleen.tv has aimed to provide more content for more games, to help bridge the gaps in the communities. This is important, as there are several FPS projects in development \nright now, and the competitive scene for them is growing quickly. \nThere\u0027s more to cover now than ever, and we can\u0027t wait to kick things \ninto high gear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of our spending activity will be recorded on https://twitter.com/tstv_patreon, so you\u0027ll always be aware of where your contribution is going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat sort of things will this contribution support?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGlad you asked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTournaments, hosted by Tastyspleentv. Focused on the NA scene. Bigger prizes than ever before.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eContent shows, focusing on FPS development, game reviews, and level design.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLAN event coverage, such as FadeCon.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore regularly scheduled community events, such as Fragfests and King of the Hill.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdequate man/womanpower to make sure every game is getting the attention it needs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThere\u0027s obviously a lot more that could be thrown into the mix, but you know us, and you know what you want. So let\u0027s make it happen.\u003cbr\u003e",
