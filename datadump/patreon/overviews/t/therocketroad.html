For those who don\u0027t keep in touch with me too often, this is a chance to see what I do for a living, and even be a part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a project that I started long ago, and is something that I recently started up again with my sister, due to her budding interest in me showing her how to writing songs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe name is one that I stumbled upon; it\u0027s actually one that I stumbled upon while going back and forth from San Diego to Los Angeles while starting the studio that I currently work at. There was a street \u003cem\u003eliterally called Rocket Road\u003c/em\u003e, which was the entrance to the company building of SpaceX, which totally captured my imagination. I thought it fitting to pick it back up, since my sister is \u00a0an electrical engineer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money to this subscription will go to us funding this journey, and will include Awesome rewards, including a peek into the process of writing and creating the songs, as well as early exclusive downloads to demos of the songs, to even being a part of the creative process, and even an Executive Producer Credit on the Album and more, for the higher tier contributors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome with us on this Awesome Journey!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
