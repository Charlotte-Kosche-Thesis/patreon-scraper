    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon Community! \u00a0The fact that you\u0027re here is evidence your aware of the time and effort that goes into making videos for the Model Railroading Community. This place is for those of you who want to join my effort with what I\u2019m doing in ways that allow me to create more valuable information to help you build your skills and learn new techniques. Thank you for taking the time to join me in my endeavor to help other modelers in need of guidance in pursuit of their dream of building a model railroad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat Is Patreon?\u003c/h3\u003eIf you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, the concept is that you support a creator financially for each piece of valuable content they create for you. In my case, it\u0027s videos about Model Railroading, editing your work, and advancing your creativity on YouTube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in this concept with all my heart. It\u0027s helping modelers (like you and me both!) bring more value to the community by making it financially sustainable long-term. Please consider joining my community with a dollar (or however much you like) per video that I create. \u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t forget, you can always put a limit on what you spend each month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow Does It Work?\u003c/h3\u003eEvery month I publish Informational\u00a0\u00a0Videos to Toms Trains And Things YouTube Channel. Each time I do so, I share those videos here and mark it as a piece of content that you\u0027re supporting. The number of Videos I publish that month determines how much you contribute.\u003cstrong\u003e Shout Out Monday Evening and other non-instructional Videos will not count toward the Supported Videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor Example,\u003cstrong\u003e if you pledge $1 per Video and I publish 8 Videos that month, you will contribute $8 for that month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027re concerned about going over your budget,\u003c/strong\u003e you can easily set a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly contribution limit \u003c/strong\u003ewhen you\u0027re entering your payment info. That way there\u0027s no surprises at the end of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t worry about missing out on any content either. You will still continue to get my Videos even if I publish additional Videos that go beyond your maximum contribution limit for the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho Is This For?\u003c/h3\u003eIf you are new to Model Railroading, or had your inventory of Model Railroading wares packed away and are thinking about starting again. You\u0027ve come to the right place. Maybe, you\u00a0already unpacked your\u00a0equipment and want to catch up on what you\u0027ve been missing out on for years. This Place Is For You., to build your skills, learn new techniques, build your dream, and have fun while your building your Model Railroad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to Model Railroading Videos I also publish Help Videos concerning YouTube and Audio/Video Editing. Many modelers have YouTube channels where they share their videos of their creations and need help with editing their creation and needing a boost with information about YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started producing a video series called \"Model Railroading For Beginners\" \u00a0just for you. There are many other related videos covering a number of topics beneficial to the beginner and advanced modelers alike, such as \"At The Work Bench\" where I show the modeler how I perform various tasks in detail. \"How It\u0027s Done\" where you will see specific tasks common to all scales and level of expertise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere Does My Money Go?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://tomstrainsandthings.com/wp-content/gallery/behind-the-scenes/20160930_171107.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables me to invest into producing free YouTube videos for the Model Railroading Community who have a desire for the knowledge I provide through these videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, it takes time and resources to create content, both which require money. Your support lets me focus on making the most valuable content for you that I possibly can instead of spending valuable time focusing on the financial side of how to deliver it to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see from the equipment I\u0027m using to produce these videos, this is not a high tech operation with expensive gear. Still, your contribution is needed to upgrade aging devices long overdue for replacement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t do all this alone. Join my effort to continue producing valuable informational videos and I will provide you with additional content in My Patreon Community so we all can have fun doing what we love to do. Model Railroading!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see on the left are my goals. Once I reach a goal, I will set new goals to provide you with more valuable content in MY Patreon Community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the right are the tier groups of this community. As the value of your contribution increases, so will the perks that go along with each tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for believing in me and my cause. Without you joining me in this endevor, I would not be able to continue providing quality content as I expect to provide for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e"

Most of my videos are targeted for the beginner and those who have been away from the hobby for years, like I have.",
