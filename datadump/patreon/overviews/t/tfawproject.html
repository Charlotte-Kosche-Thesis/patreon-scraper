Be Filipino. Know your history. Speak Filipino. Know your family roots. Don\u2019t ask questions. Visit the Philippines more often. Lighten my skin. Lose weight. Get a stable job. \u2026On and on and on. All of these kind, good intentioned suggestions and not once was I told, \u2018Just be who you are. You are enough,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWith The Filipino American Woman Project, we celebrate the Filipino American women as they already are. Our underlying message is: You are enough, and we want to celebrate you by sharing your story.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe started The Filipino American Woman Project last year through her online marketing agency, Social Turtles, and uses Facebook Live to broadcast the show with interviews featuring other women who identify as Filipino and American. After looking online to learn more about the history of women like her, who came before her, and coming up mostly empty, she decided to have women speak for themselves on what it means to be part of this community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmos, 29, lives in downtown San Diego with her fianc\u00e9 and their rescue dog, and is the founder and host of the project, and founder and executive director of her online marketing agency. She took some time to talk about her inspiration for the project, what she hopes people inside and outside of her community can learn from the stories women are sharing, and what it\u2019s taught her about herself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e Tell us about The Filipino American Woman Project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e It was inspired by my personal experiences as an American woman of Filipino descent, and it stemmed from a deep desire to collect stories of those that identify the same way, to have these stories for generations to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e What led to the creation of a project to tell the stories of Filipino American women?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Since middle school, I have battled against being a self-loathing Filipino American woman. Within my own community, I grew up with traumatic experiences of my father\u2019s sudden disappearance, bullying, emotional and financial abuse, and child molestation. In college, I decided to explore beyond my childhood experiences by getting involved with San Diego State University\u2019s Filipino organization. Throughout my post-college years and young adult experiences, I would occasionally get involved with other Filipino-related community events and organizations. Yet, despite my experiences, I still felt like something was missing. It was then I realized that what I needed wasn\u2019t external, but internal. Thus, The Filipino American Woman Project was born.\u003cbr\u003eFrom my personal experience and observations \u2014 and I emphasize \u201cpersonal\u201d experience because I do not want my story to be a blanket description for my whole community \u2014 Filipino American women (and Filipino women for that matter) are very humble about their work ethic, resilience, history and service to others. So much so, that we\u2019ll do more than we can handle because we don\u2019t always know how to communicate when enough is enough. I personally grew up discouraged to speak up or communicate my feelings, especially when I was overwhelmed. I was told that I was weak, complaining or challenging authority. With this project \u2026 rather than having a book, a scholar, an organization, a loved one or anyone else speak on our behalf, we\u2019re putting Filipino American women themselves front and center, to share what being a Filipino American woman means to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e Why was this something you wanted to do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e I have found that storytelling is the most powerful and effective way of connecting with others. In understanding our similarities and differences, we may hopefully find a common ground of community, support and collaboration. There are numerous times where I have felt more connected with someone because I was moved by their story or they were moved by mine. Now that we\u2019ve created a platform for Filipino American women to do the same, it\u2019s my hope that at least one more person can feel connected, whether it\u2019s the influence of a woman sharing her story or the influence of women listening to her. Stories connect. And when we\u2019re connected, I believe that we\u2019re empowered to embrace the beauty that\u2019s within ourselves and with each other.\u003cbr\u003eAs this passion project grows, I, too, am learning to embrace my own story in a broader perspective; to realize that my own sad stories don\u2019t define me. I am the author of my life, and I can write a more positive future for myself that doesn\u2019t have to include abandonment or abuse. If I can do the same for even one person or facilitate a space for other women to affect one more person in a positive way, then I am glad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat I love about downtown San Diego...\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy little family and I love spending a lot of time together. So we love how \u003ca\u003eDowntown\u003c/a\u003eSan Diego is a dog-friendly neighborhood.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e How does the project function?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e I first started promoting it through Facebook groups and our responses were almost immediate. What I find most beautiful about these insights is that they are all organic. Filipino American women have approached me and encouraged their friends to share their stories, too. When friends see their friends being interviewed live, they are inspired to do the same. Depending on their location or preference, we interview them in person or online, and all of the stories are available on our Facebook page (\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/thefilipinoamericanwoman/videos/\"\u003ehttp://facebook.com/thefilipinoamericanwoman/videos/\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e Why is it important to you to tell stories about Filipino American women, specifically?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e It\u2019s the Filipino American women stories that I\u2019m most curious about because I know so little about them. I never knew my grandmother\u0027s stories from either my mother or father\u2019s side. I am still learning about my mother\u2019s story. I have learned about Filipino and Filipino American culture as a whole, while I was in college. But what about the Filipino American woman? In general, I have no convenient access to stories of women like me. My fiance, who\u2019s Caucasian, knows American history very well. One, because it\u2019s taught in our American school system. Two, it was essential for his career in the military. Three, he just loves history! He has the luxury of being able to research his American history through the Internet, libraries, the plethora of American-based documentaries, in popular culture, and so many other places with ease. For a Filipino American woman such as myself, learning about my history is not as easily accessible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e What do you hope this project does for other Filipino American women?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e I hope that this project will influence them to celebrate themselves and each other for the amazing women that they are today. For any Filipino American woman that feels misrepresented, I hope that this influences her to share her story. As long as a women living in America is of Filipino descent, our project has a platform for her to share her story. I also hope that the strength and skills we find in storytelling will translate into our professional lives and whatever endeavors we choose to pursue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e How do you think seeing these stories about each other will provide strength?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e I believe that hearing and engaging with stories on a consistent basis will make us stronger communicators, and having better communication skills is an opportunity to make healthier connections. On a more personal level, I feel like these stories provide me with the strength to honor my parents\u2019 story of immigration, how they left behind all that they knew in the Philippines to give us more opportunities and options to succeed in America. Now, I admit that the majority of my life being a daughter to immigrant parents wasn\u2019t easy, but today I see that it was all worth it. More than ever, I honor my parents\u2019 sacrifices, resilience, and courage. I\u2019m especially learning to honor my mother more, who became a widow with three children under 11 years old to care for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e What\u2019s been challenging about your work with The Filipino American Woman Project?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Mainly taking care of myself as a dark-skinned, female minority who\u2019s had a long history of being a self-loathing Filipino American woman. It sounds self-centered, but for my close friends and loved ones who know me, I have a strong tendency to put myself last. This passion project is a personal declaration to care for myself first, so in turn, I can better serve others. Secondly, I have to remind myself on a daily basis to practice interdependence, rather than falling into the extreme ends individualism or collectivism. This project is meant to serve as a community for others, but I can\u2019t forget that it should also serve me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e What\u2019s been rewarding about that work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Knowing that I\u2019ll never not be a Filipino American woman. It\u2019s exciting to know that I have a lifetime to work on this potentially, ever-evolving project and grow with the community that may come because of it. I also find that the feedback of Filipino American women is incredibly rewarding. In the few short months we started this project, I have had countless women thank me for doing this. It touches my heart and motivates me every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e What has it taught you about yourself?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u2019m beautiful just the way that I am. I am always enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e What is the best advice you\u2019ve ever received?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e My favorite Bible verse, Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 (about how \u201cThere is a time for everything...\u201d). This verse reminds me that I have many versions, evolutions, and seasons of myself to look forward to throughout my lifetime. It\u2019s exciting. It reassures me that I\u2019m always at the right place at the right time because God has a plan for everything in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e What is one thing people would be surprised to find out about you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e That I was born in Yokosuka, Japan, but I am not Japanese, nor do I speak Japanese. I was born on American soil on a U.S. Navy base. Therefore, I am an American.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e Describe your ideal San Diego weekend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e A nice day at home or a nice day out with my fiance and our dog is enough for me.
