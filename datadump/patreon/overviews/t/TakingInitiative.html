    "summary": "Sometimes a group of people get together and make an idea that changes the world. And sometimes they get together and decide to record themselves playing Dungeons and Dragons. This is one of those times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTaking Initiative is an actual play podcast that leans heavily towards being an audio drama made by a group of goofs that range from veteran players to first-timers. Currently we have our fangs sunk into the Curse of Strahd module by Wizards of the Coast and a healthy splash of homebrew to keep things spicy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe initial idea to make a podcast was just something that we tossed around and then suddenly, due to a series of events, quickly became something real. And from the moment that the first episode went live, back at the beginning of 2017, we have dedicated ourselves to make the best play through of this module that you have ever heard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron of Taking Initiative will help us grow and become even better. It will allow us to buy better equipment, set up better recording spaces, put out more content, and support The Spark Network (\u003ca href=\"https://www.thespark.network/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethespark.network\u003c/a\u003e) as we grow."
