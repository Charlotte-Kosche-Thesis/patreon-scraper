I\nwas so shocked to see so many neglected, injured, starving and sick street dogs\nat every street corner. I couldn\u0027t believe it. I wanted to end their suffering,\nI wanted to do something, I wanted to be the voice for them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLast year (2017) my two dogs, Molly and Henry died from ill\nhealth. The pain of losing my own dogs made me realise that I just had to work\nwith animals in a HUGE way, not just part time, it had to become my mission in\nlife. I wanted to help as many neglected + sick dogs, help them get back to\nhealth and get them their forever homes as these dogs don\u2019t receive the\nbeautiful life my Molly and Henry had. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI poured my heart in to the Phuket Government Dog Pound. I\nhave never seen so many dogs in one place suffering. It was like a death camp.\nThey were suffering from painful diseases, life \u2013 threatening injuries + then die\nof horrible deaths. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn a typical day I do; basic vet care, treating injuries, medicating, feeding,\nsocialising, cleaning runs, bathing, grooming, finding foster homes + forever\nhomes and certainly not least of all, raising awareness of these dogs plights.\nAnd that\u2019s no small feat, yet to see people who I like to believe have a\nnaturally altruistic nature, respond and help, step up and open their hearts\nand home is what truly makes the daily heartbreak, exhaustion and anxious\nmoments worthwhile.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have been supporting myself\nfinancially through my self-employed work whilst at the same time volunteering\nfull time at the Government Dog Pound. But working two jobs and 12-15hr days\nlike this is not sustainable. In order for me to focus more time + energy on\nthe dogs and keep my health, that is why I have used Patreon as my platform\u00a0to provide me with the funds so that I can continue my work helping these Sick,\nAbused + Neglected Street Dogs.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour help and support via sponsorship allows me to continue helping and\nsupporting those most in need. I believe $1200 per month will enable this\nmission to be continued and to do more. I reach out to you in the earnest hope\nthat my work, my passion + my vision for a better future for these suffering\nstreet dogs encourages you to act and say yes to sponsorship. Please know all\nassociated costs are bare minimum and it is your sponsorship that allows me to\ncontinue this work. I am also setting up a small dog sanctuary, a holding place\nfor 10-15 dogs, where the dogs will have a clean, calm + safe space to be\nrehabilitated, walked, fed + socialised in preparation for their imminent\nadoptions. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere are the things already\nachieved, imagine if I have more time, what would be possible?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe now get a vet coming one morning per week\n(before there was no one)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eMedical supplies from Soi Dog Foundation\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eLess dogs dying (before 5-15 dogs die everyday,\nnow average 5 a week from disease and fighting)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eRaising awareness in a big way\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eRegular Donations from supporters for food,\ntoys, cleaning equipment + products and small shelters inside the runs for dogs\nto get out of the rain\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eNearly 100 dogs adopted in the space of 6 months\n(with the help of Soi Dog Foundation)\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eEveryday we have an extra 1-3 people\nvolunteering\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eSoi Dog Foundation helped with maintenance\n(fixing gates, making sure the runs are secure) \n\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eThe Government Dog Pound raised money for\nconcrete floors in 2 runs and tiled floors in the clinic runs for sick dogs\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eCurrently we are sorting the water system to be hygienic\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\nPlease contact me for further information of what the sponsorship entails,\ndetails relating and any questions you have.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWould you like to help me with this mission? \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading this and supporting me on this journey."
