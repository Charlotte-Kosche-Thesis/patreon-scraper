    "summary": "The Board Podcast started as an idea that the Mechanical Keyboard Community would be interested in having a regular source of entertainment, talking about the news, interesting developments, and of course, the drama that happens about Mechanical Keyboards. Here we are, a year on and still going, delivering weekly (mostly) podcasts to shoot the breeze, sometimes guests, and just talk Mechanical Keyboards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts been a great journey so far, one that has to be acknowledged to be because of you guys, our listeners, fans, supporters, donators, who have helped fund our podcasting hosting costs, who have sent us cool things to review, who have come onto the show to talk, expand our horizons all about Mechanical Keyboards. \u00a0We\u0027ve had a great time so far, and we\u0027d like to continue to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve come to Patreon to look at how we can offer something back to the community further, by having funding to go towards better goodies for giveaways, upgrading our audio gear, and possibly long term, being able to fly someone out to another country to come along to meetups! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, even without any additional funding, we\u0027re still going to be making content, still going to be podcasting and YouTubing, because that is what we love to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want all of our content to be available to everyone, and to this, we\u0027re not going to have \u0027paid for\u0027 content, and \u0027delay release\u0027 content, so hopefully our reward tiers will reflect only \u0027extras\u0027 that in no shape or form will affect your ability to reach our content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, once again, thank you for hanging out with us, spending your time listening, watching, hopefully enjoying us talk everything and anything about Mechanical Keyboards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve never been over and checked out any of our podcasts, you can find them there at \u003ca href=\"http://www.theboardpodcast.com\"\u003ehttp://www.theboardpodcast.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil next time, Happy Clacking :)"
