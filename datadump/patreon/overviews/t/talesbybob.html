    "summary": "Hey there! I am Bob, of Tales by Bob, and I appreciate you taking the time to give me a look. I am an odd little author from the deep south gradually working towards being able to practice my craft for a living, and I am hoping you fine people can help me get there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing seriously since late 2012, when I decided to make a go of following my passion in hopes of making it my career. Since then I have written dozens of stories and hundreds of thousands of words, all in a number of different genres. The bulk has been in horror, but I also enjoy writing fantasy, steampunk, and southern gothic. I have had bits from each of those genres published in a variety of anthologies and lit journals, which has given me the (hopefully not too erroneous belief) that I can do this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking hard I have gotten rid of all debt (except student loans) and my bills down to an amount that with a little help and a small book deal I could quit my job and write full time. I likely wouldn\u0027t until a second book deal came through, but still, you get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what will you get for becoming my patron? A number of things! You will get access to the behind the scenes work that I deal with, such as acceptance and rejection letters, agent pitches, that sort of stuff. I will also be putting up a flash fiction monthly for your enjoyment. Also, as I create worlds for most of my fiction, I will be putting up background material for these worlds for you to peruse, be it mythologies, histories, folk legends, or bestiaries. I may even post \u0027deleted scenes\u0027 or rough drafts of stories I am working on. I will also be doing Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s on here, as well as potentially doing skype or the like conversations! For higher teirs there will be thanks on my website and potentially in books, as well as getting to offer names for use in stories. I might even write you something custom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve gotten this far, so thank you for that! I hope you will take a bit further plunge and decide to sponsor me! If not, go with my thanks for your time if nothing else! Cheers!\u003cbr\u003e"
