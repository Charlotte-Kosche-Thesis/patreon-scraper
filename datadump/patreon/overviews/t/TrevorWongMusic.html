I can\u0027t thank you guys enough!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t know what I\u0027m about then here\u0027s the jist: I\u0027m a guitarist and drummer from Canada who plays in several math rock groups (Polarhorse, Either/Or, and Zoo Strategies). I make detailed and fun weekly tutorial videos on music theory and math rock. These videos are a passion project of mine and I love having the opportunity to share the wisdom and knowledge I\u0027ve learned to people on the internet. Making these videos is one of the most rewarding things I\u0027ve gotten to do over the past couple of years and I\u0027ve learned a lot along the way. But, with such a dedication to this project, it has also taught me a simple truth; they are very time consuming to put together. As a student trying to pay my way through college, putting together guitar tutorials can be a great strain on my existence. This is where you guys can step in to make a huge difference in my life ---\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, making these videos can be a more productive task for me in the greater scheme of things. By having an additional source of income, this allows me to justify spending so much time making tutorials, and hell, it would be sweet to have this somehow become a career. Not only that, but your support also directly helps to improve the quality of content on the channel. For example, right now I don\u0027t even have a computer that I can use to actually edit videos at home. I\u0027m forced to edit at the local university right now. With your patronage, hopefully all of this can one day become a thing of the past!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, I hope to see you guys in a future YouTube video or somewhere on the net!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove, Trevor\u003cbr\u003e"

I have zero budget, but I have a good DIY ethos and this alone has led to the production of numerous self-produced bedroom music videos and comedy films. I\u0027m looking to push myself to the next level but the only way to do so is through a bit of financial aid. With support, I\u0027m looking to expand the production aspect of my content (i.e cameras that aren\u0027t just my cellphone, real microphones for audio, etc) so that I can make films which accurately portray my talents. Thanks for reading this if you\u0027ve made it this far!",
