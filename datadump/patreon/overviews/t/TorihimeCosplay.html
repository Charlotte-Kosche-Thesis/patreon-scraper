Anyway, I\u0027m Torihime Cosplay, and I\u0027ve decided to make a Patreon account to allow fans to donate to my efforts, because I think everyone could use some assistance, and I\u0027m no exception! With college, a part-time job, and very important people to take care of, I don\u0027t make the most money. I spare what I can towards cosplay, but I always wish I could do more. With your help, who knows what else I can do! Thank you so much for your time and donation. I appreciate it more than I could ever express!\u003cbr\u003e",
