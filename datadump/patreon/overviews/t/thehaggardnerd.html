TheHaggardNerd here and welcome to my Patreon page! \u00a0I love making videos and creating great content to share with the YouTube community. \u00a0This is my chance to dig deeper into the world of games and film and here\u0027s where I need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just a normal guy working a 9-5 job that has been given a chance to actually do something he enjoys: working on film projects and making gaming videos. \u00a0Right now, my channel is small, but it really does have the chance to grow much larger! \u00a0With your help, not only could I possibly buy another computer to render on and get a better camera to make higher quality videos, but this also opens up the opportunity that I might eventually be able make videos full time! \u00a0That means I could spend a full 40 or more hours a week working on video stuff. If you like my content, then this would be a win-win for both of us, now wouldn\u0027t it. :-P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are on Patreon. \u00a0A mere stepping stone into the awesome possibility that is this channel\u0027s future. You aren\u0027t obligated to donate anything, but just know that if you do, you have my deepest gratitude and also you have the knowledge that you are supporting a creator that wants nothing but the best for his community. Thank you so much. \u0026lt;3"
