I am a music professional in NYC: I work in cover bands,\n I sub a little on Broadway, do the occasional teaching gig, play on \nsome jingles, lots of other sessions and some church gigs.

Here are some of the ways we want to expand:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelease episodes more frequently. \u003c/strong\u003e How about twice a week?  3x?  There are plenty of players out there, but to do this will take substantial listener support.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHire a professional producer and editor\u003c/strong\u003e to improve the quality of the show.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTravel to visit musicians in other places. \u003c/strong\u003e\n You know you\u2019re everywhere.

But do you want to deal with ads?  Do you enjoy listening\n to them? We\u0027re not against having ads on the show, but if we start \ntaking ads then we\u2019ll have to tailor the content in order to please the \nadvertisers. For now we\u2019d rather keep our focus on serving hardworking \nmusicians\u2019 interests, many of which have been sidelined (to say the \nleast) by the prevalence of the ad model.  If you agree with us on this,\n then you must chip in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"How much time goes into producing each episode?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore\n than you think, and more than might seem reasonable.  We want to make \nit as good as possible, so we spend the time.  It\u2019s not like making a \nrecord, but it\u2019s pretty intense to put a new one up every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What are you gonna give me in return?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMostly\n just the satisfaction of being involved.  But also VIP treatment at \nlive events, special access and bonus content.  You can\u0027t buy your way \nonto the show, but you can get closer to the action."
