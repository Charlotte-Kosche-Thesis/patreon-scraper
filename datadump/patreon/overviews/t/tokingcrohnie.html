I\u0027ve been a medical marijuana user for some years now, and in that time, I have learned a lot of useful information that is not easily accessible to patients. Particularly those who might be coming to marijuana later in life. With that in mind, I decided to make a series of instructional videos regarding different ways to take mmj, the differences in strains, and other useful tidbits to help improve the quality of life for users.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I\u0027ve had friends and readers asking me for years to show them how to make some of the amazing meals and dishes I make. As such I am going to let the Toking Crohnie take over the Twisted Ladle in a series of food related videos. Learn how to can your own preserves, how to make a fantastic steak, how to make sushi, basic home staples, and a variety of other fun food explorations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in Ottawa with my wife, two cats, three turtles, several fish, and a dog. Many of whom will be making appearances on my show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will the Money Be Used For:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney raised by this Patreon will go towards creating more and better videos. This includes getting a more professional intro, equipment, and set up. It will also help me cover the cost of my medical marijuana which is not currently covered by insurance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis money will also help me procure and make videos with larger varieties of tools for medicating, offer reviews of products, as well as do on location shoots in other places where medical marijuana is legal, to do even more comprehensive videos. For example, it would help cover the cost of a trip to Colorado to show the different types of medicating options available that may not exist in Canada, as well as explore what a culture of legalized marijuana can look like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore money will also let me do even more fun experiments with food, including renting equipment I could not otherwise afford, finding different exotic ingredients, etc. Eventually it might even help me fund the launch of a more intense food dream of a food truck or line of sell-able foods. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
