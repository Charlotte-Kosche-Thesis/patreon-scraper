    "summary": "theAnimeGallery.com is trying to provide the biggest gallery of anime images available, with no restrictions, no download limits and no invasive ads - in fact, our goal would be to have NO ADS at all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur image repository contains over 300Gb of high quality anime images. That\u0027s over 190,000 different wallpapers, artworks and other images.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your support, we will be able to pay for our server fees, even upgrade our servers to offer all anime fans with improved reliability and speeds. In addition, as we reach different goals, we will remove ads for \u00a0all registered users first, and all visitors. We would love to have a distraction free image library, so that you can simply navigate, download and enjoy our collection.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a little bit of a backstory, the site was created in the summer of 2006. The initial goal was to provide small thumbnail images to support an anime cataloging application that we had created. However, after a few months of usage, users were starting to upload a wider range of images, and it was obvious that users were more interested in larger, higher quality images.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is the first image ever uploaded to the site:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.theanimegallery.com/data/thumbs/790px/0000/tAG_1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003eYes, this is the full resolution image!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe site has come a long way since then, and now we host over 50,000 wallpapers, 70,000 artworks from more than 3,000 different series.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs mentioned before, some of our goals for this campaign would be to make the site self-sufficient without the need to rely on ads, but we are also interested in adding more functionality for our users, updated layouts, but that requires design and development time. With your support, we could make all of these improvements happen. We will be adding extra goals as we move forward for this stretch goals.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for visiting the site, helping with uploads, comments, tags, votes, and even contributing if you can!\u003cbr\u003e"
