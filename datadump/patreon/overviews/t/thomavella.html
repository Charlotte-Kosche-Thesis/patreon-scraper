You may have heard of it. Most of my output is focused \u00a0on political talk (leftism, mostly). However, I\u0027ve also covered other interests of mine--particularly music, but every once in a while I may cover some other stuff like movies or video games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI strive to make videos that are entertaining, but not just for entertainment\u0027s sake. I\u0027m hoping there\u0027s a large enough audience out there that cares enough to\u00a0hear my silly opinions that I can create some sort of dialogue between me and my viewers on any topic I might tackle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, did you say you\u0027re an anarchist? What are you even doing here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI may be very critical of capitalism, but it\u0027s all we\u0027ve got for right now. If I\u0027m going to participate in this system, I\u0027d like to do it on my own terms. In my\u00a0efforts to circumvent the soul-crushing effects of wage slavery, I\u0027ve decided to become a wage slave to my audience instead, which I hope turns out somewhat\u00a0nicer! Rah rah, labor!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get in return for my support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eFor just $1, you can get access to patron-exclusive videos (which may include \"behind the scenes\" videos or early previews of upcoming videos). I\u0027ll also offer downloads\u00a0of the beats I make that wind up in my videos sometimes. You\u0027ll also be invited to my public Discord server, but with a fancy color on your username! It also lets you see Thom\u0027s Media Diary, where I talk about music, movies and other artsy stuff I\u0027m enjoying at whatever particular time. I might even host patron hangouts if there\u0027s any interest in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you chip an extra dollar in, you\u0027ll get access to the #think_tank text channel on my Discord server, where you can have a say in the way my videos are made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will my support be going towards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eHelping me out as I make my way through college, as well as making my videos higher and higher in quality! Eventually I\u0027d like to be able to make these silly videos with some nicer equipment than the webcams and point-and-shoots I\u0027ve been using thus far. Green screens, DSLRs, lighting kits and plenty more are in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u0027d like to stress that this is a completely optional service. My videos will always be free to watch under any and all circumstances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting my channel with your viewership (and maybe even your patronage)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Thom\u003cbr\u003e"
