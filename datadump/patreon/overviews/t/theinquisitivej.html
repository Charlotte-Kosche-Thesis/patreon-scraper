I work hard on my reviews with the intention\nof putting together full discussions which are fulfilling to write and fun to\nread. My reviews are a guide to current cinema and classic films, but they\u2019re\nalso documents of my own emotional responses to a range of films which readers\ncan get something out of at any time, whether they stumble across them one day\nor one year after a film\u2019s release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf that sounds good to you, if you\u2019d like to see more of\nthat sort of content and be involved in the creative process, then I encourage\nyou to become a patron.
