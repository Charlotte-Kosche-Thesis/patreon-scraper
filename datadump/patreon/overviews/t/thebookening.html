    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eThe Bookening \u003c/em\u003eis a book club for Christians produced by Warhorn Media. Our format is a podcast where three guys talk about the great books. And by great books, we don\u0027t mean what\u0027s on the New York Times bestseller list, or whatever dumb paperback your mom picked up at at Wal-Mart because all the ladies are talking about it. We mean the \u003cem\u003egreat \u003c/em\u003ebooks. Jane Austen, Dickens, Shakespeare, Steinbeck, Tolstoy. That sort of thing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe generally do one book a month, and release 2-3 hour-ish episodes regarding said book. The number of episodes on any given books varies because, y\u0027know, some books generate more discussion than others. For example, we got three episodes out of John Steinbeck\u0027s \u003cem\u003eEast of Eden, \u003c/em\u003eand probably could have got three more if we\u0027d had the time and energy\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eWe only got one out of \u003cem\u003eWinnie the Pooh. \u003c/em\u003eWe fill the other weeks with one-offs on additional books, movies made from books, and literary discussions in general.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur panel features 3 real-life friends and lit-lovers:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJake is associate pastor of Clearnote Church in Bloomington, Indiana, and executive director of Wahorn Media. He\u0027s the kind of guy who falls hard for the good books, and kinda-sorta really resents the bad ones. He provides the moral center of our discussions, and also much of the passion. Or whatever the non-hack-pastor word for passion is.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrandon has a Phd. Abd of English literature, although now he works in land and oil. Which tells you everything you need to know about him. He\u0027s a down-home-humble-Texas boy-made-good who just happens to know everything about literature and literary history and literary theory and all that jazz. He brings the brains and provides the broader context for each book. He is smart, but not a jerk about it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNathan is Creative Director of Wahorn Media. He\u0027s the podcast\u0027s host and also its resident Id and gleeful provocateur. He believes that great literature should be not just enlightening but also fun, and so should great literature podcasts. He tries to keep the conversation moving, and make sure it doesn\u0027t get too self-important or lame. He also enjoys long walks on the beach.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut \u003cem\u003eThe Bookening \u003c/em\u003eis more than three guys. We really do think of it as a community for Christians to come and read and discuss literature, and the most gratifying part of doing it is the conversations we get to have about books with all kinds of different readers and listeners along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027ve always wanted to read \u003cem\u003ePride and Prejudice\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eor \u003cem\u003eDracula \u003c/em\u003eor \u003cem\u003eAnna Karenina, \u003c/em\u003eor if you did read them and had no clue how to approach them or what to think about them, \u003cem\u003eThe Bookening \u003c/em\u003eis for you. We provide historical and literary context, gossip about the characters, try to learn the good lessons, reject the bad ones, and have fun doing it. Yay us!\u003cbr\u003e"
