I ran ads for a while, and made decent money from them, but I HATE ads, so I decided to drop that system. One of my listeners suggested this site, so I\u0027m giving it a shot. The vid is one I made for another site, but it\u0027s the same message and probably better than what I\u0027d do today, so there you go.\u003cbr\u003e"
