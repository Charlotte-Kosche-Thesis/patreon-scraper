    "summary": "Hi all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little over three years ago, I starting posting original drawings and short fiction on Tumblr under the name Thelonious Grimm. What started off as a little experiment quickly grew into something more. It\u0027s been over three years and well over 300 drawings and stories, all of which have been posted for free with plenty more in the works.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in. For a most of the blog\u0027s history, I was able to support my work through other projects. Recently though, I\u0027ve been unable to keep up due to the simple need to take on more projects to pay the bills...projects that take me away from creating the drawings and stories that many of you have come to love...not to mention some books that are in the works I hope you\u0027ll love too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I will be able to:\u003cbr\u003eKeep writing and drawing original work to post for free on the Thelonious Grimm Tumblr and Complete the picture books that are currently in the works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been an absolute pleasure creating these stories for you all these last three years. With your help, there will be many more to come. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eM\u003cbr\u003e"
