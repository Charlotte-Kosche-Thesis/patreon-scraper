    "summary": "Hello, I am\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/vorfanidou\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eValia\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am from Greece, a\ncountry of 11 million people and about 5 million stray dogs and cats. The\nOrphan Pet is a Youtube channel I created without really giving it much\nthought, because I wanted to share with the world the awesomeness of my first\nrescue dog, Apollo. I then started making rescue and educational videos about\nrescue dogs and cats, and after a couple of them went viral, I realized that I\ncould really make an impact.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat is The Orphan\npet today?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\nToday The Orphan Pet\nis a full time job for me. There is so much going on here every single day,\nthat even if I posted five videos per day it would still not be enough. Abuse,\nneglect, and abandonment are too common, especially in rural areas and although\nGreece is a no-kill country, the millions of strays are basically on death row,\nsince they are being poisoned per hundreds every other day. The economic crisis\nhas made things even worse than we could imagine. Both my Youtube channel and my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://theorphanpet.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e focus on making the situation here go as viral as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat do I do every\nday?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\nApart from taking\ncare of my three pet dogs, Laura, Apollo and Pela, I also foster a rescue dog\n(or two) at a time. I volunteer in a cattery and a dog shelter, I rescue and\nrehome, and I try to help as many charities as I can by filming and\nphotographing their rescues. When I am at home, I spend most of my time behind\nthe computer. I usually upload one or two videos per week and post daily in my\nblog. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhat kind of videos\ndo I make?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\nWell, my videos are a\nmirror of myself - and I range from very emotional to quite sarcastic or\nironic. I mainly became known thanks to videos like the one I made on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hViMtuZFi0M\u0026amp;t=3s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBilly\u003c/a\u003e,\nbut I am just as passionate about my short films, my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzjuRAuh-C7SQ6IVHZSpcbX--H-lzRmGr\"\u003eFYI\u003c/a\u003e series and my controversial \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzjuRAuh-C7QDyKtODwRXnb-kddDqR1vi\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnimals in Greece this week\u003c/a\u003e\". So by\nsupporting The Orphan Pet, you basically support all sides it (and me!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhy do I need your\nhelp?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nWell, after years of\ngoing through different jobs, hobbies and interests (psychology, theater,\ncinematography, teaching) I realized that this is what I want to do: talk about\nwhat\u0027s going on in this tiny, famous country of mine, raise awareness and\n\"create\" compassionate people. I used to work as a Spanish teacher until January 2018, but\nevery hour I spent away from The Orphan Pet felt like an hour stolen from\nanimals in need, and I didn\u0027t want that. The more positive feedback I get from\npeople all around the world, the more I want to dedicate myself to doing what I\ndo best. There is so much to be done here and so much to be said, that spending\ntime \"working\" on any other job than this one feels like a waste of\ntime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhere will your money\ngo?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nTravel for a rescue\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n(animals in need of rescue or that I am asked to film and photograph can be\nhours away from home)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nInvest in equipment\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n(pc, hard drives, headphones, microphones, cameras, memory cards)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nBear the costs of my\nfoster dogs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e (usually, their food and medical care are paid by the charities,\nbut I would like to be able to maintain them myself, as this would give me more\nconfidence and liberty)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nMake a living \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is the only\nthing I want to do in my life, and being able to maintain both myself and my\nthree dogs will make me the happiest person on\nEarth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t even begin to describe how thankful I am to you, for even taking the time to read all of the above.
