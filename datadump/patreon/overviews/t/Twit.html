    "summary": "Hi I\u0027m Twit, I\u0027m 24 and I\u0027m from the US. I\u0027ve been on YouTube for around 5 years. About a year ago I began on a journey that has changed my life for the best. Believe it or not, that journey consists of uploading videos of myself playing Pok\u00e9mon. It may sound crazy, but who wouldn\u0027t love to play one of their most memorable childhood games for a living, presenting it to the world and having it recieved well because you\u0027re considered to be an entertaining individual? EXACTLY!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not here to strike up a sob story, but I feel that I should at least be honest with everyone.\u00a0The last few years of my life have been a constant uphill battle and I finally feel that I\u0027ve settled into doing something that I have full confidence in and that I can be successful. Like I said, I\u0027m not going to start a sob story and get everyone in their feels or anything, just know that if you\u0027re having a rough time in life, someone will be there for you regardless of the situation your in. I\u0027ve found this to be true because of the insane amount of support and love I receive from my fans \u0026amp; friends. Without these people influencing my life so positively I honestly cannot say that I can guarantee that I\u0027d be here able to help others, or make them laugh, or even as some have said, \"Inspire\" people to continue throughout their daily lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I decided to start a Patreon page is because I\u0027ve always dreamed of being my own boss, working and making a living off of something that other people wouldn\u0027t regularly do, which is YouTube, obviously. I want to be more involved with my subscribers \u0026amp; followers and with the rest of the community that has accepted me for who I am and treated me so well already. I know that with a little time and support that I can create something extraordinary with my channel and the support from all of you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can donate, that is amazing! However, if you cannot, that is completely alright too! I understand that money doesn\u0027t grow on trees, and if you\u0027re fortunate and willing to donate, then I greatly appreciate it. This is not a place for me to force you to donate for content at all! All of my content will continue to be free for your enjoyment. I\u0027m simply looking for a little help while I continue to journey through my days on YouTube and do my best to keep you all entertained and smiling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll have a video going a little further in detail about this Patreon page on my channel soon. If you\u0027re a subscriber, follower, or simply a passerby here, I appreciate your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, and I\u0027ll see you in the next video!\u003cbr\u003eAs always, it\u0027s been Twit and I\u0027m out! PEAAAAAAACE!\u00a0\u30c4\u003cbr\u003e"
