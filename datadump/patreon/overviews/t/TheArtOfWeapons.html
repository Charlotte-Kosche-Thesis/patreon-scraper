Almost all of the creations that I make are documented on my YouTube channel that I have been growing for the past two years or so and over the years I am sure that you will agree that both my video quality and the quality of my projects has improved massively.\u003cbr\u003eFrom my oldest to my newest slingshot...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i0.wp.com/theartofweapons.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150427_184028.jpg\" style=\"width: 525px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...Or my least to my most powerful crossbow...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i0.wp.com/theartofweapons.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150427_184234.jpg\" style=\"width: 525px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...or my bluntest to my sharpest knife...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i2.wp.com/theartofweapons.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150427_184001.jpg\" style=\"width: 525px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e... I am sure that you will agree that I have improved loads in the short space of time that I have been creating, but with your support imagine how much more I will have improved in the next two years?\u003cbr\u003e As my channel has grown and improved so has my passion to make these videos and creations but the problem is making all of these videos and projects take money and lots of time. The fact that you are here shows me that you already know my channel and that you appreciate all of the hard work and money that goes into my videos.\u00a0For the past two years I have been funding these projects with revenue earned from YouTube advertising, however to take these videos to the next level I need your support! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt is so quick and easy to set up and you can pay from your Paypal account so you know it is secure!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNo matter how much you pledge you will become part of an elite group of fans who\u0027s support I will be incredibly grateful for. You can have the satisfaction of knowing that for every project that you pledge towards, you have been part of the motivation for me to finish, because without all any of the awesome fans that support me on YouTube I would never have had the motivation or money to support this awesome hobby!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow It works\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe way that this works is you pledge a certain amount of money per new project that I release. Every time that I release a new project you can then contribute towards the next one! Not only will you have the satisfaction of viewing more awesome videos but you will also unlock certain awards and access to patreon only content and exclusive discussion groups. \u003cem\u003eAnd\u003c/em\u003e on top of that when I reach certain milestones of money per project then I can use the money to purchase new tools, cameras and materials to produce even more awesome projects!\u003cbr\u003eAs mentioned earlier, you will only be charged per \u003cstrong\u003enew project. \u003c/strong\u003eThis means that if I make a new crossbow and upload a shooting video, and a 2 part tutorial, and you have pledged $2 then you will only be charged $2 for all 3 videos. You will not be charged for something like a workshop tour or a tool review.\u003cbr\u003eSome people may also be wondering why I am not charging per month, its much more predictable is it not? Well the reason for this is since I am still 15 and still at school I have a lot of upcoming exams that may require a lot more of my time in the future. This may mean that for that month I will only be able to release one video and it wouldn\u0027t be right to charge my loyal patrons for that inactive month so I think that this way will make sure that it will be a lot more fare towards you, the fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my most popular videos have been my casting aluminium series:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLiBJ_D3_ZSgKjt42Gl_zhBIl2D9KTP75t\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for even being here, it shows that you understand what I am trying to do with my channel and that I need your support! If you do donate then you wont regret it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
