We focus on films, games, TV, music and geek culture. We started in 1999, originally known as DVD Times, but our growth in terms of subject matter meant we relaunched in 2010 under the current name.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a dedicated and brilliant team of writers creating some fantastic unique content but the world of online publishing is changing. We want to keep up and create even more content and features.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the coming weeks we\u0027ll be giving Patreons the opportunity to view The Digital Fix as an ad-free experience - at that time we\u0027ll be updating our tiers and rewards with more information. We also hope to add further tiers and benefits soon including some exclusive opportunities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we setting up this Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil now, The Digital Fix has relied on advertising and affiliate income to pay for its existence. Unfortunately that income is reducing monthly and we\u0027re keen to explore new avenues to ensure the continued existence of the site AND to allow us to grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is one of those options.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery penny we receive through Patreon will be used to pay our writers to create NEW and original exciting content. None of the money will be spent on anything other than content. Our hosting and other costs are already covered through advertising income and affiliate links.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Values\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe are dedicated to creating new content that is both exciting AND informative. We are an inclusive publication and we are striving to create content to appeal to as wide a range of people from different backgrounds as possible. To this end some of the money we receive via Patreon will be ring fenced to pay for content written by and aimed at marginalised groups.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are also founding members of UK Film Blogs and abide by the UK Film Blogs charter which is published here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/UKFilmBlogs/status/801186380277694465\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/UKFilmBlogs/status/8011863802...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
