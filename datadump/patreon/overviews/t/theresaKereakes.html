We had ideas and bands and art and no one would give us a venue. So\nwe made our own magazines, galleries, clubs, stages...all self-funded,\ncommunity-supported.  We \u2013 and I - still do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the time 2017 is \nfinished, there will be two books on the market with my by-line. \nHorizontal Action Books will release the companion piece to my \ncomprehensive traveling exhibit,\u003cem\u003e UNGUARDED MOMENTS: Backstage and Beyond (Photos from the Golden Age of Punk Rock)\u003c/em\u003e and Punk Hostage Press will release the compendium of \u003cem\u003eLOBOTOMY: The Brainless Magazine\u003c/em\u003e\n by Pleasant Gehman and me.

Because the content was available for free and on the World Wide Web, you could be connected to anyone with a browser.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLeveraging a growing and curious punk rock fan base, I was able to mount traveling photo exhibitions, make my own souvenir merchandise,\nsell prints and build a diverse international audience since the 2005 launch of Punk Turns 30. By 2009, the work was featured in the\ninfluential art journal, JUXTAPOZ in support of my \u003cem\u003eUnguarded Moments: Backstage \u0026amp; Beyond\u003c/em\u003e exhibit showing at Lancaster, PA\u0027s influential Mid Century showcase, Metropolis Gallery. Later that\nyear, 24 prints of images from that show were included in the Pop Culture\nAuction presented by Christie\u0027s Auction House. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe efforts and accomplishments that\nled up to the final gallery show were entirely self-funded.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe downside of this is the double-edged sword. Free distribution takes all the risk away for the audience - if they don\u0027t like something, there\u0027s no loss for them. On the opposite side, free distribution means the artist doesn\u0027t earn anything financially.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not the only content creator whose work has been lifted off the internet and shared widely, devaluing its earning potential in a tight market.\u00a0 Every day, I see people using my punk images as their avatars on Facebook and Twitter and other social media, and in YouTube clips. Those \"lifts\" are kind of a complement, but other lifts are confounding. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the 2007/2008 academic year, one of my blogs (\u003cem\u003eThe Female Gaze\u003c/em\u003e) was required reading in a university class on Gender Studies, and I didn\u0027t even know about it until I studied the details of a huge spike in the site\u0027s web traffic on an invisible statistics counter I installed and followed the \"visitors\" link.\u00a0 My work became a free textbook for a major university and was listed on the class\u0027s syllabus as part of the homework. No one from the university contacted me! \u00a0 Anyone who has purchased a book for a university class knows how much this author lost. Ironically, most artist-creators look forward to either having their work become assignments for university classes, or strive to teach at the university level to augment or support their art. The double-edged sword play of the internet often gives a free book to the student while stripping earning power away from the author/potential instructor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe direct contact between creator and consumer in the Patreon model is an inspiring and uplifting one - not unlike the direct relationship between student and teacher that so many of us in the creator community miss out on when our work is lifted.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA Very Brief History of Punk Rock Blog-to-Exhibition Success in Photos:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/189859_1510139766713_1240029_n.jpg?oh=9ec1b6aea5dfb4eb25a1af6ae2531de9\u0026amp;oe=5926FB0C\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Flyer for the first Punk Turns 30 In-store exhibit, 2005)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1253/1426175023_b3e2c65aaf.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n(Preview in the Nashville Scene for the exhibit at Grimey\u0027s - \"Our Pick of the Week\")\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3093/3105779922_a55fafb9f6_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Me \u0026amp; my Unguarded Moments exhibit above the fold in Lancaster, PA\u0027s daily, Intelligencer.

And this is where you come in -\nas a subscriber/supporter of my project, you\u0027ll see the process of building the\nbooks and goods, from selecting (curating) the images, restoring them, and\nassembling them.  In addition to the books, I will be making prints, and\nother printed materials - all of which are available to you. Directly as rewards and in advance of publication at a discount! There is also the opportunity to interact and discuss (as artists are wont to do) the process - and more importantly, for you to give me feedback on curating and other things I can\u0027t even predict. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis project is ambitious.  Its elements are many: Photo/slide/negative\nrestoration; image editing; project assembly; printing; designing books, cards,\nposters and shirts, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope you will help me take the next step in this artistic journey. Whether as\na financial supporter or a spreader of the word, I appreciate you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
