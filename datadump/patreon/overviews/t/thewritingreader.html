    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Liz, aka The Writing Reader. I have been posting a new creativity prompt every day since November of 2012.This was literally a crazy, middle of the night idea that started me on a journey I could never have imagined. The best part has been meeting writers and other creators like you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have another hair-brained idea. I want to include you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine an excerpt from your book being featured as a prompt. With a link to buy it at Amazon or a link to your InstaFreebie page or whatever you tell me to link it to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine your photo or artwork being featured to illustrate a prompt or as the Visual Prompt of the Week with a link to your store or portfolio so that my visitors can see more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine your creative product being featured within the weekly Carnival of Creativity or even as a solo post on The Writing Reader.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI actively promote all my prompts and Carnivals on Twitter to over 52K followers, which means I will be actively promoting you. All my prompts are in a queue that cycles so that the post with your links are constantly being promoted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, I would do all of this for you for free if I could afford to. Hosting and domain registry is expensive, and now there is a new expense. I have hackers from all over the world trying to hack my server all day. I\u0027m spending a lot of time manually fighting them instead of creating content or engaging on Twitter. I currently cannot afford to put Site Lock on my sites, but I need to. Help me keep The Writing Reader running safely, and I\u0027ll help you promote your creative services and products.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a supporter, you\u0027ll get access to my private Trello board to provide the content you want to be featured on my site or the promotions you want me to run on Twitter. Trello is an easy and awesome way for teams to communicate, but if it\u0027s not your cup of tea, you\u0027ll also have email access to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really looking forward to working with you!"
