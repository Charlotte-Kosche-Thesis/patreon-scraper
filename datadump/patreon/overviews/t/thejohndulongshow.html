I loved how they developed a community that I could be a part of. They connected and informed me, the entertained and delighted me, and they occasionally outraged and saddened me. I wanted a piece of that from the creative side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThus was born \u003cstrong\u003eThe John Dulong Show.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0A podcast about one man\u0027s desire to have a podcast. Every Monday, I rant and rave about whatever strikes my fancy (#AntiFig) and much to my delight and surprise, a bunch of people listened! And even weirder, \u003cem\u003ethey keep listening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eHere\u0027s the story of why I\u0027ve decided to launch this Patreon page. I\u0027m a poor student, and podcasting is my hobby. I want to be able to do more things with this show, which means expenses - more storage for the show, better equipment, a slick website, \u003cdel\u003ea golden throne from which I can sit while I complain about the mundanities of my, realistically, charmed life\u003c/del\u003e, and, y\u0027know, other stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support me, I want to say an enormous \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e. If you don\u0027t want to support the show monetarily \u003cstrong\u003ethank you all the same\u003c/strong\u003e. The fact that people keep on listening to this thing makes the act of creating it all the more joyful!"
