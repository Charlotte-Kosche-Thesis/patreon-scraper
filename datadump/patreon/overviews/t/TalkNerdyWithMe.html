    "summary": "My name is Payton Swanson \u0026amp; I have created a Youtube Channel called Talk Nerdy With Me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI grew up loving movies and TV shows. Whenever I watch them, I don\u0027t simply watch them, I EXPERIENCE them. I fully immerse myself into it and I truly look at the movie not just from an entertainment factor, but from a completely intricate view. I look at the writing, the shots, the chemistry of actors, the continuity, the vibe, the set, the background. All of it. I notice everything. I\u0027ve worked on TV shows and movies and it just grabs me a little differently than most I think.\u00a0 PLUS, I also created a podcast on here: P.S. Let\u0027s Be Real... You will get public access to that! I will do extra side podcasts based off what reward tier\u0027s request as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I created this page, was because yes, lighting equipment, going to the movies and what not isn\u0027t cheap, but also, I\u0027m not looking to fund PAYTON SWANSON, I\u0027m looking to fund Payton Swanson\u0027s interests. It\u0027s not designer bags and trips to Paris. I work for animal rescues, I have a strong passion for homeless animals, homeless Veterans of our military and I\u0027d use my platform, once it\u0027s built up, to also bring light to that. I want my voice to be known, loud and heard so that when I talk about serious issues, it reaches everyone. Like Leonardo Dicaprio with the environment or Bob Barker with spaying/ neutering your pets. Thank you for stopping by and appreciate the time you took to reach this!"
