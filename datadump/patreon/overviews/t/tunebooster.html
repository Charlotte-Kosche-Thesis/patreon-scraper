    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAssisting Musicians in Becoming More Successful.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting our Patreon page. You are very welcome indeed!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are developing a Web Application to help musicians earn more income online via\u00a0our unique BUSK BUTTON \u00a9 feature. Fans and followers will be able to instantly pay musicians just as you would a street performer. In a sense you can call it an Online Busking Platform. Isn\u0027t that great!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all now the influence and reach video has on the internet. that\u0027s why we would like to encourage subscribers to use the power of video to connect with their fans and followers just as you would on Patreon. In this day and age it is of utmost importance to connect with your fans in some sort of creative manner and the best way to do this is through an introduction, story, short interview or a behind the scenes look.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know not many artists want to hear this, but it is almost as if your Music is secondary these days and your personal connection is the primary and essential to your success. People want to be able to relate to you as an artist. This just ads more value to your music in the end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic is a multi-billion dollar industry, so there IS money available, but it is being distributed only to the popular mainstream artists. Many musicians run day jobs, even have families to support, so juggling between being creative, touring for exposure or working 9 to 5 and supporting a family leaves little or no time for marketing and simply becomes another burden.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://tunebooster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/info1-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy creating your own personalized video where you actually talk to your audience and introduce yourself, you are increasing your chance of success significantly. The ideal is to create something catchy that tells your audience who you are, what you do and what your inspirations are. Let your band members conduct an interview with each other; get your mom, sister, uncle or wife/husband to interview you. Do guitar/ bass/ vocals / drums solo introductions etc. Be creative and make people like you even more. Of course if you don\u2019t have an introduction video yet, upload any existing one just to get started and ask your fans and followers to Busk you online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis concept has been very affective in the past and has been used by big labels for decades. The only difference is you do not need to be signed to a big label to be able to do this yourself. All you need is some confidence, a topic, story or personal interview, some creativity, any form of video camera (even your phone or webcam will do) and you are ready to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTunebooster is also based around a musician profile. Musicians(users) can share their social links and be part of a musician community. Fans of yours will also be able to open a profile and follow and interact with you on the tunebooster planform.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMarketing\nyour music can be an extremely daunting task. Spending hours and hours on the\nInternet trying to find out what works and what doesn\u2019t. We all know that\nalthough gigs and touring is a great way to build up an audience, but rarely\npays enough and often the expenses cost more than what you earn anyway.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour\npledge will help us further develop of the website as well as covering marketing cost,\nmaintenance and future app development. There are many things to come such as\ncompetitions, sponsorships, newsletters, direct funding features, causes and event creation and many more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://tunebooster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/info2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
