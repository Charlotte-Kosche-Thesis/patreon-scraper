I create, write, act, direct, produce and edit all my own content.

I was pointed towards Patreon to give my fans an opportunity to give more support and to also give them a more intimate chance to get to know me as a creator. I will continue to make free, weekly youtube videos every week regardless, (as I have for the past 2 years) but a little help goes a long way. \u00a0It takes so many hours so make one video, that I have quit my side job and am diving fully into content creation, so I can keep putting out weekly videos!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe production value is larger in my sketch episodes, as I have to hire a camera man to film at different locations with other actors as well, whom I would love to throw a bone or two when I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOverall you\u0027ll be helping with camera costs, lighting, equipment, editing software monthly fee, other actors, props, snacks, coffee costs and so much more! \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just here to give fans a little more of me and more behind the scenes of what goes on with #ThisIdiot and see if I can make my #IdiotArmy even bigger, with more support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, you\u0027ll earn access to unpublished content, weekly chats and video hangouts!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means the world to me!\u003cbr\u003exoxo\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eKarate Kicks,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTara\u003cbr\u003e #ThisIdiot\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
