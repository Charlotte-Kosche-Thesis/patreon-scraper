    "summary": "...who live and dance in a way that inspires change within our local communities as part of a global initiative. \u00a0Something I call \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Breakthrough Movement\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Breakthrough Movement\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is an international dance and theatre company that addresses culturally relevant issues, brings arts education to areas in need through outreach programs and workshops and raises money, awareness and man-power for various causes and charities both locally and internationally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFounded officially in 2013, I created \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Breakthrough Movement\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e (using one of my favorite phrases) to \u0027kill two birds with one stone.\u0027  At the time I was in need of dancers to truly create the artistic and philanthropic expressions in my spirit, and (by this time) I knew a group of young dancers from across the US and Canada who were in need of, and looking for, opportunity.  We debuted Off-Broadway with only seven dancers, which quickly grew to thirty by the following year.  In 2015, we began our apprenticeship program; and in 2016 produced our 1st Collaboration Tour to Guatemala!  Today, The Breakthrough Movement community has grown to \u003cem\u003eover forty dancers and apprentices\u003c/em\u003e hailing from 13 United States, 3 Canadian Provinces and Guatemala.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eA (very brief) introduction and background on what inspired the movement and brought me to Patreon...\u003c/h4\u003eHello and \u003cem\u003ethank you\u003c/em\u003e for visiting me on Patreon! \u00a0My name is Garrett \"Spaghetti\" Minniti and I have been singing and dancing professionally for over 20 years now.  Looking back on both my prime training years and highlights of my career it\u0027s easy to connect my success to \u0027being in the right place at the right time.\u0027  I had incredible teachers who from the very beginning not only beat talent into me (or \u0027out of me\u0027 depending on how you look at it), but instilled in me the responsibility to give back to my dance community, to (one day) train my students to be better than myself and that caring for them required a commitment that far exceeded just the number of hours spent in the dance studio. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last 10 years, my career has been largely centered around the competitive dance industry; teaching classes and workshops, setting choreography and judging/adjudicating dance competitions and festivals throughout the US and Canada. \u00a0I have met hundreds, maybe thousands, of kids; most of which can be broken down into 2 categories: either they have the talent but lack opportunity and knowhow to take their dancing to a professional level or they don\u0027t have the talent and are desperately looking for a way to keep dance in their lives post competition years. \u00a0It was a group of these young dancers and their stories that inspired \u003cem\u003ethe movement\u003c/em\u003e, if you will...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike most artists and entrepreneurs I have put, \u003cem\u003elet\u0027s just say\u003c/em\u003e, lots of money into my vision; beginning with my 1st company (In It For Life Productions) back in 2007. \u00a0Theatre rentals, rehearsal space, flights, accommodations, and (most importantly) \u003cem\u003eactually paying company members and guest artists\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is....expensive. \u00a0I say this, truly, only to convey my commitment to the artistic, educational and philanthropic company mission. \u00a0I have tried \u0027traditional\u0027 crowd-funding before via IndieGoGo (twice now), unfortunately to pretty much no success whatsoever, and over the last year The Breakthrough\u0027s progress has been slowed due to my lack of finances. \u00a0So when I discovered Patreon I knew that I had finally found the missing piece in the equation of funding the company; which ultimately mirrors the company vision itself: \u003cem\u003ecreating community.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat happens with your money?\u003c/h4\u003eSince the beginning, The Breakthrough Movement has always operated under the guidelines of a not-for-profit 501(c)3 organization. \u00a0ALL FUNDS donated/raised here on Patreon go directly to creating/running the company itself. \u00a0To begin, it is my goal to create ONE Breakthrough Movement Workshop, which includes a day of community service followed by a day of dance training and filming a music video! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy joining The Breakthrough Movement community it is my goal to\u00a0create a more intimate experience to being an \u0027arts supporter,\u0027 one where you as Patrons will get a direct glimpse into the artistic and production process, and one where you feel involved and valuable to the company\u0027s progression. \u00a0You will also receive a number of \u0027perks\u0027 including 1st views of company projects and videos before publishing, exclusive interviews and LIVE streams with company members, discounts on swag and tuition to workshops where I am teaching (for you or a dancer or your choice), and much more! \u00a0#JoinTheMovement\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU for taking the time to learn a bit about The Breakthrough Movement. \u00a0Any support you can offer is greatly appreciated, and if you feel so moved, please share help us reach more people by sharing our vision with your social networks. \u00a0Thank you for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003eStay in peace. \u00a0-G\u003cbr\u003e"
