    "summary": "Hello, my name is Victor Vossler. I have been playing pen-and-paper role-playing games since the tender young age of five. My father hosted a game of first edition AD\u0026amp;D for me and some neighborhood pals. Running into a troll under a bridge gave me a healthy respect for dangerous monsters. It wasn\u0027t until later that I recognized the unique way that such games let us re-tell old stories, or weave cultural tropes into our own new creations. I started hosting my own games at recess when I was eight years old using a pad of paper and a pencil, drawing up dungeons, and enemies, and having my friends save the day before the bell rang.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I matured I consumed many sets of role-playing rules and settings. Each offered new and exciting ways to run a game. Mega-Traveller opened up the whole galaxy to explore and made me enthusiastic about science and space exploration. Empire of the Petal Throne forced me to confront my myopic world view I inherited from western civilization;\u00a0playing characters that conformed to the cultural norms of Tekumel and not my own. And a multitude of White Wolf publications branded me with a deep earning for storytelling over constant combat against orcs and goblins. Of course, I still love sitting down at a table with my friends to hack and slash our way through cavernous dungeons in pursuit of treasure and glory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith 25 years of gaming experience under my belt I have decided to realize one of my life-long goals of creating my own system. There were many factors to consider in doing so. I realized that there are many forms of role-playing that different types of players enjoy:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHack-and-Slashing\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCharacter Development\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePoliticking\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWorld Building\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCrafting Narrative Arcs\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI would not be satisfied creating a game that focuses on any one of these particular aspects or ignores the others. With this in mind I have been developing the basis for my new game \"Tales of the New Age\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond the ambitious goals I had already set I want to finally harness the power of the new age of communication that we live in by bringing the game online in a way that traditionally would require massive correspondence efforts by many game masters. Beyond being a writer and storyteller I have the required knowledge to bring this game alive on the internet. Games played by groups will affect each other in ways that no previous pen-and-paper role playing game has achieved in the past. Instead of playing through pre-fabricated content released by the publisher of a game players choices will have real effects in the game world and shape the content other players encounter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more information please visit the Tales of the New Age\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.totnaonline.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNexus\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile many role playing games have offered a large worlds for players to participate in, none have given them the kind of unprecedented influence over the content and experience of players outside their local group. Tales of the New Age will provide on-line tools to not only track the progress of players\u0027 characters but to also allow them to have an impact on the state of the game world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ways that the players can interact are vast:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate and Trade Items\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConquer Territory\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuild in-game Structures\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGenerate Quests with Consequential Outcomes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStart new Religions\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlant Rumors about your Allies, Enemies or Yourself\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMany, many others...\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the most important goals of Tales of the New Age is to take the concept of crowd-funding and crowd-sourcing, combine them and provide a blank canvas with room for all interested participants to mark their creative influence. Being a patron not only means that you will be forging a whole new way of experiencing pen-and-paper role-playing but it means you are a part of this new world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a game designer I wanted to provide the most opportunity to the community to have their creative desires seen in the game world. Therefore, the historic content and setting are left intentionally vague. I do not wish to pigeon-hole any player with a great idea. The world is designed for the players to shape in whatever ways they see fit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons will have access to the development forums. I hope to see you there giving me hell, supporting ideas that you want to see, and ultimately assisting in the game design process.\u003cbr\u003e"
