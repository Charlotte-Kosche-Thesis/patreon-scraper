It is a protest of settler colonialism, patriarchy, capitalism, and white supremacy. We strive to instigate meaningful discourse that leads off the page and catalyzes political action in one\u0027s own community.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eterra incognita\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e means \"unknown land.\" This is a phrase cartographers would use to label areas that were \"undiscovered\" in Turtle Island. We use the phrase, \"terra incognita,\" as way of jabbing at early colonizers because this land was always home to Indigenous peoples. Before settlers came to the shores of Turtle Island supremacist narratives were already fomenting. These people came to the shores not out of ignorance, but with definitive mal-intent. Early European settlers subscribed to a way of looking at the world in hierarchies, deeming some as \"other,\" and \"lesser,\" just because they appeared to be different. This, of course, led to European colonization and genocide of Indigenous people, the affects of which are ongoing, and the fight against these forces continue to this day. This media platform is one way we protest.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe seek to address race, class, and gender and how these things affect our experiences with nature, technology, and anything related. We publish narratives that raise the voices of women, femme, queer, trans, POC, and Indigenous folks. We uphold creativity, expertise, and craft.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInclusive feminist media doesn\u0027t exist in the outdoor industry, so here we are, bitches.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAmidst the debris of countless outdoor brands co-opting \"diversity\" and erasing history, Erin Monahan started Terra Incognita Media in December 2015.\u003c/h3\u003eTerra Incognita Media is on it\u0027s way to becoming a non-profit as the first independent feminist media company for the outdoor industry in the U.S.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur situation:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a small team. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the last two years of starting Terra, Erin Monahan, the founder, does everything behind the scenes: runs the website, social media, emailing, organizing of events, promotion, networking, reaching out to potential contributors, building awareness, writes essays, does podcast interviews when time allows, and managed to create one video for the site. Phew! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLorena Jasis-Wallace and Larissa Nez have been incredible additions to the team in that last year. Both are co-facilitators of our monthly \"Interrupting Oppression\" workshops, as well as contributing writers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need to harness the power of sustainable income so that we can pay for operation costs and to pay our team: this will mean more powerful, intersectional, consistent content, a bigger reach, and discerning conversations that push for equitable change.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are Terra Incognita Media\u0027s costs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWebsite Hosting. \u003c/strong\u003eFor the traffic on the\nsite we need a robust backend!

Our founder is not tech savvy so we will need\nto hire someone for this job!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eAdvertising on\nFacebook/Instagram/Print flyers for events/Promotional materials. \u003c/strong\u003eSpreading the word is not\nfree!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003ePaying our team and freelance contributors. \u003c/strong\u003eAs we work our asses off\nbehind the scenes, typing away, organizing, discussing with collaborators,\nputting on events, and delivering you the most incisive feminist media for the\noutdoor industry, we also need to eat and gather at our coffices (coffee shop\noffices since we don\u2019t have a real office). Our needs are minimal, but we do\nneed to have basic living costs covered, so that we can maintain this work! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all of this support, Terra Incognita Media will be well on its way to securing a sustainable future! We know how important it is to be reader-supported at a time when everything is being co-opted for easy and simplistic narratives. Our team and community know that the world is more complex than soundbytes and scripts on news channels. We appreciate you becoming a patron because that means that a more equitable and inclusive world MATTERS. You are joining arms with a whole band of feminist thinkers, activists, and creators. Never underestimate the power of $1. Your support means the world to us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-The Terra Team\u003cbr\u003e"
