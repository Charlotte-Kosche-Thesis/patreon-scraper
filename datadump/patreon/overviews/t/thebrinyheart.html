    "summary": "Hello friends!\u003cbr\u003eSupport comes in a lot of different forms, from social shout-outs, to donations, to free cases of high grade gin. I know everyone can\u0027t do all of these, so I\u0027m grateful for anything and everything that you guys have to offer. If you can\u0027t afford financial support right now, then giving the podcast a review on iTunes (or where you listen), liking the podcast on Facebook, and shouting the podcast name as you drive by me on the street are great! Please don\u0027t throw stuff at me from your car.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m using Patreon to raise financial support for a few reasons:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. To give me a little more time and resources.\u003c/strong\u003e I create the Briny Heart on my lonesome, in my cobbled together home studio. Researching, writing,recording, editing, images, website - \u00a0it\u0027s all me. Every pledge that people make on Patreon gives me the ability to dedicate a bit more time to this. I\u0027d love to be able to take the time to create a bit of merchandise to offer, or to make longer or more frequent episodes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. I don\u0027t want to be just a corporate\u00a0shill. \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m happy to accept sponsors and advertising on the show, but I don\u0027t want to become a corporate robot for some vast gin-distilling conglomerate. (That said, if you are the head of a vast, gin-distilling conglomerate, hit me up.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. I want to thank supporters! \u003c/strong\u003eYes, Patreon gives me a way to raise funds, but it also means I can give you some form of thanks or reward for that support. And as the podcast grows, and is assisted by Patreon support, I\u0027ll be able to offer better rewards for that support. Circle of life, baby.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you in advance for any support you can offer The Briny Heart. And remember, \u003cstrong\u003eEast Coast is the Beast Coast!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings need to rhyme.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE BRINY HEART is \u00a0podcast of tall tales, legends and myths from the east coast of North America. That\u2019s right. Canada, too. Stop trying to ignore us.\u003cbr\u003eEvery two weeks, I\u0027ll bring you a new coastal creature, myth, tall tale, or legend that has been put through a haphazard research and writing process. Some stories have more truth than fictions, and some are downright unbelievable. \u003cbr\u003eThe most important thing to remember is that I\u2019m not a historian, and I barely play one here.  History, legend and salty talk. What more could you want? \u003cbr\u003e"
