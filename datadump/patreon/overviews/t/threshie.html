I\u0027ve been posting artwork on sites like DeviantArt, Tumblr, and Facebook for nearly a decade, and have been drawing ever since I could hold a pencil. I hold an AA degree in graphic design, and in the past I have taught five years of drawing classes for beginners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why am I on Patreon? I\u0027m here to finally launch a project I\u0027ve had on the back burner for years: a web comic. Followers of my DeviantArt and Tumblr may recognize my quirky Chibi Zombie artwork. Well, originally Chibi Zombie wasn\u0027t just the occasional tiny, adorable undead character. It was supposed to be a web comic, and hopefully with your support, it still can be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting, and for reading my rambling little introduction, here. Feel free to message me, I would love to hear from you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eXOXO,\u003cbr\u003eThreshie\u003cbr\u003e",
