     "about": "I guess I should start at the beginning... The very beginning..\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI was born to a beautiful woman named Diana Francis May, who met my Dad Randy Lee Keever when he was a Sailor on the Westwind Ice Breaker US Coast Guard many many Moons ago... Gee that\u0027s a lot of Moons..\u003cbr\u003eAnyway it was a hard time for my Mother, unwed and raising a baby in a backward era. I didn\u0027t have it too easy either, in school especially on Father\u0027s Day I was sat in a corner of the room facing the wall, whilst Fathers and children bonded and creating Fathers Day Cards I was reminded I had no Dad so I couldn\u0027t participate so was given other tasks like cleaning the blackboard or taking completed work in folders to the Head Masters office.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I knew no different so it was normal I just went on auto pilot on these occasions. But I had company anyway, 5 Spirit children who would hang around me at the school until home time, telling me all about their pets and one even had a ferret! I seemed to get into trouble a lot though, when other kids would push me around, hit me, throw my stuff out of my school bag and call me names, they couldn\u0027t see my friends so I would just shrug, pick up my things and carry on all the while being kicked or hit\u00a0 and shoved about. One day walking home two girls followed me, my 5 little Spirit friends kept yelling at me \u0027don\u0027t put up with it, are you yellow!\u0027 I was a quiet child, and was quite reserved but these Spirit friends were insisting I put an end to the taunting. I turned and faced the girls and before they knew it one I knocked down with one punch to her head the way my friends told me to, I stood shocked then the other came at me to slap me and I don\u0027t know how it happened but I apparently broke her wrist. In a panic I ran all the way home crying because I thought I was going to be in trouble. I had put up with that almost every day and every other day for the past 4 years and never had I so much as raised a hand. But at home my friends followed me, they were cheering and telling me how happy they were I stood up for myself. The mothers of the girls called to say that my Mother had to pay the doctors bills but my Mother told them to drop off and that if their brats didn\u0027t do what they had none of this would had happened. After that the kids at school left me alone. It was life changing :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years later I was sent to the Head masters office because one of the teachers found I ignored (well that\u0027s what she said) the bell to go into class, it was because I was playing on the equipment with my Spirit friends, I was having such a good time with them laughing at their jokes and being typical kids. I was extremely nervous because the teacher told me I was disobeying the rules and was to get the cane. As I waited the secretary of the Head Master asked me why I was there and that the Teacher said I was disobeying the bell, the Teacher also told her about my \u0027story\u0027 about the children she asked me who my friends were, I told her their names and she asked what they looked like, I described them having bad skin. She asked how long I had seen them. I said \u0027everyday\u0027 she then got up and went into the Principals office and I could hear her saying to him that the description I gave sounded like the kids that were killed in a house fire, she asked where did they live? I told her behind the school, she then ran to the Principal\u0027s office again and saying words to the effect that she believed I was telling the truth because years ago there were a family of 5 children who all perished in a house fire, behind the school she even told me that she believed me, my Mother was called and they discussed with her the fact that I had claimed to see children from a house that was behind the school, she asked if my Mother had told me about the kids, my Mother said no. It turned out they were in my Mothers class as a child, To my surprise, they were in my Mother\u0027s class. Well long story short afterwards my Mother told me about the kids and the fire I literally wept as a baby. Having the awareness that they were deceased children I eventually didn\u0027t get to see my friends any more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI can recall sitting and crying because they stopped coming to see me and it was the hardest time for me, I even felt l didn\u0027t want to go to school I was so heartbroken.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever through the years many other Spirits came to visit and dating was awkward especially when seeing Spirits and seeing the look on my date, Michael\u0027s face, I recall seeing a guy sitting beside Michael, the Spirit looked disfigured with half of his head looking caved in and knowing he was deceased I later discovered he was his friend who died in his arms after his car hit a pole and the pole fell on top of the drivers side causing his head to literally pop, as described by Michael who said he died in his arms before the ambulance arrived. When I told him about the Spirit Michael said \u0027what are you constantly looking at? It\u0027s driving me crazy!\u0027 He was quite freaked out by this and it took a while for Michael to speak to me because I described his mate who had the sort of personality that would be typical of him to try to shock me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are too many visitations to name them all, I honestly have lost count.. however this incredible compressed sensation is felt\u00a0 whenever they come around me, I get light headed, disorientated, a closed throat, my voice becomes croaky as a result. I\u0027ve had palpitations, I have had out of body experiences that\u0027s the only way I can describe it.. I get woken often by them, I\u0027ve had many cases of having visions of things that appear as dreams but I\u0027m wide awake seeing them.. and seeing them moving so fast around me, whilst others just stare like they\u0027re waiting for me to say something.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have done many things in life and loved doing the columns in the newspapers and working on radio, and passing the messages on is pretty much how I\u0027d sum my life up, it seems pretty mediocre I guess to most people but for whatever reason this is something that is a part of me, just as an artist knows how to naturally draw or paint, I can speak to Spirit. I am not ashamed to say no, I have no awards from passing any student in the Paranormal course or student of tarot, what I have is something that just is, the difference between choosing to study this and not is that it chose me. At almost 60 years of age this is all I know so it\u0027s not as though I can unlearn anything. Everything is hands on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike other Mediums I am not rich, but one good thing is at least I don\u0027t have any prior knowledge of the people I\u0027m reading for, I don\u0027t want to know I know that may seem rude but it\u0027s none of my business, as a messenger why do I need to? It\u0027s like a postman needing to know if you are married .. not their business. All your job is to do is pass on the info and that\u0027s it. end of story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~ Karen :)",
