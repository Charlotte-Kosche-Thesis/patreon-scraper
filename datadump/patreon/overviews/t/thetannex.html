The Tannex is located in the heart of Barelas -- one of the oldest villages in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\u00a0If the Tannex had a mission, it would be to showcase the multi-disciplined, hybrid work of artists who often work outside the conventional definitions of performance. This space is unique in the city in that it is one of the few venues that truly reflects the diversity of the citizens. The Tannex is a safer space for people of all walks of life to engage, communicate, and create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Tannex has become a vital contributor to the artistic life of Albuquerque. Not only does it draw local, national and international touring performers, it is home to the Albuquerque Zine Library, and the city\u0027s first and only annual zine fair-- ABQ Zine Fest-- \u00a0now in its 7th year. In order for the\u00a0Tannex to continue, it must become sustainable. No one is turned away from lack of funds, and ALL artists, local and traveling, receive an honorarium for performing, which leaves very little to cover operating costs, keeping the space in a constant state of financial peril. For the Tannex to\u00a0keep going, stay solvent, and present more evenings of great events, we\u0027re finally asking for support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY YOUR SUPPORT IS IMPORTANT:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour continuous support will help us keep the space in working order, improve your venue experience (cool in the summer, warm winter) allow The Tannex to provide more opportunities for artists, both local and touring acts. Your support means more hours available to peruse the Albuquerque Zine Library. \u00a0Your dollars would make it possible for The Tannex to be more visible in our city through the publication zines, podcasts, mix-tapes and live recordings (based on artist clearances) to chronicle many of the events that happen in the garage. Even if you can\u0027t come to the shows, or the library, or zine fest-- you may wish support the Tannex through Patreon just to help it stay afloat for others to enjoy! Look at you, all philanthropic and !@#$.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHelp the Tannex thrive in this tough desert that\u0027s both loving and prickly. The DIY scene in Albuquerque will be better for it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU! See you in the garage!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Tannex\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
