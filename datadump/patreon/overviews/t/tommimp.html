    "summary": "Hi I\u2019m Tommi, an accidental photographer.  You can find me via \u003ca href=\"http://www.mpstills.com\"\u003ewww.mpstills.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yet in another world I\u2019m a film director! \u003ca href=\"http://www.thirdreelfilm.com\"\u003ewww.thirdreelfilm.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI only learned to use a stills camera as my film school wouldn\u2019t lend out video gear for practice.  The local directors saw this and decided they wanted photos of themselves pointing at things and looking important.  This has led to a strange career in the film industry photographing films, artists (and alcoholics).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m different to most snappers for 5 reasons:  \u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll my work looks cinematic, not photographic (I learned from the movies).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI shoot people I know; they\u2019re easier to catch in unguarded moments, always telling stories with their eyes and body language.  And its always easier to relate to a landscape when there is someone around.  \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTaking the photos is only half my job; making them stand out means many hours by the laptop; of late I\u2019ve learned how to choose and combine filter after filter until a unique range of colour emerges.  Few now can develop photos like I do.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere\u2019s nothing faked or staged about my work, I shoot what I see.  Compared to what the world can offer, our own minds are limited.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI use only available lighting, because it\u0027s more surprising.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eImages are disposable these days.  Even great photos, drown fast in the online noise.  Like with music, the hard copy, the limited edition, has more value than ever.  The more real it is, the more it matters.  It\u2019s the same with how we talk to each other, letters may be slower, but its a rare couple who prints out and files away their chat logs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlus, we rarely observe the small details.  Compare a band\u2019s album cover to its online photos; one we get to know well, the other we skim over.  You get more from what physically exists.  So if you support me enough, you\u2019ll get limited edition prints, from postcard to poster size. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBut for fresh photos I need fresh people.  Lucky then that being a film maker means having friends all over.  And curiosity too.  Being part Asian in a school of 750 white kids, I grew up aware that there was a world beyond my village borders.  So I flew away when I could, and thanks to my budget, where the cheap flights took me.  And always with a camera, at a time when phone cameras where no more a gleam in Steve Jobs\u2019 eye.  There\u2019s nothing like a set of foreign eyes on home soil, to see the wood for the trees.  Even Hollywood was built by those from far away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it\u2019s great that people use Patreon to help artists, but I can use Patreon to help you.  How?  With postcards.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFew things make people\u2019s day more than finding someone has taken time to send them good vibes by hand.  It tells them that someone cares, and that you\u2019re the kind who goes the extra mile.  The better the card, the bigger the effect.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce my friend picked out a card from the National Gallery in London, poured her heart out to a family back home in Brazil, and when she came to visit; the card had been given a place of honour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy favourites were by an artist local to Hebden Bridge; you could only buy them at a local craft shop.  Colourful paintings of old, long gone houses in the local area, they looked like nothing else, cost little to buy, and made me a few friends for life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo a good postcard, can help you:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake friends with people in the business world.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCut down the amount of time needed for people to trust and respect you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake your ties to friends and family stronger.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to being a film maker; I\u0027ve friends in many European countries. And thanks to past experience, I know how to stretch travel money.  It\u0027s almost the same as I live at home.  But I still have to get there! \u00a0So you\u0027ll be helping me make memorable images of people across the continent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistory has shown that successful artists have always had patrons.  Always.  Even James Joyce, whose Ulysses is regarded as the greatest of novels, wouldn\u2019t have published a thing if not for the money and effort of the little known Harriet Shaw (\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Shaw_Weaver\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Shaw_Weaver\u003c/a\u003e). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo by supporting artists like myself, you\u0027re carrying on a tradition that has endured for millennia.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithout you, no one would remember people like us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarm regards,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTommi Murshed-Parish"
