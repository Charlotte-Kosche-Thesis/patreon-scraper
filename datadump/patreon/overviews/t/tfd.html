The rotten shark of Iceland and the freshest peach plucked from the tree \u2013 equally authentic. A slice of heirloom Chess pie matched with a well-made cocktail, or perhaps the angelic sweetness of Chateau d\u2019Yquem as well as Tej, the Ethiopian spiced honey wine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe use of \u201cFood Dictator\u201d is tongue-in-cheek (itself a bad pun for a food blog!) but I decided to start this for the simple reason that I have a photographic memory for food, a talent for finding and creating the best in recipes and a burning desire to make YOU just as much of a dictator as I am. My own recipes seek to realize the ultimate perfection of a particular dish and elevate the simplest meal into a memorable experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of my recipes are complex \u2013 many are not.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me in this quest and together, the revolution against the garbage that we have reduced ourselves to swilling down like pigs will succeed and lead us together into a glorious new age of culinary discovery!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAm I elitist? Hell yes. My hope is that you too will join the elite of those who dare to break the chains of mundanity and rediscover our glorious culinary past as well as the brilliant present and numinous future of authentic cuisine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donation will pay for my server time, my IT costs to keep the blog running and promotional activities - my normal bill totals $500+ per month, so your support to keep TFD ad-free is truly appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a1Viva la Revoluci\u00f3n!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
