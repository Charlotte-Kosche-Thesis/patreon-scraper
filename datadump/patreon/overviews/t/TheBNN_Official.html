    "summary": "Howdy! Welcome to The British Nerd Network or The BNN for short. So who are we? Well we all started because we were really into a variety of nerdy-related things, however, had no one to discuss our interests with. This sucked, so we decided that we\u0027d create an online platform for all nerds from all over the world to meet and discuss their nerdy interests. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also appreciate the grind that content creators, streamers, game developers and graphic designers go through, and decided that the platform of nerds could be used as a networking and promotional method also. We started in October 2017, and have grown at a rapid pace since. In January 2018, we launched our website (www.thebnn.net) alongside our blog.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe future of The BNN is bright. We anticipate Podcasts, Talk Shows, Community Nights and E-Sports in the near future, and will look at including our TeamBNN members along the way. This alongside continuing to offer nerds a safe space to discuss their interests and offering a platform for content creators of all definitions will all come together to create one large, supportive nerd community. Welcome to The BNN!\u00a0"
