    "summary": "Have you ever wanted to do good deeds but don\u0027t have the time, money, or energy to make a real impact yourself? Do you love basketball \u0026amp; have a hankering for premium content that is free of any of the fluff that plagues regular sports coverage? If you answered yes to one or both of these questions, The Charity Stripe is the place for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur purpose is to create premium basketball content behind this paywall with every single cent going towards different causes or charities the staff and/or are passionate about. We want to be 100% transparent with where your money goes, how it is spent, \u0026amp; what causes we support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne month we could donate it to a charity \u0026amp; the next we could absolve a group of students that have negative balances in their school lunch accounts \u0026amp; the next we could buy sneakers/uniforms/court time for a youth basketball team that\u0027s underfunded. Kind of like when Shea Serrano \u0026amp; the FOH do, but on a smaller scale \u0026amp; instead of getting a warm fuzzy feeling, you\u0027ll also get basketball analysis that rivals any major media outlet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur staff is small but comes with years of experience \u0026amp; a wealth of knowledge. As our project grows \u0026amp; we gain notoriety, it will only open up more avenues for better content \u0026amp; more opportunities to do good.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to The Charity Stripe, thank you for your subscription \u0026amp; we look forward to doing some good things with you.
