    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi guys and gals.\u00a0Welcome to Tabletop Evocations! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Oliver. I am an aspiring sound designer and composer, an avid rpg-, tabletop- and pen and paper-nerd, and I am the creator of this Patreon. Here I am creating custom made sound effects and musical ambiences for (fantasy) tabletop games.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I use sounds and ambiences in my tabletop session?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs most of you are aware, sound has a huge impact on how we perceive dramatic scenes or settings. This is most obvious in movie or game soundtracks. A composer is able to oftentimes enhance a scene on screen immeasurably and most of the times is even setting the very tone the director wants this scene to have. Also, the difference good sound design can make in a game is huge. If well done, players will not necessarily even notice it, as it blends in seamlessly with the world the game designers, visual artists and story tellers have created.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA lot of you guys are already using movie or game soundtracks during your sessions. I do to! Spotify playlists be praised :-)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I am offering though is a bit more particular.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo, what are you offering here?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI will be creating sounds and ambiences in four different categories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emonster or creature sounds\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003espell effect sounds\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNPC voice over lines\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emusical ambiences\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThese sounds will be yours to keep and use as you see fit!

Those will include, for example, a roaring dragon, a screeching banshee, a woodland nymph toying with the PCs, a pack of Gnolls, Zombies, an earth elemental groaning etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpell effects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a role player myself, I will try to create engaging and interesting sounds for spell effects. Those will include the classic fireball spell, magic missile, charm person, cure wounds, teleport, conjure demon, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNPC voice over lines\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThese will be generic enough that they will seamlessly fit into most of your sessions but once again I will try to make them as interesting and engaging as possible: an arrogant dragon guarding its hoard, a death knight mocking the players before engaging them in combat, a city guard barring the PCs the entry to the city by night....or letting them in, depending on their persuasion role. :-) I will offer both of these outcomes in separate files.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMusical ambiences\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThese will be pieces of ambient sounds containing musical elements of several minutes length. I will not just comprise stock sounds but will enhance these ambiences with musical compositions: A harbor trade city by day, an elven court, an undead crypt, a jungle ruin, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow are these sounds linked to Patreon tiers and when will you be releasing them?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have separated the sounds into four tiers:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTier one: creature sounds\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTier two: spell effect sounds\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTier three: NPC voice over lines\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTier four: musical ambiences\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThe releases structure will be the same each month:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ecreature sounds in week one\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNPC voice overs in week two\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003espell effects in week three and\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003emusical ambiences in week four\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you and why are you doing this?
