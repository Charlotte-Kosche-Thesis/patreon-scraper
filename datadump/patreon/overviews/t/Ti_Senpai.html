    "summary": "Hey there! I\u0027m Ti-Senpai and it\u0027s been my dream ever since I was a little kid to be an artist. I was very inspired by Shonen anime and manga. I want to my art to encourage people the same way Shonen manga inspired me. I\u0027d also like to be able to help out my mom with money and due to personal reasons, it seems that making money online is currently my only option. I appreciate every cent and hope you enjoy my art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m working on 3 webtoons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShy Awkward Weeb: A webtoons about me. It\u0027s kinda lame.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Uncool Kids: A comedy about an nerdy, tsundere, elf named Norwegian, a rude, arrogant, half elf half vampire named Iron, an easygoing, playful, zombie experiment named Stitch, a punky and feisty human named Dolce, and the stoic, mature, vampire named Edgar. They\u0027re all friends that get into all sorts of shenanigans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDemon Daze: Demon Daze is remake of a manga series I drew in elementary school. Back then it was called Mika\u0027s Curse and Ichigo was the fun loving best friend and Mika was the protagonist. I wanna remake it and keep the things about it that kid me enjoyed drawing. The only difference is I\u0027m gonna make it good. Ichigo is the protagonist cuz I wanted to tackle having a male protagonist since I\u0027ve never done that before. Anyway, Demon Daze is about the 2 delinquent buddies Mika Hiraki and Ichigo Tachibana. Mika is always vandalizing things and picking fights, so Ichigo always tried to keep her outta trouble, but has been labeled delinquent by being best friends with Mika. The only thing odd about them is that they see ghosts and have unusual powers. Ichigo is a shape shifter and Mika has the power of lightening. In their free time when they aren\u0027t goofing off or causing trouble, they help ghosts pass on. Whatever\u0027s keeping a ghost in the human world, whether it\u0027s a message they wanna give to someone living or catching their killer, Mika and Ichigo will do whatever it takes to help a ghost pass on. However, when demon sightings and attacks in the human world sky rocket, Mika and Ichigo will have to face scarier obstacles than helping out ghosts."
