    "summary": "Thank you so much for your interest!\nI am a writer and performer.  I was a playwright and screenwriter and then,\nin 2009, I wrote my first prayer, \"Fruit Flies\" for a Birkat HaChamma\nservice (the prayers for the sun that are done every 28 years) in Prospect\nPark, Brooklyn and I became obsessed with the form and its function liturgically\nand personally . I have been writing prayers, new liturgy and kavannot ever\nsince.  Each piece is a holy conversation\nwith the divine, what Alicia Ostriker calls, \"The Fierce Mystery\",\nwhatever that is meaning for me at any given moment. I have raised enough money\nto print my first book, \u201cPLACE YOURSELF: Prayers and Words of Intention\u201d, a\ncollection of new liturgy and kavannot to be published by Dimus Parrhesia Press\nand hope to have the wherewithal to support myself as I publicize the book, set\nup readings and teaching as an artist/scholar in residence in Jewish venues and\nsynagogues, and continue to write.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI was the Liturgist-In-Residence during the National\nHavurah Committee\u0027s 2014 Summer Institute and I have served as\nScholar-In-Residence, prayer leader, teacher, speaker and reader at synagogues\nand Jewish venues in Brooklyn, Westchester, New Jersey and Ohio. My work has\nbeen published online on \n\u003ca href=\"http://ritualwell.org/\"\u003eRitualWell.org\u003c/a\u003e, the\u003ca href=\"http://opensiddur.org/\"\u003e Open Siddur\nProject \n\u003c/a\u003e, and at my site, \u003ca href=\"http://www.triganza.blogspot.com/\"\u003eTrisha Arlin:\nWords of Prayer and Intention\n\u003c/a\u003e as well as anthologies.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI share my work online with a Creative Commons license and I am happy that it is used in services and gatherings around the US and Canada and other countries. But I need to pay my bills, I need time to arrange residencies and appearances, prepare a book and most of all, to write and study. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\"Trisha Arlin\u0027s liturgies are so\nfresh you\u0027d think someone just picked them off the vine.  They are\nthoughtful and reverent yet utterly modern, with language that evokes the grit\nand doubt of the real world.  They have the depth of traditional prayer,\nand, one has the sense of the real internal monologue of a contemporary human\nbeing.  These prayer-poems are needed as a voice of the times and a\nsignpost on the way to the sacred.\"--Rabbi Jill Hammer, PhD, translator of\nThe Romemu Siddur and author of The Book of Earth and Other\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Thanks to Trisha Arlin we observe\nRosh Hodesh Elul with prayers and blessings for animals.  Her extended\nblessing focusing on the smallest of animals - the bugs and even smaller - was\nastonishing:  funny, deep, thought-provoking.  It connected us all to\nthe Divine in a completely new way.\" ---Rabbi Ellen Lippmann, Kolot\nChayeinu/Voices of Our Lives\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Trisha Arlin\u2019s prayers create\nworlds of spiritual space that invoke a worshipful tone. Then they puncture\ncomplacency and boldly ask, badger, and provoke. They awaken us. And then they\nrestore the spiritual space, but we\u2019re a bit more comfortable in it because\nlike us, the prayers are faithful and faithless, hopeful and hopeless, serious\nand playful. The overall affect is a prayer spot wherein moderns who yearn may\nfind comfort, solace, and a smile.\" --Rabbi Jeff Hoffman,\nD.H.L., Rabbi-In-Residence and Director of Institutional\nAssessment, The Academy for Jewish Religion\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"In my congregation are published\nauthors and readers of professional quality as well as students and just plain\nfolk. They relish the opportunity to read one of Trisha\u0027s kavvanot aloud during\nservices. The rhythms of her poetry awaken our hearts on the High Holy Days and\nher words, real, alive and down to earth enhance our Shabbat worship experience\nthroughout the rest of the Jewish calendar year.\"--Rabbi Peg\nKershenbaum, Congregation B\u0027nai Harim, Pocono Pines, PA.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Trisha Arlin\u0027s prayer-poems are\nevocative, moving, and spiritual. I am constantly amazed by their deceptive\nsimplicity, which opens like a flower unfolding to reveal color upon color,\neach richer than the last.\"--Rabbi Jennifer Singer,Spiritual Leader,\nCongregation Kol HaNeshama, Board Member, ALEPH Alliance for Jewish\nRenewal\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\"Love\n  this [Rosh Hashana Amidah] and am sharing it again to Kol Hai this\n  year.\" ---Shir Yaakov Feit, Aleph Rabbinic Student, Spiritual\n  Leader, Kol Hai, New Paltz NY\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0 I know how to write words that are meant to be\nspoken out loud and heard in real time: \nI received a BA in Theater from Antioch College in 1975 and MFA in Film\n(Screenwriting) in 1997 from Columbia University School of the Arts. But I\nrealized I needed to know more about Judaism if I wanted to add depth and take\non tradition.  So, in 2009/2010, I was an\nArts Fellow at the Drisha Institute; in 2011, I graduated from the sixth cohort\nof the Davennen Leadership Training Institute (DLTI); and in 2012 I became a\npart-time second career rabbinic student at the Academy of Jewish Religion\n(AJR).  Traditionally, rabbinic students\ngo to seminary to be pulpit rabbis but I went to become a Sacred Artist.  A sample is here, something written for Yom Kippur, or see the video below, which is a piece I wrote for the seder, Four Children and Five Rabbis.:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(5, 45, 73);\"\u003eINSIDE THE HOLY OF HOLIES\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u00a9 2017 Trisha Arlin\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInside the Holy of Holies, I see\u003cbr\u003e\nAn empty room.\u003cbr\u003e\nThere is a roof on top of four walls\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd a door but no windows.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe declare the inside, divine\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd the outside, mundane.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is arbitrary but okay with me,\u003cbr\u003e\nI like holy separation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInside the Holy of Holies, I see\u003cbr\u003e\nJudgement.\u003cbr\u003e\nGod speaks to me and tells me\u003cbr\u003e\nOf God\u0027s disappointment with all my mistakes.\u003cbr\u003e\nI apologize and promise to do better.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe both know this is unlikely but God appreciates the sentiment.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is great for me,\u003cbr\u003e\nI have faith in the rituals.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInside the Holy of Holies, I see\u003cbr\u003e\nHate.\u003cbr\u003e\nI see racism, murder, ethnic cleansing,\u003cbr\u003e\nMisogyny, homo- and transphobia,\u003cbr\u003e\nRape, fascism, privilege,\u003cbr\u003e\nLies, manipulation, collusion.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf this is God,\u003cbr\u003e\nI give up.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInside the Holy of Holies I see\u003cbr\u003e\nHope.\u003cbr\u003e\nPeople rise up, demanding action.\u003cbr\u003e\nInvestigators and organizers reject cynicism and despair.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe light candles, pray and make change.\u003cbr\u003e\nEveryone votes and democracy rules.\u003cbr\u003e\nGod manifests\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd I rejoice.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInside the Holy of Holies, I see\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Jewish people.\u003cbr\u003e\nOur stories create me,\u003cbr\u003e\nOur culture animates me,\u003cbr\u003e\nOur society challenges me,\u003cbr\u003e\nOur past scars me.\u003cbr\u003e\nI couldn\u0027t escape them if I tried.\u003cbr\u003e\nCould be worse.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInside the Holy of Holies, I see\u003cbr\u003e\nMyself.\u003cbr\u003e\nYears of therapy allow me to make\u003cbr\u003e\nAn honest evaulation\u003cbr\u003e\nOf who and what I am.\u003cbr\u003e\nI criticize myself appropriately.\u003cbr\u003e\nI honor self-awareness,\u003cbr\u003e\nAnything else is boring.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInside the Holy of Holies, I see\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Infinite.\u003cbr\u003e\nI meditate on the Ruach Ha Olam\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd each breath is a prayer.\u003cbr\u003e\nI feel the Presence,\u003cbr\u003e\nI am unaware of the past and unworried about the future.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\nI give thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInside the Holy of Holies, I see\u003cbr\u003e\nThe God I need to see.\u003cbr\u003e\nToday, God is ancient wishful thinking.\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd tomorrow, Aveinu Malkeinu, Who will make miracles.\u003cbr\u003e\nNext week, I ponder the Fierce Mystery,\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd the week after, I know the One-ness that is everywhere in all things.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhatever.\u003cbr\u003e\nHere I am,\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the Holy Of Holies.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e"
