    "summary": "Ryle\u0027d Up Fans,\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ve shown us overwhelming support since we began performing for you. Together we have grown so much. You pushed us to pursue our music careers in Nashville and we thank you whole heartedly. We cannot say enough how important you all are to us. #getryledup\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been almost two months now of doing Ryle\u0027d Up live our weekly video (Sundays at 7pm Central) where you can request the songs you love to hear us play. We have had so much fun making these videos. However, it is no secret that making this weekly video for you all requires a lot of time, effort, and money. We are striving to provide the highest quality of video and content we can - and we\u0027ve come very far simply with what we have - but we call on you for support. If you love watching these videos and want us to continue regularly making them we ask that you consider becoming a patron of Ryle\u0027d Up. As a patron, we ask that you pledge 1$ during Ryle\u0027d Up live as a sort of subscription to our services - that being music entertainment and enjoyment. Just 1$ helps us so much. Think of it like tipping the band. Our goal with Ryle\u0027d Up Live is to bring you a live performance right in the comfort of your own homes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s talk about what you\u0027re money will go to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money goes for cost of equipment. We use iPhone cameras and they aren\u0027t cheap (have you seen the price of the new iPhone X). For our content to be competitive, we need to have or be able to recreate top of the line cameras. Other equipment includes iRig, Microphones, Lights, Recording Equipment, Apple Computer etc. Also, our video reach extends only so far - unless we use Facebook advertising - so money will be used to extend our reach to engage new viewers and patrons through advertising campaigns (you can see where this really starts to add up).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRielly works part time as a music instructor as well as a singing server at the Opry Backstage Grill. She is also training to become a part-time yoga instructor. These videos take time to rehearse, create, and setup, time taken away from what keeps us paying our rent. Musicians don\u0027t work for salary and benefits, we have to hold down multiple jobs and have alternative streams of income in order to thrive. Kyle spends anywhere between 40-80 hours on music in any given week. Between freelance work performing and in the studio as well as practicing, preparing, and rehearsing there isn\u0027t much time to do anything else. He is also a full time student and works part time as a Gallery Monitor at the Gallery of Iconic Guitars. We just want you all to know that we really do work hard. While we want to keep making music for you, we still have to make a living.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
