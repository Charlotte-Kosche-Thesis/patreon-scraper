\u00a0Depending on your patronage level, you will gain access to Jeffery the Artist\u0027s Independent Artist Supercharger Kit \u00a0which\u00a0is a package of documents that I have created designed to give an artist all the equipment they need to start building their fan base both online and offline, how to land gigs, how to monetize and get paid for your soundcloud plays, how to distribute your music to 150 music channels globally and get paid high royalties for your streams, how to create professional looking graphics for your music projects, how to create logos, how to create an EPK + easy program to do it, and a directory of almost 50,000 venues across the United States and Canada\u0027s categorized by genre and region, and a solicitation method for contacting these venues, as well as a guide gaining a local following through open mics. \u00a0You also get monthly promotion of your creative projects on the ever-growing TRiiiBE Worldwide fan page and eye catching caption videos!!
