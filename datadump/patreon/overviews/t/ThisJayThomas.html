    "summary": "As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a \u003cdel\u003egangster\u003c/del\u003e writer...\u003cbr\u003eBefore I had even reached the age of ten, I was obsessed with books. Like little Matilda from the Roald Dahl book, I would always be down at the Library and immersing myself in all manner of worlds. It was my solace. It was my bliss. When I got to ten, merely reading about such worlds was not enough. I wanted to create these worlds. I wanted to shape the characters that would inhabit them. And I wanted to craft the adventures these characters would go on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I began to do just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years, I wrote as much as I read. With every word, my hunger simply grew. My passion extended to include not just books, but television and movies. My need to create extended to not just writing stories, but poems and screenplays, even reviews and blogs. My bliss had transcended field or genre. I just wanted to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, coming from a small Island (the Isle of Wight to be exact), encouragement and opportunity was few and far between. Instead, I turned my attention to opportunities more consistently available. I spent many years training and working as a chef, but I garnered no fulfilment from it. The more days that passed, the more I slipped away from my dream. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t say all of this in order to garner sympathy. I say all of this in order to fully convey just how passionate I am about writing. After so many years of settling for what I felt I should do, I am finally embracing what I actually want to do. My dream has awoken and I am finally going to do whatever it takes to see it become a reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why I am here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the coming months, I will be stepping up on creating what I hope to be a network of sorts that will encompass all of social media. Through this network, I will be offering my unique thoughts and reviews of all things Film, TV, and Literary. As well as anything else people would like to see or hear my opinions on. As well as these, I will also be regularly posting extracts from novels and screenplays, short stories, poems, songs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese will mostly be posted in written form. But, with your help, I will be looking to quickly branch out into video-based reviews and podcast-driven discussion of all the aforementioned subjects. On top of that, I shall be seeking to create sketches and all manner of entertaining silliness that come to me along the way, once all channels and websites are up and running. I will also be seeking to get all poetry and fictional work published, either through a company or self-publishing, so that it can be more widely enjoyed in its natural form. If all of that goes well, who knows, maybe I will try my hand at bringing my screenplays to life...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI considered going a traditional route in my career, but the idea of\n writing directly for my readers is a much more exciting prospect to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, will you help me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you - and a free cookie - in advance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Examples of numerous, already written and published works can be found via the links below.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNo Escape Review\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"http://www.actinghour.com/reviews/no-escape\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.actinghour.com/reviews/no-escape\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKill Command Review\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"http://www.actinghour.com/reviews/kill-command\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.actinghour.com/reviews/kill-command\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTriple 9 Review\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"http://www.actinghour.com/reviews/triple-9\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.actinghour.com/reviews/triple-9\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Prey Review\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"http://www.actinghour.com/reviews/the-prey\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.actinghour.com/reviews/the-prey\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaper Towns Review\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"http://www.actinghour.com/reviews/paper-towns\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.actinghour.com/reviews/paper-towns\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterview with Peter Anthony\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"http://www.actinghour.com/interviews/the-man-who-saved-the-world-peter-anthony\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.actinghour.com/interviews/the-man-who-saved-the-world-peter-anthony\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
