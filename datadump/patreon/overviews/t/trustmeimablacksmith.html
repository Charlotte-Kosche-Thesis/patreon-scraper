    "summary": "I have been running my forge and business IAStudios in rural Herefordshire for about 3 years and I had quite a scary patch just before Christmas 2016. The 3 months leading up to that Christmas were some of my slowest ever and I was starting to think about the future of my business and whether or not the last 7 years had been worth the time and effort. With some help from a friend and the making of some hammers I\u0027m now here talking to you. Since starting the channel and working for a good friend I\u0027m reshaping my life and the business. I\u0027m rebuilding the business to fit what I want it to be and what I feel it should be. Part of that rebuild is growing the web site \u003ca href=\"http://www.iastudios.co.uk\"\u003ewww.iastudios.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e and the YouTube channel \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ3rO8Nb9I1p9Wh_lQ6ebew\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/channel/UCZ3rO8Nb9I1p9Wh_lQ6ebew\u003c/a\u003e to help promote my business. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo where do you come in? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell something unexpected happened, you guys and girls responded really well to my channel and with your help we made it to 500 subscribers in just over 4 months. That\u0027s amazing and better than I could have ever hoped for, but that achievement hasn\u0027t been easy. It\u2019s like having a second job. Which would be fine but I already have 2 so it\u2019s like having 3 jobs.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why bother pledging and helping me grow the channel, website and business further?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell if I could cover some of the costs of making videos for the channel by getting your help I can merge aspects of all 3 jobs into the channel. I will also be able to create extra content and more aspects to the channel, website and business giving you guy and girls access to the benefits. I would be able to buy much better recording and editing equipment. That would mean an increase in production values and hopeful a decrease in the amount of editing time. That would all add up to me being able to spend more time making videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support would also allow me to put time and money into growing the blacksmithing courses and the product side of the business and website. I would hope to be able to start an online blacksmith shop where you can get hold of all the tools and equipment you would need to grow your own forge and business. Also with the growth of the channel and website I would be able to get more and more students taking classes because of the increased awareness of the channel and myself.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy growing the channel, website and business in such a way I should be able to pass on knowledge, good quality products and savings to you guys and girls. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
