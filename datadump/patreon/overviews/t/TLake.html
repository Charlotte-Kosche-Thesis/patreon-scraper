    "summary": "My name is Taylor Lake and I write stories. A\nsimple premise without seasoning or twists that I\u2019ve been working off of for\nover a decade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello, and thanks for considering\nme among the many fine folks out there. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not expecting a\nwhole lot. I\u2019m not really here for the money, and I know that\u2019s not what I\u2019m\nasking of you anyways. Instead, what I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll donate is your time and\nattention, and that\u2019s no small thing to request. We live in fast world, and there\nare hundreds of thousands of writers out there right now, most of them working\nfor free as I\u2019ve done for years. A great many of them are probably a lot more\ntalented than I am. So why here, and why ask? Because what I\u2019m trying to find\nis an audience, and what I\u2019m trying to earn is support. And I\u2019d like to do that\nby writing stories with thoughtfulness and quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  First and\nforemost, everything that I write is done from a position of respect for my\nreaders. I believe that the best part of reading is giving the reader just\nenough to let them create their own vision of the work, and enough background\nto make it stable. On the other hand, you can expect me not to leave you\nhanging on important plot details and characterization. I do my best to think\nabout what I put down, so that if you\u2019re asking questions, it\u2019s not \u201cwho\u2019s\nthat?\u201d or \u201cwhen did that happen?\u201d I like to make my readers think, but I want\nyou to have every possible tool to draw informed conclusions. I also put my\nwriting through the editing wringer at least once, often three times. I believe\na professional writer owes it to their reader to make sure the copy they put\nout is as clean as it can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n  With those\nthings in mind, I write stories across many genres. I tend to write adventures\nmore than anything else, though my greatest joy lies in writing private eye\ndetective stories. I\u2019m not a prolific writer, but I want to do my best to get\nout one solid short story every month. If enough people would like me to do so,\nI may also share experimental writing (poetry mostly) and other things I dabble\nin, but overall the core of this patreon will be the presentation of one short\nstory per month. This is a tentative first step into a much larger writing\nworld, and I hope I\u2019ll be able to earn your support and trust as I take it.\u003cbr\u003e"
