We want to maximize how many people can find us. \u00a0That costs $20/episode i.e. $80/month. \u00a0We happily made those payments ourselves, but it\u0027s a challenge to sustain on our own!\u003cbr\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eVideo editing - \u003c/strong\u003eWe have an amazing editor who supports us in cutting our video content together.

Website \u0026amp; Mailchimp up-keep - \u003c/strong\u003eit\u0027s a vital resource to make our good information readily accessible!

Us \u003c/strong\u003e- dedicated to quality content, we put in a lot of time to find the right guests to answer our questions, and do the admin for posting an episode, video content, and social media. \u00a0It\u0027s a full time job as it turns out! We want to dedicate our full attention to the beautiful goal of showing others how to achieve personal fulfillment in relationships and sex - the answers are there if you have time to find them! We are quite nimble in our expenses, but living in L.A. means that $5,000/month allows us to break even. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5.

Every bit helps!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe created this podcast in March of 2014 with the goal of being completely transparent and honest with our personal experiences in sex, love and personal development in hopes of inspiring you to have the courage to do the same. \u00a0When we don\u0027t know the answer to something, we find an expert to answer all our questions with hard facts! Through the hilarity of our real life situations in sex and romance as a professional cuddler and sensual bodyworker, we lay everything out on the table: that cervical orgasm we had for the first time (and how to make that happen again), why our relationship failed, what we loved and didn\u0027t love about that mansion sex party, what deep fear or deep desire poked through on a date and why, and so much more. We found that people around us were very uncomfortable talking about these sorts of things or didn\u0027t feel they had permission to express this kind of stuff, and we get it! \u00a0Looking at our lives can be painful and downright uncomfortable, which is why most of us don\u0027t. But self examination with love is the only way to move forward if we want deeper connection, intimacy and better sex with our partners. \u00a0Our intention is to use our voices as relatable young women to normalize and cultivate our relationships to sex. \u00a0Our show signifies that you, the listener, have a right to enjoy sex and a right to express yourself. Now let\u0027s find the tools to do just that! \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eT\u0026amp;A Talk Sex is a podcast hosted by a professional cuddler and a sensual bodyworker. T\u0026amp;A (Christina Hepburn \u0026amp; Stephanie Allen), two treasure troves of sensuality and intimate connection, were baffled by how many of their lovers and clients marveled at their sensual capacities, yet fumbled when it came to their own.  In service to humanity (and themselves!), T\u0026amp;A share the wisdom from their real life experience with what works and what doesn\u2019t work to create deep, human connection and juicy sex. From swallowing cum to contemplating marriage, these women\u2019s anthropological approach to their love lives can\u2019t help but give you insight into your own. Gentlemen, thrill at the brilliance of a thoughtful female look into what women want and need, and ladies, find the empowerment in relationships and sex that you\u2019ve always wanted."
