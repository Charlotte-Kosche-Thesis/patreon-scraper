    "summary": "Welcome to the TPS Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re new\u2026\u003cem\u003eThe Pipeline Show\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(TPS) is hosted by me, Guy Flaming (yes, that \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e my real name). I created the program back in 2006 in an effort to provide coverage of junior and college\nhockey and introduce fans to the future stars of the NHL. I recruited a co-host and for the next 12 years, TPS was heard twice a week on TSN 1260 sports radio in Edmonton, AB Canada and online at \u003cu\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.thepipelineshow.com\"\u003ewww.thepipelineshow.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/u\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat separates \u003cem\u003eThe Pipeline Show\u003c/em\u003e from the plethora of hockey programs available is that TPS\u00a0is 100% focused on the leagues that produce tomorrow\u2019s NHL stars. To begin with, TPS covers Major Junior hockey in the form of all three CHL leagues (WHL, OHL, and QMJHL). In addition, we dive into the 10 CJHL leagues known as \u201cJr.A\u201d\nlike the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL), the United States Hockey League (USHL), NCAA College Hockey and professional minor leagues like the American Hockey League (AHL) and ECHL.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOver the last 12 years we have interviewed many of today\u2019s NHL superstars but did so at an age when they were still playing amateur hockey, often conducting that player\u2019s\nfirst major interview. Interviewing players is just the tip of the iceberg. Coaches, scouts, General Managers, beat writers and broadcasters are all primary guests on TPS.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen the show first left radio and became 100% podcast, some of you expressed an interest in helping support \u003cem\u003eThe Pipeline Show\u003c/em\u003e financially. A listener from Ontario sent me a $50 E-Transfer (bless you \u201cRob\u201d!) but I wasn\u2019t comfortable accepting his \u201cdonation\u201d\nwithout being able to give something back, despite his insistence. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to start charging my audience a subscription fee to download the show. They have faithfully supported TPS for over a decade without \u003cem\u003ehaving\u003c/em\u003e to dip into their wallets; it wouldn\u2019t be fair to force that on anyone. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is where \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way for the \u201cRobs\u201d out there to support the show while allowing me to provide some \u201cpayback\u201d with a clear conscience. The way Patreon works is a\nlistener (or \u201cPatron\u201d) can donate whatever they want on an ongoing monthly basis. Several suggested levels are available but anything right from the $2 level will really help to keep TPS financially viable. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s important to note that everything you have enjoyed for free up to this point \u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003ewill still be free\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e but as a \u201cPatron\u201d you will have access to some exclusive, bonus content from TPS.   \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat the Money Will Be Used For\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHere are the costs involved in the ongoing production of \u003cem\u003eThe Pipeline Show\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0as a\u00a0podcast:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Hosting:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The website (\u003cu\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.thepipelineshow.com\"\u003ewww.thepipelineshow.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/u\u003e) was created and is maintained by my brother\u2019s company (DLM Consulting) so I get the family discount but he still has to pay his guys something and just the monthly hosting costs add up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Soundcloud:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0The service by which I upload each show so that it is available in our archive and at your favorite podcast provider. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Travel\u003c/strong\u003e: Covering the various events that I do for \u003cem\u003eThe Pipeline Show\u003c/em\u003e can add up. Fortunately, in the past I have managed to cover some of the expenses by trading radio advertising (like the trip to Helsinki in 2016 to cover the World Junior Championship or the 2011 USHL Top Prospects\nGame). However, to attend a Frozen Four or Memorial Cup on my own is another story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Equipment\u003c/strong\u003e: Converting the office space in my home to a workable studio with quality recording equipment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Guests:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Some of the big name, recurring guests that we\u2019ve had on \u003cem\u003eThe Pipeline Show\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0in the past are used to getting paid for their radio appearances so that could be an added expense now too.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- ME\u003c/strong\u003e: I didn\u2019t get into this to become rich but I also need to be able to look my wife in the eye and say that I\u2019m contributing, not just living off of her. I\u2019m\nthe \u201cstay at home\u201d parent in our family and \u003cem\u003eThe Pipeline Show\u003c/em\u003e has been my part time job while she\u2019s saving lives and making a difference in the real world. I\u2019d\nlike to buy her some romantic things like groceries or gas for her car, maybe cover the phone bill.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThose are the basics. With those expenses covered, TPS will be able to support itself without depending on corporate sponsorship. It goes without saying that I would greatly appreciate\nyour financial support but I\u0027ll say it anyway. \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe Patreon model has us offer up rewards to entice you to donate but I believe that you\u0027re here because you appreciate \u003cem\u003eThe Pipeline Show\u003c/em\u003e and the uniqueness of the content that we provide. If you choose to donate on an ongoing basis, you will have my unending gratitude. If you just want to keep listening\nto \u003cem\u003eThe Pipeline Show\u003c/em\u003e for free, that\u2019s fine too but do me a favor and tell a friend or three about the program and encourage them to give us a listen.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSincerely, \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGuy Flaming\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe Pipeline Show\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eSome royalty free music heard during the show provided by:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.purple-planet.com\"\u003ewww.purple-planet.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eKevin MacLeod at\u00a0\u003cu\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html\"\u003eincompetech.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.purple-planet.com\"\u003ewww.freestockmusic.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
