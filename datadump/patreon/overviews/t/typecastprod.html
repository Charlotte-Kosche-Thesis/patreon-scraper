    "summary": "TypeCast Productions is a brand new theatre company based in Edinburgh. Our first project is currently in development for a full three week run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2018. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a production company there are some values that will absolutely apply to all shows regardless of how much support we can generate, namely:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNew Writing: We will have an emphasis on not only new adaptations and original writing but also on new playwrights. Our first project, Ganymede, is my first piece of writing and I hope to work with other first-time writers for future projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExperienced Voices: We will aim to cast any sensitive or minority roles with actors who can bring their own voice to the character. For Ganymede this will be an LGBT focus including at least one role which will require casting a transgender actor. My hope is to bring them in at an early stage in development so they can be a part of creating their character at a scripting level, if successful, pre-casting an Experienced Voice could become a regular feature of future TypeCast productions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third hope is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003eParticularly in the Fringe, There are a lot of companies who occupy that grey area between amateur and professional, who can\u0027t afford to offer fair pay to their cast and crew (often made up of very experienced amateurs, theatre students and the like). Profit shares are common but they generally barely cover expenses for the duration of the show and can\u0027t hope to acknowledge what is often 6 months of rehearsal time. Patreon support early in the year could fund a workshop-style audition day to pre-cast Ganymede, and pay a professional photographer to shoot marketing/trailer/BTS videos, but the ultimate goal is to be able to offer a core staff of 4 people from the beginning of November, adding a full cast of 8 from the beginning of April and a further 4 crew from the beginning of June, a minimum of full expenses, preferably minimum wage. And the final goal would be to offer an Equity contract.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you get back for your investment, aside from the warm fuzzies knowing you\u0027re supporting new talent? Everyone will be credited on our social media and any programs we give out for our shows, and complementary tickets will be available to most levels. At the end of each show run there will be thank-you packages sent out to all our patrons, with varying contents depending on your pledge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, if we do create any behind the scenes videos these will be exclusively available to patrons until August when they will likely be publicly released as part of our marketing effort during Fringe, and if we are able to film the show itself, there will be early access for that as well. Pledge level descriptions will be updated as and when we are able to confirm these further offers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far and are ready to help us out, great! A huge pre-emptive thank you from us here at TypeCast, and we look forward to hearing from you if there\u0027s a project or page you\u0027d like us to tell our media followers about. If you can\u0027t donate just now, that\u0027s ok too. You can still help by sharing this Patreon and our social media links with your friends and followers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
