     "description": "In 2012 CJ and Brian were talking about the Disney movie \u201cWreck-It Ralph\u201d\u003cbr\u003eIt was during this discussion CJ made an outrageous statement. Even after the success of \u201cWreck-It Ralph\u201d there is no chance of a sequel. Brian (knowing how stupid this was) issued a slap bet. If there was a sequel to this movie he can slap CJ has hard as he can. CJ took the bet and after 5 years of thinking he was in the clear, Disney has officially announced \u201cWreck-It Ralph 2\u201d\u003cbr\u003eIf we reach our goal we have some big plans\u003cbr\u003e1. We will live stream the slap\u003cbr\u003e2. We will release a limited edition \u201cCJ Slap\u201d T-Shirt\u003cbr\u003e3. Josh will match what is donated.\u003cbr\u003e",
