    "summary": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Tem, and thank you for taking the time to stop by my patreon. I\u0027m a sophomore game design and animation student at college who also works on both original stories and, at present, a Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum Nuzlocke called \u003cem\u003eCertainty of Dishonor.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you\u0027ll not only unlock some of the behind-the-scenes work for \u003cem\u003eCertainty of Dishonor\u003c/em\u003e, but you\u0027ll also help support my living on a very low wage. Because of my project-intensive class schedule, I don\u0027t have the liberty of having many work hours, so I am currently running on very little money for food or other things that I might need. Any money at all is very appreciated and a big help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in finding my work, you can follow my \u003ca href=\"https://temorali.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantart\u003c/a\u003e, which is where I post most of my finished artworks, both for my own personal projects such as \u003cem\u003eTime of Death\u003c/em\u003e, and my Nuzlocke comic, \u003cem\u003eCertainty of Dishonor\u003c/em\u003e. Just want to follow up on my comic? You can follow me on my \u003ca href=\"https://certainty-of-dishonor-nuzlocke.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e, where I post Fun Fact Fridays, character sketches, updates, and other nuzlocke-related content that you might not see on my Deviantart. Just interested in page updates and nothing else? I\u0027m also on the \u003ca href=\"http://s7.zetaboards.com/Nuzlocke_Forum/topic/11027549/1/?x=0#post11079996\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNuzforums\u003c/a\u003e!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you don\u0027t have money to give, any and all support is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for taking an interest in the things I do.\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f"
