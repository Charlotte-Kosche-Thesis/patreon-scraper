    "summary": "Hey! I\u0027m Tony. \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a trumpeter, keyboardist, composer, and producer\u003c/strong\u003e\nwith a million things to say through music. At the age of 23 I have\nalready recorded on over twenty studio albums, including my own four jazz records.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI write all of my own music\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and am also frequently commissioned to compose for big bands, pop groups, classical chamber\nensembles, and even television and film. In addition to writing and recording I also play over 100 live shows a year, fortunate to be consistently collaborating\nwith some amazing artists.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe bottom line is that I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003ereally excited\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eabout music\u003c/strong\u003e, I really \u003cstrong\u003ebelieve in its importance\u003c/strong\u003e, and I want\nto \u003cstrong\u003eshare it \u003c/strong\u003eall with as many people\nas possible. But as a young entrepreneur I don\u2019t always have the finances\nto produce everything I want, let alone everything \u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003ewant.

There is\nso much that goes into producing music: the time and creative energy it takes to compose and arrange, hours of practicing and rehearsing, recording in the\nstudio, hiring sound and video teams, purchasing and maintaining all\nof the equipment we use, and of course the brilliant musicians themselves. By\nsupporting me through Patreon you make all of this possible. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?
