A full, custom redesign done by a web designer and\ndeveloper who really knows what they\u2019re doing (that is, someone who is not me \u2014\nI\u2019ve hired the wonderful Megan Gray of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.houseofgrays.com/\"\u003eHouse of Grays\u003c/a\u003e for the job) will vastly improve\nfunctionality, offering better navigation and greater ease of access while\nstill keeping the spooky atmosphere we all know and love intact. The redesign\nwill also include things like a logo and a stronger visual identity, making the\nwhole site much more of an Experience for you, Gentle Readers. Reaching this\ngoal consistently for 12 months will fund the redesign, installation, and launch.\u003cbr\u003e",
