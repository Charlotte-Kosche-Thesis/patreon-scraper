    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eThe Psongs Project\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaige is a freelancing musician living in Canada. Alberta to be exact. Edmonton to be really exact. I write, record, and perform music in my band Hold for Home. I\u0027ve been a Christian since I was probably something like 7 and I\u0027ve been involved in musical worship at my church for 12 years. After all those years, I have decided to contribute to the great body of Christian music that is out there. However, I also wanted to begin a project I\u0027ve been eager to start: arranging the exact English translations of the psalms to music for English speakers. The psalms are such a large collection of early worship poems and songs; I wanted to connect to that collection of scripture first.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNathan is a multi-faceted freelance musician who enjoys wearing many different\n musical hats. He is a music educator, a multi-instrumentalist, a \nsought-after soloist (vocal) and can be seen singing in the national \naward winning Chronos Vocal Ensemble as well as in Edmonton\u2019s \nprofessional choir, Pro Coro Canada.\nNathan graduated from The King\u2019s University with a Bachelor of Arts \nin Music. He has been leading worship for more than 10 years, and has \ncombined his passion for leading worship with his passion for music \neducation in his vocation as the Director of Music Ministries at The \nChristian Reformed Church of St. Albert. He loves to incorporate \ndifferent genres and traditions of music into worship, which is one of \nthe reasons he is excited about the Psongs Project. Together, with \nPaige, they combine the right style of music with a melody that \nbeautifully reflects what each Psalm is saying.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, we turned to Patreon to support this project. And you\u0027re probably here because you enjoy worship music or you enjoy musical tools to memorize scripture. For our supporters, we will set and arrange the lyrics of the psalms to modern, Western music to form \"psongs\" that can speak truths about the power, wisdom, and unchanging presence of God.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider supporting us in this project so we can get as much great content out to you as possible. Thank you for your support! Join us in worshiping our God!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScripture quotations are taken from the Holy Bible, New Living Translation, copyright \u00a91996, 2004, 2007, 2013, 2015 by Tyndale House Foundation.
