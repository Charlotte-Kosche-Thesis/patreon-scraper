    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m \u003cstrong\u003eThe Guitar Geek!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eYou probably already know that as you\u0027ve probably already seen some of my videos. Before we go any further - \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK-YOU\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou probably also know that I make guitar gear demos and reviews. You may not know that I am trying to do this full-time. I\u0027ve been lucky enough to work with music most of my life and honestly, it\u0027s been great. I\u0027ve toured, I\u0027ve travelled, I\u0027ve met and played with heroes. I\u0027ve also faced disappointment, betrayal and setbacks \u003cem\u003e(that was a tough morning) \u003c/em\u003ejust because the music industry is a tough area to work in. I\u0027ve put all the experience and knowledge into The Guitar Geek so that I can bring you honest information backed up by some educated opinions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had a YT channel BEFORE The Guitar Geek \u003cem\u003e(It\u0027s still online, see if you can find it) \u003c/em\u003ebut TGG has by far been the most rewarding project in my professional life. I\u0027ve met amazing people and every person that leaves me a comment makes me smile\u003cem\u003e, (yes even the nasty ones)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I mean is that I am SO grateful to you, my loyal followers and fans. We are a great community and I\u0027m achieving some of the goals I set for myself when I started TGG. I wanted friendly, honest videos for people that want to be entertained and educated. I take the time to check out new gear so that you have some kind of reference point when you are thinking about spending you hard-earned cash.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, here we are - Hard-earned cash.... Yes, I do make a little bit of money from YouTube advertising but it\u0027s SO insignificant that it doesn\u0027t come close to putting food on my table. I want The Guitar Geek to flourish and I want you to keep receiving useful information. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf my videos are helping you make choices about gear or helping you enjoy the gear you already have then \u003cstrong\u003ethat should be worth something to you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf my videos simply make you laugh or feel something - \u003cstrong\u003ethat should be worth something to you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf my videos have saved you money, either with a promo code or by helping you to not make the wrong purchase for you - \u003cstrong\u003ewhat is that worth to you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eIt honestly doesn\u0027t matter how much you contribute but if even 10% of you gave a few bucks per month, I could operate the channel full-time AND feed and clothe my family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will stay independent and honest whatever happens but now I need your help to do this more often and more efficiently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have big plans for the channel, more gear reviews, more trips to places where I can review the newest gear and collaberation videos with your other favourite YouTubers. Please help me, Andrew, quit my day job and \u003cstrong\u003ebecome\u00a0The Guitar Geek all-day, every-day\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
