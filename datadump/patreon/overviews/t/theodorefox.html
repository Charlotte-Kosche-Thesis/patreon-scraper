    "summary": "Hi! My name\u0027s Theodore Fox and I\u0027m a writer living and working in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery week for the last six months I\u0027ve been writing my column\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://blog.latitude53.org/tagged/sunday_poems\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSunday Poems\u003c/a\u003e, a poem accompanied by a short article, which was supported by my position as Writer in Residence at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://latitude53.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLatitude 53\u003c/a\u003e. I hear from readers all of the time that reading the poem has become a ritual and an anchoring part of their week. Sadly, my term has come to an end, but I\u0027d really like to continue writing a poem every week for you on my blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s important to me to keep publishing Sunday Poems for free on the internet, but it does take a lot of time each week to put the post together and share it with as many people as you can. To help me spend as much time as I can publishing free work online, I would appreciate your financial support here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a website to support creators who are writing, making videos, or making art. You, dear reader, can choose a monthly pledge in \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e amount to support the work I\u0027m doing. Donate as little or as much as my work is worth to you. Every month Patreon will send me the money it gathers from supporters and I will use that money to fund Sunday Poems and other future projects. As we get to various monthly totals, I can grow Sunday Poems in the ways described in the goals column on this page. It\u0027s great to have my webhosting and other small expenses paid for but I can use some of the money to pay other up and coming writers or illustrators to do interesting work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been using Patreon as a supporter for years, and it\u0027s allowed me to pay creative people whose work I appreciate (but might not be commercially viable). I strongly encourage you, even if you don\u0027t choose to support me on Patreon, to browse this website to see if there\u0027s anyone else who you\u0027d like to subscribe to. Even a tiny pledge from a few dozen or few hundred people can make a huge difference in an artist\u0027s life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf don\u0027t have money to spare, but still want to help me and the work I\u0027m doing, please share this page, or a link to Sunday Poems with the people you know who might appreciate it. Word of mouth is pretty the only way my work can reach new people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTheodore Fox\u003cbr\u003e"
