    "summary": "\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWell, by now I\u2019m sure you have realized that we Depreys are\na very rare breed who must be going, achieving and learning every minute of\nevery day.  You know that we have decided to embark on an extremely crazy\nonce in a lifetime adventure of traveling and searching for a new place to settle and build a home all while living full time in our Fifth Wheel.We have finally found our little piece of heaven in the foothills of NC and are currently embarking on a DIY home build..\u00a0 You honestly never know what you will see when you come to our channel. Between my ever going Fred and I we always have some kind of shenanigans going on !\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always we make sure to\nshare all of our shenanigans with you, our faithful friends! Via You Tube,\nour website \u003ca href=\"http://www.werv.tv/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.TheDepreys.com \u003c/a\u003eas well as our FaceBook group. Weather you are looking for some tips on fulltime living in your RV,RV trip craziness or DIY home building tips I can assure you we have a video that will help offer some insight. As well as helping you to avoid some of our mishaps\nand disasters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoss shows you the dirty side of things while dragging Heather along for some help .All while Heather shows you some DIY beauty tips,cooking and crafty fun. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you follow us on our You Tube channel, you have seen us\nin almost all of our adventures as well as the upgrades and\ntutorials that we have posted. Let us not forget about all the cooking tips\nthat we have shared as well. Yes ladies, you can make a full course meal in an\nRV.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSoo why  Patreon and how can you help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs most of you know we purchase and fund every piece of\nequipment we use to bring you our videos as well as the gear used in our type\nof lifestyle. While we enjoy bringing our videos to you and documenting our\ncrazy adventures and the DIY Building process this is not something we get paid to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e While we do earn a\nlittle bit from before video ads it does not add up to the hours Ross (AKA\nFreddie) spends filming and editing our videos.  While our site is a team\nproduction, Ross spends hours a night going through our daily shots and editing\nthem into an entertaining, knowledge filled video for everyone to enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSome have asked why we are choosing Patreon and not another\nfunding campaign.  Well, first of patreon allows you our viewers the\nchoice of help us fund our shenanigans on a per video or monthly basis. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile\nwe usually put up a video every day on our adventures we \u00a0will be intentionally skipping \u00a0a few days from time to time. So we will be going for more of a quality video than quantity from here on in. Your patronage will be helping us to fund some\nspecial adventures that you help us to decide on , As well as help us to update\nour video and editing equipment, thus enabling us to continue bringing you\namazing quality videos. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to helping us build our community to help\neach and every person no matter what journey they are on.  We are not saying that there will\nbe a charge for our Vids on You Tube or joining our Face Book group. All of\nthose videos have always been free and will continue to remain free. Those who\nchoose to contribute will get a little bit extra and receive other perks that\nare not offered on our YouTube or website. Hop on over to see how you can help\nus to make a difference . \u003cbr\u003e"
