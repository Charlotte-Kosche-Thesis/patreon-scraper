As we grow, we want to start making Live Action Adaptations as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat makes Site-42 worth supporting via Subscription or Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Site-42 believes in going several extra miles when it comes to content. The Site-42 staff are performers from various walks of life; theatre, film, voice over, singing, directing, and writing. The goal is to pour all of that into exceptionally well-made content. For some of our most exciting samples, check out \u003cstrong\u003eSCP-3001,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eSCP-3999\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eSCP-3043\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eS.D.

Make Audio Adaptations to build an audience and build up a small budget.\u003cbr\u003e2. Start spreading the wealth around the SCP Community, encouraging other artists of various types to work with us and even paying for art because working for free is rough.\u003cbr\u003e3. Get large enough to open \u003cstrong\u003eSite-42 Studios\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0with a recurring crew and cast for Live Action SCP Videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I need to pay to see your content?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0There are no plans to implement a paywall. Patrons of $1 a month and upward do receive access to Patron-Only Chat (which is the quickest way to access Site-42 staff as the comments on YouTube can be a bit of an avalanche) as well early access to recordings and other rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is behind Site-42?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Site-42 is currently run mostly by TheeSherm.
