    "summary": "Welcome to the Game Chasers Insider\u0027s Club\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Billy from the Game Chasers. I have has this account for a while now, but I only used it to support friends and channels I like. Now after long consideration I have decided to turn it into a creator page. My dream has always been to create content for people, and for the last 4 years, after doing video for other people I am pursing my passion. So why am I doing this? Here is some back story: I pretty much take all the ad revenue from the channel. It inst enough for one person to live on but its enough that I can justify putting as much work as I do with the channel as it is essentially a part time job. I can only devote a certain \u00a0amount of time to the channel because I have to do other video freelance work as well. Melvor can only edit in his spare time after working 60 hours a week, and Jay has a full time job himself. Those two guys have put in a ton of work without much in return. I know some might say that its \"just youtube\" but sometimes things can evolve into so much more. We love providing you with content, and we would love the opportunity to get paid doing what we love, just like any other entertainment artist, musician/actor/movie maker...etc, so we can do more of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know if we hit certain goals we can provide people with more of what they want. It would be amazing if we could at some point be able to get an office that we could all work at making videos as our job. I know a ton of people have asked for me to put this up. We have sold merch like DVD\u0027s but some people dont want stuff, they just want to throw a few bucks your way to help you keep doing your thing. This is for you. Speaking of DVD\u0027s, any profit from them has gone into the show like Trips/equipment/ and recently a new game chasing mobile for all the miles and traveling we do.We dont have a stable income for the biggest issue: freeing up our time to make more videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can look at this as a subscriber upgrade program, or advantage program you would see on a website that allowed you to get extra content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know some of you have wanted us to do this for a while. Even if you dont want to be in the Game Chasers Insider Club, you will still have your game chaser episodes just like always. Everything on the channel will still be there, we just want to make it more of it. If you want to see the Game Chasers take things to the next level, and you want to sponsor us as me make \"homebrew TV\", now is your chance. You have always been awesome to us and very supportive, so no matter what you do, thank you for everything."

     "about": "I have been a video producer for 14 years now creating commercials, corporate videos, weddings, and recently youtube videos. I love doing it and it is my passion. The great thing about youtube is that it has allowed me to create video content that I want to make as opposed just to making videos for a client. It has been my dream for 14 years to do this but until recently that dream wasn\u0027t realistic. Bills have to get paid so having a job making corporate videos sucked up all my time. Now for the last 3 years I am pursuing this. Im earning way less money now and sometimes its been a struggle keeping the lights on but at least I get to make content I want to make. For now. I still have to take on other jobs to pay the bills but maybe some day I can make a full time living doing my dream job. I\u0027snt that what we a stride for?",
