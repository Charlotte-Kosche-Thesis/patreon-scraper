My videos are already in use by major corporations, government agencies, foundations, and 7th grade thru college level classes to train mainstream people in a basic understanding of these identities, and how to act respectfully to individuals who live them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s an example. My TED Talk is much longer than most of the videos I will create, but it gives you an idea of how I charm conservatives and encourage everyone to embrace transgender people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWubtUnSfA0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProject 2: \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ll also be writing short essays and stories that I will eventually collect in a book whose aims mirror the videos: to instruct and inspire, educate and entertain, and make the world smarter and safer for gender diverse people. The book is in proposal form, and is currently being repped by a top narrative nonfiction agency, with a view to being published in 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.onlevelground.org/blog-archives/dialogue/how-i-stopped-being-queer-and-learned-to-be-happy\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHere\u0027s an example of a blog post that tells an instructional story from my life about the trans and queer politics of our time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow would you like me to support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough the wonders of crowd funding, just $1 per post or video from you -and others- adds up, and allows me to spend more time -help more people- and put more good out there. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, to answer your question, \u003cstrong\u003e$1 per post and a share on social media about my work\u003c/strong\u003e would support me amazingly!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you post?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI will never make more than 5 posts per month. Ideally, it\u0027ll be more like 2-3 per month, sometimes less. Also, you can jump off any time, and re-commit when it works for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you choose to be my Patron, you will have exclusive access to my videos and posts on the Patrons Only page before they are released. If you have comments or critique, you can share and be part of the process -I don\u0027t read the comments on youtube! I will thank you in the book, and make sure you get a signed copy or ebook when it\u0027s published. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to contact me @turnerschofield on all the social medias, or at speakingoftransgender@gmail.com if you you have questions about anything.\u003cbr\u003e"
