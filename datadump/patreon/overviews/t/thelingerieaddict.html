I also love tea, comic books, science fiction and hard candy, and I\u0027ve just recently moved to Manhattan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thelingerieaddict.treaclemediallc.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/the-lingerie-addict-lars-kommienezuspadt-nyc-4.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy original career was in nonprofits, but I\u0027ve\n been writing about lingerie for almost 10 years. \u003c/strong\u003eThough I\u0027m an industry outsider, intimate apparel is my passion, and I see my \nmission as making the world of underthings friendlier, easier to \nunderstand, and more accessible to people who feel like it\u0027s not for \nthem (which is most of us, I\u0027ve found!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistorically, The \nLingerie Addict has focused primarily on lookbooks, lingerie shopping guides and \nproduct reviews - with the occasional more in-depth piece from time to time. And we\u0027re going to keep publishing that kind of content. However, I\u0027d also like \nto expand The Lingerie Addict\u0027s outlook, because I truly believe we can be more than \"just\" a \nlingerie blog. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink more in-depth articles (how about a tour of a lingerie factory?), more videos (would you like to watch someone sew a bra from start to finish?), and more fashion \neditorials (because lingerie is for everybody and \u003cem\u003eevery body\u003c/em\u003e...and the photos we see should reflect that).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thelingerieaddict.treaclemediallc.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/made-in-eighty-5.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOver the years, I\u0027ve learned\n The Lingerie Addict\u0027s most important asset - the one thing we need to \nhang on to at all costs - is our independence. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Lingerie Addict\u0027s perspective on lingerie is different from many other places. We focus on the fashion of lingerie, and being dedicated to a single topic means we can cover it in a way other outlets are unable to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have over 2,000 published articles in our archives, and while we are definitely a fashion blog, we also spotlight brands covering a wide range of sizes, share lingerie options for trans people, and discuss how lingerie intersects with conditions like fibromyalgia and vulvodynia. Furthermore, an emphasis on diverse and representative imagery is interwoven throughout the blog. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTLA\u0027s inclusive approach to lingerie is an \u003cem\u003eessential\u003c/em\u003e part of\n what we do, and I feel like it\u0027s more important than ever to \nhave a platform that makes people feel welcome and wanted - no matter their size, \nage, budget, race, religion, or ability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://thelingerieaddict.treaclemediallc.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/TLAhighresolution015-1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027ve ever wanted a more inclusive vision of the fashion industry - and of the lingerie industry, specifically - you can help make that a reality by supporting our \nPatreon.
