     "about": "My name is Tom Talks and 10 years ago I was so crippled with back pain I could barely walk. Sometimes my sciatica was so bad I had to crawl to the bathroom in the middle of the night. When my back did get better and I was able to lift weights, my body didn\u2019t change very much and I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. Through educating myself over the years, I\u2019ve learned how simple diet and training can be. You don\u2019t need to kill yourself with cardio or eat an awful diet that is not sustainable. Stick around with me and I will share my knowledge, play some games together, and journey through life together! It\u2019s TOMINATION TIME!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m an easy going gamer who enjoys learning and succeeding. I enjoy teaching and that is exactly what will happen here. I will share what I\u2019ve learned and you will walk away smarter and healthier. More importantly, we will walk together! I want to help you and see you on your journey as well! This is all going to happen while I am playing games. Yes, that\u2019s right. You can play games and get fit at the same time! What time?
