This means that as Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, and yes, Zayn Malik start their paths as solo artists, we will be right there with them. We\u2019ll be sharing our opinions on songs like Niall\u0027s new single This Town, our favorite 1D tattoos, and what we want each boy to do in their solo careers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur weekly podcast is free on iTunes, but if you are looking for extra 1D content, we would LOVE your support here on Patreon! Here we will be uploading extra episode segments every week--rewatching the ever famous X Factor Video Diaries, sharing our REAL thoughts on topics we deemed too explicit for the main show (#weedgate, fandom shipping, etc.), and playing more wacky 1D games. Also, get ready for some vlogs from us and inside access into the creation of our podcast, perhaps you will even guest host on an episode! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all your support \u0026lt;3\u00a0Talk Direction\u2014By the fans, for the fans!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/talk-direction-one-direction/id1016622858?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSubscribe on iTunes here!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Talk_Direction\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFollow us on Twitter here!\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"mailto:talkdirection@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEmail us here!\u003c/a\u003e"
