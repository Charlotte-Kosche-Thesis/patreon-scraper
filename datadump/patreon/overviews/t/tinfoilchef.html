    "summary": "It was in November of 2009 that I first started vlogging.\u00a0 I found that I loved making videos and interacting with viewers and the community that grew around vlogging activities such as the YouTube Orbit and groups of people supporting each other in their efforts to lose weight. Then in March of 2011 I discovered Minecraft and an aspect of video making I never knew existed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOver the years since then I\u0027ve made over 300 episodes in my single player vanilla Minecraft series, joined the Hermitcraft server first on FTB and then the vanilla server as well.\u00a0 I also branched out to include six seasons of Kerbal Space Program as it has grown through development, and Skyrim..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile I am continuing to produce new videos as often as possible, lately I\u0027ve had a number of money problems that take my attention away from the thing I love doing the most, making videos.\u00a0 Your support will help me get those matters straight so that I can fully focus on making lots of great videos as well as keep my gear up to date and able to produce the best quality possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI should also point out that I prefer to be more relaxed and chilled out in my videos.\u00a0 Unlike too many people I\u0027m not going to be cursing or yelling \u0026amp; screaming in my commentary or generally carrying on like an over-excited child.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile sometimes a \"choice\" word or two may slip out in the heat of the moment, I avoid using \"strong language\" in my videos because I know that there are plenty of people watching that find such things offensive and because it really is possible to communicate without resorting to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always referred to my single player Minecraft world as \"The Empire\".\u00a0 I am continuing that theme below.\u003cbr\u003e"
