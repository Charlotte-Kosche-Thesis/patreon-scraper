If you have become a patreon member already then THANK YOU SO MUCH! \u00a0Though if you are not (and transparency is something that I always put first here on the channel) then I will try to answer that obvious big question of - why Patreon, and of course, what\u0027s in it for you? \u00a0Well the channel now has well over 200k subs, however it honestly doesn\u0027t pay that well at all... in fact I would be making less money than a guy working at a supermarket full time in Australia... and I am usually doing 60-70 hours a week on the channel, constantly finding myself without any time for anything else, and in order to get the extra money that would be needed to upgrade things like camera gear, paying bills, buying different parts for computers etc. (which I recently purchased a sony A7S ii with your help, again thank you so much!) I need to turn to other methods of funding than just Youtube\u0027s typical service of ads and amazon and ebay\u0027s affiliate links.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother special we provide for patreon contributors is access to a monthly live stream that Steve (from Hardware Unboxed) and I broadcast once a month, so if you have anything you would like to ask and need help with something then just post it here and we will address it in the next live show. \u00a0We would like to ideally make this two times a month if possible as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the personal stuff, it\u0027s no lie if you have seen my videos that I have been through a lot with the Japan phase of life (if you have followed us that long, then again thank you!), divorced and screwed over from the Japanese law system (essentially losing any visiting rights to my now gorgeous 5 year old son...) it has been extremely tough to go through life the last 2 years, with the content and channel certainly having it\u0027s ups and downs. \u00a0Though as of August 2017, it is now on to a new start, no more burrowing my head, time to move! \u00a0And in the future I would love to take on someone\u00a0to help film and edit,\u00a0that is the dream\u00a0going\u00a0from hereon -\u00a0as I always seemed to be time starved and would love to deliver a video every single day of the week for you guys - that is the goal!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the videos, appreciate honest reviews and content\u00a0that are laced with some random entertainment, then Tech YES City is the place to come to :).\u003cbr\u003e"
