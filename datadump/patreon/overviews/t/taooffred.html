    "summary": "I\u0027ve spent my life immersed in a world of ideas. Relentlessly, I read about philosophy, religion, and psychology \u2014 the wisdom of the ages. With every great book I pick up, I come across an idea, or handful of ideas, that makes a profound impact. Some of them stick, and others sadly slip away.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a way of preserving the most meaningful and provocative of these ideas for myself, I took to encapsulating them into short verses of lyrical poetry. The limerick, rhyming and galloping in anapest meter, is arguably the most whimsical form of poetic expression in the English language. So I could imagine no better \u2014or more concise, or more paradoxical \u2014 way to capture these deep and esoteric notions, from the pages of Homer, Genesis, the Bhagavad Gita, Heidegger, Nietzsche and so many others. And next thing you know, I find myself with an all-consuming project, surrounded by scraps of paper with rhyming scribbles referring to Spinoza\u0027s Ethics, Pascal\u0027s Wager, or Schroedinger\u0027s Cat.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more than a dozen years I have been building myself a veritable library of limericks. For me they serve as touchstones, little mnemonic devices that transport me back to the source materials, the legends, the myths, the dialogs, and the treatises from the greatest thinkers and story tellers of all time. I hope that in some small way, my short poems can also help convey a spark of those enormous ideas to others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration and for supporting me in my ongoing project. And if there\u0027s topic, an author, a premise, or a paradox that you\u0027d like to see ensconced in limerick form, please don\u0027t hesitate to ask."
