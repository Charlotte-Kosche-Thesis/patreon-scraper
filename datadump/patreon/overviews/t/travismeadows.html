But I write so many other songs that you won\u0027t hear anywhere else, and these bitches are GOOD! \u00a0(*ahem*)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get asked all the time how people can get copies of the songs I write that they hear me play in a songwriters\u0027 round, or at a home show. \u00a0And there are songs that I love that I never play out, that never get recorded (in fact, less than 5% of my songs are ever get played publicly, in any format).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, I have finally found a way I can share what I think are some of my best uncut songs with the true fans of my music. \u00a0Patreon is like an ongoing kickstarter campaign that allows me to share more music with you. \u00a0You can support each song for as little as $1, and set a maximum limit per month if you\u0027d like. \u00a0I plan to do a song per week.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m dreaming big about all the things I can do for you guys as more people jump on board ... videos, premium content, private shows, google hangouts, and more! \u00a0I appreciate so much the love and support I get from my fans, and I want to share a peek behind the curtain of what a day in the life looks like for a songwriter in Nashville.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for believing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Travis\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
