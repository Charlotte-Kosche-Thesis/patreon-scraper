We have the chemistry that only years of friendship can create. Our episodes are filled with personal stories, musings, movie break downs, Top 10 lists, games, and the unpredictability that has become our trademark. We are currently heard in 19 countries by thousands every week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why do we need your support? We want to grow bigger! We want to have more contests and giveaways! We want to have the infrastructure in place to interact more with our audience and give them the best show possible! And we can\u0027t do any of that without your help!\u003cbr\u003e"
