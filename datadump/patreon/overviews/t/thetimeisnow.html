    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon page!\u00a0 And thank you, so very much, for taking an interest in your own survival.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur world is changing. It\u0027s changing faster, and in different ways than any of us imagined. Some of those changes might prove to be good for us, while a great many will likely prove to be disastrous.\u00a0 What we know for certain, is that changes are coming that will make it more difficult to live on this planet. You may call it doomsaying, or pessimistic, or just plain crazy, but there\u0027s a reason young boys and girls around the world have been taught the Scouting motto \u0027Be Prepared\u0027.\u00a0 That motto is the single most useful piece of advice you will ever hear.\u00a0 It applies to every part of your life, and it could be the only thing that keeps you alive \u003cem\u003ewhen\u003c/em\u003e the proverbial shit hits the metaphorical fan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that is a \u003cem\u003ewhen\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0not an \u003cem\u003eif\u003c/em\u003e. We all know this to be true, whether we openly accept it or not.\u00a0 The time is now, don\u0027t wait any longer to ensure you and your loved ones have the best shot at surviving whatever waits for us in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this campaign is to provide you with knowledge and skill sets that will become the foundation of your survival plan. This isn\u0027t a place to celebrate the latest high tech gadget or debate which gun is best for navigating a field of zombies. I will bring you exclusive content - created by me, Martin J. Clemens - on the basic tenets of preparedness, sustainable living in the real world, and homesteading knowledge bases. I\u0027ll offer essays through my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://preparedincanadablog.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0detailing how disasters work and how they affect us differently depending on who we are, and where we live.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be using your pledged funds to continue and to document my own journey along the path to long-term preparedness. I am well-versed on the subject, but as most people I speak to on this topic explain, knowing what other people say about preparedness isn\u0027t the same as creating, stocking, and living your own survival plan.\u00a0 I\u0027d like to bring you along with me on that journey and share with you the lessons I learn along the way"
