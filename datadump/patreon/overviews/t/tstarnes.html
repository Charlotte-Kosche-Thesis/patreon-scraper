It normally goes through a couple of drafts before this stage), and can offer suggestions/ideas that you\u0027d like to see either before the story starts getting written, or as you see the finished chapters. \u00a0I don\u0027t promise I\u0027ll use your idea, but I do promise to discuss it with you.\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlus\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2022\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0Have ideas that you would like to see as a novel, this level lets you pitch ideas. \u00a0If I pick your pitch, you\u0027ll have the chance to give input on the trajectory of the story.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u2022\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0A thank you in every novel.\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2022\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0Your name (and maybe other information about you, I\u0027ll ask questions to get some ideas) will be used for a character in an upcoming novel (this will be done for just one character, although there\u0027s always the chance your character becomes reoccurring in a series).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2022\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0Access to chapters as I write them and they finish basic proofreading (they get proofread as they are written. \u00a0Trust me, you don\u0027t want to read the unproofed chapters). \u00a0I try to finish one chapter a week, although sometimes I manage to push out two (and occasionally it takes a week and a half) \u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2022\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0A copy of all of my books to \u00a0date \u00a0(there are a bunch) plus new books as they finish the full editing process.
