One is about comics, and the other is about being men in their forties, and not knowing how to do that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThey are called \"\n\u003ca href=\"http://wehaveissues.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWe Have Issues\u003c/a\u003e\" (which is a pun about comics, and being dysfunctional), and \"\u003ca href=\"http://2grownmen.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e2 Grown Men\u003c/a\u003e\" (which isn\u0027t a pun, so much as an ironic statement).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt our core, we are podcast spouses \n\u003cstrong\u003eNick Papaconstantinou\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eJames Gillie\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(the \"2 Grown Men\"), and a handful of other co-hosts on \"We Have Issues\".\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"We Have Issues\" also has a lot of contributors, who contribute excellent audio segments that spotlight things like big comic crossover events, the history of Manga, and the psychology of comic characters. They\u0027re pretty great!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve been podcasting since September 2009, and between us we\u0027ve made over 450 podcast episodes. We\u0027re almost good at it now.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLike most podcasters, we make these shows for the love of it...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(Like most podcasters, we make these shows because we\u0027re desperate to make some connection with other people out there in the void, no matter how tenuous, and we crave the validation of our peers.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n...And we\u0027re going to keep making them whether people are giving us money, or love, or are actually even listening.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut we are but human, and we have ambitions!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf you choose to support us\u003c/strong\u003e, you\u0027ll help us with our ongoing running costs, such as hosting, the comics we buy to talk about, Pot Noodles and Peperamis.\u003cbr\u003e\nMore importantly, you\u0027ll be helping us forge into a brighter future, where we hope to:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGet tables at our favourite conventions, so we don\u0027t have to walk around so much at them.\n\t\n\t\t\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay our contributors a little, so that we can stop feeling quite so guilty about exploiting their labour and insight.\u00a0(Only a little, mind. We don\u0027t feel \u003ci style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003ethat\u003c/i\u003e guilty.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBuy nice new equipment, so that we can do recordings out and about and stuff like that.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStart developing possible new shows down the line.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWe\u0027re keeping it simple at the moment - one Patron level, until we get some ideas for possible rewards, and a threshold of $100 a month at which we can start giving everyone involved $5 per show they\u0027re on.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve tried to get corporate sponsorship like all those other podcasts you listen to, but it turns out they aren\u0027t that interested in giving money to people who talk about their own sexual inadequacy all the time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHopefully, dear listener, you aren\u0027t as squeamish as those corporate weaklings.
