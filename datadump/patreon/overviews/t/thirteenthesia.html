    "summary": "So, I used to technically be a concert pianist. I\u0027ve done a few small concerts, played a few conventions here and there. I trained under some pretty cool people and learnt a lot. Did a performance diploma after my grade VIII.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I didn\u0027t have a piano for a decade. And got super ill with achey-breaky hypermobile joints and some other crud.\u003cbr\u003eThis was, clearly, a mistake due to be rectified.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now I have a piano. And I want to make more music for people, even though it\u0027s harder for me now. I love being heard, and I love people enjoying music, even if I\u0027m not technically amazing. I want to be able to make magic again. I want to make you feel things. This is kinda what I feel I was meant to do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously this costs money and time and thaaaaaaaat\u0027s where you come in! (If you want. I won\u0027t bite. You might even get a cookie). Dropping me a few bucks here and there helps with the upkeep of the piano, helps me buy more licensed sheet music and books, and it means that I can put money towards travelling to conventions and playing little concerts there too, eventually, in the future. (I\u0027ve played 3 Ayacon events so far, and each one of those was absolutely amazing and a real highlight for me!). I\u0027m hoping in the future it will help with things like equipment for filming (I have a really sweet microphone and DSLR, but no laptop so far!) and botch jobs along the way. (It also helps keep my pets and wife in kibble and wrestling paraphernalia).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m fairly well-versed in generic geekery and don\u0027t mind taking some requests here and there, in between a few bits of streaming. If you want, please drop me a line and suggest something. I\u0027m open to anime, game, film, tv soundtracks, annoying jingles, even some classical bits here and there. I usually play in cosplay when I\u0027m not doing simple practice at home too, so you can look forward to me looking like a right fool too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
