I am a Catholic who takes his faith seriously. As in I try really hard and fail really hard. But I\u0027m told the trying is important so there is that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also think a lot about \u00a0the narratives of games from the perspective of faith and hope to help the medium that I love grow into a true art form. I feel this channel can offer a unique perspective that can help gaming narratives evolve into an art form to rival established mediums such as movies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contributions will help fund this endeavor. My hope is to use your donations to fund things like getting AAA games closer to release for research. Actual audio recording and video editing equipment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving said that while my \"real job\" provides for my family every little bit helps. I can\u0027t guarantee that the funds will only be used for channel resources. That would be irresponsible of me as a father and main financial provider for my family especially during an emergency.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMake sure to set you maximum contribution so that you don\u0027t accidentally contribute more than what you are comfortable with per month. \u00a0My release schedule is 2 videos per month but I may post more if time permits. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all your support. If you cannot contribute financially but still want to help please contribute with your prayers. Also feel free to participate in the general postings and share and link these videos. Thank you so much for your support!"
