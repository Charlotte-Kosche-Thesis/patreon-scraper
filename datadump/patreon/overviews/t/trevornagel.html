    "summary": "Hi my name\u0027s Trevor and I am creating simple 3D games for the PC. To help me I\u0027ve written a robust little game engine whose main feature is a software renderer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have no formal computer science training and am entirely self taught. I don\u0027t work in the industry, in fact my day job is as a health professional in regional Queensland, Australia. My passion however, is game development. The engine has been created from scratch and I\u0027ve worked hard to get it to the stage you see now. The main engine components are in place and I\u0027m turning my attention to game mechanics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow the fun begins!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love you to be involved in this next stage, where we work on game elements, continue to improve the engine tech, and create games! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Pitch\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need your help to turn this hobby into something more. Small, fun games for the PC released regularly. My paid work is such that I can only spare a few days a week to work on this project, so currently progress is slow. I\u0027d love to devote more time to this and be able to fully document the development process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like patrons to be involved in game design and content creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy skills are sufficiently advanced now that I feel confident programming most things. We are only limited by time and hardware!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith sufficient support I will have the time to produce educational content. This will start with a video summary at the end of each programming day, transition to expository videos of the game systems and eventually live programming sessions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thoroughly enjoy game programming, and the thrill of turning code into interactive worlds has never faded. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf Patreon support got to the point where I could give up my day job, my life would be complete!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat games are you making?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3D first person shooter / puzzles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in the immediate future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContinue to release demos that showcase particular game play elements\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere\u0027s a growing number of folk doing game dev exposition, what\u0027s special about you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) You can play my game demos right now. No long distance promises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Realistic outcomes. I want small games with a single focus released regularly. I\u0027m not building the Metaverse. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) I write all my own code. No 3rd party dev tools or engines here. The renderer, collision, animation and game systems are all hand written. The only notable exception is my use of Sean Barrett\u0027s excellent stb_image library to load textures in from various image formats during setup. I can show you how to write a modern software renderer, an axis aligned collision scheme, perform logical game updates, order and process game data concisely and in a manner amenable to vectorisation and threading. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4) I am an amateur who started programming in adulthood, and a lack of formal training and a disinclination towards maths meant I struggled to make headway for quite some time. I\u0027ve learnt by hammering doggedly away at things until they work. I\u0027ve got a particular appreciation for how difficult building games can be if you are not  a certified genius. I\u0027ve also learnt that there is nothing that is insurmountable if you are determined. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5) I\u0027ve fully embraced the vector programming paradigm and write almost all game code vectorised. This engenders quite a different style to conventional scalar work. Given the direction that modern desktop CPUs are heading, many cores with wide vector units, it pays to learn how to tap into the significant performance potential on offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6) In the course of developing the engine I have sifted through a lot of material on and offline and follow many experienced game devs on social media. I can show you what is useful and what is not, and who to follow. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a software renderer?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Good understanding of low level graphic operations:\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first began to teach myself about graphics I tried some OpenGl tutorials and soon had a simple demo with a spinning coloured cube. I found this profoundly dissatisfying. It was just calling a bunch of functions that someone else had written and I had no real understanding of what I was looking at. I decided I wanted to learn how it all worked, right down to the pixels. The experience was slow and painful, but immensely valuable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) You learn to write efficient code: \u003cbr\u003eWriting a software renderer that\u0027s fast enough to power a decent scene at interactive speeds requires writing efficient code, which in turn implies a good understanding of the strengths and limitations of modern CPU hardware.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) Software rendering is direct \u0026amp; flexible:\u003cbr\u003eYou can change any stage of the graphics pipeline to suit your purposes. You are not working with graphics drivers. You are programming to a general purpose multi-threaded environment with lots of memory. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4) Software rendering may not be dead. \u003cbr\u003eFuture desktop CPUs will be many-cored with wide vector units with potentially enough throughput to match mid-range GPUs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
