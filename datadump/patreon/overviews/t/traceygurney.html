What kind I have yet to decide. Then, I am hoping to secure a more steady income living my full time dream of peddling my wares. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI graduated with a bachelor degree in advertising and graphic design in 2001 from The Columbus College of Art \u0026amp; Design. I took a huge chunk of time off after graduation and worked at a book store. In 2012 I quit my job, at said bookstore of 10 years and started my own business. \u003cem\u003eIt was the scariest thing I have done so far in my life.\u003c/em\u003e I\u0027ve been a full time artist for four years now selling my creations at conventions around the US and also through my \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/TraceyGurney\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEtsy shop\u003c/a\u003e. Working conventions is extremely fun, but can be expensive. I also do freelance graphic design and other projects for a few clients, but it isn\u0027t as full time as I would like. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s19.postimg.org/fq3ds46pf/2016_02_26_09_08_14.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is one of my many set ups you may see if you come out to a convention I\u0027m at.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy creations are best described as pop culture designs and creations. I tend to create items I want to own for myself and then hope others do too. Everything from art prints to stickers, jewelry, fandom candles. I just can\u0027t \u003cstrong\u003estop!\u003c/strong\u003e I am hoping to start with drawings and digital paintings on here and then maybe branch into offering more creations, like jewelry or shirt designs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cannot express the joy it brings me to make \u003cem\u003ethings\u003c/em\u003e that others want to have in their lives. The feeling is hard to explain, but it is why I continue to do it. My hope is this funding will help me create more than I do now and bring you amazing \u003cem\u003estuff \u003c/em\u003eyou haven\u0027t seen from me yet.
