    "summary": "Thanks for visiting Anti-Media\u0027s Patreon page! It took us a while to create a Patreon account, and to be honest, we never planned on joining this platform because we never really had a reason to. In the past, we made a modest living paying \u003ca href=\"http://theantimedia.org/the-team/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eour team\u003c/a\u003e of brilliant writers, editors, fact-checkers, web developers, researchers, and graphic designers with ad revenue from Google and Facebook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut all of that has changed. Facebook has decided Anti-Media shouldn\u0027t be shown in people\u2019s newsfeeds. Google has deemed us un-newsworthy. We\u2019re guessing they don\u2019t like the fact that we highlight and expose corruption wherever we see it, be it in the \u003ca href=\"http://theantimedia.org/boeing-helped-government-cover-up-worst-nuclear-disaster-in-us-history/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egovernment\u003c/a\u003e or from \u003ca href=\"http://theantimedia.org/media-blackout-gas-leak-illness/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecorporations\u003c/a\u003e. They don\u2019t like us challenging the \u003ca href=\"http://theantimedia.org/us-empire-1000-military-bases-80-countries/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eempire\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"http://theantimedia.org/military-industrial-complex-addiction/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emilitary-industrial complex\u003c/a\u003e. They are uncomfortable with us calling out \u003ca href=\"http://theantimedia.org/legalizing-weed-done-1-trillion-dollars-40-year-war-couldnt/\"\u003ethe drug war\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://theantimedia.org/big-pharma-illegal-price-fixing/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBig Pharma\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://theantimedia.org/4-victims-come-forward-chicago-secret-prison-man-tortured-weed/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epolice brutality\u003c/a\u003e, the \u003ca href=\"http://theantimedia.org/california-prison-industrial-complex/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eprison-industrial complex\u003c/a\u003e, and the \u003ca href=\"http://theantimedia.org/nobody-won-2016-election-landslide/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esystem at large\u003c/a\u003e. Because we\u2019re not exactly \u201cbrand friendly\u201d \u2014 at least, according the Internet\u2019s media gatekeepers \u2014 our whole operation has been put in jeopardy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe giants have come to crush Anti-Media, and they will succeed unless you step in to help us win this battle. The time has come to ask for your help. We need your direct support to continue our operations as one of the largest and most trusted independent media outlets on the Internet. You\u0027re our only hope. We don\u0027t do what we do for the money \u2014 if we did, we wouldn\u0027t be facing this battle with these corporate monoliths \u2014 we do it because it\u2019s the right thing to do. Instead, we\u2019ve been publishing our content for free for years, also making it creative commons so anyone can re-publish it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we do have bills to pay, shows to broadcast, writers to support, messages to spread, and movements to make. Anything you can contribute will help us keep fighting the good fight. Thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
