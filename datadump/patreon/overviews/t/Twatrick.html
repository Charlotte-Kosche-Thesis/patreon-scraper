I produce music, videos,write paint sketch and sculpt with what ever medium I find myself able to utilise.\u003cbr\u003efor 30 years \u00a0I have travelled Europe, the Caribbean, North and Central america. These adventures have been funded by my artist endeavours. Trading murals for food and accomodation, teaching,selling, and trading paintings on street corners and festivals I have managed to lead a frugal yet productive inspiring journey.I have lost track of the amount of countries I have arrived in with no more than my craft and a smile to support myself.I hitchhike ,work my passage,rarely sleep in hotels! Generally staying with new friends or camping by the roadside. Beg ,borrow or steal are not tools in my bag of tricks.\u003cbr\u003eA 10 year veteran of burningman and many other festivals, my participation was enabled through volunteering \u00a0for clean-up, assisting with art installations and my own productions, such as the universal boopzone( 2012 burningman) and trash labyrinths.Over the years I have given away far more of my art, and skills than I have sold.I,m not trying to get rich merely support my travels, further my craft and share my work with the world.\u003cbr\u003epresently i attempting to create permaculture art maze in guatemala",
