You just have to be willing to look.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt Tedium, we try doing a deep dive into the mundane, the unusual, and the trivial. (Or as we love to put it, we\u2019re hunting for the end of the long tail.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe tell stories about the noble failures and the historic moments deemed too useless for the history books. We\u2019ll hunt through old newspapers, vintage patent filings, and BBS-era text files that haven\u2019t been read in decades\u2014all with the goal of showing people that, yes, there is something valuable in these offbeat topics. And we link the hell out of everything in case you wanna dive in yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe then publish it in a newsletter and on our website, giving these subjects the presentation and notice that they deserve. Because someone\u2019s gotta do it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd hey, people seem to like it. We have more than 10,000 email subscribers, and these days, our website attracts upwards of 30,000 visits per month in each of the last six months\u2014a number that\u2019s been growing significantly of late.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut we need your help. Publishing Tedium takes a lot of time (generally 20 hours per week), and there are some set costs that come with it. We try to minimize those costs where we can, but it would still be nice to not have to go out of pocket for things like \u003ca href=\"http://newspapers.com/\"\u003eresearch materials\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://emailoctopus.com/\"\u003eemail distribution platforms\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://cloudinary.com/\"\u003eimage hosting\u003c/a\u003e (GIFs aren\u2019t cheap), and \u003ca href=\"http://buffer.com/\"\u003esocial media management\u003c/a\u003e. Every little bit helps. And so could you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCheck out our benefits over to the side reach out if any of them interest you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHelp us tell awesome stories about boring things\u2014and you\u2019ll be rewarded with some awesome knowledge. Promise. Thanks a bunch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2014 Ernie @ Tedium\u003c/em\u003e"
