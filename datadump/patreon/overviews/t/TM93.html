    "summary": "Thank you everyone for stopping by my Patreon! Some of you may be familiar with my older work on a system called Digimon: Digital Adventures, \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ltxa4nx_ghGl4LjI6WYrT47MDdS7dQVj2PWLVRt0fpw/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eand a link to the current google docs based file for that system is here\u003c/a\u003e if you are interested in looking at my older work, and it\u0027s something that is very near and dear to my heart, but that\u0027s not what this page is about (I will however continue to work on the old system, but that\u0027s not the point here).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut back to the point, welcome to the Patreon for RISE; a tabletop role-playing game designed with two things in mind; creative freedom to make your own unique powers and techniques, mix and match them, and allow for a great variety of equally unique encounters, all while keeping players grounded in a setting which isn\u0027t so very different from the world we know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kWVKjVq.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of right now, RISE is in what would be considered an early alpha build; things are still being put together, and of course many features still aren\u0027t currently available, so keep that in mind as you\u0027re viewing the system. Things take time, mostly because they have to be tested, balanced, and re-balanced over and over to make sure everyone has an enjoyable experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are my future plans for RISE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell first and foremost, getting the core system finished. By the time it\u0027s done I intend for there to be dozens upon dozens of unique playstyles to choose from, and I want each one to be different and rewarding in some way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, to get the supplementary books ready. Said books include, but are not limited to playing non-human characters, rules for non-western settings, and a beastiary full of pre-generated enemies to toss at players within the rules of the system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I want to create a variety of resources, references, and a community around the system, between blog posts, direct feedback, and system discussion videos, in order to make sure that there\u0027s an answer ready for people who need it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get for supporting this system?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, besides the obvious answer of knowing that you\u0027re supporting someone doing work they love, for a community they want to give back to, you get several unique Patreon rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust one dollar will get a link to the system\u0027s Discord server where I\u0027ll be available to answer questions, get feedback, and listen to what the community has to say about the system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFive dollars will get you a special place in the Discord as an \u003cstrong\u003eOfficial Playtester \u2122\u003c/strong\u003e, where you\u0027ll have access to the most up-to-date version of the system as opposed to the public version, which will normally update between once every week and once every month, depending on the volume of changes which have to be made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are the most basic levels of support for the system, but there\u0027s others too; be sure to read all of the tiers that we have to offer, some offer special rewards like the ability to write a custom scenario, monster, or character for the system, although with these we do hope our supporters understand that it may take a bit to make to the full system, and if a plan is made to include something similar in the system already, we may have to discuss alternative options.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if there isn\u0027t an update over the course of a month?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell then you don\u0027t have to worry! If I can\u0027t get an update out in any way, shape, or form, even something as simple as a blog post talking about the system, you don\u0027t pay a dime. Not every month will have a full system update, that happens, but if a month goes by without even a peep? I won\u0027t take a single cent from my supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre there any other reasons to support the system?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides my eternal gratitude, the knowledge that you\u0027re helping to expand the world of tabletop gaming, and helping support a creator just trying to make ends meet. I\u0027m trying to make a living doing something that I love, so I can afford food, shelter, comfort, and down the line going through some changes including but not limited to transitioning (surprise) as a means to try and make myself more comfortable in my body.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd again, thank you so much for stopping by and at least looking at my page; even if you didn\u0027t donate, \u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003eI hope that you enjoy the system, which can be found here\u003c/a\u003e"
