Wow that went quickly!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve also recently started branching out into other games and I\u0027m trying my hand out streaming which I\u0027m LOVING! I have so many ideas for videos, the list just keeps growing and with your help I will be able to spend more time on my channel so I can make better quality videos more often and stream more often too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bit about me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy love for video games started with the Amiga 500 which my brothers got one Christmas. I would play on this whenever I had the chance and get lost in games such as Monkey Island, Lemmings, Canon Fodder and loads more.\u003cbr\u003eMy love for video games grew when I would sneak into my brothers rooms to play on their N64 and Playstation. Here I would be blown away by the likes of Goldeneye, Mario 64 and Crash Bandicoot.\u003cbr\u003eMy love for video games was fully realised when I got my own PC and started buying every game I could gather my pennies for. This is when I found some of my all time favourite games such as Half Life, Dungeon Keeper and eventually TF2.\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago I started making videos about some of my gaming experience and I\u0027ve now I\u0027m pretty much addicted! I love sharing my gaming moments I and interacting with you guys. Your feedback and support is a huge inspiration!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your generous donations I hope to be able to spend more time on my videos so they are more regular and of better quality. At the moment I have a full time job and so I only really get the weekends to dedicate to making videos. This means I can only get one video out every week or two. I have so many ideas for new videos that I would love to be able to do more as well as stream move often. In the short term your donation will go to two very practical things - 1. My SFM artist that creates awesome high quality artwork for my videos and the thumbnails and 2. My video editors which put together some highlights of my streams to share with those who can\u0027t make it (originally I made this but I couldn\u0027t maintain this along with my normal content so I had to outsource). Alongside all this, your support is a huge inspiration and motivation for me and every like, comment or donation really keeps me going! Thanks for your kindness in advance!"
