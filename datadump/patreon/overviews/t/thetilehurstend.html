    "summary": "Hello Folks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to come check out the crowdfunding page. It\u0027s never easy or fun to ask people for money, but we like to think of this more as our online tip jar than anything else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s hard to believe but The Tilehurst End website is now nearly six years old, while our Podcast has notched up more than 100 episodes in only half of that time.\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/svWcFPX-VNqqp3Z4ierUWXpKcqI=/0x43:750x543/1020x680/filters:focal(0x43:750x543):format(webp)/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51632191/TTEPD.0.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we love having the chance to talk and analyse our beloved Reading Football Club - preparing, producing, recording and editing the podcast and website does take a significant amount of time and effort, and while we poke fun at being an \u0027unprofessional joke of a podcast\u0027 we try to put out as polished and high quality content as we can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, taking a podcast to that level involves both time and money and that\u0027s where your support comes in. Not only will your donations help fund future improvements to the show and website, they\u0027ll also go towards rewarding those of us who create the content that you read and listen to each week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027ve said, doing this is something we love and we came in knowing it wouldn\u0027t be financially rewarded but when you get a few quid into the coffers it really does help give you the occasional reminder that your efforts are being appreciated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please just donate what you can. Once again, think of it like a tip jar and a virtual pat on the back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past we\u0027ve had a few people get in touch who\u0027d love to help but don\u0027t feel comfortable pledging on a monthly basis. If you would still like to donate but want to go through PayPal or through other means just drop us a quick email to \u003ca href=\"mailto:thetilehurstend@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethetilehurstend@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
