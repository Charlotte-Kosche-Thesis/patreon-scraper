Our motto is \u201cbetter, not breaking\u201d. You can\u0027t photograph what you don\u0027t see, so at the very least you know the people creating content for True North are not sitting behind a computer screen all day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrue North Photo Journal was founded with a small grant from the NWT Arts Council. We believe that those who cannot afford subscriptions should not be prevented from viewing True North\u0027s content. As such there will never be a paywall for this site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, moving forward, the website will be supported through subscriptions from the general public made through Patreon. With your help, our goal is\u00a0to raise the bar for Canadian media outlets who have ripping off the public by placing profits ahead of their product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks in advance for your support.
