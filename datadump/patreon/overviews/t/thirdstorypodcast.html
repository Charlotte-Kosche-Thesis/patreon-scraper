I\u0027ve made nearly 100 episodes with blood, sweat and tears, and along the way I\u0027ve connected with amazing people (some of them guests, some of them listeners). I\u0027m continually inspired by the community of of listeners who reach out to me with their thoughts about the conversations.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I\u0027ve started a series of more narrative episodes that explore ideas of community and culture, and I\u0027m planning on making much more of that kind of fully produced content in the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow it\u0027s time to take The Third Story Podcast to the next level!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.third-story.com\"\u003ewww.third-story.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
