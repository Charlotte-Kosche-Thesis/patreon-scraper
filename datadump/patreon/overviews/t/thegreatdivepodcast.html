What started off as a fun and silly way for us to talk about diving has quickly turned into a show that has gained respect and an audience. But with that, it has also turned into a second full-time job with countless hours each week going into the research, preparation, recording and production of the show. And this is where you come in, where we rely on our dive buddies. For a couple of bucks a month we can really start to dive deeper into each one of these episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe show is going to remain a free podcast, but if we\u0027ve got enough financial support each month we can produce better content, more interesting episodes, cool swag, merchandise, some bonus content and we have so many more great ideas if we had the money to do them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf we had the time and money we would get out there and dive with each and every one of you and personally sign your logbooks after the dive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThank you all so much,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eJames and Brando\u003c/div\u003e"
