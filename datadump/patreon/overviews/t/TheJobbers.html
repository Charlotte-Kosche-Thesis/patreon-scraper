We continue to grow because of you all, and we can\u0027t thank you enough for the support! We have some awesome stuff planned in the future, and we plan to continue to focus on what we have done leading up to this point.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOur goal starting out was to get to 100k subs on Youtube, and possibly get to a point where we could go to events and create original content live for our viewers. We are currently just short of 50k subs just after 1 year ... DELIGHTFUL!! Our love for wrestling and building a community of wrestling fans is what we are all about ... thank you for joining the Jobbers Squad!!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e"

If you are like us, the current WWE storylines leave a lot to be desired, but we can come together as somewhat of a support group for our unhealthy addiction to pro wrestling! It\u0027s like that terrible significant other that you can\u0027t understand why you stay...but you do no matter what abuse may come your way. We all know every Monday is all part of an abusive relationship!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe met on Twitter in 2016 and formed a bond through discussing pro wrestling on a weekly basis. Our relationship has grown through the year, and we have grown our Youtube channel through \"best of\" and original content. We hope that through Patreon and our Youtube channel, we can go to live events and do live content from the actual arenas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can\u0027t thank you enough for your support ....
