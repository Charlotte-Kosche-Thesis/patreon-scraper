    "summary": "I\u0027m Tyler Gates, and I\u0027m a small writer with big ideas. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in Adelaide, Australia, where I write historical fiction and fantasy. The South Australian Writers\u0027 Centre named me one of their \u0027youngest and brightest\u0027 writers, so that\u0027s something. My short stories have been published in several (well, a few) anthologies, including\u00a0\u003cem\u003eColossus of Ephesus\u003c/em\u003e, which appeared in the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06XSPY85J\"\u003eWARRIOR\u00a0\u003c/a\u003ecollection by LGBT+ publisher, Ink \u0026amp; Locket Press.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShort stories are great, but I\u0027m aiming for bigger word counts. Maybe even \u003cem\u003eThe Novel\u003c/em\u003e. Unfortunately, the market in Australia doesn\u0027t suit the type of stories I want to write. The price to publish an author is high, and the publishing industry is restrictive with what they will or won\u0027t back. And I have no interest writing a cricketer\u0027s biography. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can ditch the gatekeepers and self-publish. I\u0027m not talking about creating a bestseller (though, that would be nice), I\u0027m talking about being in the position to publish original content without restrictions based on the local market. I\u0027m talking about strengthening my financial muscles to get things done (I\u0027m a scrawny guy).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny support you give me in this quest is appreciated. Thank you! Hopefully the stories I write are something you can be proud to say you helped birth (I\u0027ll leave you with that image).\u003cbr\u003e"
