Through our educational content, I aim to help players have a better time both on and off the airsoft field. The BB Warrior will introduce you to products and discuss their usefulness for airsoft purposes. While some products are excellent and have their uses for real conflicts; not everything translates perfectly to airsoft. I aim to show you the usefulness of products, not the hype behind their marketing. Along side product spotlights, I also discuss changes and trends within the airsoft industry, and talk about how to improve your skill as a player through tactics and individual skill based content.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eSo, who am I?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Lane, and I\u0027ve been playing airsoft for almost a decade. My love of airsoft has inspired me to create The BB Warrior, a project dedicated to helping other players have a better time both on and off the airsoft field through educational content. Airsoft has been a huge part of my life, helping me through rougher times; if I can give back even a percent of the joy that airsoft has brought me to my viewers, then I am happy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2015, on my eighteenth birthday I opened my own airsoft store, to better serve the players in my area as well as gaining the ability to take a \"insider\" look of the industry of airsoft. While my store is closed, the lessons I learned and experience I gained have been invaluable to me as I create my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eWhy is The BB Warrior worth Supporting?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to make content that truly helps players, I need to maintain my independence from industry financing. My goal is to only work with companies that I personally recommend and use myself. A rule of my content has always been \"there is no perfect product\", that\u0027s why I critique products that I love; because I want airsoft (and the products needed to play) to improve. Patreon allows the viewers to support content they enjoy, and thus allows myself as a creator to not be swayed or pressured into saying positive things about products to keep food on the table.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m so excited that you\u0027ve found my Patreon page and are interested in joining my close knit community of viewers that make my work possible. As a Patron, you will get access to exclusive work that didn\u0027t make the cut, helping me shape the content and topics I discuss in videos, and taking a look behind the scenes to see my process of creating education content."
