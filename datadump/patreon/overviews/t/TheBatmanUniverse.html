    "summary": "The Batman Universe first came about in 2008 in the form of a single monthly podcast. Over the years, we have added a website along with an array of podcasts featuring various aspects of The Batman Universe. Our popularity has grown by leaps and bounds and with more content, more costs arise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt has always been our opinion that ads on a website deter the from the experience fans should have when visiting the site. And while we have tried a variety of different things over the years to help support everything we do, we believe that our fan-base and Bat-Fans around the world are the best group of fans that there are in working together to accomplish a goal. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what does that mean? Rather than blanketing our website with advertisements, we are asking for your support. We have set costs per month that need to be maintained along with the need for periodical maintenance that adds up as well. We need your help to make TBU better in a variety of different ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution will help to keep us producing new episodes and give the ability to continue to provide them to our audience. In addition to that, website updates and new content will be added as time goes on. The more support we get, the more fresh and original content we can produce for the fans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please consider sharing your love of Batman with a site that wants to share it back with you and other Bat-Fans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, please consider that if you do not have the ability to share funds with us, we are always looking for skilled individuals to help us with a variety of things on the website. Some of the things we are always looking for are content writers, news writers, graphic designers, artists, video editors, audio editors and web developers. If you have any of those skills or something else you believe could help us, email us at \u003ca href=\"mailto:tbu@thebatmanuniverse.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etbu@thebatmanuniverse.net\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
