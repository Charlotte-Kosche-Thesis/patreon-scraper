My blog, The Forward Cabin, shares my experiences, musings, reviews, tips, tricks, resources and industry news with you, the fellow traveler. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to share my knowledge of the travel industry with you so you can travel more, fly further and stay in nicer hotels, all without breaking the bank!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt would be remiss if I didn\u0027t thank you for stopping by and being a supporter - whether you\u0027re a first time reader of my blog, just happened to stop by this Patreon page, or know me personally, I have to thank you from the bottom of my heart! It takes a lot of work (and money!) to share the tips and tricks I know, and to be able to continue network with other people to gain more information to share with you, and without your support this would never be possible. Thank you SO much for stopping by, and as always, if you ever have any questions or feedback, let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJamie\u003cbr\u003e"
