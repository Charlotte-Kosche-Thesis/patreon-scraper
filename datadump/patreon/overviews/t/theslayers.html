When I am no longer working and all my time is focused on the art, I will advise you guys in a post. If you guys have any questions, about anything, feel free to ask. I do not judge and I would love to keep you informed. Thank you for you time.

I am an opened minded person, who accepts everyone for who they are. My life goal is to be one of the best, if not the best, storytellers to ever live. I write day and night, when I\u0027m not at work, on stories I plan on telling through different forms of art, such as, writing, drawing, and directing(actors). I am here on Patreon because I need help funding The Slayers. I found an artist, Erwin Prasetya, who is an amazing artist, however, doesn\u0027t work for free and I don\u0027t blame him. He does have a family and so do I. With your help, this manga, soon to be anime, will be continued and released. I haven\u0027t given up on a project yet, and i would hate for this one to be the first, due to funding. So please help anyway you can, even if you can only share a post. I will be grateful. Thank you for your time! I hope everyday is your best!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJeff",
