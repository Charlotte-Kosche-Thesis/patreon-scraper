    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m Lauren Fox. Also known as The Cartoon Physicist, mainly just on my bi-weekly webseries \u0027The Cartoon Physicist\u0027s Noughtie List\u0027 in which I review TV shows and movies from the 2000s. Not just bad shows and movies like most reviewers though. I analyse what I consider to be good movies and shows, and bring attention to those long forgotten. Sometimes I look at TV pilots from the 2000s that didn\u0027t get the chance to become an ongoing series, in a segment I like to call \u0027TV Casualties\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m myself though on my podcast \u0027Schlock \u0026amp; Terror\u0027, which involves my friends and I going through every video nasty one by one and talk about the reputation they garnered when 1980s\u0027 Britain thought low-budget horror VHS tapes were the root of all evil.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started \u0027The Cartoon Physicist\u0027s Noughtie List\u0027 a few years ago, but I feel my show has improved since then and therefore I can start a patreon without anyone laughing at me. If you want to pledge, go right ahead. It\u0027ll definitely help me get the props I need to finally work on the show\u0027s storylines. Have fun enjoying the rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thecartoonphysicist.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethecartoonphysicist.wordpress.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

As well as the ordinary 2000 to 2009 shows, you can also request any shows that started in the late nineties (1996 to 1999) and have continued into the 2000s due to the number of shows that were deemed 2000s shows even though they started in the late 1990s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso shows that started in the 2000s into the 2010s and onwards. But not 1996 to 2010s shows, they are not shows from the 2000s. They\u0027re not 2000s shows, they\u0027re shows not restricted to any decade like The Simpsons or SpongeBob.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a few conditions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. There are a few shows and movies I have reserved for special episodes like anniversaries. If you request a reserved show or movie, I\u0027m going to have to ask you to request your second choice. Nothing personal, these special episodes involve a lot of preparations and are made for specific dates, I can\u0027t possibly get one done in time for a patron like my average episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Please don\u0027t request the following movies and shows that I wouldn\u0027t review:\u003cbr\u003eAnime - I barely watched any, never been interested. It would be very difficult for me to talk about an anime series since I\u0027m the opposite of an expert.\u003cbr\u003eHarry Potter films - Hold your torches and pitchforks, I\u0027m just indifferent to Harry Potter in general. I\u0027m not going to review them because I would be a pretty boring reviewer in an episode about any of these films.\u003cbr\u003eTwilight films- Everything that could be said about them has been said. I would just end up repeating what every reviewer has said.\u003cbr\u003eTransformers films - Same as above.\u003cbr\u003eSon of the Mask - Pretty much the whole review would be me rocking myself in the corner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. They must be completed shows, no on-going series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
