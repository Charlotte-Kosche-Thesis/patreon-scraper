    "summary": "Come and Take It is a talk show about Texas, by Texans. Three friends born and raised in Texas share their views on the state\u0027s history, culture, and just what it means to be \u003cem\u003eTexan\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0We create high-quality audio podcasts exploring both the well-known high points in Texas history (remember the Alamo?) and the lesser-known corners (like the camels of Camp Verde). We aim to educate as well as entertain, sharing our love and pride for the Lone Star State.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been making this show for about a year now, and it\u0027s a labor of love. We\u0027ll continue doing the show for as long as we can find something Texan to talk about and the cost of producing it doesn\u0027t get out of hand. We can handle the first part; there will always be something to talk about. Your contributions will help with the second part. There are costs involved with the production and distribution of the show which will likely increase over time, and your support will help us continue doing what we\u0027re doing how we\u0027re doing it for as long as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we want to do so much more! Right now, we\u0027re fortunate that we can get together and record in one room with high-quality equipment, week after week. It\u0027s limiting, though, because if one of us moves or is otherwise unable to be present, we can\u0027t record at the quality we (and you!) are used to hearing. We would like to get better microphones and other equipment that would allow us to record remotely and still maintain our high quality standards. Would you like to see us do a live show from the Texas State Fair or the basement of the Alamo? We\u0027d love to do that! Would you like to listen live, or watch a video stream from the studio as we record? Those things have additional costs associated with them, too. These are just some of the ideas we\u0027ve had to take Come and Take It to the next level, and your patronage can directly support these goals."
