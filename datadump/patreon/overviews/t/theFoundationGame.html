Something nearly destroyed the Foundation once. It won\u0027t make the same mistake again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the SCP Wiki?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe SCP Wiki is a peer-reviewed collection of creepy-pasta style articles written in the form of technical documents instructing the reader on how to properly contain a paranormal object. The Wiki pretends to be a database run by the SCP Foundation,\u00a0a secret organization entrusted by global governments to contain and study anomalous entities, locations and objects that defy natural law. The SCP Foundation\u0027s goal is to preserve normalcy and public order by suppressing knowledge of such abnormalities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is XCOM?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eXCOM is a series of games about an extraterritorial organization tasked with defending the earth from an alien invasion. Player manage bases, research new technologies and engage in tactical turn based combat to defeat the aliens and save the earth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy name is Devin Nelson. I am a Computer Scientist with a background in enterprise solutions and SaaS. Really boring stuff to most people. However I have long had an incredible passion for Game Mechanics and the art and design of video games. About a year ago I had an opportunity to pursue this passion full-time and I took it on. Its been quite an eye opening experience. Incredibly fun and satisfying and yet also surprisingly difficult. The Foundation was my first major project and I have been eagerly watching it grow and develop into the fascinating game it will become.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? Don\u0027t most of you people use Kickstarter?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is an experiment for me. The Foundation targets a niche audience that is passionate but possibly not large enough to make for a successful Kickstarter campaign. Also many supporters have wondered why I don\u0027t get a larger team put together. Patreon can solve both of these problems if successful. Even very small donations can help towards purchasing required art assets, software, and libraries, and together it might even be enough to pay multiple developers to work on the project. This is something that would never happen if I had to wait until I had a successful Kickstarter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt should also provide a way for me to interact closely with those who are the most excited about this project and reward them for their support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim for complete transparency with this patreon and will post monthly reports on time spent and money usage. It will be easy to see whether or not your support is being wisely used.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for your consideration and support.\u003c/strong\u003e Be sure to check out the goals and rewards and follow the progress of this game as it moves towards completion."
