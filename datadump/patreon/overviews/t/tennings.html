    "summary": "As much as I give out about it, reviewing terrible video-games is one of my favorite things to do, and apparently, you guys like me doing it! Unfortunately, it\u0027s hard to justify dedicating so much time into making these reviews when other, more boring, adult responsibilities get in the way. However, with the kind support of you lot, I\u0027m hoping that my talent of getting angry at video-games, may soon help me pay a bill!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am asking for $1 for every new video that I make (however you\u0027re welcome to donate more). I\u0027ve decided against a monthly option as sometimes (as my fans can attest), I tend to go months without making a video, so I feel that the \u0027\u003cem\u003ep\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eer new video\u0027 option\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is more suitable for the both of us! Also, just for total transparency, I\u0027m intending on uploading a maximum of two videos per month. If I do upload any more than that, you won\u0027t be charged. See, I\u0027m nice like that! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m really not expecting people to become patrons, and if any fans of mine are reading this, I just want you to know that neither my output, or quality will change based off of the success (or lack-of) of this Patreon campaign. You\u0027ll likely still be leaving me comments telling me to get off my lazy arse and make a new video, and I thank you for it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
