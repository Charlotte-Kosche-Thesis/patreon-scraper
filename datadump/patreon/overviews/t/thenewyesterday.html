    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://thenewyesterday.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe New Yesterday\u003c/a\u003e is a webcomic space opera I\u0027ve been working on for years. Using a combination of 3D Model-work and hand drawn art, I\u0027m telling the story of a huge galactic civilization, a devastating war, and a small group of fugitives caught in the middle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love telling stories, I love making art, and I want to make sharing this comic my full time job. For that to happen, I\u0027m going to need help from readers like you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA long time ago, the comic medium was very different. Artists produced daily or weekly strips that would appear in newspapers. Sometimes, those comics would be telling long, engaging stories over weeks and months, and the artists were paid wages based on the sale of newspapers, syndication, etc. But since the web has come along, and distribution of content has become more free, we\u0027ve begun to expect \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003econtent\u003c/em\u003e to be free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a platform perfectly suited to find a middle ground. It allows us to support creators we love in small amounts throughout the year, rather than crowdfunding big, scary projects. Most of that creator\u0027s content remains free, but with the help of a small community of patrons, those creators can start to make reasonable wages off their hard work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like the The New Yesterday, think about pledging your support. Every little bit helps me produce more great, ad-free content for everybody to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, besides that warm, squishy, PBS feeling of supporting the arts, donations of 3$ or more give you access to special patrons-only content. Things like Bonus Art, Glimpses behind-the-scenes, Blog Posts about my process, or future directions of the comic. It\u0027s important to note that no pages of the comic will be held behind a paywall, but you might see the odd page a few days early, too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrowdfunding can be tricky. Not just in comics, but basically every medium, creators can sometimes get bogged down in providing so many backer rewards, and bonuses to patrons, that the work itself suffers. For me, the focus will always be to create more content, faster, so I have set a series of goals (listed on the left) for us to aim for. Gradually, with added funds, The New Yesterday will be able to update 5 times a month, 6, and so on. My big, outlandish dream for this project would be to be able to quit my day job, and work on TNY all the time, if that happened, I think I\u0027d be able to update nearly once a weekday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut let\u0027s not get ahead of ourselves. For now, I\u0027ve set our first goal at 30$ a month. If we can reach that, I will be able to update five times in four weeks. That seems reasonable, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s do this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-J. Mackenzie Graham\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
