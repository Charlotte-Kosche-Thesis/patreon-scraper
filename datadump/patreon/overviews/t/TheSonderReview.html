Our magazine lives both online and in print and is based in Upstate, New\nYork.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe believe in language. Words raw and shuddering and unabashed. Prose which is spare and piercing, delicately\nand deliberately crafted. We believe in\nstorytelling that is innovative and daring, precise and oddly angled. Writing which shows us the bizarre but also,\nalways, the resounding throb of humanity. We want fresh voices; words which must be heard.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd we believe in you, our readers and contributors and friends.\nSonder is about inclusivity, about collaboration and community. And so we hope to build something special out of this journal, to foster conversations and\nhelp each other to grow as both readers and writers of magnificent prose. But for that,\nwe need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eNot to mention, all of those little annoying managerial parts of\nrunning a lit mag and small press (printing, web hosting, advertisement, etc) do,\nunfortunately, cost money\u2026 so we\u2019re asking you, our beloved readers, to help us\nout a little bit at a time with our Patreon Subscription. Trust us, we will\ndefinitely make it worth your time; we are \u003cem\u003eso\u003c/em\u003e\nexcited to bring these perks to you, and we hope you enjoy them as much we\nenjoy making them.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe are so, so happy to be able to start this, the\nnewest chapter in our little Sonder community. Come join us, won\u0027t you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eThe Sonder Review\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.sonderreview.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.sonderreview.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.thesonderpress.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.thesonderpress.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
