Her curious mind has her going on a quest to find out all she can on both subjects, making new friends along the way in a monthly series posted online for adult readers into swords and sorcery and sexiness to enjoy for free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, but who is Tiktikkobold?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am a writer who grew up in the roleplaying circles of the internet during the turn of the millennium. I\u0027m also an avid player of Pen and Paper rpgs, mostly Pathfinder, nowadays. My interests in writing grand stories and fun characters grew around the same time as I was coming into my own sexually, and recently, I\u0027ve decided to use the skills I\u0027ve honed casually and professionally to tell fun stories involving tiny dragon people and their many lovers.\u00a0 At first, the Tik Tik identity and\u003cem\u003e Adventures\u003c/em\u003e were just a side character and account I would use for rp, but over the course of 2017, I\u0027ve come to get a little cult following among other kobold enthusiasts, writing various commission stories that can be found on my accounts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I see your accounts?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSure Thing!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/user/tiktikkobold/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.377506771.7006/flat,800x800,075,f.u4.jpg\" style=\"width: 175px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tiktikkobold.tumblr.com/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/926117422565699584/vxKajRJx_400x400.jpg\" style=\"width: 166px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you link them here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHonestly?
