    "summary": "thirty bees is dedicated to creating free open source e-commerce software that simply works and has the features merchants need to be able to sell their products anywhere in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe undertaking of thirty bees is quite costly in both time and actual monetary costs. The fixed costs we have currently exceed over $1000 a month and include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eServer / hosting fees\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImage licensing\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCorporate fees\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMailing list fees\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eother 3rd party software fees\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eother 3rd party SaaS fees\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThings can start adding up pretty quickly as far as costs and they will only grow in the future as we expand into more free modules and more integrated services.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is why we are finding new and creative ways to fund the development of thirty bees. Other companies omit features and sell them back to you, this is not something we believe in and we feel it is against the spirit of open source software.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur promises to our community\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything that thirty bees develops will always be free and open source. Every module, every part of the thirty bees software, everything. We will not specifically leave features out so we can charge for them as is the business model of other platforms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will also do our best to add the features that merchants need to the core of the software. We feel it is important to listen to merchants, hear their struggles or sticking points, and to develop features that will help them in their day to day business and to grow their businesses over time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBy the numbers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe repository for the core over thirty bees has over 500,000 lines of code that we maintain. This is not including the over 100 modules that we maintain as well. With over a dozen modules in the works. There are over 5000 active shops on thirty bees, with more being added every day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you will be funding\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we have to balance our time between working on thirty bees and working to make ends meet. As we get more funding, we will need to work less to make ends meet and be able to work on thirty bees more. This is what we are really looking forward to. We can advance the platform further, quicker. Release faster updates, more compatible modules, and create a more stable platform for merchants. We will also be able to release better content and guides to help merchants maximize their sales and improve their SEO.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are passionate about open source and thirty bees, we take pride in the fact that so many merchants have trusted us, trusted our vision for e-commerce and migrated their shops to thirty bees. We want to keep creating stable, cutting edge software for many years to come, we want to help each and every merchant become successful in their e-commerce journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
