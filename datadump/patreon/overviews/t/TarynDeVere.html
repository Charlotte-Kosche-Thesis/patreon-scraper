I bring joy in lots of ways but mainly by writing articles that inspire, affirm \u0026amp; make people think about the world in a different way. *DISCLAIMER* I can\u0027t and don\u0027t bring joy to everyone, in fact for some people me \u003cem\u003eeven saying\u003c/em\u003e I bring joy immediately makes them hate me, however\u00a0 I know I bring joy to some people, because they tell me! Yay!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had a lot of super awful stuff happen to me in my life like multiple rape \u0026amp; domestic abuse and I don\u0027t want the next generation to go through what I did. So I write about what I\u0027ve learnt the hard way, in the hope that it might spare someone else going through what I went through. Roughly 20,000 people a month are reading my work at the moment.

You can become a Patron to someone on here for as little as 12 bucks a year.
