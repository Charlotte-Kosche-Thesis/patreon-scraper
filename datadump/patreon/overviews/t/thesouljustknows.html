Over 95% of the population are so busy with their lives they don\u2019t take a moment to actually live their life. It was when I was 33 years old when I discovered the secret within. I battled with that voice inside that was giving me the worst words of advice ever. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen ever I listened to \u201cthat\u201d voice, I found the results were awful. During a very powerful breathing meditation I came to understand that \u201cI\u201d was not that voice. My life changed in a brief moment where a bridge was created between the conscious and the unconscious. When I awoke from my breathing meditation I finally realized that I was awake for the first time in my life.\nI was blessed to have travelled throughout India and found words of wisdom that reaffirmed my understandings.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow go to the monthly donation, Pick your amount you are comfortable with, step out of your comfort zone and get serious...chose the stage below and LETS CO-CREATE CHANGE!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\n\u003c/div\u003e"
