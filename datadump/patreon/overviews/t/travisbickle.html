    "summary": "Hi there! I\u0027m Tucker Stone, one of the three guys who hosts a podcast called Travis Bickle on the Rivieria. I\u0027ve written for places like Flavorwire, The Comics Journal, Comixology and The Factual Opinion, and am currently punching the clock at Nobrow, a publisher of comics, graphic novels and children\u0027s books. Back in 2012, my friend Sean Witzke, a movie critic whose most recent work can be read at Grantland, started this podcast as a way to continue the conversations (and arguments) we had been having about movies amongst our mutual blogs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough neither one of us had listened to a lot of podcasts, we felt that our cantankerous, expletive laden diatribes might be of interest to others, and in the years since, we have been extremely lucky to be proven right: people, for whatever reason, like to listen to a couple of miserable depressives wax nostalgic over action movies from the 80\u0027s. (It probably didn\u0027t hurt that the hugely talented Michel Fiffe drew our logo image!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I became a father in 2013, longtime friend of the show and frequent guest host Morgan Jeske came on board to keep Sean from going stir crazy with backed-up opinions. Jeske--the talented cartoonist behind books for Image Comics like Change and Zero--rapidly made himself indispensable, and after my return to the show, it only made sense to welcome him on as an official host, turning this gruesome twosome into the trio it had always been destined to be. As the episodes have piled up (you can check out our episode guide, with every movie, director and special episode listed\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://travisbickleontheriviera.tumblr.com/database\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e), the show was continually graced with a murderers row of guests from the world of comics and film--you can see all of those amazing people at that link as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of that brings us right up to right now, a cold day in October: the day where we ask for help. Simply put, the increased interest in the show has meant that we\u0027ve had to put a bit more into the nuts and bolts of paying for it than we used to, and we thought 133 episodes (at most recent count) was enough to try passing the hat to help meet the costs. The show isn\u0027t in danger of going anyway anytime soon--Sean, Morgan and I like hurting each others feelings just a little too much for that to be a real concern--but we would appreciate the breathing room that financial support will allow. \u00a0Below you\u0027ll see the various levels of pledge options and the rewards they provide--we\u0027re pretty excited about them, especially the one where we send you surprises you can\u0027t return--but even if you come away thinking that we don\u0027t deserve one thin dime, it still means a lot that you stopped by in the first place. Thank you for reading, but most of all thank you for listening!\u003cbr\u003e"

Well, he did--but you can be forgiven for not realizing that, since he\u0027s spent the last couple of years rewatching Miami Vice and experimenting with movies produced by the WWE. But if we hit 500 a month, we\u0027ll add a new segment to every episode of Bickle: a Criterion Check-In, wherein Tucker will review the hundreds of DVD\u0027s he bought as a way to deal with the fact he didn\u0027t like his life or himself. Legitimacy: you can, in fact, pay for it!",

In the film, all your favorite white guys from your 3rd and 4th favorite TV shows get to grow some beards and pack some heat. So why not make Tucker grow out a really horrible beard and go watch the movie on opening night in January in full John \"Jim from the Office With A Beard\" Krasinski cosplay? It\u0027ll infuriate his wife, severely detract from the ability of his coworkers and peers to take him seriously as an adult, and the whole disgusting process will be documented via the Patreon blog.
