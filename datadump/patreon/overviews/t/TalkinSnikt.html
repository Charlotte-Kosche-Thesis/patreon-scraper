    "summary": "TalkinSNIKT is the best podcast there is at what it does, and what it does best is talk about Wolverine!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Ryan, I\u0027m a longtime X-Men fan, especially Wolverine. I fell in love with X-Men in the early 90s when the Animated Series debuted. And now you\u0027re humming that glorious theme song (you\u0027re welcome). I was just the right age, a ripe old seven, and Wolverine was just the tough guy a young boy could grow to admire.\u003cbr\u003eSince then I have tirelessly read, watched, listened to, you name it, anything I could get my hands on that featured The Strangest Heroes Of Them All, and the claw-popping Canucklehead in particular.\u003cbr\u003eNow I want to share that love with all of my fellow SNIKT talkers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing is (there\u0027s always a thing!) running a podcast actually takes quite a bit of work, especially for a one man show being written, recorded, edited...well, fully produced by said one man. And not only is it time consuming, the cost adds up. From hosting fees for the show, to updating equipment, to paying for the media I must consume to bring you the show in the first place. The price tag just ticks higher. And frankly, I don\u0027t want to stop doing this anytime soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy joining the TalkinSNIKT community your dollars are put to work ensuring that the community continues to grow and that the show continues to run. But that\u0027s not all you get, you can get some great rewards, from acknowledgement of your patronage, to the pleasure of driving the conversation, even to somethings you can hold in your hand!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
