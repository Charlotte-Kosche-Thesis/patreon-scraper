    "summary": "Hello, people of the warmth!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in a county of eternal cold, far up in the north. We have no great wall to separate us from the south, and we are no wildings (granted, we used to be). With such cold comes many opportunities to play and tear apart board games!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have years of experience playing board games and I play a lot of them. For the last five years, I\u0027ve been making video reviews in Norwegian for over 200 games and I am well on the way with many English reviews also. I\u0027m fortunate enough to have my videos displayed on The Dice Tower, but that\u0027s as far as it goes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I want to focus on in the reviews in not to go through the rules of the games, but rather tell you how the flow of the game is and what the different elements or stages of the game feel like. It\u0027s important to find the game that fits your play style, so I do my best to help you find what you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love theme in games and would like to elaborate this in my videos.\u00a0But these things take time. Not only do I need to test all the new and old games that exist or will exist, I also need to spend hours upon hours of recording, editing and publishing the videos. It\u0027s quite the process, I\u0027ll tell you. And that\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you help out, I can more easily set off more time doing the stuff that we all really want to do and not the other important chores and regular work. But more importantly, you also get the option to get your say in what game I\u0027m going to review next!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/56TZZU8TBgY?list=PLN-gSxjckcEMFQuoj3TweShZ0pjfTnfbb\" width=\"1280\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour contribution helps in many ways:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAcquire games you want reviewed which is not accessible to me.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePossible to attend gaming conventions such as SPIEL.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp support the costs that is included with running a website.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpgrading or replacing broken equipment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAs you can see there are many costs to running a \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e video podcast so any contribution is welcome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, once a month I\u0027m going to give you the opportunity to influence the next game I\u0027m going to focus on.

You can vote on any game in my library and also suggest a new game to get if it isn\u0027t on a list. Suggestions are only for me to be aware of what you want, unless I reach a certain pledge level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen a game receives most votes, I\u0027ll focus on getting it played enough to get a thorough review of it.

So combining photo/video with board games felt like a great opportunity for me to explore the hobby further and contribute to the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to paint my miniatures, especially those coming from Fantasy Flight Games, as they are always highly detailed and the games just look and play awesome, especially with the extra touch of paint.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe country I come from - Norway - has to be one of the most beautiful one in the world. The nature is overwhelming and I love hiking in the mountains and just enjoy the awesome country that I have access to. But sometimes it\u0027s very good to enjoy gaming with my friends, or even alone on occasions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorld of Warcraft was a big part of my life years back, but I suddenly lost interest in computer gaming as a whole, missing the feeling of social interaction. I discovered the awesome development of board games, and I\u0027m really passionate about the hobby.\u003cbr\u003e",
