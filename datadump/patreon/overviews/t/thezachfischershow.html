We live in such a negative time.. you turn on the tv and there is killings here, bombings there... this political party attacking that political party!! At some point we need to tune out of the negativity and find positivity!! That is what my hope has always been for this!! \u00a0I spent months before starting my podcast praying and planning it out! It was really years in the making! I had done motivational videos, as well as blogs and posts... I tried a lot of platforms!! When anchor came out with their platform I fell in love!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I did a podcast challenge for the Denver Broncos as was beyond shocked at the support that I received! If you were apart of that... I can not thank you enough\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease Contribute\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please take a moment to think about what this podcast means to you and how many hours of content we\u0027ve already produced for you.  Then contribute anything you can afford.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your continuing support and God Bless!!"
