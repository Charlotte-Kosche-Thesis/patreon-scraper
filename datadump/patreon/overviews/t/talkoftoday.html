I\u0027d describe the podcast as:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA podcast for Generalists\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor people who want try to live a life without ignorance\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA podcast for people who just want to learn about a diverse range of topics and keep an up to date worldview\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA little bit about me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m 25 years old, and I live in Brisbane, Australia. I grew up living in Malaysia/Singapore, and being a digital native living in this globalised world, I identify as a citizen of the world - and would like to be formally reconised as one. I think it\u0027s time for us to formally recognise that we are bound by our humanity and this Earth, and use this recognition to advocate for global interests, and as a mechanism to deliver access to basic needs and human rights.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHead to \u003ca href=\"http://www.globalcitizenship.today/\"\u003ewww.globalcitizenship.today\u003c/a\u003e for more details!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would it mean to me if you became my Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I have to work 3-4 days a week to support myself. I work the spend the rest of the days of the week (weekends included) working on the podcast, YouTube channel and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.globalcitizenship.today\"\u003eGlobal Citizenship Today\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will allow me to work on discussing and sharing the developments that are shaping our world, as well as pursue this global citizenship dream.

What not just ads?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not really sure how I feel about ads...I\u0027m not a fan of them personally. I really value my time, and I don\u0027t want people taking that away just so I can consume some content. So, I think I should treat my audience the same way! By supporting me on Patreon, we can cut the crap and talk about the fun and important stuff. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you for supporting me and the dream of living a more informed life.
