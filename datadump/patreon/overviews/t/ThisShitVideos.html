    "summary": "Behold the glory of my inability to floss before filming a vlog!! Seriously, though, it seems silly to go over a whole buttload of information when everything you need to know is in the video included here. Of course, for those who don\u0027t want to sit through three minutes of me babbling on, I\u0027ll go ahead and hit the main bullet points:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS \"THIS SHIT\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s an animated series meant to provide an outlet for my weird ideas and general silliness. We animate story ideas, random concepts, and weird conversations recorded in a podcast format.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY AM I ON PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, YouTube has yet to figure out their algorithms to ensure that animators have a fighting chance in a sea of live action uploads. I\u0027m asking for donations per upload because some months are busier than others and I don\u0027t want anyone to be paying a monthly charge if a time should come along when I can\u0027t upload anything for a month. Just know that you can set a monthly limit, so if you want to donate $2 per video, but can only afford $4 a month, you can set that limit and won\u0027t pay any more, no matter how many animations I upload.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny patronage here will help buy me a little time off work each week to spend more time on making more and better animations. This is what I want to do for a living, but working 40 hours a week really eats into creative time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eANYTHING ELSE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you can\u0027t donate, I am simply doing this in the hopes to reach anyone else out there that feels like a square peg trying to fit into a round hole. So if all you can do is subscribe, comment, or even just laugh at the content, then I have done what I\u0027ve set out to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for checking out the page! I hope you enjoy the content and look forward to releasing more content very soon."
