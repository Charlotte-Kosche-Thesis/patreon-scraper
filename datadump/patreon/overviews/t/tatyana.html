To make new musical videos. I have a very-very small team of one (all-around) person with whom we make all our videos. All the light, sound, camera, filming, editing and so on will be made by ourselves. It takes around 30-60 hours to produce a new video (and there is NO time for practicing included and yes, sometimes I need some months to make the piece ready for recording). So it takes really a lot of time to make a high quality video and your support is very much appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n2. To make guitar tutorial videos. There is a new video project \"Ask Tatyana\", where I can answer all your questions and share with you my technique tricks, exercises, how to practice and to develop your playing.\u003cbr\u003e3. To make\nthe videos more exciting \u2013 this means new great locations, light, equipment,\nother musicians etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eLet\u0027s stay in touch,\u003cbr\u003eYour Tatyana Ryzhkova.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
