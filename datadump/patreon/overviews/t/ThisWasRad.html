Paul is an avid movie fan of everything from Star Wars to The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Greg is an video production professional who\u0027s love of movies runs deep into cinema\u0027s core including owning a large collection of Criterion certified movies. Together they form This Was Rad! Podcast.\u003cbr\u003eAs the podcast has slowly grown we\u0027ve done our best to add better equipment, improve our sound, and just provide the funniest, most insightful, and raddest podcast we can. Now we are asking our loyalest fans to help us out and go to eleven! For the smallest amount possible you\u0027ll help to us continue to bring you clever catch-phrases like \"crop tops all around\" and recount the \"flippy floppy laws\" broken and of course remind you, we are all \"human garbage\" :)\u003cbr\u003eAs always, we here at This Was Rad! Podcast appreciate every listener who takes the time to download the cast and hope you continue to do so.\u003cbr\u003e"
