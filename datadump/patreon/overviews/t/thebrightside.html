The comic will, of course, continue to be published free on the internet, FOREVER. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I\u0027ll be able to spend more time drawing side comics (there\u0027s so many side comics I could be drawing!!), extra art, and working on that database of death gods/depictions which used to be chilling on my site with a total dearth of updates for all that time. Potentially, I could also work more on producing merchandise (do you want a plushie death?? everybody wants a plushie death i\u0027m 100% certain of this) and other currently-vague ideas. These are all distant dreams unless I can count on the support of YOU! YES, YOU! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you in!? \u003cbr\u003e"
