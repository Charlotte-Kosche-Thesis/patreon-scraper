Theater, certainly, both in DC and beyond -- but also travel, life in the rich and changing neighborhoods of the nation\u0027s capital, maybe even some politics. Whatever keeps me awake, really, when I ought to be getting more sleep. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis time I\u0027m calling it something else.
