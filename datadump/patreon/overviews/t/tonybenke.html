    "summary": "I\u0027m Tony Benke, and I\u0027m a bit of a strange fellow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll my life, I\u0027ve been fascinated by storytelling, be it through verbal communication, the written word, graphic oriented art, songs/music, or the in depth storyline of a video game based RPG. I was (and still am) a HUGE Star Wars fan, and during my elementary school years, I used all of my allowance to purchase novels written in the Star Wars Expanded Universe (now known as Star Wars Legends and no longer considered to be canon source material...EF YOU Disney!) series.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my creative endeavors back in middle school, both as a musician and as a writer of fan fiction for my favorite video game series (Final Fantasy).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my high school years, I shifted gears a bit by focusing predominantly on writing songs and playing guitar in a heavy metal band. That time period is what gave me an idea of what the creative process is all about, with such things as writer\u0027s block and keeping the fans happy becoming all too familiar to me, along with the expenses that come with the process; both of the monetary and time nature.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my early twenties, I moved to Florida for a few years and rediscovered my long lost love: fishing. In fact, I loved fishing so much that on the days where weather conditions weren\u0027t favorable for fishing, I spent my free time writing both informative and story styled articles in a now defunct blog, several of which were submitted to and published in a few outdoors magazines and local newspapers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo where exactly does that leave us now, and why are we here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell first off, a bit about the current \"me\". My name is Tony Benke, I\u0027m 30 years old, happily married to a beautiful and wonderful graphic designer named Kira, and the proud father of one sassy tuxedo cat named Mackerel, an incredibly fat and overly affectionate all grey kitty named Tarpon, and a gigantic and lovable Alaskan Malamute (not a husky!) named Athena...and like her namesake, she is definitely the Goddess of Destruction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work a more or less dead end job as a CNC Machinist, and though I love the work I do, it\u0027s not really the best paying job and the shop I\u0027m at doesn\u0027t really offer any positions for me to advance to. Plus, since it\u0027s what we refer to in the trade as a \"production shop,\" it doesn\u0027t really offer much opportunity to exercise my creative desires.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo before you ask why I stay at the job, I\u0027ll just cut right to it: I\u0027m comfortable there. I\u0027ve built up enough seniority to earn a decent amount of paid time off, which gets utilized by taking extended weekends for travel and/or kayak fishing. Aside from doing graphic design, my wife is also competitive kayak angler. The many tournaments we (well...she) participate in take us all over the state of Michigan and occasionally out of state.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what exactly am I doing and why are we here? Well, to put it simply, I want to write, and I\u0027ve already started. Over the last two years, I\u0027ve been jotting down ideas and have crafted my very own world, one based on the one we live in today. This world I\u0027ve created is vast and detailed, with a rather extensive timeline...factors which will allow me to produce mountains of content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn late August of 2017, I started my first book in this world which will kick off a 3 - 5 book series titled \"The Immunity Virus\" which will have a 3 - 5 book followup series that takes place approximately 26 years after the conclusion of The Immunity Virus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also began working on a plethora of short stories based in this world, the majority of them being character back stories and...well, just short stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem that I\u0027ve encountered is that my full time job puts a huge cramp on my writing lifestyle. The hours are long, the work is physically and mentally exhausting, and at the end of the day I find myself so drained and so short on time that it affects my creative process in a negative manner.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you made it this far, congrats!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re part of the \"too long; didn\u0027t read\" crowd, that\u0027s cool, too...because at least you skipped down here to see what I\u0027m doing and what I\u0027m looking for. That being said, here it is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy wife and I live a pretty humble lifestyle, but even so, the bills get daunting at times. With my long hours and the exhausting nature of my work, it\u0027s hard for me to generate quality content in a timely manner while maintaining my dwindling shreds of sanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo...well, I\u0027m looking for the help of you generous Patrons so that I may deliver tons of quality content while still being able to keep the lights on and food on the table. To do that, I\u0027ve come to the conclusion that I need to cut my work hours in order to have more time to write. Without your generous contributions, I\u0027ll be unable to do that. I\u0027ll still be able to generate content, but it will take so much longer, and it will be very difficult for me to guarantee the quality of work that I wish to produce.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I\u0027ll be able to write more often and produce quality work while still taking care of my financial obligations both through your contributions and the income from the part time position I\u0027ll eventually be taking on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be many gifts for my Patrons that will reflect their contribution levels, including such things as free copies and/or advanced copies of my stories/books, to copies of my behind-the-scenes journals/outlines/research journals/character bios, to having the opportunity to develop a character of your choosing based on yourself through personal one on one discussions that will have a short story or three with them as the main character...with possible inclusion in the main series!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me make my dream and my world become a literary reality while becoming a part of it in one way or another. Help me, Patrons. You\u0027re my only hope!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, not really, but we can get so much more done together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
