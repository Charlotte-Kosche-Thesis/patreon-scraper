    "summary": "We believe humanity is at its best when its exploring. Exciting roads to the future are opened up. When we boldly explore it inspires a new generation of engineers, scientists, artists and mathematicians, leading to awesome new technology we could only dream about before. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the most incredible moments in history was landing humans on the moon. Walking on a world, alien to us, for the first time. Since then we have scaled back our ambitions. We scaled back our exploration. We have lost the ability to return.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot for much longer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoon we will have three or more companies able to put humans back on the Moon. They will reach even further and put humans on Mars. And they will reach beyond, inspiring a whole new generation.\n\nWe believe we are living on the cusp of the greatest story humanity has ever told. We tell that story each week as it unfolds.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome with us and explore tomorrow!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ngUPXizoWUY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is TMRO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTMRO (pronounced \u0027tomorrow\u0027) is a live, weekly show all about space and the cosmos. Join hosts Benjamin and Cariann Higginbotham, Jared Head, our Space Mike hologram and producer Duta each week as we dive in to what it will take to get humans on to other worlds, who is making amazing things happen in space, and how soon you\u0027ll be able to take a trip in to micro gravity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re not a small fly-by-night podcast but rather a small fly-by-rocket live show with a team of very dedicated people who want to get you excited about space! Now in our 10th Orbit, we have covered the final Space Shuttle missions live, cheered along with the winners of next generation rocket competitions and brought everyone a bit closer to the cosmos week after week. And we like to have fun while doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.tmro.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/20170607_204048.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin us live every Saturday on Twitch and YouTube at 18:00 UTC / 2:00 pm EDT / 11:00 am PDT and help us continue to produce the show. Great video takes a lot of time and money. Your contributions will help us reach further, do more and get everyone excited about the amazing future humanity has.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a way for you to reward us for making great content that inspires humanity. On-video ads do make a little bit of money, but not very much. Instead of requiring us to rely on ads, become a Patron of TMRO for as little as $0.01 or as much as you would like. Contribute whatever amount you think the show is worth to you and change that easily at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we release a new on-demand show archive, you\u0027ll pay your pledged amount as a way to support us. Worried that we\u0027ll release 10,000 shows in a month and bleed you dry? Set an upper cap so that even if we do release a lot of great new content, you\u0027re never spending more than you want.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTMRO is excited to use Patreon as a way to let us focus on creating fun live shows and content and not have to worry about payment processing, refunds, etc. We\u0027re excited to work with Patreon and look forward to hanging out with everyone!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
