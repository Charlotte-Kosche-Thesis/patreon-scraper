You probably know me as TitanLeon almost anywhere, or TheLastLeon if you\u0027re from Twitter! Either way, call me Leon, it\u0027s easier for everyone that way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/2lu3lhk.png\" style=\"width: 381px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo whether you know me from FurAffinity, deviantArt, Twitter or whatever else, you should know that I\u0027m a vore fan; it\u0027s the thing I like to draw the most, but of course I\u0027m all for diversity. I like macro/micro, muscles, general furry art, heck I even like humans! *gasp*. I\u0027m also a big video game nerd and a heroic fantasy fan if you\u0027re interested in that kinda thing~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you haven\u0027t found me on one site yet, here are links to my galleries!\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt; \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/titanleon/\"\u003eFurAffinity\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://titanleon.deviantart.com/\"\u003edeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026gt;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/TheLastLeon\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy did I start Patreon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eThat one is simple, and very common. student loans are scary, and recently graduated vulpines are rather short on money usually. I really want to be able to do what I love (i.e. draw) more, and working 40 hours a week very much hinders this. \u003cbr\u003eBasically, I want to make a little extra income on art so that I can put more time and love into my art and offer more drawings to all you lovely people! c:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do I have to offer?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eArt! Obviously haha. There\u0027s a lot I want to offer, and for those of you who pledge to other artists on this site, you probably know the gist of what to expect~ Above the occasional post of pieces and WIPs, I\u0027m hoping to have a regular flow of stuff for you guys! Every patron counts, and that\u0027s why I want to be able to give back for your generosity and support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what does that mean I get, Leon?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eYou can check the list of pledges on the right for a rundown on rewards, but lemme make give more details about some of these points.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePolls:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eEach month, there will be a poll with theme choices for the month. With voting power, you can sway which direction my art will go for the month, and hopefully everyone gets into more of what they\u0027d like to see! There will also be additional polls occasionally to determine certain characters involved in upcoming projects, or any other topics I\u0027d rather know what -you- guys think!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThemes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eNow this, as I just said above, is the theme of the content that will be produced for the month (excluding art rewards for pledgers). Starting from a certain pledge, patrons will have the opportunity to actually suggest a theme which will be voted on in the poll!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt rewards:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003eFor anyone in this category, you have an assured \"commission\" from me, so to speak. Before the middle of the month (the 15th of each month to not be confusing), send me your idea and we can discuss it. I\u0027ll give a reminder a few days before the deadline, as it would be a shame to forfeit such a reward!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eRules and stuff!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eSo here\u0027s the whole part that\u0027s important to read so we both avoid unnecessary. The terms of service I use for my commissions completely apply here. So whether you are wondering about what topics I am or am not okay with, or how I proceed with art rewards, refer to it \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/wqasacg9ji2zl1r/Terms%20of%20Service%20TitanLeon.pdf?dl=0\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn conclusion\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eI do hope you guys enjoy what I have to offer, and I am extremely grateful to any of you for all the support, past, present, and future. Thanks a lot, and let the art commence~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
