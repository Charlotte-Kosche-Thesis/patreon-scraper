Welcome to the Archer and the Squirrel!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the Comic:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Archer and the Squirrel tells the story of Lark, a young woman in the pursuit of a better life. When the Colludian King offers a handsome reward for an unusual bounty, Lark jumps at the opportunity. However, things aren\u0027t always what they seem in the Draiocht Woods. What started out as a simple hunting trip, turns into something much more\u2026 dangerous. Now, Lark must learn how to navigate a new type of hunting ground, one full of secrets and magic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Tieback, but you can call me Tie for short. I\u2019m the creator of the Archer and the Squirrel. While, I\u2019ve been drawing comics for years, this webcomic is the first story I\u2019ve published online. I\u2019m a traditional media artist, which I know is\u00a0\u003cem\u003euncommon\u003c/em\u003e in the world of webcomics. It requires more tools, supplies, and time. But hot damn I love my watercolors! I also love cosplay and cats. Well, \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e might not be the right word. It would be more accurate to say that: cats, comics and cosplay are the reasons I eat.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTimeline:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently, this comic updates every other Tuesday, so twice a month. But in months that have five Tuesdays, you get a bonus third page on the fifth Tuesday! It\u2019s my goal to shift this comic into a weekly updating schedule, but I first need to study for and pass two big day-job required tests. Grrrr.... responsibilities.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFunding:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Archer and the Squirrel is a FREE comic. That\u2019s right, you could move along to my website, read the story as it\u2019s published, and never drop a dime. However, if you find you like this story, please support it. It takes a tremendous amount of time to create this comic, not to mention the expense of art supplies. By becoming a Patreon, YOU keep this story going!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
