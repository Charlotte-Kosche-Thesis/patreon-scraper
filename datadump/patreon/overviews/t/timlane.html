Although the Great American Mythological Drama is not an easy thing to describe, it essentially involves an idea of America that streams down to us through folklore and legend as much as it does newspapers, books, and historical documents. It has to do with the ideals we hold firm to as ideas that are distinct to American culture and our collective idea of America, in general. It involves pop culture superficially, but also the deeper, more meaningful ideologies that shape us. I believe that pop culture tends to be the superficial result of the deeper ideological ways in which we both perceive and define ourselves. In this way, the two are fundamentally linked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m currently working on an interpretive biographical graphic novel about the actor, Steve McQueen. I say \u201cinterpretive,\u201d for many reasons, but mainly because I\u2019m using the life of Steve McQueen as a conduit to construct a picture of American culture that both shaped Steve McQueen, and was partly shaped by his influence. This book is artistically inclined - heavily influenced by works such as Michael Ondaatje\u2019s \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Collected Works of Billy the Kid\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eComing Through Slaughter\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, and David Clewell\u2019s \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eJack Ruby\u2019s America\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. In other words, it is not a traditional biography. Rather, it is an experiment in what the potentialities are in writing about the life of a real person, and a more subjective consideration of how that person\u2019s influence touched the life of the \u201cbiographer.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"640\" src=\"https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7600/28326621710_31d73b943e_z.jpg\" width=\"454\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis graphic novel, whose working title is \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eJust Like Steve McQueen\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, is as much about the art of writing, drawing, and sequential story-telling as it is about it\u2019s protagonist, Steve McQueen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"640\" src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8883/27996860513_f4e3f43f73_z.jpg\" width=\"503\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpon first glance, the completed book might look like a sequence of short stories all linked by a chronological exploration of McQueen\u2019s life. My interest in the differences between what is true and factual as opposed to what is myth and rumor will be explored in the style in which I\u2019m making this book. Each chapter in the book will be told from the point of view of a different narrator - for example, one chapter might be written from the point of view of someone who claims to have known McQueen\u2019s father, another from the point of view of a woman who claims to be one of McQueen\u2019s former lovers. Sometimes, the narrator will be me. Sometimes the narrator will be directly linked to McQueen, others only tangentially. Sometimes it will be McQueen himself. Like that. My intention is to also create various chapters using a genre of cartooning that would be applicable to both the mood of the story, as well as the era in which the story takes place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"640\" src=\"https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8765/28611069535_da776110b9_z.jpg\" width=\"408\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSteve McQueen died in 1980, when he was 50 years old. Although I was only nine years old, I was born into an America that had already been influenced by Steve McQueen, in the same way that it was an American already influenced by Elvis Presley, Martin Luther King, Jr, Malcolm X, the Kennedy brothers, Bob Dylan, and Chuck Berry. In other words, I was born with these influences, and so many others, already in my DNA.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnown in his time as the \u201cKing of Cool,\u201d McQueen led an extraordinary life. As a boy, he was abandoned by his mother and never knew his father, spent time in street gangs in Indianapolis and LA, and was abused by a step-father during a short-lived reunion with his alcoholic mother. He was a reform school kid. He had joined the merchant marines after lying about his age, wound up working in a Caribbean brothel, hitchhiked and hopped freight trains across America and into Canada, worked for traveling carnivals, and had joined the Marines - all before he was 20 years old. By the time he landed in New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village in the late 1940s and early 50s - and still without any particular direction in life - he already had more physical life experience than some people attain in a lifetime. A lot of travel, adventure, and haplessness - themes you might recognize if you\u2019re familiar with any of my previous work. McQueen\u2019s  story, even by the age of 20, doesn\u2019t lack drama or excitement. And the rest of his life, I assure you, is just as interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, beyond that, it is how much McQueen was a man of his time that interests me, and how the backdrop of his life speaks broadly of that illusive American myth I find so interesting. And how his legacy is still relevant today. Despite having died almost forty years ago, his image is still used to sell watches, sunglasses, leather jackets, cars, and of course,  motorcycles.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn example of this: I recently read an article in \u003cem\u003eMen\u2019s Health\u003c/em\u003e about the importance of  every man owning a \u201cclassic leather jacket,\u201d and McQueen was used as one of the reasons why this was so. How is it possible that a man who\u2019s been dead for nearly forty years still has that kind of impact? What is it about what he represented that still captures our imaginations?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother example: Again, after finding a full page advertisement of McQueen for Tag/Heuer watches in a contemporary magazine (I forget which one), I noticed that the ad seemed to assume everybody still knew who Steve McQueen was. It wasn\u2019t a posed shot - it was simply a candid of him strapping on his racing helmet, wherein the watch he\u2019s wearing is clearly visible. I showed this ad to my wife in disbelief, and she just said, \u201cYeah, but look how cool he looks.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, of course, she was right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/145592844@N04/28573509555/in/album-72157671509456556/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"640\" src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8575/28573509555_d450305210_z.jpg\" width=\"449\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eBut those examples mentioned above, I argue, are only the superficial ice tip of his contemporary cultural relevance. His story is both simultaneously unique and classic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"358\" src=\"https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8580/28504282762_269d51bc0e_z.jpg\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMcQueen\u2019s is a rags to riches story. An outsider story. A story of a person who doggedly fought to remain his own man, without rulers. He descends from the philosophy of rugged individualism. He was  anti-intellectual, and relied heavily on his considerable street smarts and instincts. And, among these other things, his is a story of a true American rebel - all themes that fit into the greater idea of the Great American Mythological Drama.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"640\" src=\"https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7495/28611182165_5cf575c6fa_z.jpg\" width=\"449\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a very personal way, this book is also a kind tribute to, as well as a criticism of, a type of American masculinity that I rarely see in contemporary culture anymore, but from which I descend. One way to look at it is like this: If you\u2019re like me, you love and respect your father and grandfathers patly because they embody an idea of masculinity from which you are proud to be in some way connected. But, on the other hand, there are many things that they represent, as the result of their masculinity, that you might find embarrassing or inappropriate in contemporary culture. In this book, I intend to explore those themes - like a son who, although critical of the men who raised him, very much loves and venerates, and very often, misses their spirit. It is also a recognition of the fact that they - those fathers and grandfathers - are themselves merely descendants of a complicated history of American masculinity that stems back to the Declaration of Independence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"640\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8229/28504205832_815e59dc2a_z.jpg\" width=\"489\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019d like to ask for your support with  this project. Above all else, I need time to complete this book. It has already taken me three years since I began - the first year was spent entirely in the research phase (although the \u201cresearch phase\u201d never really ends). In the past, I\u2019ve made my living as a freelance illustrator, but, the trouble is, the more freelance work I take on, the less time I have to work on this book.  In a perfect world, I\u2019d like to have the book finished within the next three years. But I need directed, focused time to do this. And, of course, money. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there\u2019s more to it than that. Writing graphic novels can be a lonely business. I think it would be fun to have a community of people to converse with as this project rolls out. To get feedback - from those of you who are McQueen fans, pop culture fans, comic and graphic novel fans, storytellers and writers, on and on, because I believe this book will appeal to people with wide and varying interests. I look forward to opening up my studio and showing you some of the things that only my poor wife and a few friends know I\u2019m excited about - such as the miniature bust of McQueen I sculpted to shine noir-ish lights on for reference purposes, and the creations of Sam Shepard-inspired original stories I\u2019ve written in which McQueen will star and be \u201cdirected\u201d in Robert Mulligan-like style. Diagrams for models of McQueen, like the kind you might have found in Aurora model kits, only the scenes depicted in my model diagrams aren\u2019t from his popular movies, but lesser known movies, or moments in McQueen\u2019s life. The creation of new, original stories that are meant for McQueen to be the protagonist (or possibly antagonist). Various things like that - not all of which might make the cut for the book, but things attempting to relate, both in narrative and visuals, but most importantly, \u003cem\u003ein spirit\u003c/em\u003e, the personal connection to McQueen I have, as well as his impact on culture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"640\" src=\"https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8615/28504212022_5b69654328_z.jpg\" width=\"463\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Lastly, I hope to explore what we\u2019re actually talking about when we talk about \u201ccool.\u201d For anyone who has ever been a teenager, you know the importance of the word, but what exactly does it mean? The words of the immortal jazz innovator Louis Armstrong come to mind. When asked what jazz was, Armstrong answered, \u201cIf you have to ask, you\u2019ll never know.\u201d Maybe seeking a definition of \u201ccool\u201d is like that. But, at the risk of proving myself to be decidedly uncool, I want to explore that subject a little. After all, what value is there in attempting to make art if the artist isn\u2019t willing to reveal his vulnerabilities, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"640\" src=\"https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8753/28580573996_43b5b40e60_z.jpg\" width=\"519\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u2019ll find various incentives listed on this page that will be offered to you for varying levels of your support.
