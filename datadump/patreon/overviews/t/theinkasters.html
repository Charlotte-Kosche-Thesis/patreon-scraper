    "summary": "Alright, settle down, youngsters. Story time. Two guys loved telling (trash) stories together through the medium of tabletop gaming and, sharing a mutual enthusiasm for writing (trash), decided to try their hand at collaborative storytelling. They were real good at mixing delusions of grandeur with no illusions of competence, so they decided to call themselves \"The Inkasters\" -- your bargain bin Inklings.  After tens of thousands of words, or in my own case hundreds of thousands of words, I\u0027d like to think we\u0027ve passed into the realm of being... Hell, I\u0027ll say it and say it proud.  Adequate.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMore seriously, soon after the project started is when my friend squid_foot, after years of writing various campaigns and some short stories, made moves to try and turn his hobby into a profession while I, your humble gorilla_fingers remain a hobbyist, if an enthusiastic one (if those hundreds of thousands of words wasn\u0027t a dead give away). So if you\u0027re here, you\u0027re likely from a link in one of my free online fan works and, while you might\u0027ve gotten the gist from that, a few things need to be put out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, I\u0027m not asking you to buy updates to my works you may enjoy.\u00a0 This Patreon in no way affects whether or not I\u0027ll update or how frequently:\u00a0 regardless of whether you support it or not, you\u0027ll get free content at a similar pace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, this isn\u0027t me desperate for money in such a way that threatens my ability to get the content to you guys.\u00a0 I\u0027m relatively okay on paying my bills right now so I\u0027m not about to drop off the face of the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat this is, then, is basically a tip jar:\u00a0 if you\u0027ve read my works and enjoyed them a great deal, then this is merely here as a means of supporting me if you\u0027d like as, while my financial status isn\u0027t dire, every little bit obviously helps.\u00a0 If you like what I put out and you\u0027d like to toss in a few cents, then feel free to do so.\u00a0 If not?\u00a0 Well, I hope you enjoy the work I put out regardless and I appreciate your readership.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you decide to become a Patron or not, know that I greatly appreciate any amount of investment or attention you\u0027ve paid to anything I\u0027ve written."
