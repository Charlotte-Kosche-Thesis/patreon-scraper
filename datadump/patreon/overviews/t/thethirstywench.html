    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eHi there, my name is Robin LeBlanc. I\u0027m a Toronto-based writer and photographer who, for nearly three years now, has run a site focused on international and local craft beers called \u003ca href=\"http://www.thethirstywench.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Thirsty Wench\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site has seen a fair bit of success in recent years. I was the only Canadian finalist in Saveur Magazine\u0027s 2013 and 2014 Best Food Blog Awards in the Beer \u0026amp; Wine category, a winner of the 2014 awards, as well as \u003ca href=\"http://www.saveur.com/article/siteswelove/The-Thirsty-Wench\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea highlight in their \"Sites We Love\" section\u003c/a\u003e. I am a regular guest on \u003ca href=\"http://www.rogerstv.com/page.aspx?rid=16\u0026amp;lid=12\u0026amp;sid=126\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRogers Daytime Toronto\u003c/a\u003e where I present television viewers with selected local beers. I have appeared in \u003ca href=\"http://www.nowtoronto.com/guides/beer/2013/story.cfm?content=193442\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNOW Magazine\u0027s Beer Guide\u003c/a\u003e, given interviews on the craft beer scene for \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/robin-leblanc/thirsty-wench-680-news-spot-1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e680 News\u003c/a\u003e and several other radio shows, and am regularly asked to judge or be on a panel for beer events throughout the city and beyond. Since starting up the site in 2011, I have been spreading the gospel of good quality beer by writing posts that successfully dance the line between entertaining and informative. From \u003ca href=\"http://thethirstywench.com/2012/09/18/4-comics-4-beers/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecomic and beer pairings\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://thethirstywench.com/2014/02/06/when-are-you-going-to-get-certified-the-prudhomme-and-cicerone-beer-certification-programs/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003elooking at beer certification programs\u003c/a\u003e, to talking about \u003ca href=\"http://thethirstywench.com/2013/11/08/barkeep-another-course-the-canadian-craft-beer-cookbook/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ecooking with beer\u003c/a\u003e and even looking in to \u003ca href=\"http://thethirstywench.com/2013/11/15/premium-near-beer-a-look-at-quality-non-alcoholic-beers/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003enon-alcoholic beers that don\u0027t suck\u003c/a\u003e, I have helped open up a lot of people\u0027s minds to the complex, versatile world of beer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also make absolutely no money doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile The Thirsty Wench is definitely a site built from a strong passion for craft beer, I often have to put the focus on creating posts on the back burner in favour of paid work (which, as an underpaid freelancer, isn\u0027t much). Sadly, the chances of landing a columnist job for a paper are very slim, as the landscape for hiring is HAHAHAHAHA....pretty terrible. Let\u0027s not even go in to how dreadful payment is for freelance writers. Trust me. It\u0027s bad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I come to you folks of the Great and Powerful Internet and humbly request that you help me relieve some of the financial stress and allow me to continue to produce articles surrounding craft beer that will make you laugh, think, discuss, and drink what I hope will be a damn fine beer. Any help you can offer would be appreciated, as it would help cover my basic needs and give me the flexibility to go forward with potential plans such as organizing beer events, attending educational seminars, and perhaps even a spot of travel to look in to the different beer scenes out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s Patreon as I understand it: You can give a set amount per article I produce, or to make sure that I don\u0027t drain your account by posting constantly as part of an hourly salute to penguins in silly hats (I will not do this I swear), you can choose a set amount per month to pay. So you can pay, say, $5 per article and set a limit of $15 per month so no matter what, you\u0027re still paying what you can while not having to worry about depleting your account. As of writing this, an article is anywhere between 500-1500 words. In terms of content, you can expect things like reviews, event run-downs, informational pieces, pairing suggestions, and my own personal journey in the world of our favourite fermented drink.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever happens, whatever goes down, I want to thank you for taking the time to read this. This is something I really love doing and I want to keep on doing it. With your help, I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(\u003ca href=\"http://zigposca.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eabove image by Manny Hernaez\u003c/a\u003e)"
