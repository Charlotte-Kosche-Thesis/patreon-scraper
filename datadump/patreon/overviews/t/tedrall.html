Ask my colleagues at Charlie Hebdo. I\u0027ve gotten more threats of bodily harm and even death than I can count, mostly from right wingers but also from some self-identified lefties. But terrorists and thugs aren\u0027t the biggest danger to hard-hitting political cartoon and commentary. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEconomics are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know, journalism is facing a serious economic crisis. The demise of print has lead to a loss of funding for journalists, cartoonists, photographers, and political analysts like me. Thanks to the Internet, I have a bigger audience than ever before. But online outlets haven\u0027t figured out how to pay for good journalism or political cartooning \u2013 which is why people like me are coming to people like you to ask for your support. If you value professional, independent political cartoon and analysis like I do, you will have to help support it or it will simply vanish. All that would leave behind is the bleak landscape of corporate media and the bland establishmentarian content that it produces.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a clip of me mixing it up with FOXNews host Sean Hannity:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SP2W9N6BYfg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here\u0027s one of the many interviews I\u0027ve given, this one about Edward Snowden and the NSA:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7AB8tQKvtto\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy It Matters\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you believe in democracy, and in a better future, as I do, you know it\u0027s important to get behind the social and political critics who are helping to pave the way to that future. People like me have trouble gaining access to mainstream media. Don\u0027t get me wrong \u2013 I\u0027ve had a lot of luck, appearing in places like the \u003cem\u003eLos Angeles Times\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eVillage Voice\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eRolling Stone\u003c/em\u003e magazine, \u003cem\u003eThe Nation\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eEsquire\u003c/em\u003e, you name it. 20 or 30 years ago, the kind of career that I\u0027ve had \u2013 the kind of career that I\u0027m having \u2013 would have generated an income that would have been very comfortable to live on, even thrive. But outlets have shrunk, especially paid outlets. Pay rates have plummeted. Budget cuts have led to newspapers canceling their syndicated comic strips. Because they\u0027re so scared, it\u0027s harder to find editors willing to publish anything that questions the basic underpinnings of the American system: the two-party duopoly, free-market capitalism, endless warfare. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome outlets have even been corrupted. Last summer, for example, the LA Times fired and smeared me as a favor to the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. The reason seems obvious: the LAPD pension fund was the number one shareholder of the parent company of the LA Times.
