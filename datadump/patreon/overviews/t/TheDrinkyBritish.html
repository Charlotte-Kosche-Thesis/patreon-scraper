Long overdue update!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off: Apologies for the slow-down on ALL Patreon (And frankly, all other) artwork projects. Due to my new employment late last year, I\u0027ve had my time free to do artwork cut down considerably, meaning I\u0027m squeezing in as much as I can. I\u0027m playing catch-up with a lot of stuff, so I thank you all for your patience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIN ADDITION: Due to the new restrictions on certain \u0027lottery rewards\u0027 for Patreon, I\u0027m reworking my rewards system. A new \u0027Icon reward\u0027 will be up on the $10 tier and be finding some new, equally-satisfying reward for my Patrons during those particular streams where I want to give something back to those who are supporting me. For starters, this\u0027ll begin with more regular \u0027WIP updates\u0027 here on the Patreon site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again to all those who have supported me for as long as they have! It means -the world- to me! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE 13/10/15:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am going to be changing the day of which I host my donation streams due to issues with some folks being unable to attend, as well as adjustments to my own schedule. Instead of running them on Sundays, I\u0027ll instead be conducting them on \u003cstrong\u003eFRIDAY\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0from the next scheduled stream, which will be on the \u003cstrong\u003e23rd October\u003c/strong\u003e. Following raffle winners will be announces this coming Friday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE 14/08/15:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs per my donation stream incentive that approaches with my changes to the sketch lottery, I\u0027ll be doing my first \u0027Patreon Choice\u0027 piece this Sunday. A poll will be featured here for donators who vote for or select their own predator. Any tie-breaker will be decided by viewers in the stream to finally put forward the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the \u0027prey\u0027 for this piece, that will simply be decided by anyone who wishes to have a character put forward and then will be decided by a simple dice roll live!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e26/07/15:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollowing some changes currently happening in my own life, I\u0027m having to reconsider the way in which I am conducting my art donation streams. I am going to do my best to continue doing them at their original intended times as planned by the recent milestone goal, HOWEVER... the way in which I will be arranging winners is going to change, simply because the workload for my current availability has become too high atop of trying to find new work and other life matters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs such, I will now be putting the entirety of my donation thresholds together into ONE lottery and doing TWO rolls per donation stream. These two picks shall earn winners quality of art designated by their donation amount to ensure that it\u0027s far to those who make the contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo balance this out, however, I will be doing a \u0027vote\u0027 piece as per my donation streams based upon a single theme. These will be started from 16th August!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is all about giving back something for viewers and donators to enjoy on a regular basis, be it art, streamed content of art production with narration (Something with a comedic touch!) and personalized commission work for those who want to give something more. I enjoy doing this kind of thing, sharing what I want to share with a community who enjoy seeing it just as much, so giving me your support will ensure I can dedicate more time and focus on giving an experience that you can all enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking a living from art is never easy. Any artist will tell you this, but having a little something extra to get along whilst making new art, working with new projects and spending time with fans of one\u0027s work just makes it that much more enjoyable and rewarding of an experience. Hopefully, I can even enhance the experience in the future!"

     "about": "Greetings and Salutations, Patreoner...ers. I\u0027m a 24 year-old British concept artist with a degree in Computer and Video Games, currently hoping to find work in the field of video game production or animation. As of right now, I\u0027m sadly out of work and trying to get a boost up on my productive side, hammering out as much as I can manage without my tablet pen catching fire! \u0026gt; .\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2D Stuff is where my specialty lies, as well as cartoon visuals. Some say my style\u0027s borrowed a lot from manga, which I suppose would be true! I\u0027m not the sort who\u0027s much into realism and the human form, but that doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t try to get all the details I can into what I produce. If anything, I\u0027m a stickler for details! You want me to draw you something? Gimme\u0027 all the information you can because I don\u0027t like to make guesses for other people and I\u0027ve usually got a reference for something I\u0027m working on, even if it\u0027s something I\u0027ve drawn dozens of times before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideo Games and animation are my passion. I like ideas that are beyond the realm of reality to be brought to life, given emotion and to bring emotion out of people, much like music. If it\u0027s a cartoon about a cardboard box in a warehouse and it can make you laugh or can make you cry? Then that\u0027s a good cartoon, in my opinion. The same could be said of 2D art also! Comics, particularly, though also what single images can make a person feel and interpret.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, as for where the name \u0027TheDrinkyBritish\u0027 came from, it merely derives from a nickname given to me by some friends from the US that I play video games with. It amused me thoroughly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
