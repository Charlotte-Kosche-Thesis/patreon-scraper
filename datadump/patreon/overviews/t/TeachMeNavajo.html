My name is Ryan \"Jeeyi\u0027 \" Mike. I am a Whitecorn Zuni Edgewater. I am born for the Bitter Water clan. My Maternal Grandfathers are the Red House Towering Clan and my Paternal Grandfathers are the Red Streak Running In The Water Clan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo share a little about the page Teach Me Din\u00e9- Navajo Language we would have to go back to my N\u00e1l\u00ed hastiin (my paternal grandfather) and the countless hours he spent telling stories and teaching the culture through the Din\u00e9 language to myself and my brothers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough those times I have learned so much about our rich Din\u00e9 culture and lifestyle and now I want to share it with you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom those experiences I have decided to share with those wishing to learn the language and the culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeach Me Din\u00e9- Navajo Language started as a small project to share basic vocabulary through social media, but now it has grown to something more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe it can grow even more with the help of donations and patreons so I have started this Patreon account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your patronage we can create something more and something amazing like no one has ever seen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re wondering \"Why do you need the money?\" Well, just like any work created it takes time and time is valuable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am starting with basic equipment right now: mostly on my phone and a mic. But with the incoming donations i believe i can focus more on improving quality and the type of material that will be shared. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the pledges and donations\u00a0it does make a difference, because simple posts that are created with no research or time and effort are poorly written and boring, but if I spend a little bit more of my time and effort into it it is well written and informative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I would like to thank all who become a patreon. I look forward to creating something educational and amazing with you. Ahx\u00e9hee\u0027. Thank you."
