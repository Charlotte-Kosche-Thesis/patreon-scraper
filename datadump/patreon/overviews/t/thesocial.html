    "summary": "the Social is a pretty simple concept--politics works best when we are able to properly meet each other. To do this we bring engaging speakers into spaces in which people enjoy themselves, namely a pub, and hold conversations that create shared understandings (plural).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRoughly, the format is as follows: anywhere between three (not two, to avoid a dichotomy) to five speakers, depending on the subject (it\u0027s difficult to limit speaking time with difficult subjects, so we prefer to have fewer speakers), speaking for 5 - 10 minutes. Then, a break of about 30 minutes for general milling and though digestion. Finally, we reconvene for a facilitated conversation that includes attendees.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hold one a month, and piece them together with two newsletters--one which serves as follow-up to the event, and another, a few weeks later, which introduces the upcoming event and provides content, such as videos and readings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll make a video at our up-coming event, which is December 14th, and which is titled \"#metoo, Power, and Violence in Modern Society\".\u003cbr\u003e"
