I\u0027m some dude named Gunnar Tarsa who received his BFA in drawing and my goal is to be a full-time artist. I spend countless hours a day doodling, diddling and scribbling my thoughts and creations on paper, computers, walls, streets, etc. Art has always been a part of my life but as I started my adult life I realized it was deeply attached to my soul. You see if I\u0027m not making things my spirit doesn\u0027t feel full. My dreams and ambitions rage in my head every waking moment telling me to color the whole world. That\u0027s exactly my plan for world domination. Thing is I can\u0027t complete that task alone. This is where your support and help comes into play because all of life is one big collaborative experience. I\u0027ve trained my gift of seeing and drawing and now I want to share it with as many humans as possible while sparking more creative minds along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I mentioned, I create a lot of artwork. Exhaustive amounts of teeny tiny drawings to large-scale\u00a0scrawlings that are the size of walls. Because of that, I will be uploading a lot of my art completely free across online sources. What you can expect to find here is a drawing series I have deemed as \"MIND MATTER\". This stream of consciousness form of creating allows me to pour all my thoughts into a shape or field and let them coalesce into a form of \"MATTER\". Their primary existence right now is small drawings that I turn into high-res digital files for all to download. The first set consists of fine black lines and forms which make them perfect for coloring and doodling on top of.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, for just $1.00 a month you will support me and all my matter. I hope to build a community of sorts where I can constantly engage, communicate, and collaborate with you all. Because after all, this is our story, not mine. I am simply a creative vessel spewing out the stories of history that are trapped within my mind and pressuring me from the world outside. I have set up two other rewards for those who really enjoy the things I create so you can acquire a piece of my brain to hang on your wall and dissect. Art is not decoration, it\u00a0is exploration and I\u00a0aim to invite the viewer to get lost in\u00a0the drawings. Love and peace to you beautiful humans!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIDEAS IM WORKING TOWARDS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e- Coloring Book compilation of my \"Mind Matter\" drawings\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- An artist book containing photos of all my work\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- A podcast\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- Videos on art making \u0026amp; art history\u003cbr\u003e- A Comic Book\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- A local and digital sketchbook club\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFILE DISTRIBUTION\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFiles will be posted on the Patreon feed for download as high-res PNGs for all of your coloring needs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"
