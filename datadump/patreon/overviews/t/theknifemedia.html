We offer readers top U.S. and world news stories without the sensationalism, bias and polarized opinions common in the media today. We also have a rating system that measures the level of objectivity of any news article, helping readers proactively choose the standard of news they wish to consume.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re a \u003cstrong\u003ecommitted team of 20 writers, analysts and editors\u003c/strong\u003e who are specialized in critical thinking and logic and are continually developing and refining the process for un-spinning and rating the news.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost media outlets depend on advertising to exist. They cater to needs of advertisers, which encourages bias and sensationalism. Not us. The Knife has chosen a model based fully on\u00a0 subscribers and patrons in order to ensure that \u003cstrong\u003ewe only serve the interests of our readers\u003c/strong\u003e and that our coverage isn\u2019t influenced by the needs of advertisers.

If you care about bringing critical thinking and objectivity to the media, we hope you find a home with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming our patron, you can enjoy key pieces of Knife content here on Patreon.

While we believe in the importance of accuracy and have a dedicated team of fact checkers, we believe it\u2019s just as important, if not more so, to identify when true information is distorted. This is more common in established media, more difficult to detect and significantly erodes our understanding of the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe use a \u003cstrong\u003emethodology based on the scientific method\u003c/strong\u003e that measures the objectivity of any communication. Our analysis process examines the spin, slant, logic and accuracy of every word, sentence and paragraph of a given news story. The final product gives you unbiased news and analysis that helps you identify distortions and become more critical and objective in how you consume news.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, The Knife\u2019s mission is to provide objective and factual news that \u003cstrong\u003eaccurately preserves history and elevates the level of critical thinking\u003c/strong\u003e and civil discourse in our society. In today\u2019s technologically advanced world, it is more important than ever to have standards for media and mass communication, as one piece of information can reach a global audience in seconds.
