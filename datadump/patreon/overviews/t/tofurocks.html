I am a freelancer who specializes in the development of narrative games (read: Visual Novels and Twine Games). I consider myself a writer first and foremost but also wear the hat of a programmer and GUI artist while using the Ren\u0027Py Engine. Some of my work may contain explicit adult scenarios, but I\u0027m not an eroge developer by any means.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what am I doing here on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I love developing indie games, it isn\u0027t paying the bills quite yet. I work part-time at a grocery store that treats me like I\u0027m full-time most days so by the time I come home, I\u0027m too drained to get to the important things in life. Having some supplemental monetary support from Patreon would mean I wouldn\u0027t have to beg for extra hours at my day job. It\u0027d also mean I\u0027d be less stressed out for the most part and have more time to work on my projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current big project is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://boop-studios.itch.io/talk-to-me\"\u003eTalk To Me, a VN being developed by Boop Studios\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0I released\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tofurocks.itch.io/eed\"\u003e8=D~\u0026lt;3, a Twine Game about some gay math nerds getting some poly action\u003c/a\u003e (contains explicit sexual content) not too long ago as well. To see some of my other work I\u0027ve done, please visit my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://tofurocks.itch.io/\"\u003eitch.io page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport of any kind would be greatly appreciated, whether it\u0027s $1 or spreading the word about my projects.
