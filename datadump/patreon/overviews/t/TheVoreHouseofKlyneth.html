    "summary": "The Vore House of Klyneth is a fetish-themed webcomic set in a modernized world of fantasy and magic, where the titular establishment has trained predators and prey that can be hired to safely indulge any and all vore-related fantasies. There will be potions, there will be spells, and there will be a whole lot of nomming going on at The Vore House of Klyneth, and the best way to be a part of that is to pledge your support to the cause!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWritten by Runa Merone and illustrated by Foxifly Studios, this webcomic aims for a weekly release schedule per page as well as supplementary side stories, one-offs, and short story prose to help flesh out the world. Together, we want to bring as many vore related fantasies to life as we can, exploring the myriad variations of endosomatophilia, predator and prey interactions, the intimacy and comfort that such relationships can foster, and everything in between up to and including the sexual elements involved. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of The Vore House of Klyneth and all associated media is to nurture positive (if fantastical) encounters where predator and prey can live in harmony, where nobody gets hurt, and fantasies can be indulged consequence free. There will be no snuff, no digestion, no hard vore, and no scat involved in this webcomic, though there may be some violence and blood in some cases if the situation calls for it or the client requests it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a webcomic, this series will be divided up into chapters, each ~15-30 pages long told over the course of a few (3-6) months. Within each chapter you can expect the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1 - Some plot regarding the operation of the Vore House and the characters that reside at the manor, their interactions, their hardships, and their growth to become better predators and prey. This will always be going on in the comic, even if it\u0027s not the primary focus. This is where we\u0027ll see much of the cameos and chosen background characters as determined by your pledges. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2 - A long form narrative revolving around that chapter\u0027s client; subject matter and character determined by an auction that decides that chapter\u0027s lucky winner. Ideally this will be a story about a customer\u0027s first time, their discovery of the Vore House through our marketing division (Staff determined by the $25 pledge tier), and their very specific vore scene with the Pred or Prey of their choice. Each chapter will be different to avoid monotony, but that\u0027s the basic idea, and that theme will be determined by our voters and the one who wins the bid. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3 - A world populated by our patrons. Given that we need your support, and the world needs to be filled with colorful characters, we dare not waste a single slot with a generic background character and would much rather fill it with all of you lucky gits! These slots will be filled with our $5 patrons, $10 patrons, and $15 patrons that don\u0027t win for that raffle in any given chapter. The highest of these slots will be given a role in the nearby city of Klyneth, be it a baker, a social media guru, or whatever you chose. The city needs citizens and the $15 tier will determine those key recurring background characters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4 \u2013 One quickie vore scene of 1-3 pages to set things up and get the mood going; subject matter and character determined by our $10 and up patrons. We\u0027re always looking to give back, and while each chapter will have one focal guest character and their story, there\u0027s room to give a few slots out to our patrons as well. These quickie vore scenes will take place concurrently to the main story, and will be labeled as such, that way they don\u0027t break up the flow of the narrative while still giving more of our fans a chance to indulge in their Vore House desires. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging, you are not only gaining access to the rewards tied to your tier (A role in the world, access to the Vore House chat, HD files, early access, raw data, and first look into the creative process to name a few), but you also get what we\u0027re calling Nom Tokens to be used exclusively at the Vore House. These Nom Tokens have a myriad of potential uses, from bidding on slots in those one-off side comic pages, purchasing exclusive Vore House icons/prepose spots, or buying a role in one of Runa\u0027s many short stories tied to the Vore House. These tokens will have plenty of uses, and while the Vore House is still young we are still exploring options, but their number of potential uses will increase over time. You will receive one Nom Token for every $10 you pledge, so if you\u0027re one of our $15/month patrons, you\u0027ll have six tokens after four months. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to the ongoing main story, there will also be side stories that take place concurrently in different parts of the world or in different parts of The Vore House manor, which can be bought outright, first dibs going to our patrons. That means that you can specifically commission a one page comic from Foxifly Studios or a 5-10k story from Runa Merone for 75 dollars each, 150 to get both! This is completely separate from Patreon, though, but keep it in mind as it is still canon and the best way to get one of these is by pledging and catching an opportunity in the Vore House chat. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow much work we can get done and put into The Vore House of Klyneth is directly related to the funds we can procure. At bare minimum of $200/month, we can put out three pages of the main comic, without much room for side content or supplementary additions. But with more we can enrich the world of The Vore House with more pages per month, short stories, novellas, one-off illustrations, and complementary comic pages. The more support we get, the more we can do with this and the more we can involve you, our supporters, in the world of The Vore House of Klyneth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you pledge or not, we want you to know that your support means the world to us, and that without you The Vore House of Klyneth would not exist. All posts and submissions will be given to patrons first, 4 weeks in advance of their public release and in higher definition, so there are incentives to pledge. However, both Runa and Foxifly want our work and our passion to be shared with the world, and therefore everything posted to Patreon will be made public, on FA and maybe on an official Vore House website, should that once again become a reality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, we cannot thank all of you enough from the bottom of our many hearts for your support. It\u0027s been a long, strange journey to get here, and with any luck it\u0027s only going to get stranger from here, so buckle in, tuck in your bib, pull up a chair, and join us at The Vore House of Klyneth! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBon apetit!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
