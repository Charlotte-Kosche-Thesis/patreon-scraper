Also help emerging artists show their work. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been known to bust a move or break out into song at the drop of a hat. I believe that life should be like a musical; the music starts and everyone falls into step.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy story, the short version...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a self-taught painter. A late bloomer - started painting at age 29. Always thought I wasn\u0027t creative... turns out I was wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sold my first painting probably 8 or 9 years after I started painting. Then in 2009 I quit my full time job to follow my dream of making a living as an artist. It has not been an easy road, but I\u0027ve been doing ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy story, the long version...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born in NYC. My mom was an activist (hated being called a hippie), and my father was a jazz musician. My parents split when I was very young, and my mom moved us out to Colorado with her new husband. \u003cbr\u003eGrowing up I was interested in dance and singing and acting. I always wanted to draw, too, but believed I had no talent. And as much as I longed to perform on the stage, self doubt got the best of me, I lost my nerve and abandoned those dreams early on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter high school I worked for my mom at her retail business. My late teens and 20s were filled with work. During those years would say \"I don\u0027t have a creative bone in my body\". \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen when I was 29, my little sister Melissa - the light of my life, and my only sibling - was killed in a car crash. She was just 19. My heart was broken into eight million little pieces. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMelissa had recently taken up painting. I loved to watch her work, and was moved by her paintings. The paint seemed to flow without her stopping to think about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy best friend was a painter, too, and when my sister died, I became more interested in her work. It intrigued me... color, line, abstract form. It seemed to be her subconscious brought to the outer world through paint. \u003cbr\u003eOne day we were painting a wall in my store and instead of using a paint roller, we started blending colors with our hands. I was hooked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few months later I went to commemorate my sister\u0027s birthday at my step-father\u0027s house. I told him about my recent interest in art, and he gave me her art supplies.\u003cbr\u003eI was blown away. There was a full set of acrylics, oils, turpentine, brushes, and even an easel. My best friend hooked me up with a canvas, and I was off. \u003cbr\u003eI started with acrylics, but they didn\u0027t really do much for me - they dried too quickly. So I moved on to oils and... it was like coming home. It felt familiar - like I had been doing it my whole life. I\u0027ve been painting ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid my sister\u0027s spirit have something to do with it? Impossible to say, but I can say that she is all over those first paintings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sold my first painting probably 8 or 9 years after I started painting.\n In 2009 I quit my full time job to follow my dream of making a living \nas an artist. It has not been an easy road, but it has been a gratifying one.\u003cbr\u003e",
