And so, by moving to Patreon, we no longer need to waste valuable time fighting with people who have bad intentions. Instead, with their noise and nonsense out of the way, I can get stories and reports directly to you, while being more available to connect one on one with other smart, respectful fans, answering your questions and highlighting our most insightful community members in my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, in time - and with your support - I want to build this Patreon service to be more than just my work. I want to see us create a stable, successful home for other talented and dedicated writers, hosts and former scouts, who can get paid to provide you with even more exclusive, everyday comprehensive, top-of-the-line basketball coverage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease help me reach these goals, while building for you a place with strong opinions, strategic insight, news, rumors and a respectful community for Knicks fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U\u0026amp;video_id=oP60Ct14FN8\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003ePlease help me reach these goals and let\u0027s enjoy the ride together.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSincerely,\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTommy Dee\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e"
