    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eOur Mission:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn a world filled with violence and uncertainty, many find themselves in need of a spiritual respite. A place where they can be filled and explore their spirituality in a safe and loving environment. The Wandering Preacher seeks to create a community of open-minded individuals seeking wholeness in a fragmented world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an Ordained Minister in the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and many times people ask me what that is. One of the challenges of being a Disciple is trying to define precisely what we are, it\u2019s trying to claim that identity. The following is an overview of what that is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Statement of Identify is as follows- We are Disciples of Christ, a movement for wholeness in a fragmented world. As part of the one body of Christ, we welcome all to the Lord\u2019s Table as God has welcomed us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis may seem like a simple statement, but it is very complex and has a lot of aspects to it.\u003cbr\u003eThe Communion Table is one of the most important elements to being a Disciple, for Jesus taught us that whenever we are to meet together we are to eat together and remember him. At this table we practice unity and inclusion. We welcome all to the Table, as it is an action of mission and a symbol of Gods family which is all the world. It should then be no surprise that our symbol is the Chalice with the Saint Andrews Cross (a nod to our Presbyterian and Scottish background).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelievers Baptism is also central to our faith and practice, it is important to us that a person be able to make the decision to follow Jesus as a full member of the church rather than that decision being made for them. Baptism means that you are a full member of the church and a part of the priesthood of all believers. It should be noted however that we as Disciples recognize all Baptisms as valid and don\u2019t see a need to re-baptize.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a movement for Christian Unity. Beginning in our founding statements found in the Will and Testament of the Springfield Presbytery (Springfield Kentucky), we began as and remain a movement to become one with all Christians. This is seen today in our involvement with the World Council of Churches, and our cooperative work with the United Church of Christ in Global Ministries. We also strive towards unity by making room at the table for all people with varying perspectives staying true to the idea of \u201cUnity, not uniformity.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a people of the book, studying the scriptures for ourselves rather than allowing creedal statements and tests of faith govern our lives we know that there is strength in reading the scripture and working things out for ourselves. In the paraphrased words of Alexander Campbell, the educated mind is fertile ground for the Gospel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe answer Gods call for Justice, we particularly focus on God\u2019s call to be good stewards of the earth by taking care of the earth that he is given us and working for that in a variety of ways, we also answer the challenges that women and children are facing, and seek to care for those who are in poverty, those who hunger, and those who face immigration crisis recognizing that even Christ was a refuge when he fled to Egypt from Herod. We seek to do all of these things in cooperation with other people of faith.\u003cbr\u003e"
