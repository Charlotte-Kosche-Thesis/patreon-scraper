    "summary": "Hey! My name is Nick, but most know me by either Tak or Tikky.  I work full-time as an artist from home in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  I mainly work digitally, but I also tend to do stuff with traditional media.  I draw furries! Cute stuff! That isn\u2019t to say that a lot of adult-rated artwork gets posted here, though!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am 28 and I\u0027ve been drawing since around the fourth grade.  My art teacher from 4th-8th grade really helped to push and mentor me with my art.  She saw potential where I didn\u0027t and helped flesh me into the artist I am today.  After 8th grade, she continued to mentor me through High School, but I was also self-taught quite a bit, which I am still constantly doing.  I have attended Savannah College of Art \u0026amp; Design, but I have not graduated yet.  Still deciding if I want to continue, to be honest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI, like many during these tough times, have a small amount of debt bearing down on me.  We have mortgage, bills, and of course need to provide food for our small, and hopefully to grow, family.  Besides the two of us, we have a 3 year old rambunctious siamese cat named Koopa Troopa.  Art is my passion and my career.  With Patreon, I hope to increase that income so that we may live more easily and I can enjoy doing what I do best.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the pledges going towards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy pledging, you are helping me make a more easier living off my art.  Whatever money I get will go towards helping with the mortgage on the house, bills, food, Koopa, helping me out of my debt, and any future projects I do through Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we, the Patrons, get in return?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNot only do you get the satisfaction and pride over helping an artist you like (I hope you like my stuff! OxO), but you\u0027ll get some pretty cool stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eDepending on which pledge tier you go for, you could get some of these rewards:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSee all my work a week before the general public!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSketches, WIPs, hi-res access, PSD files to see the inner workings, and sneak peeks into future projects.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrivate, Patreon ONLY stream sessions, there will be chances of getting art if you attend the stream!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFree art opportunities!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFirst dibs on MiniScenes (which usually sell out fast!), Group Illustrations, and YCH Commissions!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eExclusive Telegram Group Chat for $5+ Patrons\u003c/em\u003e! --- In this group chat I am constantly posting WIPs, discuss how I work, talk about and vote on ideas. Everything I post there does make its way onto the Patreon feed; not to worry if you don\u0027t have Telegram!. It\u0027s a super easy and convenient way to get in touch with me if you want an immediate response than waiting through the Patreon message system.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhatever else I decide to come up with! :D I plan to keep things fresh from time to time!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWill any of the content be Patreon only?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile the sketches, WIPs, hi-res, and PSD files will be Patreon only, all finished content will eventually be posted to Twitter, InkBunny, FurryNetwork or elsewhere.  I\u0027d rather not leave anyone out, but I do appreciate your support through here! By supporting you will not only see the finished works everyone else will see (usually posted a week or so AFTER Patreon), but you\u0027ll also have access to all the bonus material leading up to said finished piece.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHowever, some Patreon Goals I have set out WILL have Patreon only content, such as the coloring pages. Each new coloring page added to here will NOT be made available to everyone, as I plan to publish an actual coloring book once I have a nice pile of pages.  There will also be Patreon ONLY stream sessions, all the content made through them will be made public, though!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will updates be handled?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI try to upload several times a week, as well as when I\u0027m working. I\u0027ll post progress shots of work that day. So...you may even get art posts daily. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere else can we find your art?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you don\u0027t want to, or simply can\u0027t support my Patreon, you can find my art on any of these sites:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFurAffinity -\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/takottah\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTakottah\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/tikky\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTikky\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwitter -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/TikkyTaksArt\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTikkyTaksArt\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome of the reward tiers will have adult-rated art updates.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eBy pledging on one of these you agree that you are 18 years of age or older.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
