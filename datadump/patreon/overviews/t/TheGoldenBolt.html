TIME!\u003c/h4\u003e\n Simply put, making these videos takes \n\u003cem\u003etime \u003c/em\u003e- lots of it! \u00a0An average review can take me anywhere from 5 to 15 hours of work from the start of scripting to the end of editing, and that\u0027s not even counting the time it takes to play the game! \u00a0Like all of you, I have to work to supplement my hobbies, such as this channel. \u00a0By supporting me here on Patreon, you grant me the ability to set aside more time away from my current job and work more on the reviews, streams, and other videos that you enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e2. BETTER QUALITY!\u003c/h4\u003e\nCome on, have you \n\u003cem\u003eseen\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0my first review? \u00a0Blegh! \u00a0To achieve and maintain a high quality of production costs a lot of money - microphones, cameras, lighting, capture and editing software, assets, and when it comes to streams, bandwidth and much more - it all adds up! \u00a0Your donation directly helps improve the quality of The Golden Bolt as a channel, as I can afford to combine that with my current income to produce better, more professional content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e3. MORE GAMES!\u003c/h4\u003e\nGames are expensive! \u00a0I review on average one video every other week. That\u0027s 26 games a year, sometimes more! \u00a0Add that to the subscriptions to PlayStation Plus and other services for PLUSone videos and there\u0027s a lot of game. \u00a0There have been times where I\u0027ve had to make a decision between purchasing one expensive game to review or a few smaller ones. \u00a0With\n\u003cstrong\u003e your\u003c/strong\u003e support, I can branch out to newer or rarer games that you\u0027d like me to cover, without having to turn away games that may be too expensive for me to obtain.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e4. A BETTER BOLT!\u003c/h4\u003e\nYou\u0027ve seen it before - a Creator that sells him or herself to brand deals and sponsorships in order to survive. \u00a0I don\u0027t want to be beholden to \n\u003cstrong\u003eanybody \u003c/strong\u003eexcept you, the viewer. \u00a0With your donation, I can make sure to continue providing better and better content, more and more frequently, without having to bombard you with ads. \u00a0That\u0027s why when you donate, I ask you to \u003cstrong\u003eturn adblock on \u003c/strong\u003eif you\u0027d like! \u00a0Together, we can continue to improve The Golden Bolt and cultivate a wonderful community of gamers, hopefully without any sort of plugging getting in the way!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Better internet!  New Equipment!  Much streams!  Woo!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBroadband where I live is solid enough, but boy can it be expensive.  Right now we currently are in the ballpark of 50mbps down, 10mbps up.  However, with up to four people in the house using the internet all at once, I can\u0027t ever guarantee solid quality if I try to stream.  When we hit $50, I can throw that money right back into our monthly bill and upgrade our speeds.  If I can do that, that means more streams and such all around!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven better, I can start putting more money into improving the equipment I use to create my videos.  That means better lighting, a higher quality camera, better visual assets, and so on!  We can really start taking this small channel and making it look \u003cem\u003emuch\u003c/em\u003e more professional!",
