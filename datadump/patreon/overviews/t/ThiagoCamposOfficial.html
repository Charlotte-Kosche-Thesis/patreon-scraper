It started out as a way for me and my friends to break the physical barriers between us and cover the music we love together. Turns out we were pioneers of what would soon become a trend. \"Split-Screen\" Music Videos were a new thing, and our little project quickly attracted much attention and escalated into a multinational collaboration camp.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward 6 years and we now have released many Split-Screen Covers, mostly from Dream Theater\u0027s music (the \"meat and potatoes\" of our catalog), which have become classics among fans, with contributing musicians from Brazil, Italy, USA, Canada, Sweden, Venezuela, South Korea, Portugal, Germany, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r28LLqyXBKs\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cpre\u003eDream Theater - Metropolis Part 1, by VRA Split-Screen Covers, Oct 2 2009.\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why is your support so important?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"VRA! / Split-Screen Covers\" has been a labor of love since it began. My passion for the music we cover, for the art of recording, mixing and producing, along with my friend\u0027s and guest\u0027s, and the AMAZING feedback we get from fans have been what kept this project going for so long.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past few years, unfortunately, I haven\u0027t been able to commit myself to it as much as it deserves. As grown-up life dictates, I\u0027ve been busy with many bands, projects and paying gigs and FREE time is becoming a luxurious, almost extinct, asset. The interval in-between videos, which previously was of weeks/months has now become years, and to my dismay I\u0027ve had to turn down countless volunteering musicians because of it, and consequently read emails, comments and msgs from frustrated fans who miss and request new releases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo put things in perspective, a single \u0027Split-Screen Cover\u0027 Video takes about 1-3 weeks of hard work to get done.\u00a0That includes learning and practicing the music (which ironically, is the \"easy\" part), organizing the lineup and communicating with everyone so everything goes smoothly, recording, editing the audio, mixing and mastering, shooting the videos, video editing and correction, rendering, upload and promoting/sharing. With the exception of video editing on our latest 2 releases (which was done by my brother and bassist Felipe, to share some of the load) everything else is done by yours truly. I wouldn\u0027t have it any other way, as I am a bit of a control freak, and enjoy every step of this whole process (especially the mixing part).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you see, as much as we love this project, I cannot justify refusing paying gigs to free up 1-3 weeks to work on a new release. If however the \u0027VRA! Split-Screen Covers\u0027 were to become a financially compensating project, not only would I have the perfect excuse to turn down other gigs in its favor, and thus be able to put out new releases much faster, but we\u0027d be inclined to make it an even more awesome experience for everyone, offering extras (backing tracks and whatnot), and reinvesting in better audio and video apparatus to make the quality of our Split-Screen Covers even better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you paying for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEssentially you are paying for the production aspects of the project, which enables the releases to happen more frequently. With just $1 per video you can make a difference, and you\u0027ll get to download the high quality mp3 file to listen to on your car or iPod. Other cool extras are offered to those who can and wish to support with bigger amounts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a per video thing. If there aren\u0027t any new videos, you don\u0027t get charged.\u003cbr\u003eAlso, the only videos that apply for this support are the \"Split-Screen Covers\". Other videos on my channel will continue to be uploaded as usual.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the support and demand for new and better videos are big enough, I will consider hiring people to help me out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur plans: Cover 1 song from EVERY Dream Theater Album + more\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i941.photobucket.com/albums/ad256/Enc3f4L0/DT-AllAlbums-600px_zpsbd406fvg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have plans to cover many new bands, as well as finish what we\u0027ve started, completing our goal of covering 1 song from each of Dream Theater\u0027s studio albums. We are 5 albums away from this goal: Falling Into Infinity, When Dream and Day Unite, Black Clouds and Silver Linings, 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence, and Octavarium.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you love our covers and want to see the project grow with new releases more often, please consider supporting us and spreading the word!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusically,\u003cbr\u003eThiago\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

What better song to do it on than \"A Change of Seasons\"!? It is an EPIC Dream Theater track, but included on an EP, so technically out of VRA!\u0027s goal of covering 1 song per studio LP. This will be the MEGAZORD of VRA Split-Screen Covers! ;)",
