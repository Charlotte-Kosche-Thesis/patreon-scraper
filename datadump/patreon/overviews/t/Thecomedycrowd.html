There isn\u0027t an obvious path to follow.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing creative should be about trying things out, experimenting, iterating and improving, until you can express your ideas in a way that resonates with your audience. It should also be about having fun. As creators we all know there\u2019s nothing more exciting than when you can see your ideas brought to life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Comedy Crowd is here to give you the tools to be creators.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe do this by giving comedy writers and performers:\n\n\u003cbr\u003e1. Access to a community of like-minded creators with different skill sets to collaborate, share ideas, get feedback, and support one another\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Up to date information on the latest opportunities that are right for you, with tips and advice from people in the industry\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. And when you need it most, the inspiration to keep your creative spark alive.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Comedy Crowd was started by Jonathan Jayson and Peter Wright because as aspiring comedy writers ourselves, we know first hand the challenges people face taking an idea and turning it into something that can be enjoyed by others.\n\nWe are also big fans of really good comedy, so it\u0027s frustrating to us when so many great ideas from talented creators are wasted. It\u0027s not like there\u0027s an abundance of great new comedy in mainstream media channels anyway! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to see what you have to offer. If you want to get involved in comedy, the Comedy Crowd is the right place for you",
