    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the Tarot Tree House! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe Tarot Tree House is a community for playfully engaging tarot learning and spiritual growth. Through weekly articles, tarot spreads, meditations, and online webinars, you can gain knowledge of the spiritual underpinnings of the modern tarot and learn to apply this information both practically for reading the cards more clearly and spiritually for expressing your higher self. Best of all, you have the freedom to choose your level of engagement and commitment. The focus is on understanding the tarot from the perspective of the Tree of Life, a mystical symbol that provides a path to connect with our higher self and ultimately to reach toward and receive the influx of the Divine. Tarot Tree House is a tarot approach to climbing the Tree of Life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://joyvernon.com/images/Tarot%20Tree%20House%20flyer.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://joyvernon.com/images/Tarot%20Tree%20House%20flyer.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReady to join the Tarot Tree House?\u00a0Click the red \u201cBecome a patron\u201d button in the upper right corner!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is modeled after the medieval system of arts patronage, in which royalty would sponsor artists, philosophers, and scholars. But this contemporary interpretation provides an opportunity for anyone to support any kind of content they love on a monthly basis. Unlike Kickstarter, where you make a one-time donation, Patreon is designed so fans can promise recurring monthly pledges at smaller amounts each time a piece of content\u2014in my case a blog article\u2014is released.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Use Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike many writers and teachers, I always feel the pull between the urge to share my knowledge and experience openly with everyone\u2014which I do a lot through my blog and free stuff on my website\u2014but also the need to earn a living. So I bear the obligation of restricting what I share to those who take classes or do one-on-one mentoring with me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon lets me finally do both! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy setting up pledge levels, I can give you the ability to support me at the level that is right for you! If you just want to read the blog posts, take no action\u2014they will still be there. But if you\u2019d like to have early access to the information, to be part of a community you can share with and learn from, to engage more with me, and to deepen your learning with additional study materials and classes, sign up at the perfect reward level to watch your knowledge and understanding grow!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do I Get for My Support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve designed a one-year program that teaches qabalah and tarot. We\u2019ll learn qabalistic numerology, discover how the elements, astrology, and qabalah open up the court cards, and use the Major Arcana to climb the Tree of Life. You\u2019ll receive, based on your level of interest and commitment, detailed weekly articles, monthly in-depth learning tarot spreads (no one creates the kind of complex and revealing tarot spreads I do!), rituals, meditations, and monthly live, interactive, online webinars. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistorically, qabalah first became associated with the tarot through 18th and 19th century French esotericists, and eventually the pairing of these two philosophies arrived in England where the Golden Dawn, a mystery school tradition, created a coherent system that layered them together. Then, based on traditional, centuries-old correspondences, they infused astrology into the mix to create a syncretic whole. More than just a series of trumps, the Major Arcana of the esoteric tarot became an initiatic process for climbing the Tree of Life towards ever more divine and ethereal planes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReady to get started?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, I\u2019ll take you on the grand tour of qabalistic numerology, discovering the meaning behind the numbers 1 through 10 (yes, this is different from other forms of numerology!) and applying those numbers to the Minor Arcana numbered pip cards. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ll explore the tarot court cards from the perspective of elemental, astrological, and qabalistic correspondences for an unprecedented academic understanding. Then watch them come to life and converse through meditations and tarot spreads. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, we\u2019ll take the Major Arcana archetypes one by one, week by week, and placing them on the Tree of Life, we\u2019ll map our path to the highest expression of the Divine. Qabalistic pathworking is much more than learning correspondences and memorizing symbols\u2014although this is the foundation of the practice, it expands exponentially when you step off the terra firma of fact and knowledge onto the astral plane of imagination, meditation, and energetic self-initiation. You will find yourself slowly growing into who you are meant to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u2019re ready to learn a mystical approach to tarot, gain the understanding to deepen the details of your tarot readings, reveal the wisdom of your true self, and be part of a community of spiritual learners who share your values and goals, then please become my Patron today!

My teacher taught me tarot, energy work, the practice and development of rituals, and the basics of qabalah. I began reading for clients soon after learning to read the cards. In 1994, my teacher guided me in preparing and teaching my first tarot class. I went on to teach regularly, read for occasional clients and participate in fairs and events. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2006, I joined the Denver Tarot Meetup. Meanwhile, through my own curiosity and search for answers, I discovered the relationship of the tarot to qabalah. In 2007 I started the Denver Tarot Geeks so that I could pursue this study with a group of dedicated learners and practitioners like myself. We went through a two and a half year cycle studying the qabalistic correspondences of the Major Arcana card by card and then in groupings based on the Tree of Life. After this, I led the Tarot Geeks in an exploration of the cards as they related to the elements and then astrology. Much of what I teach is based on my study and personal meditations on the cards during this time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2010 I was fired from my full time job and after an unsuccessful job search I did the only thing I could do: became a full time tarot reader and teacher. Eventually I added qabalah and then astrology classes to my teaching repertoire, finally arriving at my specialty as a teacher of the esoteric tarot. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I work as a tarot reader, astrologer, and teacher at Goddess Isis Books in Denver, Colorado. I work with clients and students daily to provide answers, guidance, insight, and inspiration. I\u2019m thrilled to be able to share my expertise with a wider audience through Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
