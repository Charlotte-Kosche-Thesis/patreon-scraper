    "summary": "Back in 2015 Alex and Jeffrey started having long conversations about video game history as Alex began a new draft of the first book in a forthcoming multi-volume study of the industry.  Realizing that others might find these discussions interesting, we decided to start recording them, and They Create Worlds was born!  Unlike other podcasts devoted to video game history that tend to focus on the creative side, we really want to emphasize how the industry as a whole has evolved and matured, and particularly how the partnership between creative and business talent is integral to the success of any company.  Alex has exclusively interviewed many high-level executives at companies like Atari, EA, and Activision, who have provided countless unique insights into various aspects of video game history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love the worlds created by the designers, personalities, and companies that have defined the video game industry.  We also love sharing our passion with you through the audio medium.  However, as in any venture there are costs. These include hosting fees, equipment (microphones, mixers, soundproofing etc), and editing software.  The quality of the podcast has advanced significantly since the first episode that aired in September 2015, and we are confident it can continue to evolve with your support!  With your help we can continue to enhance not only the audio quality, but also the content that we deliver.  Previously Alex has traveled to the Strong Museum in Rochester New York, and the Library of Congress to conduct research, but there are many other archival collections in California, Texas, and elsewhere that we have yet to tap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are confident that with your patronage, we can continue to provide the high-quality insights and perspectives on video game history that you have come to expect from They Create Worlds!  Therefore if you have enjoyed our content thus far, please consider making a per-episode donation."
