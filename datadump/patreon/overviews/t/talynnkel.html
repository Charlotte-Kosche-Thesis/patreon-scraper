That said, I\u0027m working on increasing the content I create and hopefully take you along for the ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve reached the point where my expenses are rising and my free-time is disappearing as I work on creating additional content. One day I hope to transition out of full-time employment and focus more on writing, costume creation, and creating video content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVideos are my newest thing. I\u0027ve found a budding producer who is willing to work with me to build both our brands. Right now that means zero pay, but we\u0027re hoping to shift that into something feasible and sustainable. That\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to do more work and create more quality content, I need to know my basic needs are met. I don\u0027t have a trust fund or investor that is willing to take a chance on me. What I do have is you, my audience, who is interested in seeing what kind I can do. I\u0027m not sure what that is yet, but I\u0027m willing to find out. What I can say is that it\u0027s going to be honest and real content, as I don\u0027t know how to be anything but that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this is the way that you can tell me that you want my content...mainly so that I can stop creating it for free.\u00a0All funds will go to paying my expenses while working on my projects. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll ever reach the goal of doing this full-time, but this will help me figure that out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your interest and your patronage."
