    "summary": "It\u0027s a fantasy to live a life of travel, taking photos and writing about the amazing places the world has to offer. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr is it? \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI travel full time. I\u00a0run a travel blog and offer my photographs through a photography website. And, I\u0027m also a fiction writer. \u00a0Somehow I balance all of this. (Well, most days anyway.) \u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI\u2019d love to have you with me on my journey because I have so much to share with you! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI have poured my heart and soul into bringing my readers inspiration each week. It takes a lot of time and resources to keep this community going. \u00a0Unfortunately, there is no \u00274-Hour Workweek\u0027 in the real world of blogger. \u00a0Seriously, there\u0027s not - \u00a0Not unless you became a blogger back in the early 90s and hit the sweet spot when you gained a massive amount of readers early on. \u00a0For the rest of us, the 99% of us, we work hard to bring you good writing, amazing photographs and unique stories, in the hopes for a sustainable income to continue doing just that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf you find value in what I do, please consider joining my exclusive Travel Far Enough community as a contributing patron.\u00a0A recurring donation, for as little as a cup of coffee per month or a nice pub lunch, would allow me to continue sharing this content with you. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are already a contributing member of the community: THANK YOU! You are definitely helping to make this possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my patron, there are some special perks:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\t- A monthly 5-minute video, in which I\u0027ll answer all my patrons\u0027 questions. It can be about anything you want to know about what I do and how I do it. \u00a0I\u0027ll put a call out for questions a few days before the video is released. I might type up responses instead of doing a video, too depending on my travelling schedule and access to a good internet connection. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cbr\u003e\t- Access to my private Travel Far Enough Community where you will receive a newsletter every week letting you know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes, what\u2019s brewing and what content has been on the travel website and/or on the photography website. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\t \u003cbr\u003e\t- Access to a 15% discount on eBooks and Courses that I sell through my website, with a Patreon ONLY code.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Access to Patreon-only posts that give you the good, the bad and the ugly of what it\u0027s like to live this kind of life. \u00a0And believe me, I don\u0027t hold anything back on these posts.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, welcome to the crazy world I live in. \u00a0I hope to encourage you to live your dream life because, you know, it\u0027s a pretty fantastic way to live.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, click on the video below to learn more about why I decided to go with Patreon - \u00a0T\u003cstrong\u003ehe video password is Patreon \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(case sensitive).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eNon- Financial Forms of Support:\u003c/span\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find Travel Far Enough on the web, Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram. \u00a0These are all open to all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\tWebsite: \u003ca href=\"http://www.travelfarenough.com\"\u003ewww.travelfarenough.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotography website: \t\u003ca href=\"http://www.travelfarenough.smugmug.com\"\u003ewww.travelfarenough.smugmug.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\tFacebook: \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/travelfarenough\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/travelfarenough\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePinterest: \t\u003ca href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/travelfarenough/\"\u003ehttps://www.pinterest.com/travelfarenough/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram: \t\u003ca href=\"https://instagram.com/travelfarenough/\"\u003ehttps://instagram.com/travelfarenough/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
