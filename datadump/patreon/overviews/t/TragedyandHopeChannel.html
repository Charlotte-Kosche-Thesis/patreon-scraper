I started this channel back in 2011\nwith no intention of it ever growing as much as it has.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started out as a simple hobby and as someone who had no experience in video editing has grown far beyond anything I could have ever anticiapted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could have\u00a0never imagined when I started this channel that it would lead me to having over 100,000 subscribers, \u00a0over 20 million total views, \u00a0a Facebook page with almost 50,000 followers, one of my videos being\u00a0recognized and shared by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/short-film-showcase/what-would-you-do-if-money-didnt-matter\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNational Geographic\u003c/a\u003e and now recently a blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I have ever wanted to do is share inspiring messages with the world, and I am truly humbled by the way it has grown.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs some of my subscribers have probably noticed I\nhave not been able to release videos anywhere near the rate I once did. I am\nsure that many probably  thought that I had ran out of material or ideas\nto share, however, this is not the case. The truth is, that I simply haven\u0027t had\nthe financial capability to keep releasing videos. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou see my channel started out with simple\nediting and mashing together of various pieces of audio, footage and music but\nthis ended up running me into a lot of trouble with copyright.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo as my channel began to grow and my editing\nskills developed, I eventually and naturally had to progress away from this\nbasic form of editing and onto a more professional form of editing through the\nuse of purchased footage and music.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDoing so gave me access to a whole range of high\nquality footage and music, that was able to vastly increase the quality and\nstrength of my videos. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever this footage does not come cheaply with\nmost videos costing anywhere between $500 to $1000 each to produce. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis amount is far above what I currently make a\nmonth on google adsense, so it has really put a halt on my ability to create\nnew videos. I truly love making these videos and would love to be able to make\nthem on a more regular basis but this requires money.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the 4 years that I have run this channel I\nhave taken very little of the profits for myself either from YouTube  or\nfrom the kickstarter campaign back in 2013 almost all revenue has gone into\ncreating more videos. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI never began this channel or have created these\nvideos with the intention to make money, I do it because it because I love\nmaking videos and because I believe the world needs more of these types of\nmessages. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI do however believe that money when used\nproperly can be a powerful tool for good and for change. And that is what I am\nlooking to achieve by starting this Patreon campaign.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is\nPatreon? \u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is a bit like kickstarter\nbut instead of just raising a one off sum of money to fund a single large\nproject. Patreon allows for consecutive smaller amounts to be raised by giving fans the ability pledge their support on a monthly\nbasis. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get in return?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAside from the fact that you will know that you\nare helping to have these messages shared with the world and that without you\nthese videos would not have been possible.  You will also get access to a\nrange of different rewards depending on how much you choose to pledge.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nTo Conclude:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will be truly grateful for any and all pledges\nto support this channel, $1 a month might not sound like a lot but a little can\ngo a a very long way. So please if you do choose to support this channel do not\npledge anything that is beyond your means just pledge whatever amount you feel like you can. And know that I will be so grateful for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe amount listed to reach in the goal section\nis the amount I will need to have freedom to be able create videos with ease. I\nam not looking to earn anything above the amount shown in goal. If by chance I\ndo end up earning above the amounts listed, then I will extremely humbled and\ngrateful for people\u2019s generosity and will use the excess to the best of my\nability. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for the interest in my Patreon\ncampaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
