At the time, with a few exceptions, there seemed a decided lack of \"interesting fact\" style websites out there where the facts presented were well researched and provided all the interesting little details on a given topic. As such, TodayIFoundOut was launched on 1/1/2010 and has since grown dramatically, now viewed by approximately 3 million people every month, featuring near daily (except for weekends) extremely well researched \"interesting fact\" articles \u003ca href=\"http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/authors/\"\u003efrom various well credentialed authors.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck us out and our popular Daily Knowledge Newsletter and Daily Knowledge Podcast on \u003ca href=\"http://www.todayifoundout.com/\"\u003eTodayIFoundOut.com\u003c/a\u003e",
