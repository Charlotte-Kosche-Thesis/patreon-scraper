    "summary": "Hello Cocktail Fans! Firstly; Thank you for showing interest in our page and considering becoming an Official Supporter of The Educated Barfly!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO WE ARE:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe love cocktails. We love to make them. We love to drink them. \u003cbr\u003eAnd we love to share all the fun and innovative things we are doing with them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe produce High quality tutorials and bartender spotlights for our YouTube Channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can check our channel out here:\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/drinktheseries\"\u003e https://www.youtube.com/drinktheseries\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003ePlease hit subscribe while you\u0027re there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Leandro DiMonriva and I\u0027m the host of the Educated Barfly. I am also a longtime Los Angeles bartender and I have dedicated the last seven years of my life to perfecting the art of cocktail making. I started The Educated Barfly with two friends of mine to share everything I have learned with you! We are creating a library of Classic, Modern Classic, Craft Cocktails and Original Cocktails from some of the most innovative and exciting bartenders in the country.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe focus on true craft; From sourcing the best and freshest available ingredients, house making syrups, cordials and liqueurs, proper ice cutting techniques\u00a0to curating home bars, so no matter where you\u0027re at in the world, you\u0027ll be able to craft amazing cocktails.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur videos are designed to be easy to follow and are for everyone from the beginning home bartender to the seasoned professional looking to expand on their knowledge and technique. It is our hope that people will use our channel the same way they use a cocktail recipe book, but the best thing about ours is that it evolves over time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY WE NEED PATRONS:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking Videos is both expensive and takes a lot man hours. To be able to bring you the best quality videos, we do as much as we can in house but from time to time we need to rent equipment on the filmmaking side and we must keep a regularly stocked inventory of ingredients, equipment and BOOZE on the drink\u00a0making side. We also at times need to hire colorists and editors.\u00a0As of now we are going solely out of pocket for all of these expenses. That\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also have an ambitious schedule of programming we intend to build over the next year and we hope to afford more time to put into this. Each video takes about 25 hours to produce from start to finish. Each of us also work full time jobs so we\u0027re doing the videos in our spare time. It is our goal \u00a0to be able to put more time into our videos so we can consistently bring you better and better content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY ARE TUTORIALS EXPENSIVE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Firstly we only make videos with products we stand behind. We are committed to using products that we believe in so you can rest assured that each brand we use for our videos, we are behind 100%. This means that for every video, we must purchase each bottle, which can get costly very quickly.\u003cbr\u003e2.We buy all local (when we can) and all organic for mixes and modifiers, this as you well know is time consuming to source and pretty pricey.\u003cbr\u003e3. We experiment a lot. Although our host, Leandro, has ten years behind the bar, we are committed to experiment with some of the latest gadgets such as smoking guns and centrifuges. We also have to purchase glassware and high quality ice on a regular basis. Yes you heard that right, proper Ice for cocktail making is not inexpensive.\u003cbr\u003e4. Ad revenue from YouTube is not currently available to us, so we don\u2019t have that avenue as an option for, the time being.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e5. Cameras, lights, editing and audio equipment are both expensive and a must in order to bring you high quality tutorials and videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY ARE THEY TIME CONSUMING?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e1. We focus a lot of our effort on creating good looking, cinematic videos. This takes a lot of planning and each video has to be meticulously lit. It also requires quality and sometimes specialized equipment to be done right.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e2. The post production end of the videos is another place we spend a lot of time, editing, coloring, and adding music and themes. On occasion we have to hire extra hands to help us out.\u003cbr\u003e3.\u00a0We spend a lot of time creating related content for our various social media outlets so on top of the videos we are conducting photoshoots with the cocktails we make and the bartenders we interview. This includes detailed blog posts about each cocktail we feature, historical information and how to procure equipment needed to make each drink.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SUPPORT US? WHAT\u0027S IN IT FOR ME?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOur host has over ten years experience behind the bar and is one of the most recognizable people in the LA Cocktail Community. He is also one of only a \u00a0few bartenders expertly creating cocktails today. He is offering everything he\u0027s learned over those years absolutely free of charge via YouTube. There are hundreds of \"Bartending Schools\" out there charging thousands of dollars for irrelevant and out dated information on cocktails. What we offer via our tutorials is more relevant information and it is offered at no cost. The goal here is to tap into our fan base, and find some funding to be able to spend more time making videos, make better content and make the content most relevant to what guys really want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eif you want to keep updated on what we do please visit our website here:\u003ca href=\"https://www.theeducatedbarfly.com\"\u003e The Educated Barfly\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
