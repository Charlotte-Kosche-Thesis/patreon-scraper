    "summary": "I\u0027m very fortunate to be able to create a brand new song each and every week that people actually listen to, but I\u0027m never satisfied to settle where I\u0027m at.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always want to continue to grow and expand as a songwriter, producer and everything in between and that\u0027s exactly what you\u0027re helping with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect or assume anyone will contribute any more to my project than simply listening to my songs, or reading each weeks accompanying\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tombcooper.com/category/blog/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBLOG\u003c/a\u003e or subscribing and listening to the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tombcooper.com/category/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePODCAST\u003c/a\u003e. I appreciate that HUGELY by itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you do feel like contributing, it\u0027ll all go back into creating EVEN MORE for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve purposefully created just one supporting tier and that\u0027s for just $1. Why? Because I\u0027m going to keep doing what I do, regardless. When you invest your $1 you\u0027re investing directly in me. Spotify or iTunes or whoever don\u0027t take their big old greedy cut, it\u0027s going directly to me to make more music and more stuff for YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re of course welcome to pledge more, likewise you\u0027re welcome to limit the amount you pledge. I\u0027m never going to do more than 1 song per week, but just for peace of mind, you can limit it :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sky\u0027s the limit with A Song A Week and my vision is to have an accompanying music video made by professionals every week, go on tour, challenge the very broken music industry of 2017 etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo no matter why you\u0027ve found your way to my patreon page, I believe you\u0027re interested enough to support me and that makes you an awesome human being, so please don\u0027t hesitate to go the next step and make yourself even more awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace and happy music making x\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Cooper - musician, producer and songwriter and now proud patron member to help grow my podcast, blog and most importantly the songs themselves from A Song A Week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve dedicated my life to music and I\u0027m fortunate enough to continue to work with some truly exceptional talents around the world as well as my own projects.\u003cbr\u003eMy songs, compositions and productions have seen success on commercial radio (BBC Radio 6 Music, BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, Kerrang! etc.) and film and TV (Film 4, Channel 4, BBC, United Artists etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up to a musician father and dancer mother, I was surrounded by the widest variety of music, which I embraced from a very early age.\u003cbr\u003eQuickly picking up the cello, guitar, piano, bass and all manner of other instruments, getting on stage to perform and sing came very naturally to me. Soon enough I was playing to packed crowds all over the country and still do with the likes of \u003ca href=\"http://www.luxlisbon.com/\"\u003eLux Lisbon\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://kuqimusic.bandcamp.com/\"\u003eKuqi\u003c/a\u003e and as a solo performer and session musician for countless other artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirstly self-taught, then graduating with a first class BA degree in Songwriting, this is where my passion for composition and production really picked up. A curiosity and eagerness to try new techniques has led to establishing myself as a top producer and songwriter amongst my peers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for stopping by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTom x\u003cbr\u003e",
