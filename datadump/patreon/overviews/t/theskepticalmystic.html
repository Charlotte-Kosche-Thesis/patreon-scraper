Welcome to my\nPatreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Patreon, it\u2019s a site where\npeople like you can support creators that they care about, so they can continue\nto create great content, and you get some perks out of it as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have this set up so that I can continue to improve the\nquality of videos I am creating, and also to increase the frequency of uploads.\nI have a lot of great ideas for new content, videos which I hope will be\nchallenging and encouraging, and support through Patreon will help me get that\ncontent to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo it\u2019s important to say that supporting me on Patreon is\nentirely optional. No one should feel obligated or pressured to do this. The\nvideos I\u2019m making will always remain free. But a project like this is very time\nconsuming and requires more resources than the average person might think. And\nso what Patreon does is allow for those who want to support what I\u2019m doing in a\nway is easy and coordinated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe way it works is that you can pledge a certain dollar\namount per video I create. Each one is designed to give some insight into\neducated, self-reflective, and genuine spirituality.  I am currently uploading at the rate of one\nvideo per week, but I hope to increase that pace as I master the technological\nhurdles slowing me down. But when you sign up you can set a cap on the amount\nyou contribute, so that if I end up being so much more prolific than you\nexpect, it doesn\u2019t drain your finances or your good graces. So you can specify \u201cI\nwant to give this much per video, but no more than this per month.\u201d I like that\nmodel because it means you are only contributing to me when I actually create\nthe videos. And it lets you remain in control of your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a thank you for your ongoing support there are different\nreward levels you can reach, which get you various perks for being a supporter.\nAnd because a supportive community means so much, I want to hear your thoughts,\nif you have ideas about what kind of perks you would like, what would be most\nvaluable to you in return for your generosity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut again, please don\u2019t feel obligated to be a part of this.\nI want you to feel free of any expectations in return for enjoying the videos I\ncreate. The fact that they are meaningful to any of you is humbling; I consider\nit a privilege to be doing this, and so you\u2019re supporting me even by just\nwatching the videos. But for those with the financial resources to do so, this\nis an opportunity to go above and beyond. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI believe in the conversation these videos are trying to\nfoster. And so with any amount of support from any number of you, I feel\nencouraged to keep putting my heart and soul into them, in hopes of making a difference.\n If you have any questions at all, please\nreach out and let me know, otherwise, thanks for watching. I\u2019ll be back with another\nvideo soon.\u003cbr\u003e"
