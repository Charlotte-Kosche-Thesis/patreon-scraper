Each episode takes us from city life to screen life. We discuss the film and television of the 70s that captures something nothing else can about the politics and social issues of the day. We delve into news and film criticism from the time, in field pieces recorded in the places that inspired them. We visit experts, in their homes or invite them into ours, to learn more about everything we find along the way. And we cover a lot of ground: in our debut season, on Times Square in the 70s, we move from \u003cem\u003eKlute\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \"Barney Miller\" to \u003cem\u003eLast Tango in Paris\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and \"The Deuce,\" and from policing and urban development to political debates about violence in the media and the power of social movements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe work full-time in writing (MGG) and filmmaking (Cheyenne). We research, record, and edit each episode in a (modest, yet very capable) home studio in New York City, and we conduct original interviews and record field pieces around the city. Each episode this season takes about twenty hours to produce, in addition to a month of pre-production research ahead of the season.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://terrific.city\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eShare the show\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/terrific-city/id1279945117\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esubscribe\u003c/a\u003e, and become a patron.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout your hosts\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nMelissa Gira Grant\u003c/strong\u003e is a journalist and author, covering sexual politics, criminal justice, and human rights. She is a contributing writer for \u003cem\u003ePacific Standard\u003c/em\u003e and the \u003cem\u003eVillage Voice\u003c/em\u003e. Her feature reporting has been published in the \u003cem\u003eGuardian\u003c/em\u003e, BuzzFeed, VICE, and \u003cem\u003eThe Nation\u003c/em\u003e, and her commentary has appeared in the \u003cem\u003eNew York Times\u003c/em\u003e, the \u003cem\u003eWashington Post\u003c/em\u003e, Slate, and Jezebel, among other publications. Her latest book is \u003cem\u003ePlaying the Whore: The Work of Sex Work\u003c/em\u003e, which the \u003cem\u003eBaltimore City Paper \u003c/em\u003enamed one of their top ten non-fiction books of the year. In 2016 and 2017, she was a visiting scholar at The Center for Place, Culture and Politics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. To learn more about her work, \u003ca href=\"http://melissagiragrant.com/\"\u003evisit her website\u003c/a\u003e or follow her on Twitter (\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/melissagira\"\u003e@melissagira\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nCheyenne Picardo\u003c/strong\u003e received her BA in Film Studies and Creative Writing from Columbia College, determined to be a film critic and theorist. Then she fell in love with editing and documenting self-described freaks of the New York performance scene, eventually earning her MFA in Photography, Video and Related Media from the School of Visual Arts. Just before grad school, Picardo took the job that inspired her first feature film \u003ca href=\"https://www.remedyfilm.com/\"\u003eREMEDY\u003c/a\u003e, that of a pro-switch (dominatrix/submissive) at a commercial dungeon in New York City. Her focus recently has been using subjective storytelling techniques to explore sexuality, gender, mental health, memory, and marginalization. Her recent work includes \u003cem\u003eBob the Drag Queen\u0027s Suspiciously Large Woman\u003c/em\u003e and Bob\u0027s upcoming docu-comedy special \u003cem\u003eA Queen for the People\u003c/em\u003e. She hopes to harness the power of the mass-media\u2019s influence over culture to destroy outdated and dangerous tropes. In short, she is committed as a filmmaker and film educator to dismantling the destructive legacy of the Hays Code, one frame at a time.
