    "summary": "For those of you that know me already, thanks for the support you have already given me over the years. Thanks also and especially to my new Patreon supporters!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you that don\u0027t know me I\u0027ve been making swords, knives and daggers since 1992. I\u0027ve written extensively in the topic both in online forums, my blog \u0027The Sword Geek\u0027 and my book \u0027The Medieval Sword in the Modern World\u0027 (available on Amazon, hint hint.) \u00a0My wife Linda and I also collaborate on fiction, and have two novels published with more on the way. We\u0027re not terribly prolific but according to our reviews we spin a good tale. But wait, there\u0027s more!\u00a0I have a variety of interests which I cannot seem to shut up about- social and political commentary, firearms, food and humor. I have been known to rant on occasion and my Facebook wall is known as a place for thoughtful discussion of contemporary issues. My other blogs include \u0027That\u0027s Right- I Went There!\u0027 and \u0027Tinker Talks Guns.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why am I on Patreon? Simple. I am a partially disabled veteran who suffers from PTSD and Chronic migraines. I have lived an unquiet life and frankly it\u0027s catching up with me. I have migraines 2-3 times a week, and when I do making things with tools that can maim me is a bad idea. It doesn\u0027t stop me from writing though- but that doesn\u0027t pay the bills and it\u0027s a constant struggle to keep a roof over our heads and the lights on.\u00a0So I am here to ask for your support; if you follow my craft, my opinions and writing. Not so much looking for a hand-out; if you think you receive value from the things I do then I am asking you to help support those things with a modest monthly contribution. Because financial insecurity sucks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat happens if you don\u0027t support me? Nothing. I keep right on doing what I do, because that\u0027s who I am. You get to keep enjoying the things I do that you enjoy free of charge. You don\u0027t even have to feel guilty about it; it\u0027s not like I could stop myself anyway. But if you\u0027ve got a dollar a month to spare I\u0027ll take it, with gratitude. If enough of you contribute I\u0027ll do what I do now, and maybe more cool stuff than ever. I have plans, oh yes I do..."
