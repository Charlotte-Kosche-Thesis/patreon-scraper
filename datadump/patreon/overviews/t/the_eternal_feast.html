Illustrious as the position seems, it turns out to be one of bondage, for not only are you expected to be present at the whim of this dark Goddess, you must also perform any and all deeds Her wicked mind devises.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sJW0JOT.jpg\" style=\"margin: 8px 0 16px 0;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eThe Eternal Feast is a story-centered RPG that fuses elegant writing, voice-acting and select art to create a decadent experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nThe Eternal Feast is currently in production, and we are working towards a free demo as a proof of concept. It will use a custom engine and interface to deliver its art and voice-acting empowered storytelling.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a9EDe5S.jpg\" style=\"margin: 8px 0 16px 0;\"\u003e\nThe player plays a predefined character much like one would find in a book or games like Mass Effect or Planescape: Torment. Over the course of the game the choices that are made will define a great many things: the direction of the player\u2019s corruption, the type of content this triggers (and blocks), which depraved romance they may enter into, how they deal with their own household and slaves, and last but not least - how they survive the enigmatic Succubi Deity known as the Mistress of Pleasure.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/e06UKKm.jpgg\" style=\"margin: 8px 0 16px 0;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe game engine of the Eternal Feast will look at a player\u0027s actions and statistics, and spawns content that aligns with that: whatever the player indulges in the game will notice and spawn more of, and what the player does not indulge is slowly worked to a bare minimum.\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSelective Descent\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe main game mechanic of the Eternal Feast is a feature called Selective Descent. It allows the game to select content from a pool of events that fits your preferred likes and kinks. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Eternal Feast is designed to work with chapters that contain a set amount of turns. Every time a turn starts the game looks at your statistics, the slaves and toys you possess, and your previous deeds, and selects which content is ideal to spawn in alignment to that. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nSelective Descent isn\u2019t just a cool game mechanic, it is also core to the story of the Eternal Feast. The feature represents how the Lus\u2019Inne, the  dark dimension in which the game takes place, tempts you to descend to deeper and deeper levels of depravity. What better way to do this than by seducing you with the things it knows you will indulge in?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xmIO3fB.jpg\" style=\"margin: 6px 0px;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eVoice acting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m working with a talented cast of ladies can act as convincingly as they can portray sexual scenes (and let me tell you, finding VA\u0027s who can act AND do adult work is hard!). Instead of listening to me raving on about it enjoy this little sampler of the Mistress of Pleasure.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/292534383\u0026amp;color=ff5500\u0026amp;auto_play=false\u0026amp;hide_related=false\u0026amp;show_comments=true\u0026amp;show_user=true\u0026amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHigh-quality art \n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Eternal Feast will feature art for the game\u2019s main and support characters, done by a professional fantasy artist that has done work for Legend of the Cryptids. The art is mainly there to help bring the varied cast to life, but the player can also unlock the ability to undress a characters art. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am also looking to have the stories that open a chapter be illustrated. Due to the massive costs involved, however, this is a feature that will have to wait for now.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JXqNa4y.jpg\" style=\"margin: 6px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDesigned for the devious\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Eternal Feast revolves around indulgence and corruption. This is not only restricted to the story and lore, it is also applied to the game\u2019s design. Everything in the Eternal Feast - as much as budget will allow - will be aimed at the deviant that enjoys indulging in unnatural (sexual) themes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe writing that is being done for the Eternal Feast is very high quality, especially for an adult game. There is a scene we are currently working on that is the climax of chapter one, which serves as a good example. In this scene the player is taken into the dimensional shard of the Succubi Portaea. Once there Portaea engages in dialogue with the player, but with a twist: four massive male slaves wait their turn to mount her from behind, one by one. During the sex the player can ask questions (which Portaea will answer in between moans and groans), but the player can also indulge in observing specific body parts of the Succubi. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe writing and design direction of the Eternal Feast thus allow the player to effortlessly indulge in the way something looks, feels or smells. If you want to spend 5 minutes reading about a veined object of massive proportions, you can. If you want to read in intricate detail how the scent of a Succubi causes orifces to become moist with excitement, this too is possible. If at times you\u2019d rather brush by some of these excessive descriptions in favour of keeping the story flowing, this will of course also be possible. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5ZFnqFX.jpg\" style=\"margin: 6px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LVQ89uC.jpg\" style=\"margin: 8px 0 16px 0;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nImagine a world where mankind is nothing but a plaything to lustful Succubi. The men these ravenous demonesses capture are turned into \"Cockslaves\", physically altered thralls that serve a singular purpose - to pump semen into voracious Succubi orifices. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor women the Succubi have more varied uses: some become house servants and handmaiden, others artistic entertainers like dancers and contortionists, but the majority end up as what are commonly referred to as \"Pleasure Dolls\u201d. Pleasure Dolls are servants trained in very specific forms of erotic expression, aligning to the tastes and perversities of their owner. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe prestigious Succubi of this dreamworld each have their own shard, which can be seen as a miniature realm in which these demons rule their household with supreme authority. The shards are connected by gateways: magickal doors, mirrors, large archways and the like bring the player from one abode to another, each vastly different from each other yet the same in a single respect - in each shard a ravenous Succubi feasts on the emotions and life energy of captured slaves. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA dimension seeped in corruption\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe lifeblood of the Lus\u0027Inne - and also the only thing sacred in the dimension - is indulgence in pleasure. To remain a welcome visitor a Succubi must not only indulge in Pleasure constantly, she must also descend into darker and more perverted forms of said Pleasure as time passes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile there are infinite ways to enjoy the Pleasures that the Lus\u2019Inne offers Succubi, the three and three, also known as the twin-sister unholy trinity, and sometimes as the Pillars of Corruption, are the focus of many an established Succubi. Together they hold the six corruptions that players of the Eternal Feast can indulge in.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DzDzGg7.jpg\" style=\"margin: 6px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWyrd toys\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the Lus\u2019Inne wyrd and absurd are the norm. You\u2019ll come across sexual accessories that are all as twisted as they are unique, and are often also instilled with their own perverse consciousness. The Pleasure Doll of the Lash that goes by the name of Milk, that players can acquire early in the game, is a good example of this. Once the player unlocks this frail Doll, they also find an enigmatic phallic object in their possession. It is up to the player to discover what the object is for, what it wants, and to decide if they desire to use it upon their Doll.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of the toys you will come across in the Eternal Feast are a cruel screaming whip that revels in dealing out agony, a parasitic garment that leaves no orifice unspoiled, and a mask that allows you to ravage the mind of your victim.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThematic playrooms\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eIf possessed sexual accessories aren\u2019t weird enough, the Lus\u2019Inne will allow players of the game to enjoy thematic playrooms. These are very much like servants and toys in the sense that they can be used and levelled up, but differ in that the experience is a lot more excessive.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause these rooms are required to access crucial scenes with the romanceable Succubi, what a player chooses is very defining. If a player is looking to romance Portaea, for example, this means they need the [Seduction] themed \u2018Room of Many Mirrors\u2019. In this room the player will explore the seduction - and eventual abduction - of helpless mortals. Eventually the player may even succumb to Portaea\u2019s offer to acquire an old acquaintance via this method\u2026\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome other rooms you can unlock are the [Worship] themed \u2018Lair of the Milk Mavens, in which leaking breasts and thick phalluses are worshipped with equal abandon, and the [Cruelty] themed Mindbreaker Prison, which allows you to indulge in the mental breaking of slaves.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eA household intent on Pleasure\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the Eternal Feast anyone who is anyone has her own servants and slaves. As Yra you start the game with Mara and Silke, your trusty handmaiden, who cater to your every need. Upon meeting your first Succubi, the High Priestess Saana, you are immediately introduced into the ways of the Lus\u2019Inne, as she brings with her your first Pleasure Doll and Cockslave.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom there on the journey of the player becomes one of unlocking more content, and then learning which of these align with their kinks. All the slaves and Dolls have their own personality, backstory and corruptions attached to them. The massive Imperial Cockslave doesn\u2019t speak and follows your every command to the word, yet you soon learn that despite the few opportunities for its character to express itself, it has a penchant for sadism. The Doll of the Heart, on the other end of the spectrum, is a nurturing and motherly servant that desires nothing more than to soothe any difficulty you experience.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour Sevilla, and all the Dolls and Cockslaves have two routes of use to them. One aligns to frictionless indulgence, and the other the exact opposite. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/enqW1ri.jpg\" style=\"margin: 8px 0 16px 0;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTEF has been around for a while as a project and has had a rocky start. The main issue has been with developers and artists, which have proven to be an erratic bunch at best. I had to learn to cover my bases, and not just rely on anyone\u2019s word. Combined with some rather severe personal issues that befell me last year, TEF hasn\u2019t progressed as much as I liked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe choice I was left with was simple: either throw in the towel, or swallow my pride and take the lessons learned, and restart the development machine. Since I love TEF\u2019s concept way too much, and feel there are way too few decent adult games being made, I decided to go with the latter.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo what will be different?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst and foremost my mate Lord Arioch, whom has been successfully developing Seeds of Chaos for quite some time now, will tackle the coding for TEF. That means that his team of developers, which he has worked with effortlessly for quite some time, will also take on TEF.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSecond is that I am returning to full on communication and transparency. I\u2019ll be online on Discord, will post regularly on the state of things on Patreon, have a document that shows where we are with commissions, and will set up a website that delves more into the game\u2019s world. I can\u2019t guarantee a spotlessly clean ride, but I do promise I will commit 100% and keep you updated every step of the way.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bbLKHP1.jpg\" style=\"margin: 8px 0 16px 0;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Eternal Feast is a one of a kind undertaking. In what other game world are you snatched into a Succubi-dominated world, given a household of servants and slaves, and then commanded to indulge in heinous and wicked deeds? \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBeyond that I strive for quality, and adult games that aim for quality are very rare. The writing for the Eternal Feast is crafted with attention to detail and real passion, as the snippets on this page hopefully exhibit. Lastly there is the concept of the game - to give you non-filler content catered to your most freaky fetishes and kinks - again opts for a quality experience over a simple \u2018get off\u2019 session. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWe need support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTEF is a relatively expensive undertaking for a budget game. The writing we commission costs $1000 a month alone. If you factor the 2 art pieces we also commission from an industry professional artist, and then keep in mind we haven\u2019t spoken of developer costs and voice-acting yet\u2026 \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLong story short\u2026 I believe the Eternal Feast is going to be a unique game that rewards intelligent and perverted players in a way no other game games does, but I need your support to make it happen. If this is your thing consider chiming in, and if you can\u2019t maybe spread the good word on social media? Either would be a great help.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith that said I leave you with a final piece of writing that I hope won\u2019t get me kicked from Patreon. Enjoy, and maybe I\u0027ll see you in the Lus\u2019Inne!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
