    "summary": "Since YouTube essentially demonetizes 60 - 85 percent of everything I put up now, I\u0027m hoping that others can help out. That way, the channel does what it was meant to do - sustain itself while our friendly staff - me - pours through tomes of articles throughout the years, trying to see what comics were and are and what they should be, so videos can be made addressing both past and current issues.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt one time I might have answered this differently, but lately, I personally think that comics journalism is broken and that people like you and me are the thing that will finally right this disturbingly crooked thing. WE see issues within the medium and we see the people causing them, and we notice how this is transpiring. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe HAVE to bring exposure to this, challenging specific narratives as they rise, making certain that voices are heard. We have to do that ourselves, too, because NO OTHER organization will listen - I mean, do you feel heard by the current\u00a0 comics status quo? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo ensure a voice, we need more than topical information on topics; we need research to add insight, noting the who and what are behind things, adding both understanding accountability to this. We need time and energy and effort.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need to speak to others and have them hear us, so that enough of us might actually make the industry listen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we need to build this thing ourselves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think it would be interesting to build something like that, and think other people would want to as well. So, let\u0027s do it together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
