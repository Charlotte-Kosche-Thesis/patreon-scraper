We were selected for this competitive program by demonstrating an entrepreneurial spirit, a drive to create opportunities for others, and a willingness to give back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCaroline Hatfield is a visual artist, startup adviser, and a freelance designer. Anna Baghina (formerly Isachenko) is a songwriter, lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist in the indie pop trio Soviet Girls, and has experience in operations at high growth companies. Both of us have worked for a variety of startups and have degrees in business strategy. Together, we are a team of badass artists and business-minded builders. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Forge has empowered us to become better artists and taught us how to run business owners - and we want to help others on their creative paths.

Each day, we are learning what it takes to provide the necessary resources to help them succeed - and as our community grows, so should our resources and offerings. \u003cstrong\u003eWe are turning to Patreon in a collaborative effort to sustain and grow our resources for residents, provide more value to our supporting community (you!), and more strongly support our neighborhood.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve had an overwhelming amount of gracious support in renovating The Forge home, but also had to dig into personal savings to to get our home safe and ready for our residents and collaborators. Because an inspiring and inclusive atmosphere is core to our mission, we have also poured finances into furnishing the home for our residents with furniture and basic creative and event supplies covered. These financial costs to upkeep the residency have left us strapped when it comes to the important aspects of growing a vibrant creative community, such as hosting events, providing shared maker supplies, and building out art and music studios. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough we both must sustain full-time jobs to keep up on finances, we are still stretched thin in terms of what we can dedicate to The Forge and, consequently, have had to refuse opportunities that come our way and limit what we provide to our community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(217, 150, 148); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u00a0Get Involved\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u2019s the deal, you get exclusive access to our resources, outputs, and creative processes, we dedicate more to The Forge\u2019s mission, and, in turn, provide more awesome resources for you and our creative community.
