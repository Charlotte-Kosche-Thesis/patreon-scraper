    "summary": "The Gringos were a high energy show band who hailed from Scottsdale, Arizona.  The band originally began in the early 1960\u0027s as a Tijuana Brass sound alike band eventually evolving into a Blood Sweat \u0026amp; Tears, Chicago style horn band by Spring of 1970.  Their big brassy arrangements (by leader Jim Miller) showcased a style all its own, and with lead singer Donna Byrd fronting the band, The Gringos ...produced a commercial sound all their own.  By the mid 1970\u0027s Ms Byrd left the band which caused the band to build upon it\u0027s other strengths, the individual talents of each member and from there the band went on to record two albums.  The first an independently produced and released album and later were signed to the UA (United Artists) label and produced by Snuff Garrett and Steven Dorf.  The band\u0027s first album was special at a time when independent artists were unheard of, but the enthusiasm of the band lead to some minor success as it did get mentioned in Billboard and Cash Box and received some regional Air Play on local radio stations in the New England area.  The Band\u0027s experience with United Artists was a completely different affair.  By then Lynn (Bush) Tivens had left the band and The Gringos had added a third trumpet player, Steve Lowry to it\u0027s lineup.  But most of the music played on the album was not the band\u0027s performance but rather studio musicians. Still the anticipated release meant a great deal to the band until it was learned that the UA label had been sold at the time of the release of the album and instead of getting general air play, the album was sent straight to the \"Cut Out\" bin in record stores and no air play ever happened.  With the styles of music changing in the late 1970\u0027s and into the early 1980\u0027s, the band found it difficult to find work in the night club circuit.  Disco\u0027s became the rage and live music was almost a thing of the past.  In January of 1980, after nearly 10 years performing together as The Gringos the band decided it was time to hang it up for good with half the members staying in the New England area, and the other half moving back to Arizona.  Donna Byrd moved to Las Vegas, Nevada and Lynn (Bush) Tivens went back to his home in the Los Angeles area.  Through the magic of the internet, The Gringo\u0027s still live on.  All the band members are in constant communication with one another.  Who knows, maybe one day there just might be a Gringos reunion that will produce something special again.  Stay tuned for that next chapter...\u003cbr\u003e"
