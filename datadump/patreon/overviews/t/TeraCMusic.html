Music has been my passion for a long time, and being able to create quality, consistent content for everyone would be incredible! Currently, I do all of the work myself; audio recording/editing, video recording/editing, creating backtracks, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy \u003cstrong\u003edream\u003c/strong\u003e is to make music for you guys for a living.
