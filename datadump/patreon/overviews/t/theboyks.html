    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eWHAT IS THEBOYKS?\u003c/h2\u003eI\u0027m theboyks! My name is Derek Boyko and I\u0027ve been playing Magic (read hooked on the cardboard smack) since 1997 when my brother installed the old Microprose game Shandalar on his computer and then I really got into it when he bought me a starter in 1999. So, you can consider me an old timer. I used to do a weekly video over at DraftMagic.com for years before the site died recording footage of Magic: the Gathering drafts, sealed events, and constructed content which were very popular. I also did Commander videos over at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.manadeprived.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eManadeprived.com\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.numotgaming.com/author/boyks/\"\u003eNumotGaming.com\u003c/a\u003e. Now I mostly stream on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/theboyks\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e and produce a much larger variety of content on an almost daily basis.\u00a0Due to popular demand, I\u0027m setting up this Patreon to both create another avenue for those who want to to support me and my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/theboyks\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTwitch stream\u003c/a\u003e and to create video footage again in a bite sized Youtube video fashion for my patrons!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/h2\u003ePatreon is a great tool for consumers and creators to interact directly together. I can get direct feedback on the type of content you folks want to see and produce that content for you. I\u0027m all for people helping me out, but I always feel like I need to give something back in return and Patreon is a great way for me to do so. Basically, I make videos, do huge gaming events like Mortal Komabt Fatality where I played 23 different Mortal Kombat games, Grab Bags where we take viewer polls on random games being playerd, and speedruns, but now you have an avenue to more easily give me some money to help support these events for the stream and get some extra content back in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHOW DOES PATREON WORK?\u003c/h2\u003eBasically, you agree to pay me X amount for every month of streaming/producing content.\u00a0Instead of, say, spending five dollars on an expensive coffee (but seriously, Pumpkin Spice Latte is my JAM), you can give me a fraction of that so I can make videos for you. If we hit certain goals, I\u0027ll expand the amount of content I\u0027m able to have time to make. Hey, we might even be able to setup a meetup with some folks in the Seattle area and do a draft/hit the barcade! Patreon cuts out a lot of the middle-men when it comes to supporting me, so instead of Twitch taking half of a sub or Paypal taking a huge cut of a donation, I\u0027ll be seeing a lot more of what you want to give me. This means that you can give relatively small amounts and it still makes a substantial impact on the amount you\u0027re supporting me with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll you have to do is click the orange \"Become a Patron\" button at the top of the page and decide how much to give, pick your perk level if applicable, and  put in your payment information. Thanks for checking out the Patreon and for your support. I really appreciate it."
