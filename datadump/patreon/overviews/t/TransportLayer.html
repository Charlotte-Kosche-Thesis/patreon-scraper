I\u0027m TransportLayer.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tIf you\u0027re not familiar with what I do, I like to make things with software, firmware, hardware, and my servers. I started writing software at age 9, and haven\u0027t stopped since. Seriously. I\u0027ve been sitting here at this computer continuously writing for 10 years. Please send help.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eI write the code that makes your stuff work.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tWell, probably not. But that\u0027s the sort of code I like to work on. Over time, I\u0027ve found that I only enjoy working on backend software -- the code you never see, but the code that runs everything you use. The only interface I\u0027m comfortable writing is an API.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tSomewhat recently, I\u0027ve also become interested in working with hardware: creating electronic devices and writing the firmware for them -- the extremely low-level microcode that makes the chips in electronics work. Although this is much more time consuming and infinitely more expensive than working with software, I find it fascinating that I can create things that directly interact with the real world.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eI\u0027m a system administrator.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tI currently own 5 Dell PowerEdge rack servers, 3 converted workstation servers, and rent 3 VPSes. All but one server runs Linux. The other server is running FreeBSD. I\u0027m also a volunteer sysadmin for a really fast and cool server at \n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/accidentalgames\"\u003eAccidental Games\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eI\u0027m a cellist.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tWhen I\u0027m not making things, I\u0027m usually playing my cello. I started in the middle of June in 2017. I love music with string instruments, and before I started, I wanted to try to learn either the piano, the violin, or the cello. I ended up deciding to learn to play the cello, because I love its lower sounds, and I loved hearing it in Clean Bandit\u0027s music.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI was honestly terrified of trying to learn to play any instrument, \n\t\u003cem\u003eespecially\u003c/em\u003e a string instrument. I\u0027ve always had problems learning and remembering things, and I had no experience with anything related to music before. I\u0027d never played an instrument before and I didn\u0027t understand how to read music. I hadn\u0027t even seen a violin or cello in person before. I was afraid I was going to have too hard of a time with it, and I was afraid of spending so much money on something that wouldn\u0027t end up working out for me (cellos are \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e expensive!).\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tA friend of mine convinced me to at least try it, telling me that he played the cello for a bit when he was in school. He took me to a violin shop that his mother works at, and it was beautiful. It was my first time ever seeing the instruments in person, and there were tens of cellos and many more violins and violas. I was so happy to be there. I believe I was told that their \"cello room\" was being used at the time so I couldn\u0027t see it, but there were many more cellos in there.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI was sat down and given a couple cellos to check out, and was shown the very basics of how to hold the cello and bow, but I really had no idea what I was doing. It was really awkward, but I was really happy to be holding a cello and making sounds with it. I was helped with my decision on which cello to take home, and I started renting it then.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThe next week, I found a cello teacher, and started taking lessons. I was so afraid that I\u0027d be difficult to teach or something, but neither my teacher nor myself could believe how fast I was learning. She kept telling me that, and that she was convinced I\u0027d played before and just wasn\u0027t telling her. She told me I was born to play the cello.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027ve been taking lessons with her ever since then, and she\u0027s an amazing teacher. She told me I\u0027ve been able to learn in just a few months what most of her students take a year or longer to learn. And I thought I wouldn\u0027t be able to learn to play cello at all! I\u0027m really happy to be able to play such a beautiful instrument.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI didn\u0027t expect to go into so much detail about my cello. I just love it so much, and had an opportunity to explain how I got to where I am today.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eDoing this is expensive.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tServers use a lot of power. Internet costs a lot. Hardware upgrades aren\u0027t cheap. Electronic components aren\u0027t free. I\u0027m still paying off the HVAC system for the server room. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI love doing what I do. But I can\u0027t keep doing this for free.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI\u0027ve created this page to help me keep doing what I do, and hopefully do more in the future. By supporting me financially, you\u0027ll be helping me pay for the costs of running my servers, and allowing me to buy the parts I need to make hardware projects.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThank you.\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tThere\u0027s more details in the rewards section of this page, but to show my gratitude for your donations, depending on your reward level, I will do my best to provide you with things such as custom software development, server hosting (web, Minecraft, etc.), access to existing game servers I run, and possibly physical items, such as electronic devices I\u0027ve created.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tUnfortunately, due to the amount of time it takes to create software and especially hardware and firmware, I may not be able to take every request, and it may take me longer than a month to complete the request.\n\u003c/div\u003e"
