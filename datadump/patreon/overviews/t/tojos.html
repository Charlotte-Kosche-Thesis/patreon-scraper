This requires time, effort and our own financial resources. At the moment we estimate that we could run a full time job with the amount of hours that we put in between us. That\u0027s why we have set up this Patreon page: to give you the chance to support us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, we can keep this podcast growing and continue to offer you content at the high standards we have set ourselves. One of our long-term goals is to produce a yearly magazine which\u00a0will contain the best written pieces from our website along with some articles which will be exclusive to the print edition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, you\u0027ll be able to receive rewards like an additional Team of John O\u0027Sheas podcast episode once a month \u00a0or a free copy of our end of year magazine both of which are\u00a0only available to our Patreon backers\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please consider backing our Patreon page if you\u0027re a fan of what we do. We love creating written and audio material for you but we\u0027d also love to keep on going for as long as we can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Team\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor more information about what exactly we plan on offering, check the goals column to the left of this FAQ for more details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFAQ\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon and how does it work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a monthly subscription service. You sign up for an account, pick a payment method and, whatever you choose to donate, the money goes out of your account at the beginning of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf I don\u0027t contribute to the Patreon, can I still listen to the podcast or access the website?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes of course! This Patreon page has been set up so as to keep as much as possible of our content free for everyone. We will still be completely free and available on iTunes and audioBoom. You just won\u0027t get access to our exclusive episode every month or other perks that our Patreon supporters would get.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf I make a pledge to your Patreon, can I change how much I spend?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes you can. If you want to increase your support or if you can\u0027t quite afford to support us as much in the future then you can change how much you donate each month. You\u0027re not tied down to anything which means you\u0027re free to help as much as you can/want to on a month by month basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI see there are some big gaps between a couple of your goals. What happens to the money when we don\u0027t hit a new goal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we\u0027re planning on using most of the first batches of cash we get to fund our costs in running the podcast, the plan for the future is to invest any spare income we get into creating more content. So even if we do not reach the goal for producing an annual magazine, we will use the money to improve the content on our website (either ourselves or by using any proceeds to pay writers).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027ve backed a higher tier. How do I claim my rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce we\u0027ve gotten things going, we will email details on how higher tier patrons can claim rewards or be involved with other things through Patreon. If for some reason you sign up to a higher tier and don\u0027t get any messages, please get in contact with us through Twitter or our Facebook page and we will get back to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
