Clouser offered a trilogy of records on Brooklyn label Royal Potato Family between February 2012 and 2013, earning praise from critics of jazz and rock alike, while working tirelessly as a published poet, writer of short fiction and community philanthropist in Mexico.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \"Blistering\" says the Prague Post on Clouser, while NPR goes on to call him \"fascinating .... ultimately illuminating\", with the Phildaelphia Inquirer pointing to Todd as \"A Gem, Clouser spices the All American vibe of Bill Frisell with some Jimi Hendrix fire.\" Todd Clouser\u0027s most recent offering Man With No Country (Sept 2013) comes on Amulet Records, the label of legendary drummer Billy Martin, who performs on a number of the albums tracks. A record of 11 proper songs, biting lyricism, and blood churning sonic landscapes produced by another legend of New York City\u0027s downtown scene, Golden Palominos founder Anton Fier. Man With No Country, a more vulnerable offering that anything we have seen from Todd stands to further propel Clouser into the conscience of the creative music conscience. Clouser can be found on stage and in studios across the Unites States, Central America, and western Europe, his performances exuding an impassioned and contagious commitment to risk and discovery. Whether with A Love Electric, solo, or next to heroes from Keb Mo to John Medeski, there is the sense when hearing Clouser that a new generation of ideas is arriving.\u003cbr\u003e\ntoddclouser.com\u003cbr\u003e",
