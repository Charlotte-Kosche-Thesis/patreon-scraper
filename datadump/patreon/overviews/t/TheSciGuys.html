    "summary": "Hey, we\u0027re The Sci Guys and we make educational science videos on YouTube. We started making content in 2013 and we normally release a new video every second week. Our current series of videos is known as \"science at home\" where we do experiments that you can do in your own home, with mostly at home ingredients and equipment. After each experiment we explain the science behind the\u00a0experiment or concepts using fun\u00a0illustrations and animations that we create specifically for our videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(54, 96, 146);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Unlike kick starter where large amounts of money are raised for one specific project or product. Patreon works by collecting smaller donations for each video released, we plan to initially release 2-3 videos a month. The great thing about Patreon is you get to choose which reward level fits you best and to make sure you stay within your budget, you can also set a monthly maximum.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do we need patrons?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/span\u003eAs we are a very small team, it takes a lot of time and effort to research and create these videos. While we intend to continue creating free content regardless of how many patrons we get, funding will make it easier for us to do bigger, more interesting and exciting experiments, get new equipment, as well as make it easier to produce more videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt goes without saying that we really appreciate any support you can give us whether you donate $1 or $50 dollars, so \n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003ethank you\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e ahead of time. Remember that we will still be producing regular free content even if you cannot afford to donate so don\u0027t feel bad if you can\u0027t. If you cannot afford to donate the best way to support us is to continue to watch our videos on YouTube with ads and to share them with your friends and family."

These new videos will not necessarily all be science experiment videos, but some will be part of a new series explaining science concepts, breakthroughs and answering questions, that don\u0027t necessarily have an experiment associated with them.\u00a0We will look into collaborating with local groups like zoo\u0027s or educational facilities to bring you new and interesting science content from all ranges of science fields.\u003cbr\u003e- We would also be able to do occasional bigger build experiments that are larger and more impressive.\u003cbr\u003e- This will also allow us to buy new lighting equipment and eventually upgrade our sound equipment to produce better videos.",
