    "summary": "Hi Folks! We\u0027re the Meadows Brothers, Ian and Dustin.\u003cbr\u003eWe are from Connecticut, and have been playing as The Meadows Brothers since we were both in high school, but we\u0027ve been playing music together for a lot longer then that. We play music that is considered to be \"Folk Music\" by most people, and we\u0027re good with that description. Our sound draws from a ton of varied genres, but our biggest influence is the body of American Roots Music from blues to bluegrass to rock n\u0027 roll created over the course of the 20th century. We are passionate about writing songs, which has been the driving force that keeps us moving forward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOver the past few years, we\u0027ve been able to have a lot of fun traveling around playing our songs for folks around the country, and we\u0027re planning on doing a whole lot more of that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have made the decision to remain a truly independent, DIY band. We don\u0027t have a manager, booking agent, or publicist by choice; and have released every recording that we have ever made without the help and marketing support of a record label. The ability to have control over our art is important to us, and it allows us to focus on writing better songs and becoming better musicians with fewer distractions in the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re extremely grateful to have such a supportive group of people behind us. If you would like to see and hear more from The Meadows Bros, please consider helping us out with a monthly pledge. Every bit helps!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOur hope is to build this Patreon page into something that can provide us with some extra funding, so that we can put more time into creating! Take a look at the four pledge tiers and their respective rewards, and see if becoming a patron is right for you. Thanks for checking out our page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Ian\u0026amp;Dustin Meadows"
