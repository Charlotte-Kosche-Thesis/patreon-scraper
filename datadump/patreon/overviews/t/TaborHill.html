    "summary": "My name is Tabor Hill. \u00a0Chances are, if you play Call of Duty or Fortnite and have ever been stumped on a challenge, you may have heard of me or at least seen one of my videos. \u00a0I\u0027ve been making YouTube videos since February 2011, over 5 years now. \u00a0I decided to change the direction of my channel in November 2013, when Call of Duty Ghosts was released. \u00a0From then on, I focused solely on helping the community by offering elaborate challenge help guides. \u00a0My goal was, and still is to this day, to help every caliber of player succeed in any challenge -- even the more difficult ones. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI separate myself from the majority of Call of Duty YouTuber\u0027s in that I love interacting with my fans. \u00a0If I had enough time in the day, I would reply to every single YouTube comment I receive. \u00a0Since I\u0027ve became increasingly more popular lately, it has been difficult to do so -- but I always sit down for at least 30 minutes on every upload and respond to comments. \u00a0Not only this, I am extremely active on Twitter. \u00a0I will not refuse any question or comment. \u00a0When I was first starting out on YouTube, none of the bigger channels would answer my questions or pay any attention to a \"noobie boobie\" like me. \u00a0I vowed that if I ever reached the level of success some of these guys had, I would NOT be that way. \u00a0That\u0027s my mentality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve seen any of my videos, you\u0027ll know they take a lot of effort. \u00a0The quality should be readily apparent. \u00a0There\u0027s no clickbaiting on my channel. \u00a0All of my videos are legitimate. \u00a0What I put in the title of the video, you\u0027ll definitely be sure to find in the content of the video. \u00a0There\u0027s no news or drama on my channel. \u00a0I grew my subscriber base out of pure quality content, something a lot of YouTube videos are lacking in this day and age. \u00a0I stand by my work 100%.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do have a few issues standing in my way. \u00a0I currently cannot afford to do YouTube full-time. \u00a0As such, I do work a normal job full-time. \u00a0I also have 3 children, ages 7, 5, and 3. \u00a0My daughter, age 5, was born with a severe disability called spina bifida myelomeningocele. \u00a0She has already had TWELVE (12) major operations. \u00a0She cannot go to the bathroom on her own, requires a nurse at home, and has a lot of medical issues. \u00a0The majority of my income goes towards her medical bills. \u00a0(To find out more about my daughter, including our trip to Disney World via the Make-A-Wish foundation, watch this video: \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PcjDVqeiZk).\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PcjDVqeiZk).\u003c/a\u003e \u00a0Lastly,\u00a0I have a very cranky wife. \u00a0She absolutely hates that I \"waste my time\" doing YouTube videos. \u00a0She does not seem to understand that it CAN actually provide income. \u00a0She hates me playing Call of Duty, as she thinks it\u0027s a bad influence on the kids. \u00a0Not only this, she does not let me have my own gaming room. \u00a0She actually makes me play in our closet. \u00a0Granted, it\u0027s a fairly large closet, but I literally play sitting cross-legged on my floor in a closet. \u00a0That\u0027s my gaming set-up. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to all of the above combined issues, I\u0027d say I have about an hour or less a day to work on YouTube videos. \u00a0It\u0027s a miracle I am able to upload as frequently as I do -- but I\u0027d love to upload even more frequently. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now I\u0027m asking for your help to take my channel to the next level (and then some) for several much-needed goals, including:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRELEASING WAY MORE CONTENT.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpgrading my gaming set-up. \u00a0Since my wife will not allow me to spend any money on video game related items, she will not allow me to have a gaming room. \u00a0Donations may change her tune a bit, which is what I\u0027m trying to achieve here. \u00a0I have a full basement, which currently is unfinished. \u00a0There\u0027s ample room for a gaming room, but I currently lack the funds to finish the basement. \u00a0With donations, this will be my #1 goal. \u00a0I absolutely need a work area. \u00a0I need a gaming desk and a gaming chair. \u00a0It would seem that only through donations can I make this a reality.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLive streaming! \u00a0So many times I\u0027ve been asked to live stream, but in order to do this I will need to increase my internet speed, upgrade my desktop and buy the required streaming equipment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFURTHER INCREASING THE AWESOME! Help keep me going, ensuring a steady flow of funding to pursue additional channel improvements!!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider backing my channel! \u00a0If every subscriber pledged $1 a month, I\u0027d be golden. Whatever pledge you can manage will help me marshal the time, resources, and manpower to tackle some long-awaited projects and initiatives!"
