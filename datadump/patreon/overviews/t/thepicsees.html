    "summary": "Hello, it\u0027s us...the Picsees. Thank you so much for visiting our Patreon page and for thinking about supporting us and our art.\u00a0You might know us from Facebook or twitter but if not, we would love to\u00a0tell you a bit about ourselves...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome people say that we came from the imagination of an artist...but we\u0027re actually all from the faeryworlds. We did however find our way into this world of yours through the magic of imagination and most of us live in the aforementioned artist\u0027s studio, so it\u0027s quite an understandable mistake to make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou see, every picture, story, poem or song that makes someone dream of another world opens up a wee door between here and there.\u003cdiv\u003eMy brother and I found one of these doors when a wee boy made some drawings of magical little beings that looked a bit us. Our friend Mika wandered in through a bedtime story told once upon a time in the Scottish highlands, and Lilloo arrived through a long forgotten song that was sung on the sea shores.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWe all really love it here and since someone was kind enough to open these wee doors for us we wanted to return the favour and let you sneak into the faeryworld thought our own pictures, stories, songs and poems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou are therefor invited to come and meet all of our wee faerie friends on our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.thepicsees.com\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thepicsees/\"\u003efacebook page\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thepicsees/\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e where we share their pictures and stories with those of oyu who believes in the magic of imagination...and best of all it\u0027s all completely free! We would of course always like to keep it that way but this can sometimes be tricky to do...which brings us back to this Patreon page. Every little bit helps and every Patreon penny means an extra moment we can spend on making art pictures, telling stories and hopefully adding just a wee bit of magic to this world...and we thank you so very very much for thinking of becoming a part of this ~:D\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
