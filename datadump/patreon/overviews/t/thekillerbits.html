    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello. And welcome to the Killer\nBits.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027ve found your way here to\nour Patreon page you are probably familiar with who we are and what\nwe do but if not allow me to introduce ourselves. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a the Killer Bits. A group\nof friends and YouTubers based here in the UK (and Norway) creating a\nwhole host of content over on our channel -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/thekillerbits\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyoutube.com/thekillerbits\u003c/a\u003e. What started as just a simple idea for a\nmagazine format show, poking fun at all the latest news and reviews\nin the world of gaming has turned into its own digital beast. A\nchannel that takes a look at everything from the latest AAA titles to\nthose small indie games that might have pass you by. We attempt to\ncast a critical eye and razor\u0027s edge tongue across them all and\npresent them to you with our own particular brand of humor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love what we do. We love playing\ngames and being able to make videos about them for you guys. So that\nwe can, not only, share our thoughts with you our audience but also\n(hopefully) entertain and inform you aswell. But unfortunately one of\nthe great poets of our time may have been slightly underselling it\nwhen he said \"All you need is love\". \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApparently you can\u0027t pay for your\ngroceries with good feelings. Your landlord doesn\u0027t accept hugs \u0026amp;\nkisses in lieu of rent. And the taxman certainly doesn\u0027t like it when\nyou try and fill in  your self assessment with hearts \u0026amp; flowers. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApparently all you need is love\n...and money. And this where Patreon steps in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo you are probably asking yourself\n- what has this got to do with me and what the hell is Patreon? Don\u0027t\nall YouTubers get tons of money from Google ad revenue? \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell the simple answer is - No.\nYouTube ad revenue is pretty tiny and insignificant unless happen to\nbe one of those channels lucky enough to have 100s of thousands (if\nnot millions)  of subscribers. For smaller channels like ourselves it\nis a constant struggle trying to balance the time that is required to\ncreate awesome content for you guys with need to work \"real\njobs\" in order to pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon helps shift that balance a\nlittle by allowing fans to directly support the content creators they\nlove with small donations which allows them spend more time creating\nand less time worrying about bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo is this going to turn into a\n\u201cpay wall\u201d?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s an easy answer for that \u2013 No. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are going to carry on making\nvideos free for everyone who wants to watch them over on YouTube.\nThis is simply a way for fans to help support the channel if they\nwant to and can maybe afford to give us a couple of dollars a month. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
