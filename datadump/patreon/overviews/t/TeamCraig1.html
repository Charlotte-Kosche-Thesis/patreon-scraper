I authored \u2018Better Days - A Mental Health Recovery Workbook\u2019, co-authored \u2018New Traditions - A Workbook for Better Days\u2019 and compiled the anthology titled \u201cYou\u2019re Crazy - Volume One\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn January 29th, finding myself houseless and without employment, and without prospects, I arrive in Paris France, to begin a month long European  tour,  presenting my published books, via workshops and storytelling sessions, connecting with truth-tellers, radical liberators and the brilliantly mad of all sorts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am honored to be offering professional mental health training in Brussels, Belgium; Paris , France; Lausanne, Switzerland; Mannheim, Germany; Warsaw, Poland;  Prague, Czech Republic and in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also giving talks and presentations in bookstores in France, a youth center in Belgium, a punk bar in Berlin, several squats  and collectives in Poland, a punk rock community space in London, and more\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are still reading; you know that I have been hurt, and that I am awakening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ask you to join me on this journey by allowing me the gift to share of myself,  and the beautiful learning, living and loving, that comes from awakening to the Universe, and choosing to go all in, in becoming the man I was born to be and, if I am so blessed; to be of benefit for others in my sphere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is going to be a ton of fun. I will be posting the many video and interview links and blogs that I do on the regular, and for my Patrons, unique content from my travels around the globe. Check out some of the samples posted here to learn more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrand new video content will begin being posted within days.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy story will be understood via my posts...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGratitude and Respect,\u003cbr\u003eCraig\u003cbr\u003eJanuary 23rd, 2018\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*You will only be charged monthly per tier chosen (books , buttons, and calls are one time charges)\u003c/strong\u003e"
