    "summary": "Hello! I am a fantasy and scifi artist from Michigan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy artwork stems from my love of nature and science, as well as folklore and mythology. I try to keep my style and subject matter somewhat varied, but I especially love painting dragons, unicorns, and other fantasy/scifi creatures, lush, delicate plant life, and exotic landscapes. I mostly work in watercolors, but I also use a bit of acrylic, gel pen, pencil, and Prismacolor marker sometimes. I\u0027m hoping to get into doing some oil paintings in the near future if time, space, and money will allow it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set up this Patreon page because I\u0027m hoping to work my way towards being a full time artist. I love painting, and I\u0027ll continue to paint regardless of my profession, but art supplies, overhead, and the cost of living can be steep, and having a full time day job doesn\u0027t leave me with very much time to create. My bigger, more detailed paintings can take anywhere from 10 - 40 hours to create, and I hope to continue to be able to set aside enough time to create new pieces on at least a monthly basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to find me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://metalkirin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e  - \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/TealNewcombArt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e  - \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Teal-Newcomb/132166653958?ref=hl\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e  -\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/tealnewcomb\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKo-fi\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently charge per month rather than per painting, as this takes a bit of pressure off of me to complete new pieces before the end of the month, so I am free to spend as much time as I need to work on larger, more complex pieces.
