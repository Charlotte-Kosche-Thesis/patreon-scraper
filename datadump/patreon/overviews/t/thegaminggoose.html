    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you and why\nshould anyone care?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! My name is Eric and I\u0027m the creator of the YouTube channel \u003cem\u003eThe Gaming\nGoose\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut why am I here on \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, because I really enjoy making videos\nand growing as a content creator; my hope is that this will allow me to elevate my content to new levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd secondly, I am on Patreon because YouTube\u0027s revenue sharing sucks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI love making my videos on YouTube, which I have\nbeen \u003cstrong\u003edoing since 2006\u003c/strong\u003e. Video games are a passion and hobby of mine, but they\nare not my only hobby. I specifically have an affinity for classic video games\nmore than I do most current gen ones. \u00a0Ideally, I would like to do both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon\nseems to be an option for those who enjoy seeing great content to help creators\nif they feel like doing so. You can pledge $1 (or any amount) each month for\nhowever long you desire, as sort of a \"tip\" for me producing the\ncontent I create. This website lets the audience support the channels they\nenjoy. Subscriptions can be edited or cancelled at any time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, umm why are you doing\nthis?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI can\u2019t\nspeak for other content creators you might enjoy.  The one thing that my \u003cstrong\u003ePatrons \u003c/strong\u003ehere might be\nable to help me with is \u003cem\u003etime\u003c/em\u003e. If you haven\u2019t created a well-scripted, filmed,\nand edited video then you might not realize how much time and energy need to be\nput into it. When YouTube took off, I chose to work in normal jobs and stick\nwith a company that eventually laid me off. \u00a0I have been playing catch up with expenses and debt ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs it\nis now, I do not do this as any source of income. In fact, I have been a\n\u003cstrong\u003epartner with YouTube since 2008\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and I have been with Machinima since 2012. I do not get enough views to earn revenue beyond 5.00-10.00 USD every other month. Right now I am with Maker Gen and, they are not much better than Machinima lol.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBut\nan even bigger reason is that I just really love creating and I have\naspirations larger than most others. This isn\u2019t just about me; it\u2019s about many\nother creative people as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u2019s\nnot that I mind doing \u201cPewDiePie\u201d style Let\u2019s Plays. Hell, I started those in\n2007 with Power Blade 2. In an emo moment, I deleted them from my account for\nfear people see me as a terrible LP channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019d\nprefer to have a second channel dedicated to those. I just find them low on a\ncreative totem pole \u2013 right below being a mime. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\nbottom line is, if you want to know the kind of content I want to create, look\nat my video gamer reviews and parodies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hx4xULhY4n0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eI am a firm believer in paying it forward and pushing up people. If I am successful, there will be a lot of talk of supporting other people who I believe in as well. I will never forget/ignore others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to further raise awareness about animal shelters. I love animals and would be there to show others what need there is out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a fairly big dream about being able to be able to petition/lobby with the government for changes in credit card laws. Yes, that is a fairly monumental task and I wouldn\u0027t even be able to start without a lot of help. But when I do, I will document it all the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBottom line\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you enjoy the reviews I have made and you\u0027d like to see more work in that vein continue and improve with a \u00a0better upload schedule, then please consider becoming a Patron. I see great things in the future, and I\u0027d like you to be a part of all of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support, whether or not you decide to pledge anything. What honestly keeps me motivated are the great messages I receive from fans. I appreciate you watching more than you can know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
