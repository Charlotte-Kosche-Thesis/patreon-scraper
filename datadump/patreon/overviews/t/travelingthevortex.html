    "summary": "Traveling The Vortex is a midwest based Doctor Who podcast covering all things Whovian. \u00a0What started as a lark for three friends (and fans) has turned into a mammoth undertaking. \u00a0We have produced a show about Doctor Who (along with a lot of tangental material) every week for the last five years, and have over 300 episodes to date. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut our success comes with a price, as our labor of love has outgrown our friendly fan run server. \u00a0As our constant listeners may have noticed, our feed has crashed multiple times this month, just from data streaming caps and website traffic. \u00a0We must move our expanding library and back catalogue to a new, professional server space. \u00a0This will result in fewer interruptions on our website, and more availability of our episodes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this comes with a price, and quite simply it\u0027s more than three midwestern fan boys can afford. \u00a0If you can, we would appreciate your support, (donations are of course, welcome). \u00a0Your support will allow us to continue producing Traveling The Vortex, by\u00a0funding new content, interviews, equipment and most importantly, securing website domain and server space for our growing library of shows to prevent outages. \u00a0We also have plans for special rewards for supporters. \u00a0We don\u0027t fully know what they\u0027ll entail yet, but we\u0027re working on them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you listen to our show you know that the Traveling The Vortex community is not just friends and fans, we consider you all part of our extended family. \u00a0As always, we remain grateful for your patronage, and thank you for listening to us!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Traveling The Vortex is the brainchild of life long Doctor Who fan Glenn Bartlett, who invited friend Shaun Collins along for the ride. The premise was simple: What if these two friends could introduce a third to the Doctor for the first time, and document those experiences via a podcast, allowing the rest of fandom a chance to view their beloved WHO through a fresh set of eyes? The two quickly set out to find an unwitting victim for their mad experiment, not unlike Dr. Frankenstein and Igor trolling the cemeteries for fresh meat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey found Keith Miles, sci-fi fan, friend and time travel nut, who had more than a passing interest in Doctor Who, but had never watched. Fiendishly laughing, they strapped the \u201cClockwork Orange\u201d headgear on the newbie, and subjected him to Matt Smith.\u003cbr\u003eNot surprisingly, Keith came back for more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over 330 episodes over the last six years, they \u201ctravel the vortex\u201d making different stops with different Doctors, frequently tangenting across the rest of fandom along the way. They also host a weekly \u201ctweet-a-long\u201d to a different Doctor Who episode every Friday at midnight, CST called \u201cFriday Night Who\u201d, and encourage folks to join in. The podcast can be found on \u003ca href=\"http://www.travelingthevortex.com/\"\u003ewww.travelingthevortex.com\u003c/a\u003e and iTunes.\u003cbr\u003e",
