    "summary": "Who is this guy?\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a writer, theater maker, educator and podcaster. I co-founded the all-ages production company Comedy Suitcase and was named an Artist of the Year by City Pages in 2012. I was the Artist in Residence at the Walker Art Center from September 2014 until February 2015. I spent three years making the award winning Pratfalls of Parenting podcast, which featured conversations with rappers, chefs, painters, comedians, weirdos and artists of all kinds.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thatlevi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThatLevi.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is he making?\u003cbr\u003eI make a lot of things, but this patreon is largely to support the making of podcasts. I launched a new show in December 2016 called Not About You that explores identity and understanding lived experiences outside my own. Supporting my work means not just more of this show but more work focused on creative combinations of art, creativity, comedy and social justice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy a patreon page?\u003cbr\u003eI never want to stop making podcasts. I never want to stop asking creative people how and why they do the things they do. With your support, I can make more episodes and make them even better than they are now. Also, I\u0027ve got a daughter and maybe if I could tell her a bunch of people are supporting my podcast here, she\u0027ll stop asking how I\u0027m going to pay for her college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does it mean to Levi if people support his work?\u003cbr\u003eI want to spend as much time as possible getting excited about people and ideas and sharing that excitement with the rest of the world. Your support makes that possible and makes me feel like that\u0027s a valid pursuit. So, I guess it means validation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
