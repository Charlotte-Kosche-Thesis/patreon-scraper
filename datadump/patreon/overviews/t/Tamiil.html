If you like what I\u0027m offering on my channel and have some coin to spare to support my quest of making as many game movies as possible, then please go ahead - I accept your reward. :) I will keep doing my best with the loot I have, but know that even a tiny contribution from you will go a long way in helping me level up my channel. Sharing the wonderful stories that games can tell is my passion, but passion alone can only take you so far. There\u0027s always the next big thing around the corner be it a new game, a shiny new gaming system or a story driven game that\u0027s exclusive to that new hardware. They are all protected by that evil nemesis called \"Money\". With your support we can defeat that boss though and bask in the glory of great stories. So come and become known throughout the land as the savior of game movies. :)"
