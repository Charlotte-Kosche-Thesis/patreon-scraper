    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s going on you guys? My name is Ty Notts.\u003c/strong\u003e I create a weekly YouTube Series in which I cover a variety of topics; typically creepy, unexplained, or conspiracy oriented.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince early 2016, I\u0027ve been uploading videos to the Ty Notts Channel. I previously was narrating Creepypasta stories, but quickly shifted gears to the more news-related content that so many of us enjoy. I\u0027m just your average 20-something guy from the south-west who takes pride in the content I create for you guys, and am always striving to release the best possible videos that I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut now, I\u0027m asking for your assistance in taking the channel to the next level.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat would I use your investment for?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Increasing Production Quality of the Channel.\u003c/strong\u003e This includes expensive subscriptions to stock video and image services, as well as purchasing and maintaining equipment and software that is required to keep the channel going.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Creating a Merch Store. \u003c/strong\u003eWhile I\u0027m predominately a YouTuber, I would also like to launch a merch/clothing store online to bring you guys some really great duds - this would include video-related shirts, hats, stickers, and other fashion paraphernalia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Allow Me to Become Independent, \u003c/strong\u003ededicating more time to the channel. I\u0027m sure it goes without saying that the majority of my content is, according to YouTube, \"not advertiser friendly\". This means that I make virtually nothing from the ads you see on my videos (if you see any ads at all). My main goal is to allow this channel to become my full-time job, as I am currently having to work on the side to make ends meet. Though, should enough of you guys find my channel interesting enough to invest in, I would be able to become independent and spend more in creating more videos for you guys.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that many of you guys are not able to contribute to the show financially, and that\u0027s totally understandable - just the fact that you guys watch my content is truly incredible, and I cannot express my gratitude enough. Though, those of you who are financially able, can help make this channel so much more than it currently is, and allow it to be sustainable for the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou guys are truly the highlight of my week, and I find immense joy in creating videos for you, and I truly hope that I can continue to do so for a very long time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
