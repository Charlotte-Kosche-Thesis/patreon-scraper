Through our featured interviews and live performances, we dig into the heart of local music throughout the Midwest and beyond, uncovering what makes your art and music communities come to life. This podcast is a celebration of art and the unique relationships that music fosters as it draws individuals from different worlds into a space where we all can feel a little more mighty. This production is also here as a resource to connect you to your local music community and to connect your local community to its rich and ever-changing neighbors around the Midwest.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Local Glow is brand new. Created by head producer and local musician Tariq Shihadah, the podcast started as a casual effort to break the fourth wall that has seemed to grow between local musicians and the disengaged and dwindling crowds of show-goers and listeners across the Midwest. It seems that as our culture has gone digital and as socialization has turned from face-to-face to Facebook, local music has lost some of its magic. The hope behind the creation of The Local Glow is to offer listeners a chance to bridge the gap and to experience the magic of a strong, vibrant, safe, and thriving local music scene. We hope to connect you to our featured musicians, community organizers, and local professionals, and to connect them to their hard-working and innovative peers across the region.\n\u003ca href=\"http://thelocalglow.libsyn.com/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eListen here!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSeason 1\u003c/h4\u003e\nIn the first season of The Local Glow, we\u0027ll be covering a wide range of topics and will be speaking with several talented, inspired, and powerful locals from around the region.
