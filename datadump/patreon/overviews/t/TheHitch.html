The Hitch is a non-partisan site and we do our best to represent a wide diversity of thought on a number of different topics. The Hitch is not a site for political gossip; we strive to tackle complex, complicated issues in a way that augments knowledge, understanding, and furthers the debate. It has been said that in order to get the real news and the important stories, one has to work hard to find them. Our mission is to deliver those stories to you here, at the Hitch.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nSite Founder/Editors note\u003c/strong\u003e: When I started The Hitch, it was never with the aim of making money. For a long time I was not happy with much of the political reporting that I was seeing on the internet and I wanted to try and change that. And now, in the era of \"Fake News\" I believe that good political reporting is more critical than ever. The goal has always been to produce academic, empirical, scholarly analysis that both gives readers the facts and our own thoughts on what the information could mean. \u00a0At this point we have a strong group of young writers, all of whom are eager to put out the best content possible. My goal is to try and help the site, as well as them, grow. With small donations, I believe we can have a positive impact on political discourse and foster positive debate that helps improve understanding. Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJoshua Turner"
