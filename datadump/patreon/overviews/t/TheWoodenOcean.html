    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you exactly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Leif Ian Anderson. I\"m a video game designer who stocks shelves half the time and programs half of the other. I live in South West Florida and have been making and enjoying video games my entire life. (although it wasn\u0027t until recently did I take the making part seriously)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nContinue.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n5 years ago when I was an Army Medic stationed in Korea, I downloaded the newest version of RPG Maker and slowly began work on what would one day become the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://lianderson.itch.io/wooden-ocean\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Wooden Ocean\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0 a large open dungeon crawler focused on combat, exploration, and a unique world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRPG Maker? Really? Not that program again.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYeah, I get it. RPG Maker is a widely hated and looked down upon program, and in some ways, I fully understand. There are many games that have given it a bad name. Many. But, it is not the tools that make the art, but instead the artist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe tools things huh? You say that like you\u0027re the first one to say it. Look, how do I know this game of yours doesn\u0027t just suck? In fact, what is it even about?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, without giving away any spoilers, The Wooden Ocean is about the edge of the world and you going on a quest to find someone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for it not sucking, there is a free version on the store page. The free version is the full game minus half of the side areas and 2 of the difficulties.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so how long will the game be?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s currently at 40+ hours, and to be honest, the game is already done.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWait, what? It\u0027s already done?! If it\u0027s already done, then why do you have a Patreon?!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause I want to make this game gigantic through free monthly and seasonal updates. (and yes, you\u0027ll be able to pick up where you left off)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs the game free?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNo, it\u0027s $12, but those ever expanding updates are free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis sounds like Steam Early Access.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty much, hence why it\u0027s there as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, how long do you plan on updating this game?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf I can, at least 10 years.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e10 years?? You really plan on updating this game for free for 10 years??? You\u0027re crazy. Naive more like it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI know that\u0027s hard to believe, and I don\u0027t expect you to believe me at this point. But that is what I plan on doing, and the only thing that can stop me is financial needs, hence this Patreon and the usual 10$ pricetag.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, it\u0027s starting to make sense now. It\u0027s weird, but it\u0027s starting to make sense. You\u0027re basically creating free DLC for years to come. In that case, what have you done so far?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eSince it\u0027s original release in May, The Wooden Ocean has expanded by over 100% with it\u0027s numerous patches and updates. In fact, here is a general history of what has been done and what will be done later this year. (some names are subject to change)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2016\u003cbr\u003e\nMay - Free Release\u003cbr\u003e\nJun - Commercial Release\u003cbr\u003e\nSep - Poetry of Silver\u003cbr\u003e\nOct - Divine Tower\u003cbr\u003e\nNov - v1.3.1\u003cbr\u003e\nDec - Island of Sand\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n2017\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nJan - Poetry of Bronze\u003cbr\u003e\nFeb - v1.5.1\u003cbr\u003e\nMar - Ghost Road\u003cbr\u003e\nApr - Tower of Reason\u003cbr\u003eJun - Year 2\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSep - Symphony of Carbon\u003cbr\u003eDec - Wooden Road\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2018\u003cbr\u003eMar - Dead Candy\u003cbr\u003eJun - Year 3 (in progress)\u003cbr\u003eSep - Lazik City\u003cbr\u003eDec - Frozen Ocean\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itch.io/t/40167/patch-notes\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePatch Notes\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSome of those names make no sense. Like, what the hell is a Poetry of Silver or a Symphony of Carbon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eYou\u0027ll have to play to find out.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFair enough. One last question, is this game on Steam? And if not, why not?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYes, Wooden Ocean is on Steam as Early Access.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so uhhhhhh... is that it? I got other Patreons to visit.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eJust, donate what you can, and... any will do. I don\u0027t make much money nor do I spend much money, so those goals to your left are honest and accurate milestones. If you\u0027re hesitant on trusting me, then just come back in a few months or follow me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/TheWoodenOcean\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e. I will prove myself in time through the updates, because actions speak louder than words.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWell, I hope your project does well. Good luck with the game.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThank you, and I hope you found this conversation entertaining.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
