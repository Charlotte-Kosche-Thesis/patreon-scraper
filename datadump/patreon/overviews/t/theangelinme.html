So far I have no real credibility to that point. You\u0027ve never played one of my games. You\u0027ve never seen me finish any of them. You might have heard my music at some time or another, but let\u0027s be honesty - \u003cem\u003eit wasn\u0027t that good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThen why am I here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have to thank you for stopping by nonetheless. I\u0027m currently undertaking a huge project I\u0027ve currently called \"Aldiir\", named after the location it\u0027s set in. Aldiir is a large game made in RPG Maker MV, but don\u0027t let that put you off. So far I have a nice little demo for you all to try so you can see that I\u0027m more than just another wannabe game dev.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal I have with Aldiir is this:\u003cbr\u003eI want to make a game where you can do anything. I\u0027m fed up with games that shoehorn you into a predetermined character and make you follow a certain plot. For some games this can work, but I need something that let me be exactly who I wanted to be.\u003cbr\u003eAldiir, though it will have at the very least one main story, will be mostly a sandbox adventure. Make your own friends, kill the good king, or even take a slime as a pet. I know I will do all three.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does Patreon have to do with it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m currently balancing a near full-time job, full-time study and my spare time is spent making this. A steady stream of income means that I can loosen up on my hours so that I can spend more time making this game and less on other stuff. Aldiir can be my income. Easy. Well not easy per se, but I can focus on less things meaning Aldiir gets made faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I play it now?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m a one-man team. I\u0027ll be doing all the art, music, scripting/eventing/coding, writing and so forth. So it\u0027ll be a while before the full game is complete. I do not expect it to be finished in 2018. Remember, I do this in my spare time with a hope I can do it more.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, once you\u0027re a patron - \u003cem\u003eand that\u0027s a monthly donation \u003c/em\u003e- you\u0027ll have access to \"in-progress\" builds (I think people call those Alphas) and you\u0027ll have the opportunity to help me find all the bugs and issues. I expect to have a new build up every fortnight or month, depending on the extent of the build. Builds will typically be circulating faster in the early months and slow down as it takes longer to add new things (rewriting all the music, redoing all the art, adding new story, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, you can play the first build right here: ---INSERT LINK---\u003cbr\u003eIt focuses on the largest town in the world and the surrounding island. It offers opportunity to explore the core shops, purchase property, interact with NPCs, and partake in a few small side-quests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is a very long post...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I know. I\u0027ll finish up.\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether you pledge to help me produce this game, I want to thank you for checking out the page and hopefully playing my short terrible demo.\u003cbr\u003eIf you have pledged, I appreciate the support and I hope the game will become more than what you expected it to be!\u003cbr\u003e"
