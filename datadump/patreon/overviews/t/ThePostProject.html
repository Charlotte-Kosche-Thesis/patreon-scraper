    "summary": "It all started with a rare instrument. One so unique that it could change the day of any passing human simply by being in its presence. Playing this instrument led to a wonderful observation: kids are really inspired by the sound of Singing Steel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to sculpt Hang-like sound sculptures and give them away to children. \u00a0I already have the experience and skills required to make them, but lack the financial funding needed to begin production.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u0027m Ryan Post and I\u0027m... well... a lot of things. But right now, I\u0027m here, inside of this screen, on some piece of technology, sharing with you this Dream of mine and offering you to be a part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis seed was planted a long time ago, and now I need your help to move onto the next part of the process.  For understandings sake, allow me to plug you into where I came from and where I am now. Thank you in advance for caring about my work. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a long drive ahead, we left Hanover Pennsylvania, off to Dante\u0027s Bar in Frostburg, Maryland. \u00a0I played percussion for a band called Ol Cabbage, and we were headed to perform a show there. \u00a0It was a good thing that the responsible ones were behind the wheel. We arrived alive! \u00a0On the drive my friend\u00a0Nick showed a video to me on his phone of Daniel Waples playing the Hang. \u00a0It was incredible. \u00a0The sounds that came from this thing and the performance were just whoa! \u00a0So I did what most people do next. \u00a0I asked, \"Where can we get one?\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFelix Rohner and Sabina Sch\u00e4rer invented the Hang and are founders of the company called PanART which manufactures them. \u00a0At the time that we watched this video, noone else in the world made them. \u00a0Nick responded with \u00a0a \"yeeeeaaaah man, so you have to write a letter to them and if they choose you from thousands then you might get to lease one for like $5000\". \u00a0And he was basically right about all of it. \u00a0Ugh! \u00a0This news was so depressing that it changed my life forever. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNext came the\u00a0strongest Magic that the Universe has ever shown me. \u00a0Its root were formed in this very moment. \u00a0The moment where I planted a seed that would later prove to me that we as humans manifest our own realities. \u00a0The Moment that changed my life. \u00a0I said to Nick, \"You watch, I am going to move to Boulder Colorado and someone will give me one of those drums\". \u00a0To this day we both can hardly believe it, but with the help of many angels along the way, that is exactly what happened. Terratonz gifted me a TerraPan. I can\u0027t wait to tell you about how it happened!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere is much more on this topic that I will be sharing over the next month about my past, but for now I would like to jump forward to where we are today and explain exactly how you can help!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been living houseless for the past three years, and I chose this.  I\u0027m so grateful for this experience. \u00a0It showed me how we really do manifest our own realities.  Simple means will come to you if you are really in need, but the magic is that more complex things are no different. Sometimes they just simply seem harder to believe in. \u00a0Living a transient life and observing this magic daily totally changes the way that one looks at basic needs and how one can manifest them. \u00a0What a blessed journey. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust having a TerraPan from TerraTonz in my life made being houseless much less of a struggle. \u00a0In fact, often I was able to give away half of my earnings because of the abundance that it brought. \u00a0What a true blessing to share the sounds of singing steel with the unknowingly curious ear! \u00a0It was always an honor to offer supplies to those in need. \u00a0The TerraPan that I play was a gift from TerraTonz in exchange for some of the work that I did with them. \u00a0One day I will return it or pay it forward. I bring this up in particular to share with you because after thousands of hours of playing and seeing the thousands of smiles that it has created, the odd thing is that I have never owned one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have shared some time building these Hang-like Instruments with brilliant teachers, and only because of being in their presence do I possess the skills necessary to sculpt them.  But REALLY guys, have you ever tried to get one?!!?  It\u0027s almost impossible right now for an adult, let alone a child, to get the experience of playing this instrument.  They are seemingly hard to make and few people have the tools. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thepostprojectblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/14440775_1281108821921689_4326261670111935369_n.jpg?w=900\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly believe that apprenticeship is the best way to learn how to approach any trade. Currently, \u00a0I am apprenticing under a seasoned steel drum maker, Michael Perkins, while creating Mini Steel Pans to sharpen my tuning skills for the first Hang-Like instruments that I plan to begin producing in January. \u00a0The above picture is of my first Mini Steel Pan EVER! \u00a0It tuned nicely, and that accomplishment felt pretty impressive considering that I had never used a punch before. \u00a0I believe in the structure and respect behind the student/teacher approach because it keeps us humble. \u00a0It is an honor to learn from Michael Perkins. \u00a0I am also grateful that he has such a passionate interest in the Hang. \u00a0We will be working together on all Hang-like projects in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThroughout this Journey I\u00a0will be offering insights from friends who are great teachers that will aid the truths about sculpting the instrument. \u00a0With a lot of hard work and a bit of a musicians ear, anyone can learn to sculpt them too if disciplined enough to take on the journey. \u00a0In the future, I will offer apprenticeship programs to others once we become stable in our production at our new location. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOnce production begins and after the initial 40 First Generation Instruments, I will give away 30% of all instruments produced to spaces/organizations that can facilitate their experience with kids. \u00a0\u00a0The end goal is to have\u00a0these instruments created partially through our apprentice program. \u00a0Final tuning will be finished by the most eager of apprentices and reviewed by me. \u00a0One step at a time though right? \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomething inside of me truly believes Patreon Peeps will understand the financial challenges that I face which keeps me from getting started and that we could work it out together with help from each other. \u00a0I really came from houseless to a big plan, and I know it is going to manifest; it\u0027s the transition that we all need a little help with. \u00a0I am committed to giving you my all, and I value your opinions on how to approach the future. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHere is what I offer to offer you in this moment in exchange for your subscription:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am a performer. \u00a0The entertainer in my veins has a hard time silencing itself. \u00a0This is a blessing! \u00a0I am honored to have created some of the most beautiful music with friends that I have met along the way.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T0nnk1JDt7Y?rel=0\u0026amp;controls=0\u0026amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrett Randell and I met busking in Colorado, and we instantly became great friends. The chapel in the video is where I recorded my first album, A Buskers Rough Draft. \u00a0It only took a short bit of time to fall in love with the room\u0027s acoustic qualities. \u00a0I found it necessary to do a series with Ian Glass Media and Mineral Sound called the Chapel Sessions. \u00a0This Series brought my friends into the Chapel to perform their original Music with in the beauty of its natural reverb. \u00a0With your help we can create more of these experiences!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is another Chapel Session that I could not resist recording. \u00a0I first heard Colin Robinson perform his Song \"Up in the Air\" at his show at The Laughing Goat, located in Boulder Colorado. \u00a0 He writes such real lyrics. His voice is direct and the Harmonies in this space were so very special that night. \u00a0So many things lead to us becoming great friends, but his music moves me. I will be sharing more of The Chapel Sessions with you as we get to know each other a bit more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1iluKWPQOPY?rel=0\u0026amp;controls=0\u0026amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I produce albums for other Street Performers in the Chapel. \u00a0While Street Performing, I quickly noticed how many more $10 exchanges I received for my album rather than $1 tips, and I instantly wanted to offer that to my friends! \u00a0It is an honor to share music on any public street, but you can feel unappreciated very quickly if you are not careful. \u00a0Having an Album that you are proud of, that is ready for instant purchase, is the key to making a living as a Street Performer. \u00a0Here is my newest release! \u00a0I was honored to create this experience for my best friend, The Didgeridude. \u00a0Do you enjoy what you are hearing? \u00a0Your monthly subscription will help me do this more often! I will be releasing one more album for a street performer this month. \u00a0It is for fellow Hang performers Manuel and Ewok, you\u0027ll see it first on my feed. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFood Before Flowers by The Didgeridude at \u003ca href=\"http://thedidgeridude.bandcamp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://thedidgeridude.bandcamp.com\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eA Buskers Rough Draft by The Post Project at \u003ca href=\"http://thepostproject,bandcamp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://thepostproject,bandcamp.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother big project is coming up and by subscribing you will have full access to all of my material as well as behind the scenes footage of this journey. \u00a0I start recording during the month of February in Joshua Tree California. \u00a0I will be there with many brilliant souls throughout the next year creating a Chakra Exploration that predates stringed instruments.  That one will be wild! \u00a0 We plan to use grunts, sticks, didgeridoo, drum, female and male vocals. \u00a0The goal is to make the energy move slowly up your body from the start of the album to the finish. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all performed together last year at the Bhakti Fest with Amritakripa in Joshua Tree California.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CldPYerRC7w?rel=0\u0026amp;controls=0\u0026amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently sculpting didgeridoos while I transform myself into the Hang Hammerer of my future. There is a real connection that I have made with the oldest and the newest instruments in existence, and for both I am grateful. \u00a0WaterWood Didge Design is a collective of Artisans who use a primitive method to sculpt Didgeridoos. \u00a0We have created a platform that we hope the parent/child combination might take on which consists of walking into the woods to harvest a dead Dry Log that becomes a Didgeridoo. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be releasing a Video with full audio to the feed this month showing Adahm and I finding Coexistence. \u00a0It is my favorite Produced piece of content yet, showing you our journey into the woods near Boulder, Colorado where we harvest Juniper for our future sculptures. \u00a0This Video really delivers Adahm\u0027s personality and intention to the World, and in doing so, it made me come the realization that he and I have the same goal: Getting acoustic instruments into the hands of children. \u00a0My Patreons will see this amazing video first, and before Christmas Day!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow is one of the many videos showing where we are at in the process with our \u0027How-To\u0027 section of WaterWood Didge Design. \u00a0Your monthly subscription will help us add commentary to these DIY(Do It Yourself) videos. \u00a0We love our method of creating a Didgeridoo on-site with hand tools and would love to see others try! \u00a0You can see the Hang/Didgeridoo Combo working together, Right? :) \u00a0Stay tuned and I\u0027ll show ya! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UnpTm1VVvw?rel=0\u0026amp;controls=0\u0026amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOh, and I have saved the best for last!
