    "summary": "Hello I am Corey Messer or better known by my pen name as TiredOrangeCat. In 2006 I started a web graphic novel called Plush and Blood: The Unstuffed. \u003cstrong\u003eThe story revolved around the fall of a utopian society run by a subtle totalitarian government in a world populated entirely by stuffed animals.\u003c/strong\u003e Unlike most web comics out there, this story had an ending planned well in advance. \u00a0This made it unique in that it was an actual story, complete with plot/character arcs that ended and not something that was wrung to death in an effort to make it last forever. \u00a0The Unstuffed ran for four years, updating twice a week, totaling\u00a0\u003cem\u003e450\u00a0\u003c/em\u003epages. The comic started with a completed script and a simple style. \u00a0The style took on a life of its own and evolved into a sophisticated and consistent look. \u00a0I wrote, drew, colored, and maintained the comic\u0027s website and its sister forum. During those four years life happens with its ups and downs, yet\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI never missed an update\u003c/strong\u003e. I found a loyal and excited fan base that turned into a giant family of sorts. The fans were very excited and always there on the forum where they discussed the comic in detail with each other. \u00a0They would interpolate, and expand on ideas that I had only hinted at, often in ways I had not thought of. \u00a0They were always engaged and wondering what would happen next. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI kept them on their toes for the entire four year run and cemented a dedicated fan base.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0They waited patiently for an entire year as I wrote the second story in the Plush and Blood universe titled, Memory\u0027s Threads. \u00a0The script itself is\u00a0\u003cem\u003e440\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0pages long and will be an estimated\u00a0\u003cem\u003e1200\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0comic pages in length.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://plushandblood.com/Images/Gallery/Memory\u0027s_Threads_Preview_Collage_1_600.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eMemory\u0027s Threads has now been running since June 1st 2012. \u00a0With two years and change under its belt I have already posted over 400 pages with the same dedication seen with the Unstuffed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eFor those that have not read Plush and Blood: The Unstuffed, they will not be left out. \u00a0Memory\u0027s Threads works in the basic details needed to follow along. \u00a0This allows for a much greater audience and also pulls this new audience into reading The Unstuffed. \u00a0For those that have read The Unstuffed this will be a search for answers and hidden meanings. \u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThey will be enthralled and submerged in its depths.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://plushandblood.com/Images/Gallery/Memory\u0027s_Threads_Preview_Collage_2_600.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe plot for Plush and Blood: Memory\u0027s Threads follows Katt (one of the main protagonists of The Unstuffed) as she journeys through the cataclysmic aftermath of The Unstuffed. \u00a0The premise revolves around\u00a0second chances and what makes us, us. The world has been all but devastated, laid flat by the events of The Unstuffed. With no memories and no world to ask who she was, Katt searches for answers in a society trying to pull itself back together. \u00a0Memory\u0027s Threads explores the questions,\u003cem\u003e\u00a0Is it our past experience that makes up who we are? \u00a0Is it what we do here and now that makes up who we are? \u00a0Is it our intentions? \u00a0Who are we?\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 While the people struggle to bring civilization back to a land wrecked by cataclysm the question of God arises. \u00a0 It is a brutal, dark, philosophical journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am chasing my dream right now.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I have a\u00a0\u003cem\u003ethird story penned\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0after Memory\u0027s Threads titled Patchwork Lives. \u00a0It will deal with the rise of the Plush and what they have learned from their past. \u00a0I love to write and tell a story that engages and entertains people. \u00a0\u003cem\u003eUnique characters and original plots\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0have had my readers knocking at my door asking for more. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eEntertainment is not the only goal\u003c/strong\u003e, I want to make people think about the world around them. \u00a0I try to bring points across that make them stop and look at reality and ask why. \u00a0I believe we have lost a lot of the conceptual nature of story to the glitz and glam. \u00a0It is time to bring it back. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eMy dream is in demand\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and I would like to supply everyone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://plushandblood.com/Images/Gallery/Memory\u0027s_Threads_Preview_Collage_3_600.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI produce this comic in free time I have between my day job, my family, and my responsibilities.
