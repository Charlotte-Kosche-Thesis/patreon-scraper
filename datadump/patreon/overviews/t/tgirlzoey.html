    "summary": "Hi! My Name is Zoey, and I am a 24 transgender woman who would like to become self sufficient for the first time in my life. Sense the age of 16, when I was still living in Alabama, I have been living openly as a woman. Thing\u0027s were very rough for me back then but I kept going and trying to be myself despite the abuse I received from others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the age of 19 I started hormone replacement therapy and began moving around the country to live with different men who were willing to support me, however many of these relationships turned out to be incredibly abusive. Eventually, at the age of 22 I suffered from a psychotic breakdown that completely changed who I was. I became a hateful, horrible monster. I detransitioned and began to involve myself with very nasty people and political ideologies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2 months ago I realized what I had become, and that the reason I was so hateful was because I was denying myself who I was, as I had become ashamed of who I was due to abuse. Now I am trying to rebuild my life, and get to a point where I can function independently and create content that can help people who are going through the same things that I have been through, in what ever way I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current living situation is living in a 5x5 closet in a 1 bedroom apartment with 2 other people living in the house. It\u0027s not ideal but I\u0027m trying my best to keep positive. I am actively seeking employment every day, but it can be difficult as a trans woman to find stable employment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything that you can spare to help me so that I can pay for my medical care, food, and rent would earn you my eternal gratitude, and once I am back on my feet I would be more than happy to start providing any desired content to my donors that is within reason, including pictures suited to your request, advice for people considering transitioning or detransitioning, or really anything else under the sun within reason. I\u0027m also excited to get back to streaming and camming as soon as I have a place of my own to live, and am confident enough that my body and personality would be pleasing again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you don\u0027t decide to donate, thank you for taking the time to read this. I have a hard time accepting charity from people, I was raised to work for everything I have, but when you can\u0027t find work it\u0027s hard to surivive.\u003cbr\u003e"
