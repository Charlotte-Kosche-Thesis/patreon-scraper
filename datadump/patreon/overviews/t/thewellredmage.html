I\u0027ve loved the act of \u003cstrong\u003ecreating\u003c/strong\u003e since I was a child drawing my own characters and writing up their fiction. Now, I\u0027m combining two things I love, writing and video games, in order to change the face of journalism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn February 2016, we launched\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thewellredmage.wordpress.com\"\u003ethewellredmage.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0as a small group of friends. Since then, our site has \u003cstrong\u003egrown\u003c/strong\u003e from less than a handful of writers to a host of contributors whose talent we\u0027re happy to showcase. We\u0027ve featured hundreds of\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003elong-form\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eanalytical\u003c/strong\u003e reviews on games, film, television, and literature spanning from the 1930\u0027s to the present day.
