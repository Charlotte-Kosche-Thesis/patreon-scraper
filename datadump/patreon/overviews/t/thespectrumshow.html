    "summary": "The\nSpectrum Show is a YouTube channel that concentrates, as its name suggests, on\nthe Sinclair ZX Spectrum. It has been running since 2014 and outputs a 30\nminute show every month with a wide range of content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThere is the news as it\nhappened at the time, moving month by month from 1983 onwards and special\nfeatures like our arcade clone shootouts, and new game releases.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI review original hardware for\nthe Spectrum, testing it out and giving my opinions. This is real hardware that\nI own, and not taken from magazines or other sources. In fact, I own most of\nthe games reviewed too, showing inlays and outlining the plot or game idea\nbefore giving it a full review.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe show has changes only\nslightly over the years it has been running with different features, like\nType-In-Corner - where I show type-in games not seen for over 30 years, or\nLet\u0027s Talk About... where I chat with another enthusiast about various aspects\nof the Spectrum, being swapped in ad out to keep things fresh.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy YouTube channel does not\nhave adverts and I have made no money from it, but with people asking about how\nthey can help, I decided to setup this Patreon account.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is not a way to pay for my\ncontent, the shows will always be free, and advert free to watch on YouTube. Instead\nthis is a way of showing your gratitude and supporting my work. A way of saying\nthank you, and anything you pledge, no matter how small, I will be thrilled to\nreceive.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAny money will be used to\nrepair purchased hardware for the show, so it can be included in the reviews,\nto pay travel expenses to shows so I can include reports, and to purchase new\nhardware for reviews.\u003cbr\u003e"
