Or:\u003cem\u003e I\u0027m a scholar who studies the history of comparative media and the stories we tell about it going back forever\u003c/em\u003e.

I don\u0027t have a university job like I used to at Penn. I don\u0027t have a regular gig at a fancy magazine like Wired or The Verge (or Newsweek or National Geographic or The Atlantic or the few dozen other places I\u0027ve written). I don\u0027t even have a sweet collective blog like Snarkmarket or The Message to call home.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEven when I did have a home, my best, most popular pieces were all misfit hybrids that were almost impossible to pitch and I was lucky to run.

A rogue writer trying to put things together again and figure them out. I\u0027m using all the tools I can find to do it: anything I can learn, anything I can leverage.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI can\u0027t even promise you what exactly you\u0027ll get by signing up for this. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eJournalism and opinion about the technology and media industry\u003c/strong\u003e?

None of it will probably happen without your support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s the pitch. With luck, you\u0027ve been moved, delighted, or informed by something I\u0027ve done, whether it was years ago at Wired at Snarkmarket, in between at the Verge, or more recently at Kottke.org, in my freelance days, or on my Twitter feed. You\u0027ve got a pretty good idea of what I can do and how I do it: smart, lucid, weird, sharp, making big connections and looking for bigger implications. On top of that, you get to help keep some adorable redheads in food and clothes. Really a win for everybody.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope you find a level of support with which you\u0027re comfortable. I\u0027ve tried to keep it as simple as possible. I am always interested in suggestions, either for stuff to work on or different rewards I can offer. So if you have either, lay them on me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUntil tomorrow. Remember what Al Swearengen says: most of life is one vile task after another. But it\u0027s just different; that\u0027s all. Everything changes; don\u0027t be afraid."
