To achieve this I am working on many ways to collect this capital (I was working with the same amounts already in the year 2015), but if we exceed the goals mentioned above - this is where your money will go to.\u003cbr\u003eI need to cover my living costs for the duration of the founding process, as well as for the costs to travel to Nepal and for personal insurances (which I don\u0027t have now). Funds, that I don\u0027t need for myself, I spill into my projects to help other people.\u003cbr\u003eMy principles are: independent - transparent - direct - efficient - respectful towards culture and traditions - ideology-free.\u003cbr\u003eI focus on women empowerment and avoiding creating dependencies.\u003cbr\u003eI dedicate a lot of my time to those projects, testing and obtaining my own model for sustainable humanitarian aid avoiding personal advantage. Organisation costs are strictly limited, so I have to use my own savings from regular jobs to be able to dedicate a lot of time to my activities. Don\u0027t call it non-profit, it\u0027s actually neg-profit (for negative profit, but humanitarian impact).\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my activities, this is a cordial invitation to support me as an individual to make it easier for me to do what I am doing. It\u0027s humanitarian work and music.\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s make the world a better place - together.\u003cbr\u003e",
