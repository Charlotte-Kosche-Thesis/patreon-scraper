    "summary": "First and foremost, I am a fantasy artist, specializing in the realms of Faery and magical whimsy. I started making masquerade masks back in late 1999 and have developed artistically over the years since then, by trying out different materials and techniques, from paper mache to air-dry clay, all from my own original designs. Today I create a variety of items from masks and costume accessories, including elaborate floral crowns, fairy wings, and the random Steampunk themed creation, to Fairy and nature themed jewelry, handsculpted clay garden mushrooms, Greenmen, and intricately sculpted Faery Lanterns, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Goals for Patreon:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWith the support of my Patrons, my goal is to continue pushing myself in bettering my art and skills through purchasing better art materials and learning new techniques, while hopefully also paying my bills. I have so many ideas for amazing masks and sculptures and more, but they require better quality materials and time, which is something I can\u0027t afford to put into my art right now. Further, I am trying to create my own business and do my own marketing and branding, as I want to make this a very successful venture, through which I can support myself and my family. I want to eventually start traveling around the US selling my artwork in person as a vendor at Renaissance Festival events and being able to afford better materials and learning more advanced techniques would enable me to afford to put together a great booth for my business venture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very new to Patreon and while I\u0027m doing my best to educate myself about how this whole thing works, through lots of reasearch, please be patient with me. :) \u00a0 \u00a0 If you have ideas on what you think would make for cool Donation Rewards or have some suggestions on how to better do this or that, PLEASE let me know, I am \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e ears!!! \u00a0I want everyone here to be happy, whether you\u0027re supporting my art with $1 or $100 (wow!). :D \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-It\u0027s \u0027your\u0027 money and I\u0027m just in awe that \u0027anyone\u0027 would choose to help me create more and better art! \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a very friendly and approachable person, I love to communicate and enjoy having lengthy convos about all sorts of cool stuff. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBeing that I am so very new to Patreon, as I get this thing figured out and settle in and get comfy, I\u0027ll start changing stuff up, but I\u0027ll keep you all in the \u0027know\u0027 about it before I do it, so no surprises! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, why should you pay me for my art?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will be helping me to be able to afford more and better quality art supplies, which in turn enables me to create more and better quality awesome and beautiful art, for not only yourself, but also everyone else, to enjoy and have the opportunity to purchase, too. You will become a patron of Faery art, \u0027my\u0027 Patron. :D \u00a0 Your contributions will also help to enable me to start creating videos of my art, which will include tutorials and reviews, and well, all of it! My sculpting and painting, my mask-making, what inspires me and sets my imagination on \"\u003cem\u003efire\u003c/em\u003e\", maybe read some of my poetry to you all every now and then, or even sing something, too! \u00a0 \u00a0 I love to play dress-up with my costumes and do some creative fantasy makeups from time to time, as well, so I may occasionally add a video on that, too. Maybe at some point I\u0027ll do a \u0027Get Ready With Me\u0027 video Fairy-style as I get dressed up for a Renaissance Faire. We\u0027ll see! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon works is,\u003c/strong\u003e you find an artist, or several, who really interest and inspire you, and you decide to be their \u0027Patron\u0027, to \"back\" or \"support\" their artistic projects, on a monthly basis for as long as you want, so you can continue to enjoy more of their art. And your support will allow them to have more time and more ability to create \u00a0even more awesome artistic content for you to enjoy on a regular basis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDespite the Donation tiers, you can choose how much, or how little, you want to donate and how often. Everyone is on a budget, afterall. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNow, I have my donation schedule set for every time I create a new project, but YOU have the ability to set a monthly cap. This means that regardless of how many projects I may feverishly put out in the space of one month, you won\u0027t get charged for any more than your set amount. If your set amount is $20 a month, than despite whether I\u0027ve posted 1 or 10 new projects that month, you will still only spend $20. And if I don\u0027t post anything in the space of a month, you still don\u0027t get charged, either. :) \u00a0\u00a0And you can cancel your Patronage at any time you want or need to for any reason.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently have a list of Rewards each Patron will receive per Donation amount tier, but I\u0027m still working on this and those current rewards are subject to change, but don\u0027t worry, they\u0027ll just get \u0027better\u0027. :) \u00a0 If you have any suggestions on what you think are cool and fair rewards, please let me know. \u00a0Remember, I\u0027m new!! :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am currently 33 yrs old, the happy momma of 2 fat little kitties, and in a great relationship with my highschool sweetheart. \u00a0I am an artist, I love trying out a variety of different mediums and am always interested to learn something new. I love to sculpt, paint, sing, and I write poetry from time to time,\u0027 I\u0027m interested in photography, costuming, and have a bit of an obsession with makeup, lol! I love nature and everything to do with Faery and Fantasy. I love to read and am a geek at heart. \u00a0I became hooked on fantasy when my parents started reading fairy tales to myself and my siblings as children and once I could read on my own, I was often found in the library checking out books on Grimm\u0027s fairy tales, world mythologies, and more. \u00a0Later on in my childhood, thanks to my dad, I got hooked on comic books and once I discovered my love, The X-Men, I was a goner. :D \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI was introduced to Renaissance Festivals around the mid 90\u0027s, and after having grown up a Navy brat and lived in Scotland for a few years, I fell in love with the feel and the energy which is encapsulated in that which is the Ren Faire experience. \u00a0I started working my first Renaissance Faire in middle Tn. in 1999, which led me into my mask-making, as it would turn out, which then led me into creating costume accessories. If I couldn\u0027t afford to buy it, then I would try to make it myself. \u00a0And from there, I was bitten by the \u0027arts \u0026amp; crafts\u0027 Fairy and creating beautiful art has become not just a passion of mine, but often a very real \u0027need\u0027.",
