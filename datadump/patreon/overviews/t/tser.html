I\u0027m a queer, autistic, and chronically ill ceramic and traditional media artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy specialty is ceramic pieces with small pets in mind -- reptiles like crested geckos, gargoyle geckos, leachies, leopard geckos, chameleons, bearded dragons, blue tongue skinks, and snakes of all kind! My pieces are also great for rats, hamsters, and other rodents, pet birds, bugs like roaches, hermit crabs, cats, and dogs. I also make dishes for their humans -- such as cups, bowls, and mugs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnimals are my passion, and always have been. I share my life with many pets, including a senior dog, two cats, many geckos, fish, hermit crabs, and an African grey parrot named ChuChu. I am also fond of invertebrates and have over a dozen species of isopod (roly poly) and many exotic roach species!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also draw and paint (particularly watercolor), and my favorite subjects are animals and fantasy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://velvetdragon.com/patreon/2014-04-06niji-dash-demonstrating-using-a-dish.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for your support.\u003c/strong\u003e Your patronage will help keep Velvet Dragon Studios going, and allow me to continue making ceramic pieces for pets and their people.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"

At the end of each season, I always have some pieces that didn\u0027t make the cut. Glaze flaws, cracking, kiln accidents, and just too ugly. I\u0027ll save them up, and three to four times a year, I\u0027ll take videos of destroying them in fun and creative ways! (And if I happen to make it through the term without any duds, I\u0027ll make some pottery bombs just for you guys.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA \u003cstrong\u003e2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e0% discount code\u003c/strong\u003e to use in my shop!
