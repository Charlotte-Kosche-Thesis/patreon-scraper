My focus as a university student was in graphic design, but drawing and mixed media collage were also constant companions. \u003cbr\u003eMy mother once said she never understood why I could draw anything I set my eyes on but instead insisted on working at a computer all day. While I don\u2019t fully agree with that assessment, I do feel that time in the visual disciplines outside of graphic design serve to make one a better-informed designer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eNow Is A Good Time To Focus On Drawing\u003c/h3\u003eMany of you supported me over a year ago when my son\u2019s serious health challenges brought me out of the 9 to 5 into full-time home care for my children. It was during this transition period that I turned back to drawing and painting as an outlet, and as a way to help support my family. As a result, In 2016 I was able to turn a collection of iPad sketches of Santa\u2019s elves into a short run self-published book. In 2017, I drew commissioned pet portraits, illustrated scenes of Memphis landmarks and culture for commercial packaging, and used digital drawing apps to produce screen graphics and logos for various clients. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Fall marks another season of transition as my boys are entering school, and I want to use the time they are in class to expand on some ideas:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRecord some of the everyday uniqueness of Memphis in a sketch book and on my iPad\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTurn those sketches into completed works of art\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate a new series of drawings to be compiled for the Christmas holiday\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreate some Christmas cards to sell in the holidays\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou Can Be A Part Of The Journey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eAnything worth doing has a cost.
