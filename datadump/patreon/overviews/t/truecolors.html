    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Tripp Gustin, creator of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.truecolors-comic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTrue Colors\u003c/a\u003e\u2026 a coming-of-age webcomic about college, friends, family, new experiences, and being true to yourself. Writing and drawing comics has been my passion since I could hold a pencil, so being able to seriously pursue comics and share them with the world has been a dream come true. On top of that, it\u0027s been amazing being able to bring these characters to life and share their story, something that has been over a decade in the making\u2026 and it\u0027s been truly fulfilling seeing other people enjoy getting to know Iro, Kit, Ben, Sonia, and the rest. If you\u0027ve been a reader at any point in time, thank you for everything!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI work a full-time job to pay the bills, as well as spend some time on freelance graphic design to make ends meet, so any time I spend making comics is on top of that\u2026 which usually means spending somewhere between 10-20 hours of my free time a week on comics. I love it, but it is admittedly a lot of work\u2026 almost like a second (third?) job that I don\u0027t get paid for. Sometimes it is difficult to justify spending that much of my time on something that I get nothing tangible out of aside from the comics themselves and your kind words. That\u0027s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.truecolors-comic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTrue Colors\u003c/a\u003e is free to read on the web and always will be, as will any of my works in the foreseeable future. I have always loved the webcomics model, and I love being able to share my work with whoever might want to see it, so I\u0027m not going to start charging for it any time soon. Instead, I will leave that part of it completely up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you have read and enjoyed my comics, I would deeply appreciate your financial support to make this venture more sustainable for me, in the form of monthly donations (or one-time donations, via paypal). Even a little bit would help, although more is always welcome! Just think of it like buying me a cup of coffee once a month\u2026 lord knows I could use the caffeine. In exchange, you will get access to bonus content--monthly blog posts about the characters and my process, concept art, rough versions of comic pages, wallpapers, you being drawn as a background character, and more! If enough people become patrons and I\u0027m able to meet my monthly goals, I will even be able to do things like remove ads, do a monthly drawing livestream, or even increase my update schedule to twice a week! The possibilities are limitless, or at least have a direct correlation to the limitlessness of your generosity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks!\u003cbr\u003e"
