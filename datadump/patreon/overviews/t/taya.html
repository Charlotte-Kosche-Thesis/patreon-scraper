I am passionate about painting, drawing, and photography.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI love to make things!!! There is nothing better than finding a creative way to express emotions and memories. These are some of the things that I like to do: I enjoy travel and street photography and showing my interest and love of the world through imagery.\u00a0I also love to paint and draw. Often times I love to show stories, certain atmospheres, and feelings through my photos and paintings. I love to try out new things, but a lot of the times my work is illustration based or semi-realistic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere I want to go with my Patreon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUltimately, pledges and patrons allow me to focus more on what I love to do and to create more content. In the future, I see myself updating works in progress, showing my processes, giving artist tips, and creating time-lapse art videos. I want to be able to create as much as possible and to share it with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat it means to be a Patron!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are wondering what it means to be a patron and you are interested in pledging, that\u0027s great! Basically, as a patron you can choose the fee that you pay on a monthly basis and you get to see my photographs and illustrations \u003cem\u003ebefore anyone else\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0and sometimes this will be the \u003cstrong\u003eonly \u003c/strong\u003eplace you can have access to certain works or pieces. You can pledge as little as one dollar or as much as you want! This can also be cancelled at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges will help to support me in creating more paintings, paying for materials, and continuing to do what I love. In return you will get to see things that I am working on in the form of sketches, drafts, blogs, and photographs and I even have rewards as a thank you for my patrons! I really value any and all of your support and I\u0027m looking forward to sharing my work with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003eTaya"
