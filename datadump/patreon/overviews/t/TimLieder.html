I have enjoyed my day job which has allowed me to acquire new knowledge, access academic databases, develop my craft by helping amateur writers improve their manuscripts, and listen to the life stories of Upper East Side clients who needed to write emails that told former friends to go away but be nice about it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Need for Patronage\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe problem is that I need more time and resources to work on my fiction. I would also like to publish another Dybbuk Press title within the next year. The last Dybbuk Press title\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/king-david-and-the-spiders-from-mars-sonya-taaffe/1117535875\"\u003eKing David and the Spiders from Mars\u003c/a\u003e did not sell well but it was critically lauded.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a freelancer, I am either busy seeking employment or working 12 hour days in an effort to pay off the back rent and credit card debts that I racked up in my slow periods. That does not leave much time to work on novels and short stories. Nor does it allow me much in the way of resources to attend conventions, promote my work and find new writing markets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in New York City in an apartment with a rent of approximately $1800/month. I am woefully behind on my rent and in the past I have used high APR lenders including Paypal and American Express to stay afloat, but those have been temporary solutions leading to long term problems. Only the grace of New York tenant laws that the fact that I pay more than my neighbors has allowed me to avoid eviction courts. Even when I am busy with work, I am anxious about paying off the debts racked up in the slow months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently the slow times have been growing. The freelance gigs have been drying up as many of my ways of finding clients have proven untenable. Past clients have graduated from college or disappeared. Craigslist has become so cutthroat that my ads for new clients disappear as soon as they are put up. Other venues like fiverr, Backpage, Upworks and Thumbtack have proven untenable for various reasons. Some like Thumbtack charge professionals to give quotes to fake leads. Others are full of jobs that pay very little for weeks of work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn slow months, I ask my friends for to find me work and sell books on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.ebay.com/sch/marlowe1/m.html?item=372188783676\u0026amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMESELX%3AIT\u0026amp;rt=nc\u0026amp;_trksid=p2047675.l2562\"\u003eebay.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I want?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBasically, I want time and a calm mind that will allow me to finish editing dozens of short stories, write new stories and finish my novel length manuscripts. I would also like to receive the time and resources to publish new Dybbuk Press books. I would probably not work on new Biblically themed horror collections, but there are dozens of horror and fantasy themes that can be explored, especially by an independent publishing house with low overhead.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to sleep, eat and exercise on a regular basis without feeling like I\u0027m wasting time that could be better spent seeking employment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will your patronage help?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFirst, it will allow me some security to not worry about the slow months. For $500/month I will be able to breathe easier during the slow months as I will have the ability to pay off whatever credit card advances I need to make during the busy months.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $2000/month, I will be able to retire from all but the better freelance jobs. Even though I will still take manuscript editing gigs and sell books on ebay, I will be able to refuse the less ethical jobs such as term paper writing and college essay exams. With the extra time, I will be able to write more short stories and pitch articles to magazines.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is in it for you?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNot only am I a writer, but I am also an editor, a collector of books and a man who likes to take pictures of his cats. There will be multiple awards for all of my patrons, not the least of which will be monthly cat pictures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eActually the cat pictures will be unlocked for the dollar patrons. Check out the rewards on the side and you will see opportunities to see new work, blog posts, writing life blogs and even free editing and critiques for your work in progress. I also have Dybbuk Press books available for your entertainment and edification.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
