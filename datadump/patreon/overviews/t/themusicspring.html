A conspiracy from within the music industry to demystify how successful music business is being done by everyday artists and music industry professionals all over the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur aim is to act as a disruptor to the way artists \u0026amp; industry professionals think about doing music business in the new music industry! The old label model is long gone and has since been replaced by the new music industry model which focuses on career progression from DIY artist to thriving music entrepreneur.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach week an online panel discussion takes place live via a Google Hangout On Air and is available to watch anytime afterwards on our YouTube channel. The panel consists of 3-5 guests from around the world changing every week depending on the episode topic. Each show is hosted by artist \u003ca href=\"http://themusicspring.com/panelist/lee-safar\"\u003eLee Safar\u003c/a\u003e and put together by a support team of artists who have aspiring careers in the music industry.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe select guests based on 3 elements:\u003cbr\u003e1) their relevance \u0026amp; expertise to the topic at hand\u003cbr\u003e2) their ability to put forward their knowledge and opinion based on their current experience from within the music industry; and\u003cbr\u003e3) the integrity with which they conduct themselves within their field (yes, there are people doing music business with integrity in 2014\u2026we promise!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe do not choose guests based on their hype, what label they are or aren\u2019t associated with, or their job title. Further we don\u2019t discriminate between label or indie artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis show is a valuable resource of information for anyone currently in the music business or trying to get an understanding of how it all works. Our audience includes artists, engineers, touring managers, tour support staff, venue owners, industry regulators, attorneys, promoters, festival organisers, music supervisors, managers, publicists, label executives, university lecturers, publishers, aggregators, online streaming service creators etc etc etc\u2026.you get the idea!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur mission is to create panel discussions filled with ideas and information of the highest standard so that artists and industry professionals from around the world can then apply what they hear on The Music Spring to their own careers as they progress from DIY artists to fully fledged music entrepreneurs. The idea is to show people different ways they can create a music career and have the best chance of long-term success as music entrepreneurs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a team of artists focused on creating content geared at inspiring your success (financial or otherwise) in the new music industry.
