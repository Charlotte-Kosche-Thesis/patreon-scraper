I love all kinds of video games, but I especially enjoy skillful and competitive PvP titles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started doing post-commentary content 4 years back starting with Guild Wars 2 videos. I quickly realized how much I enjoyed helping people get a better grasp on some aspects of the game or simply just allow them to look at some mechanics from a different angle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI very much like doing analytical content, explaining my thought process of how I overcome some obstacles I come across in games. Offering basic guide videos and post-commentary gameplay of challenging games I enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past I\u0027ve been spending a lot of time as a twitch broadcaster and I enjoyed it, but I never felt like I built much expertise as a streamer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn YouTube I feel like I can become a lot better in creating great videos and my goal is to focus hard on making the best content I can. I\u0027m still trying out tons of new things and trying to expand the type of videos I want to create, but that\u0027s something I enjoy so much about YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeeping that in mind I want to focus on quality over quantity. Unfortunately YouTube\u0027s system doesn\u0027t reward low quantity as much and that\u0027s where you come into play!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy my content and you can spare a few dollars it\u0027d lift a huge weight off my shoulders. Every even so small pledge will help me doing what I love for a living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut please, if you\u0027re struggling financially yourself, don\u0027t feel obliged to pledge, just you being around is a blessing already!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"
