While that still happens, I\u2019m proud to say that, thanks to you all, my mission has expanded to gameplay for its own sake, deck brewing, MtG news discussions, and even memes. I\u2019ve learned as a player and grown as a person because of the knowledge and experience that I\u2019ve gained from this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy have a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking gameplay footage is easy. Making the kinds of content that I think that you, the viewer, would enjoy more, like detailed deck techs, comedy videos, product and game reviews, and detailed discussions can take significantly more time to do well. If I didn\u2019t have responsibilities, then I could devote myself to these things without issue. Of course, that\u2019s rarely how life works\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn other words, I do my best to make the channel good for you all, but I want it to be great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can improve the channel and your experience on it. It\u2019s the least that I can do for your supporting a small channel and, in turn, the MtG community on YouTube. I am under no illusion that this channel will ever be able to fund itself enough to be a full-time job, but with your help, at least I can devote more time to bringing you more frequent and diverse kinds of content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis brings me to the benefit that most directly affects you, the patron: if there\u0027s anything that you want to see, I will do my best to make it happen. Have a brew that you\u0027d like me to pilot? Want me to play more of your favorite format? Do you have a question that should be answered on camera? I\u0027ll be receptive to your requests first and foremost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, with this cooperation, we both benefit. You get more and better content to watch, learn from, and enjoy, and I get the ability to continue making and improving it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you can\u0027t give much, every little bit would be greatly appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
