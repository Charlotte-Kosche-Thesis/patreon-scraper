Due to the nature of being a working artist, a project like this is a massive undertaking, especially when you consider the amount of work against the lack of immediate return on investment. Because of this, I have to split my time with other work to keep the lights on. I hope to eventually make enough to work on my stories full-time, and your support is a massive and fantastic step in that direction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you will consider aiding in the production of Tempest Red, and I greatly appreciate you taking the time to stop by. Keep being awesome!\u00a0"
