    "summary": "Hi! My name is Tiffany Harned, and I am a professional photographer working toward supporting myself and my photography projects full-time, solely through Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA girl can dream can\u0027t she? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work is not easy, and certainly not cheap! From equipment, to travel expenses, and more - my patrons play an important role in funding my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron, you will get exclusive access to my work that cannot be found anywhere else; behind-the-scenes content, Never before published stories behind my images, the first to see and know about new projects I am working on, how to tutorials, connecting with other patrons, and so much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo unlock access to this content and join me on my adventures, become part of my exclusive community of patrons! You can join for as little as $1 per month - that\u2019s less than a cup of coffee! (YUM COFFEE!!!)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m out to change the world for the better, and I want you to join me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s hard to believe almost 3 years ago, I traveled the USA with my cat, car, \u0026amp; camera taking roads less traveled with the last few dollars I had in my pocket, making friends in the most magical places and creating a special kind of magic within my camera. That magic allowed me to  release my self published Photobook \u201cAWAY TO AWAKEN.\u201d It was quite a feeling to see my dreams come true and be able to hold a tangible item that signified my hard work and determination. I do not want that feeling to stop after one project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I have put my all into trying to spread the word of my book by word of mouth, selling them out of the back of my car to strangers I met while on my daily travels, hoping to sell enough books to make it to the next town. Trying to sell enough books to work on the next project. \u003cbr\u003eI am an independent artist. I have a dream and am literally putting all I have into this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have realized while I have self-published my first photography book, I don\u0027t want my career to end there. I want to create MORE things. I want to be able to create freely, and more often!!!! Juggling multiple jobs and working 7-16 hours a day to get by does not allow much creative time or time to better my craft. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few things I would love to do in the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e1. Write an actual book of the whole story behind AWAY TO AWAKEN. \u003cbr\u003e\n2. Teach photography workshops \u003cbr\u003e3. Have a photo studio in my apartment and start playing with my old lights. \u003cbr\u003e\n4. Start learning wood working\n\u003cbr\u003e5. Quit all my jobs and live off just photography. \u003cbr\u003e\n6. Travel cross country again by car with my kitten and photograph places I missed last trip.\u003cbr\u003e\n7. Photograph the milky way in the desert with what I have learned since I was last in the desert.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. Do pop up art shows across the USA. \u003cbr\u003e\n9. Make photo friends\n\u003cbr\u003e10. Buy a van to travel in with winter kitten and my photo gear\n\u003cbr\u003e11. Invest in a new low light lens and a new full frame camera.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy biggest dream is to Create ART, Meet NEW CREATIVE SOULS, and COLLABORATE all of our Knowledge and Talent.  Living out our dreams, surviving off of our art, and LIVING A GREAT STORY! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Won\u0027t you make this dreams a reality?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "How does one become an artist? There are many paths and no two artists follow identical ones, but Tiffany Harned has forged her own road and thus formed her own unique style. Her medium of choice, photography, was destined when she received her first camera, a Canon A1, at the age of five. The sense of exploration that permeates all her work was first developed as a high-school student in Woodbridge New Jersey. Tiffany and her friends would go out at night trying to find the unusual locations appearing in the magazine \u201cWeird NJ,\u201d starting a life-long pattern of heading down the roads less traveled with her camera always in hand. She further developed her skills at Middlesex County College under the tutelage of professor Whitey Warner who encouraged her love of unexplored places.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2002 Tiffany moved to Los Angeles to pursue her dream to be a photographer in the music scene there. She quickly found success with her first publication in Campus Circle magazine, and then landed gigs at Skinnie Magazine and American Music Press (AMP) Magazine and shooting for OzzFest and Warped tours, among others. By 2006, however, the music industry was in decline and Tiffany found herself at loose ends. She pursued freelancing opportunities until 2008 when she moved back to New Jersey to stay with her family.\u003cbr\u003eOver the next few years Tiffany bounced between Oregon, New Jersey and California, struggling to make ends meet and hardly finding time to take any pictures. She grew depressed and despaired of ever finding a creative home for her art. In February of 2015 Tiffany set out in desperation on a cross-country journey to find a place to call home. She had her car, her cat, her Canon camera, and $3,000 cash\u2014all her worldly possessions. Remembering her teen explorations, she took the roads less travelled, heading south to Atlanta, then west through New Orleans and Houston, across Texas and along the Mexico border, traveling through ghost towns and tiny communities. She stayed with friends, camped under the stars or slept in her car, and she took pictures every day.\u003cbr\u003eEventually Tiffany landed in a small off-the-grid community called Slab City in the southern California desert. She stayed there for a while, finding inspiration and motivation and beginning to rediscover herself. From there she proceeded north through several of California\u2019s beautiful National Parks, and on up into Oregon. Looping back east through Nevada, Utah and Colorado she discovered she\u2019d been on the road for three months and still had not found a home\u2014but she had found her own peace. After a long hiatus she was again making art, and that brought happiness, meaning and passion.\u003cbr\u003eWhen Tiffany finally arrived back in New Jersey, some 15,000 miles later, she realized she had created an enchanting story in her photographs from the trip \u2013 a story brought to life in her book Away To Awaken. The book depicts not only the spellbinding sights and perspectives she captured, but also her own spiritual awakening along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Tiffany is a member of both Professional Photographers of America (PPA) and American Photographic Artists (APA). Her photographs have a well-defined recognizable style with vivid lighting often shot at night with nontraditional light sources and long exposures. Many of her shots feature her or others \u201cspinning fire\u201d for a breathtaking visual effect. More than anything, though, Tiffany Harned shows us the roads less traveled\u2014captivating vistas few people see or singular perspectives on more common sights\u2014allowing the viewer to glimpse the wonder she finds wherever she travels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/#\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
