I\u0027ve seen others put up a Patreon, and I\u0027ve decided I can manage it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Tonya Liburd. Hello.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, thanks for being interested in my work and reading my stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(I have a full bibliography, including interviews,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thespiderlilly.wordpress.com/bibliography/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSurviving on disability\u0027s no easy feat, and so little can make the difference between me getting by for that month or not. It can also make the difference between me deciding to eat and applying to go to Clarion, important contests, or even to just go to local conventions in the Greater Toronto Area, like Ad Astra, to make connections and do readings, or to go to Toronto Comicon or FanExpo to try and sell anthologies I am in along with other members of the Horror Writers\u0027 Association at our booth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI chronicle to some degree on Facebook living daily with a major mental illness, and I have received emotional support through folks like you. I hope to create a space where I can raise awareness about these issues and I plan to do more of that here, and get into the specifics. Mental health issues also feature prominently in the majority of fiction and nonfiction I produce, and you\u0027ll get to see why.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon works on a subscription model--so whatever tier you pledge, you will be charged once a month for that amount. In return, you get everything listed in the rewards tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work every day in some manner on my writing, be it making sure I\u0027m up to date on current events, helping in Abyss \u0026amp; Apex slush, volunteering my time to to other writing organizations, or working on my own writing--be it fiction, non-fiction, poetry or, at present, polishing my completed novel--so you can rest assured your dollars are going towards me expanding, doing and getting better in my field.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to sharing my journey with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGratefully yours,\u003cbr\u003eTonya Liburd\u003cbr\u003eBanner photo credit: Jeff Phillips (\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/themacbuddha1)\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/themacbuddha1)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIcon by Rayah Long (\u003ca href=\"http://www.rayahjaymes.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.rayahjaymes.com/\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e"
