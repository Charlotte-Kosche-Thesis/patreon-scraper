Its contributors are freelance journalists and writers who devote their time to deliver articles on a monthly basis and occasionally cooperate with local news agencies, for free. Though TLR officially started on september 2013, its roots date back to 2010. Here\u0027s a few facts about TLR: at the time of its debut on Patreon (April 2017), TLR had\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e285 articles\u003c/strong\u003e of various subjects, written by \u003cstrong\u003e16 authors, \u003c/strong\u003e8 of which are currently active TLR members; \u003cstrong\u003e150 articles\u003c/strong\u003e have been published on local newspapers; TLR members won\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thelightblueribbon.com/premi-e-riconoscimenti/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e18 literature awards\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eand aim at winning more; over the years, though we did so as independent writers, not as a group, we have published\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://thelightblueribbon.com/le-nostre-opere/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003evarious books\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. We have done a lot, but we believe we can - and will! - do way more than this, as the group expands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur group isn\u0027t all about blogging and articles, though. Our members do many things and this notable variety has allowed great things to happen over the years. We have \u003cstrong\u003ejournalists who have become poets or writers\u003c/strong\u003e, and vice versa, thanks to our constant support. We firmly believe in culture and free writing as ways to show the world that every single artist can give a significant and heterogeneous contribute to art and culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, we are planning to publish a number of books and organize events dedicated to culture in the places we are from, and we would also like to help other groups with similar goals. Wait, if you\u0027re wondering what our name and logo are about, let us give you an answer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://thelightblueribbon.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/logo_png_trasparenza.png?w=640\u0026amp;h=320\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Lightblue Ribbon,\u003c/em\u003e our symbol, is meant to represent infinity and the blue skies, two things that we believe perfectly match our will to be, and remain, independent journalists and writers. TLR is \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA group for Free Writers and Thinkers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0so this logo accurately sums up what we are all about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe haven\u0027t earned anything in years and years of freelance writing, and this has pretty much prevented us from doing anything beyond our regular agenda - that\u0027s why we believe contributors can really make the difference. TLR and its writers \u003cstrong\u003eare mainly based in Italy\u003c/strong\u003e, a country where journalism faces continuous backlash from certain political parties. Though we have a strict rule forbidding any political-related discussions and articles, we still face the consequences of living in a place where journalists either \"work\" for free or have to adapt to the needs of political parties. When it comes to writing and poetry, things are slightly better but still not good compared to other western countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn May 4th, 2017, we have finally made the decision to debut here on Patreon, hoping that it will mark the beginning of a more intense activity as both freelance journalists and writers. \u003cstrong\u003eYour contribute may enable us to get some our works translated into English for everyone to read and enjoy!\u003c/strong\u003e Do you find it challenging? What about this: our top contributors will be awarded in very... \u003cem\u003eartistic ways!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Francesco D\u0027Amico and Antonio Mirko Dimartino\u003cbr\u003eTLR Group Coordinators\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
