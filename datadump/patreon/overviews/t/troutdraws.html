    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Trout. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started drawing in late 2012, foraying into the world of art using only the trackpad of my beat-to-hell macbook. Starting on tgchan.org I drew quests, interactive stories about dragons and fantasy worlds, spun silly tales about russian conscripts in a world not quite like our own, and made fun of the games industry. My art evolved and prospered, first with my discovery of the miraculous things called layers (they were a pretty big deal to me), and then with the purchase of my first tablet, a dinky little thing from a company I can\u0027t even remember the name of. Among other things, I discovered how to vary my line widths, and how to execute long, curvy, and precise lines perfectly. Drawing a straight line still escapes me, however. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom there I delved into the furry community, making mad loads of commission money (or dirty furry money, as I call it) and using the opportunity to expand the range of my art and the breadth of my content. I learned how to use color, and how to imply shapes and objects and features without ever drawing a line. I continued my storytelling through more quests, occasional visits to 4chan\u0027s /tg/, and hand-drawing comics. I\u0027ve even dabbled in animation and programming! The years have seen me improve, through my efforts, in more ways than one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery day, my the things I draw-- kobolds, dragons, my own characters, and everything beyond-- reach dozens of new people a day. They call my art cute, adorable, and even sometimes sexy, depending on the content. And all through it, with every new favorite on FurAffinity or reblog on Tumblr, I am humbled and grateful. I remember my roots, where I came from, and how the long hours of work I\u0027ve put in have brought me to where I am today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging to me helps me continue to do what I do. I attend classes and work part-time, and often I don\u0027t have the time or energy to produce my art. With every dollar, I can put more time and effort toward my art, and put out more and more content! Isn\u0027t that exciting? I want to draw just as much if not more than people want to see more art from me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunds from pledges will go to costs of living and quality of life stuff. My job is enough to support a basic standard of living, and the money I make from my art goes toward my hobbies, such as cooking and videogames-- as well as having a safety cushion should money get tight, something that\u0027s happened a few times before. My current living condition is more or less financially comfortable, but emotionally difficult so I would like to leave it. My ultimate goal for this patreon is to leave my situation and find a better place to stay. If this were to happen, I could not possibly express all the joy and gratitude I would have for those who pledge to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, hi. I\u0027m Trout. I draw stuff. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading and considering to help me out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlaces I\u0027m at: \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/troutsworth/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/troutsworth/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://troutdraws.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://troutdraws.tumblr.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
