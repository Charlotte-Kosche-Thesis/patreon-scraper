So, what\u00b4s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thegg.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Gaming Ground (Aka \"TGG\")\u003c/a\u003e all about then?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, we\u00b4re a team of\u003cstrong\u003e Gamers/Geeks and techies\u003c/strong\u003e from all over the world (we are based in Sweden though), that loves to write and talk about video games, hardware, software, movies and anime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd due to the fact that \u003cstrong\u003ewe are 10 people strong team\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003ca href=\"http://thegg.net/aboutus/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyou can read more about us here!\u003c/a\u003e) nowadays (with more people eager to join us!), we cover everything from next-gen games, mobile games, indie games, PC-games to hardware, software and Gaming/anime/movie conventions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s13.postimg.org/3wadq5myf/tgg_2016.jpg\" style=\"width: 750px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for me, I (\u003cstrong\u003eRobin Ek\u003c/strong\u003e) have been working in the video game industry since 2005. I started as a retail seller of video games, by working for different game retail companies in Sweden (I also created my own company \"\u003cstrong\u003eGaming Ground/gamingground.se\u003c/strong\u003e\" back in 2006).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u00b4ve been writing about games, movies and technology since \u003cstrong\u003e1998\u003c/strong\u003e (I also created \u003cstrong\u003ethegamingground.com back in 2009\u003c/strong\u003e). However, I decided to take the next big step by creating thegg.net (which launched back in May 2014). Because I felt like it was about time that took \"The Gaming Ground\" to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so far, we\u00b4re doing pretty well, but there are tons of more work that needs to get done (updates on the homepage, \u003cstrong\u003eget more talented people\u003c/strong\u003e to join our team and so on). And that\u00b4s why we need your help. Because it\u00b4s rather time demanding to do design, code, videos, podcasts, articles, interviews and reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning our homepage isn\u0027t cheap either. In fact, \u003cstrong\u003eour monthly expenses\u00a0is about 200 dollars\u003c/strong\u003e at this time (staff costs, web host and Cloudflare costs etc.). We don\u00b4t demand (or ask for) thousands of dollars, but simply enough money to pay for our costs per month. And that\u00b4s it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe do have additional goals \u003c/strong\u003eof course, but everything above 200 dollars would be a big bonus for us. And if we got more money than we ask for, then we will use that money to pay our staff more money for their work (because at this time, they get very little for their work).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the rest of the money would go to either charity or giveaways to our fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, a big thank you in advance!
