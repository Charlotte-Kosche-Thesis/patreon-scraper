    "summary": "\"The Xperience: Hockey Talk\" - Serious Hockey Talk For Serious Hockey Fans!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAttention hockey fans, I have the show for you with serious hockey talk!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLadies and gentlemen my name is Michael Lindenbaum, and I am the Creator, Producer, and Host for \"The Xperience: Hockey Talk\" (aka TXHT).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is TXHT?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTXHT is a show I created in September of 2015, and debuted in October 2015 because I personally do not like how the sport of hockey is covered here in the DC Metro area, where I live, and I want to help lead the charge in how hockey is covered here. On TXHT we don\u0027t just cover the local team, which is the Washington Capitals, but we cover the entire National Hockey League (NHL), National Women\u0027s Hockey League (NWHL), plus so much more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBack in March of 2017 TXHT was picked up by WBGR Sports Network, which has helped greatly in exposure, but what many people don\u0027t know is that by being on an actual radio network there are fees that we the creators have to pay to have a show on the air for one hour a week. Plus these fees aren\u0027t just for being on the air, but also for using their studio so we can have a high quality sounding product, and also to have the ability to have you, the fans, to be able to call in and ask your questions live while we are on the air!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow for TXHT, we don\u0027t have any Sponsors. The reason we don\u0027t have any sponsors is because this is a labor of love for me, and this truly is a Hockey Show for Fans by Fans, and that is why TXHT is here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eValue for Being a Patron:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNow I know what you are thinking. What do I get for contributing to TXHT? That my friends is a wonderful question, and I have many things planned for you when you join this exclusive TXHT community. Now along with listening to TXHT every Saturday at 11am (est), which everyone will have access to, you will get to have access to Exclusive\u00a0Content only available here on Patreon, plus merchandise, Google Hangouts, and so much more!\u003cbr\u003e"
