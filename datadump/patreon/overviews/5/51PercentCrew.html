     "about": "Hi Everyone, Let me start by saying Welcome and Thank you for your support through out the Crypto Journey for all these years. Most of you know me from Facebook groups because I am the Admin of 51% Crew and Crypto Coin trader. I started my journey in Crypto many many years ago as a trader and have grown a passion for Technical analysis and trading. I trade full time. With that passion and acquired knowledge I have given many years of helping the Crypto Community teaching and answering questions for free. I have grown a huge following because of this and I honestly can say Thank you for the support from\u00a0 now on Patreon. This motivates me even more to keep producing great content to help you and for you to enjoy. The goal behind this page is to teach and give you an understanding of Technical Analysis and the Cryptocurrency markets. Please be patient with me. I am learning just like you are just in a different way. I am a professional trader not a college professor so I am learning how to teach while you learn TA from me. Come join me on this journey and lets learn together. Thank you for the support.\u00a0",
