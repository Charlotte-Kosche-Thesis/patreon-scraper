We\u0027ve been tossing this idea around for a long time, but if we reach this goal, we\u0027ll buckle up our boots and just start it! Because we specialize in documentary filmmaking, this course would be focused on those skills (writing scripts, prepping shoots, starting the edits, color grading, etc). They\u0027re vital skills for new filmmakers, or anyone that wants to tell a genuine story. We\u0027ve always worked with scientists, so we\u0027ll bring that background with us, but it\u0027ll still be valuable for everyone - especially those of you on youtube.\u00a0",
