THAT\u2019S WHY I\u2019VE MADE A COMMITMENT TO FILM A DOCUMENTARY.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my early research about cyber stalking and harassment, cyber bullying, and revenge porn I have discovered some startling facts. Nearly 50% of online users say they have faced some sort of harassment online. The number of cases of victims rises daily, suicide and self-destructive behaviors are happening more often and more content is created and shared by the nano second. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u2019s worse is the lack of tough penalities for predators, slow responses and no responses from Internet companies to remove such content and a huge lack of international involvement with the overall safety for our online identities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know this all too well. My name is Darieth Chisolm and I was cyber-stalked and cyber-raped by an ex boyfriend in Jamaica, who also threatened to kill me. When his terrifying and real threats of killing me for not returning to this controlling relationship was not working for him, he used a different weapon - a cellphone- and he loaded it with my naked body and fired into cyber space. He created a website with harassing memes and naked photos and videos of me, that he took without my knowledge or permission while I was sleeping. The website has since been shutdown but the emotional scars remain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a professional woman, with a 30 year career as a television news anchor, entrepreneur, author and life and business coach, I was devastated.  I was ashamed, humiliated and embarrassed by the actions of a jealous, controlling and obsessive ex-boyfriend.  I crumbled for months in silence, with so much disbelief and anger. I was paralyzed by what these public impressions might do to my celebrity and credibility. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI went to court, seeking both civil and criminal charges, with little to no remedy or satisfaction, and I quickly realized that there are feeble laws to protect cyber-crime victims, particularly in international cases like mine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eENOUGH IS ENOUGH, IT\u0027S TIME TO TAKE ACTION\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve spent over 3 decades in television and media, in front of the camera, and now I will take you behind the scenes, into in the law offices of attorneys, into the court rooms of judges, into the board rooms of online companies and into the living rooms of victims and survivors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will ask lawmakers, why can\u2019t you protect us and toughen penalties for perpetrators? \u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ll encourage the accountability and responsiveness among online companies. We will explore how to promote social responsibility for texting, posting, and sharing online, and work to restore dignity and respect to victims and survivors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s no doubt, this is a huge undertaking and it will take countless hours of pre and post-production to bring this documentary to life. We are committed. Our projected budget for the 50 Shades of Silence documentary is $500,000.00 it\u2019s a bare minimum that it will cost for us to make this film.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eTHAT\u0027S WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP TO RAISE FUNDS\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003eEvery single dollar that we receive from you will increase the value and the quality of this documentary and help us tell our story with more clarity, find solutions and provide support and direction. We need your help to make this possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have assembled a team and a production crew, from literally all over the world, and we are mapping out a plan for production, travel, research, equipment, etc, not to mention post production and the final product \u2013 the chance for you to host 50 Shades of Silence film screenings in your community, school, churches and organizations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will give you the chance to invite in representatives in your community and open this topic up for true discussions. You will also be able to download the documentary on your computer and watch it from home.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eHOW THIS WILL WORK FOR YOU\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003eHere on Patreon you choose the monthly subscription amount of your choice in exchange for exclusive experiences \u0026amp; behind-the-scenes content, plus special goodies, swag and bundles.\u003cbr\u003eLet\u2019s talk about how this works.

Some months, may be a bit slow, depending on production and quite frankly money raised.
