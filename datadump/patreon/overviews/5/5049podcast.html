    "summary": "From its inception in 2013, to its untimely demise in 2015, the 5049 Podcast was an integral part of the international creative music scene.  Week after week, I was honored and delighted to sit down with some of the world\u0027s most distinctive, creative and original musicians for long form and free-wheeling conversations about creativity, inspiration, disappointment and the day to day of creating original music in the twenty first century.  After two years and eighty six episodes, the show was cut short due to financial strains and an overwhelming amount of work outside of the podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOctober 24th, 2016 will mark the return of 5049 Podcast, and hopefully through this platform, we will be able to create a more sustainable financial model through direct involvement with you, the listener, that will allow for a long and healthy life for the show.  New episodes of the podcast will become available each Monday in iTunes for FREE and the show will always be free.  The purpose of this Patreon page is to invite the audience to participate and help the show, and me, with the support needed to make the best show possible.  Revenue generated here will go directly to paying for server space and maintaining the 5049 website, maintaining the archive, hardware issues and to help fund all upcoming 5049 related projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe 5049 Podcast holds a most special place in my heart and stands as some of my proudest work.  Despite having ended two years ago, I still receive emails on a regular basis from listeners all over the world, expressing what the show has meant to them.  I love and feel close to you all and am deeply excited to bring back the podcast to you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLove,\u003cbr\u003e\nJeremiah Cymerman\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e10/24, Episode 87: Ken Vandermark\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.muzicadevest.ro/test/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ken_Vandermark_by_Jim_Newberry.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e"
