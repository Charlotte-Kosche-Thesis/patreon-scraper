We are thrilled that you are considering becoming a patron of our music, and we want to tell ya why and what\u0027s in store!  We have spent the last 6 years building our earth/folk/rock band, 5j Barrow, in New York City.  This past August, we took a big leap of faith and left our beloved apartment, 5j, for a big blue conversion van, \"Mavis Sullivan Staples\" (you can find the meaning of her name in our \"patron-only\" feed!).  We\u0027ve jumped into our collective dream of touring \u0026amp; growing with our music.\u00a0  In this next year we plan to create more music, challenge ourselves, travel to inspiring places we have never been, release a dozen new tracks, release our first professional music video, and build, create and share much more content.  Along with these big milestones comes the cost of chasing our dream including bringing our incredible bassist and drummer (Drew and Gerard) on tour with us as soon as financially possible, tapping into the management and marketing expertise of people who can help us cast our net wider, paying for gas to keep us travlin\u0027, and equipment to continue producing high quality content, and most importantly staying focused on creating music.  Any added support from our beloved patrons can make a huge difference in what we are able to accomplish.  Whatever you are able to contribute, whether it is $1/month to $200/month will return back to you with so much love and good karma and many different tokens of gratitude!  Examples include: gaining access to our patron-only feed, personal entries of our experiences of life on the road, stories behind our lyrics and what inspires us to write, 1st listens \u0026amp; downloads to our new tunes, your very own 5j Barrow house concert, and the list goes on!  Whether or not you are able to become a patron, we remain grateful to people who truly want to listen \u0026amp; connect through our music. Musicians and artists throughout history have counted on patrons to give them the ongoing gift of support, encouragement, and strength to endure the rocky lifestyle of being an artist. If at anytime your patronage becomes difficult for you, we will certainly understand if you need to end your monthly commitment. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your support and your consideration in going on this journey with us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eLove always, 5j Barrow (Eryn, Jason, Drew \u0026amp; Gerard)\u003c/div\u003e"
