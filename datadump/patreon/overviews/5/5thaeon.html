Very specifically, to the unnamed horned goddess which has acted as egregore and mascot to my endeavors, and the lovely Baphomet, as a force of balance between the binary extremities of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, I\u0027m having to cram in my creativity whenever I can find the time, which makes for slow going progress on larger projects, such as longer term projects and graphic stories (comics). Your support would help enable me to not only get better equipment to produce these and other projects faster, but also enable me to pay the bills, \u00a0further fueling my ability to continue presenting my art to a lovely audience!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided upon a monthly campaign, without a paywall. \u003cbr\u003eWhat this means is that if you choose to offer your support, you\u0027ll be assisting in helping the art happen more regularly for all to enjoy without any exception.\u003cbr\u003eAll artwork and writing will be available at my main site 5thaeon.net\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I gather steam, supporters will eventually be eligible for special perks, which will be announced at a yet to be determined date.\u003cbr\u003eSo, thank you again for your support, and I hope you enjoy the show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDrop by the Redbubble shoppe to get art related items for your very own self or a friend!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/people/5thaeon?asc=u\"\u003ehttps://www.redbubble.com/people/5thaeon?asc=u\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
