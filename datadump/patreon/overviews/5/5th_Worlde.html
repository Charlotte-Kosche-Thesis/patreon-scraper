    "summary": "Hello, I am Kevin Donoghue and, to my amazement, an Amazon #1 best selling author. I never really expected to be an author, after all I am dyslexic, and further I have friends who \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e professional writers. I definitely do not have the skills or the ability to deliver several thousand words to a deadline. No, I am storyteller. And I became a storyteller by accident. You see, I am lazy kind of a workaholic, who lives an unconventional lifestyle. About a year ago I was ill and not able to work for a short time and as a result, in my boredom, I was driving everybody nuts. It was during this period that a very good friend suggested that I write down some of the stories, that I am renown for telling, from the time that I spent running around the world looking after Rock and Roll bands. I then started to remembered some of the stories\u00a0that I used to make up, to entertain my son, an avid fan of Star Wars, LOTR and Mr Potter. \u00a0[ Did I mention that I am also a single parent? ] \u003cbr\u003eAnd well, naturally, one thing led to another, as it where.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I want to achieve with Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have taken the 5th Worlde Sagas to their first stage under my own\u00a0steam. I have produced the\u00a0initial run of 500 paperbacks and these are now going into distribution and marketing. And I have discovered that the independent author has so much more to do after the words have been crafted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eeBooks of Dark Library Series\u00a0available through Amazon, Barnes Noble and\u00a0iTunes;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\u00a0logical next step is to produce the remaining \u003cem\u003eForbidden Books of the Dark Library\u003c/em\u003e for full\u00a0distribution though the eBooks system. Two are currently available in Amazon. This will be easily achieve and only require the books to be formatted correctly, yet that still cost a few hundred.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are The Forbidden Books of The Dark Library?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eForbidden Books of the Dark Library\u003c/em\u003e are series of short story books, which concentrate upon each characters POV and that characters storyline only. Where as the Sagas interwind all the characters and tell the whole story, in a complete worlde POV. You get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarketing: General \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSmall scale Social Media marketing and the continued investment in updating and maintaining the website and the Newletter mailing list facilities. Marketing is another area in which the independent author has to be able to applying his skills after the words have been crafted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo Production\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to create a series of short videos to help with the marketing of the 5th Worlde Sagas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudio Books of the Sagas\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe production of the audio version of the book \u003cem\u003eFrom The Devil We Came \u003c/em\u003eis the really big job. \u003cbr\u003eThis is a very time consuming project and brings with it a significant expenditure in both Voice-Over costs and Studio production time, and then additional costs in CD Manufacture. Fortunately my knowledge of the music business will make this more easily achievable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFuture Projects\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePaperback Volumes of the 5th Worlde Saga books 2 and 3\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe second volume [ untitled ] of\u00a0the Sagas is nearing completion and artwork will need to be compiled before we can begin the production of paperbacks copies\u00a0[ Autumn 17. ] Volume three will be completed in Summer 18 with a autumn release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHardback version of The Lost Book of Heroes\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a very special project and some way down the line but it is never to early to start planning. I really want to produce a large limited edition hardback, a coffee table type of \u0027tome,\u0027 which I envisage will contain the first three books of the sagas. It will also have character details and description of the worlde, along with maps that folding-out, copies of letters from the charters to each other, and the lyrics to the songs. It will also contain images of the\u00a0characters and places too. Obviously artists will need to be\u00a0commissioned, as my artwork skills are limited to basic colouring-in with crayons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComputer Games\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter reading \u003cem\u003eFrom The Devil We Came,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0a close friend suggested that the Sagas would make an interesting Action/ Role playing computer game. A kind of cross between Myst and Assassins Creed. It really is something that I had not considered but after the phenomenal success of George RR Martin\u0027s Game of Thrones, the genre is definitely much more popular.\u003cbr\u003eAgain a project that is very far\u00a0down the line but it will need investigating... Possibly a three pipe problem.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe 5th Worlde \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHere I want to introduce you to the 5th Worlde.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAn Introduction to the 5th Worlde\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMans time in each worlde is is brief for he is fragile and when he dies he transmigrates from one worlde to\nthe next. The Jinn are made of smokeless flame, they exist in sprit only and\nhave mystic powers, and the Engel are the envoys and bringers of news. After an Engel\nhas completed its task, it ceases to exist. Some believe they are the sprits of\nthose who are currently transmigrating,\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003eAnd so, inevitably, we come to the 5th Worlde. Unfortunately, As I am Sure you will learn, there is something is wrong in the 5th Worlde. Quite simply the 5th Worlde is broken. The\ntimelines are converging. They\u00a0merge\nand flux and shift and flow. And life has become very different indeed.
