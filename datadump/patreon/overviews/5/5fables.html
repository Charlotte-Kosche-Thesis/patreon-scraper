     "about": "My adventure began with a Lego set at age 5 that I have passed on to my own children. Building fantastical ships, interstellar outposts and futuristic craft of all types. When I played my first game of D\u0026amp;D at age 11 I knew I was hooked. Story telling and invention has been an obsession ever since and I quickly graduated to video games on the 2600 and beyond that into writing and even a bit of self-publishing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the late 90\u0027s I designed and developed a role-play focused web site called Thistledown Hall where my friends and I published our own game tools, modules and a variety of game aides and stories. In 1999 the web site was nominated for an Ennie RPG Web Site Design Award (The Gen Con EN World RPG Awards) and Joe and I traveled to Indianapolis, IN to addend the ceremony.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComputers and computer gaming have always been a part of my life. I have built many computers over the years including advanced and highly customized gaming rigs. Some of my favorite games have been Doom, Quake, Unreal Tournament, Battlefield and Half-Life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOTHER THINGS\u003c/h3\u003eI am currently producing a podcast focused on Technology, Experience \u0026amp; Design called \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/solvent-by-avtex/id997496930?mt=2\"\u003eSolvent\u003c/a\u003e and continue to work on \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/thecouchwarriortv\"\u003eCouchWarrior TV\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e",
