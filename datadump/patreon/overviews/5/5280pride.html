With so many of us meeting in the Mile High City of Denver, we have dubbed this collective, of bright \"human\" beams, The 5280 Pride.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs members, of The oysWORLDter Tribe, we take Pride in our individual uniqueness, we take Pride in our communities, we take Pride in our Spaceship Earth, and like a lion\u0027s Pride, we take Pride in caring for one another. We can inspire others to dream more, do more, learn more, and become more, simply by pursuing our best selves everyday.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAn application was put together for all those that wish to join The 5280 Pride of the Tribe. {you can find it\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/5Wqd0rwzl0wS4Qnj2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e} By answering all of the questions, to the best of your ability, it allows us the opportunity to know how we can best support you, and your dreams, while we curate the most out of our inspiration headquarters, 5280 Pride Rock.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWalt Disney once said, \" If you can dream it, you can do it,\" and we\u0027ve found that it rings true within our Tribe. Help us make our dreams come true by finding the membership option that best suits you. Due to our limited space within 5280 Pride Rock, we can only allow a limited number of Pride members to have full access.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have started brainstorming weekly activities in addition to our Tuesday Tea event, {like Mental Monday, Think Tank Tuesdays, Thankfulon Thursdee, Frisky Fridays, Smoke out Saturdays, and Sanctuary Sundays}, but we could use our Tribe\u0027s input along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your contribution we\u0027ll be able to focus on the growth of the Tribe and the accomplishment of our collectives goals. Let\u0027s work together to inspire others to be there best selves and to positively act today for a brighter more beautiful tomorrow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
