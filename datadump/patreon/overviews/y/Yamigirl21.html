That is, before discovering my true love\nwithin the world of Anime and Manga! :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of my\nworks relate to this passion, though I also studied\nIllustration at the \u003cstrong\u003eUniversity of the Arts\u003c/strong\u003e in Philadelphia,\nfocusing on children\u0027s books, my\nown interpretation of fairy tales, and fables from around the world!\u00a0I felt that illustration was more suited to me, rather than\nanimation, as I enjoy fine and meticulous detail; as well as\ntaking the time to convey all that I wish to within the work\nitself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI choose to use \u003cstrong\u003etraditional\nmediums\u003c/strong\u003e, as I feel\u00a0great pride working with my hands; by having complete control over a pencil, or\npaint brush! As such, I developed my own painting technique with \u003cstrong\u003ewatercolors\u003c/strong\u003e, applying them thickly, to resemble acrylics or gouache. \nI like to think that my devotion to these mediums is something\nthat defines me and my work; having honed these skills for over 15\nyears now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, because of this, my art can be *extremely* time consuming!  My process begins\nwith a sketch, then a polished line drawing, which is followed by transferring that drawing to water color paper! Next, I begin painting the image, from the background,\nto the foreground and lastly, I add the black outling that I include in\nmany of my works!  Depending on the complexity of the piece, this can range from weeks, or even months, for a single\nimage!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI suppose that brings me to \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e, as I\u00a0hope to\u00a0generate support for my work, as well\nas my dream to one day devote even *more* time to my craft!  :) \nI love interacting with friends and supporters on Deviantart,\nand I hope to do so here on Patreon as well!  Any funds will be\nused for art supplies, equipment, and if I\u0027m lucky enough, complete concentration on my art in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I would appreciate \u003cstrong\u003eany \u003c/strong\u003eamount that\nyou are willing to contribute, please know that more than *anything,* it\u0027s your interest and encouragement that keeps me going;\ngiving me the drive and determination to continue my, at times,\ndifficult process! I often say this on Deviantart, but the comments, critiques and even favorites\nthat I receive are what make me smile; bringing me a step closer to\nthe sense of accomplishment that I\u0027ve *always* wished to have with my\nwork!  I suppose \u003cstrong\u003ethat \u003c/strong\u003eis my true goal, and I hope with your help,\nI can make that happen!  :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you decide against\nsupporting me here, please continue to do so on\nDeviantart and Facebook!\u00a0 In truth, any support at\nall means more than I can say!  Thank you\u00a0from\nthe very bottom of my heart for even considering it, and for reading\nthis message!  I\u0027ll try my absolute best not to\ndisappoint you!
