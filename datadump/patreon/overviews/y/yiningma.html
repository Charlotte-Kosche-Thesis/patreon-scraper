    "summary": "Hi, this is Yining! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an improvisation musician and writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAll my music are currently staying at yiningma.bandcamp.com.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAll contents from my bandcamp are free/name your price unless they are for charity. Because I want my art to be available to all who likes it and wants to keep it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut of course, making art needs money. My existence needs money. And I would also like to keep on improving myself as long as my existence permits to make better art.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s why I made this Patreon. If you like what I make and would like to help me, please consider pledging. I will give you back in the form of my thoughts that accompanies every thing I make. Those documentaries that comes with the actual shows. I will share with you my soul, in a non-creepy way, I will open to you the door to my mind palace. I like to share. And if you like my art enough to pledge your hard earned money I feel we are close enough for me to share with you everything I\u0027m ready to share with another soul.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPlus, as a part-time artist, the most convenient thing to do is to put off making art because life have much more urgent tasks for you. Your support would be the constant reminder for me to get off my bottom and go make art. Out of guilt or out of encouragement from you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are not ready for a big commitment. You are always welcome make a purchase at yiningma.bandcamp.com. Or give a little something to my virtual tip jar at paypal.me/yiningma\u00a0. Or simply share my art to someone you feel would like it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLove you all,\u003cbr\u003e\nYining\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. You will find I have the same rewards for two different pledge each. This was a leftover from Patreon\u0027s fuckup in November. And I\u0027m keeping it until Patreon has made up their mind for what their final plan would be. Feel free to choose a lower tier since you\u0027ll get the same thing. Though I would really appreciate the extra dollar!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI talked more about it at\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/posts/15771082"
