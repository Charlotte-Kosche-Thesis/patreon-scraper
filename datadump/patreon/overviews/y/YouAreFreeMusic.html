I enjoy making music and watching anime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMelodic and chill\u00a0electronic music is my style, but I also aim to do other electronic music genres. With my music, I always try to give a story for the listeners or to give a message. Most of my songs are emotional, as they give off a sort of \"bittersweet\" feeling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnime is what I enjoy watching during my time. Mostly, I enjoy watching romance genres. The romance genre, sometimes, is what gives me inspiration for my emotional songs. Even if the series has little romance in it, any bit of it would make it enjoyable for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making music for 4 years now. I\u0027m still not very experienced in certain areas like sound design so my music isn\u0027t that great in those terms. I\u0027m also still figuring out how to be more creative with my songs. Overall, I\u0027m still learning this stuff and I hope to gain more experience as I\u0027m creating music.",
