    "summary": "Hi, my name is Julia. I\u0027m 22, living in Germany and I\u0027m a writer.\u00a0Currently working at a bookstore, I\u0027m trying to find my\u00a0footing again after life threw some obstacles my way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a bookworm all my life, I carried stories with me. Among them, the stories I knew I wanted to tell myself. But I never did. I kept them inside, thinking that there would come a\u00a0time when I felt \u003cem\u003eready.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eAs a teenager, I was convinced that I had to \u003cem\u003elive\u003c/em\u003e before I could write anything down that was actually worth reading.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.\"\u003c/strong\u003e Benjamin Franklin said and I choose the later. I planned on writing my adventures down later...when I was older...when I had the time...when I wasn\u0027t so damn busy having fun... but,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past four years, I have been really struggling with my mental health, which, unfortunately, also heavily\u00a0affected my private\u00a0life. I had to give up some of my dreams, had to make big changes I wasn\u0027t prepared for and felt proper sorry for myself and my wasted opportunities. Funny enough, that was when I finally forced myself to sit down and write. I wanted to escape into my own stories, hoping that I could create a world of my own that seemed a little brighter than my current own situation. I haven\u0027t stopped writing since.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m better now. I strongly believe that writing helped me heal. I realized that you shouldn\u0027t wait for your dream to come true, you should work for it and grow as a person while you do so.\u00a0Writing brings me joy, makes me discover myself anew and challenges me all the same. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI wanna keep writing and learning. I wanna encourage others to pursue\u00a0their dreams, even if life can get in the way. I wanna share the joy writing brings me with others and I\u00a0would love if you would help me become the full-time writer I always dreamed to be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me,\u003c/strong\u003e you will gain early or exclusive\u00a0access to my stories, some of which I won\u0027t share anywhere else. Furthermore, I\u0027d like to post sneak-peaks, insight on my writing process and NSFW content. I\u0027d also be more than happy to write \u003cem\u003ecommissions\u003c/em\u003e and personal requests for my\u00a0patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m still trying to figure out how all of this works, so I\u0027ll probably add to this. Thank you for taking your\u00a0time reading this, I\u0027d be forever grateful for some support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
