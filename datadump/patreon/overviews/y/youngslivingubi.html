    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eIt was August 2008 and I was lucky to get my first teaching job in California right out of University. And then the Financial Crisis of 2008 hit a month later. This meant layoffs in my district for teachers up to 7 or 8 years of experience. The next 5 years I struggled to be hired and rehired in my district columbinating in the 2011-2012 school year when I taught a self-contained classroom of sixteen 8th Grade students that were too disruptive for the mainstream schedule (Think The Wire Season 4).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"3 rules\" I was told, \"1. Teach them whatever you want, 2. Make them like school, 3. Try not get them to drop-out.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy saving grace that year became a link between the Sonoma County Office of Education and Entrepreneurial Curriculum they were piloting. You see 95% of those students were not going to college, Junior College would be an excellent step. Having success with this Entrepreneurial Education. I took some\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.bizworld.com\"\u003eintroductory curriculum\u003c/a\u003e with me to my next two schools over a 5 year period (2012-2017).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday with my belief in Universal Basic Income I want to spend the next 14-18 months researching and writing a book with the hypothesis:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"\u003eIs UBI the best Conclusion to 21st Century Education?\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eBetween August 2017 and December 2018 I plan to research how creating a UBI system for all Americans, but especially one that supports 17, 18, 19 year olds can help propell the USA into a new sphere of economics, as well as support the thousands of jobs being lost every year to work automation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the same time I will be going through the same process: creating, maintaining and sustaining my own online International Travel and Travel Guide business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT IS THE CONCEPT OF UBI:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea of creating and making a profit/income has been debated for centuries by everyone from Aristotle to Adam Smith. However within the last 100 years a concept of basic income has created by John Maynard Keynes, an economist known for his \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/29/how-much-is-enough-skidelsky-review\"\u003efuturist and capitalistic views after the 1928 Great Depression started\u003c/a\u003e. I have been influenced by Keynes ideas that capitalism will strive to the point where everyone on earth will have what they need, thus they should work less and spend more time in \"leisure\". \u003cbr\u003eKeynes estimated within 100 years technology would be so advanced that machines would take the place of humans, and profit and consumption would be at such a high level, humans would have everything we would need to live a successful, happy life. Have we reached this point? This is why a\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9xVWOfXW7U\"\u003e Basic Income for all\u003c/a\u003e can eliminate poverty and help \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ddemocracy94/status/855976224996315138\"\u003ereduce environmental issues\u003c/a\u003e and climate change. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWITH A BASIC INCOME, I WILL STILL WORK. \u003cbr\u003eJust as \u003ca href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/08/13/432122637/keynes-predicted-we-would-be-working-15-hour-weeks-why-was-he-so-wrong\"\u003eKeynes suggest, I plan to work 15-20\u003c/a\u003e hours a week creating my online Travel business. Also, I aim to create resources, materials, in an online format for people to learn from a UBI family that lives off a crowdsourced income to support my own entrepreneurial ideas over a 14 month period. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT I HOPE OUR UBI ADVOCACY WILL BRING:\u003cbr\u003eAs stated previously, I hope to blend my experience in the field of education and entrepreneurial curriculum to write a book in 2019 that discusses how UBI can change the way we look at both K-12 and Higher Education in America. An Entrepreneurial Cycle supported by UBI can also support all communities in the USA from Coastal to Middle America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY I BECAME A BASIC INCOME ADVOCATE?\u003cbr\u003eWhile traveling the global my wife Brittney and I have been impacted by cultures that value a balance of the earth\u0027s resources, with human interaction. Cultural philosophies like \u003ca href=\"http://www.baliaround.com/tri-hita-karana-three-balinese-wisdom-concept/\"\u003eTri Hita Karana\u003c/a\u003e from Bali or \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/buen-vivir-philosophy-south-america-eduardo-gudynas\"\u003eBuen Vivir\u003c/a\u003e in Ecuador mention a harmony between human consumption and the Earth\u0027s ability to replenish itself. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why when I read that the \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/23/developing-poor-countries-de-develop-rich-countries-sdgs\"\u003eUnited Nations 2017 on the Sustainable Developmental Goals may include a call to reduce consumption\u003c/a\u003e and bring awareness to regional consumption of products I was interested. Or as Adam Smith once said, \"The real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I read there was a correlation between consumption and personal happiness, I was sold. Like Dr. Jane Goodall said about her impact moving towards her life\u0027s twilight at age 80, \"\u201cWhat I would really, really, really like to change, is the unsustainable lifestyle of (people who do not live in poverty).\u201d We agree! Our plan is to live simply yet richly (metaphorically). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerburg made news in Spring 2017 by calling for a way to look at a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJgNKXXhHe8\"\u003eUniversal Basic income for all in the future\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasic Income is not a new idea, and some countries/regions around the world are going through \u003ca href=\"https://futurism.com/images/seeing-stars-the-fast-radio-telescope/\"\u003etest stage of data collection to measure their success\u003c/a\u003e. Our goal is to create easy to use documents for individuals, families, and communities to use as blueprints. These can be used before or after BI becomes more common as our resources, political, and economic status as humans continues to change throughout the 21st century. We will continue to ask ourselves: how many years would our child be using our material? How many years before they turn 65 in 2082 would they have been receiving a BI?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe need your help too!
