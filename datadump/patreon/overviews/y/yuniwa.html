I\u0027m a struggling artist as of right now and I\u0027m barely getting by. I\u0027ve been making music since I was 14 its something I truly love but since I lost my job last February due to a lung infection things have been really hard. Everything given will go to my living expenses or new music equipment and no matter what I will not stop delivering good quality music to the supporters that I love and that have helped me come so far. I want to grow and become big enough to where I can travel away from home and DJ shows, be able to work with bigger artists and hopefully build enough resources to take my music to a higher level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Love\u003cbr\u003eThe.
