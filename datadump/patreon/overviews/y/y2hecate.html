    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHihi!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Nikki, I go by Y2Hecate pretty much everywhere online, since forever (1997), and I\u0027m a part-time professional artist. I\u0027ve been drawing for as long as I can remember, but pursuing art as a career since high school, circa 2000. I have a BFA in Studio Art, concentrating on Sequential Art (Comics \u0026amp; Animation), and currently do freelance/commission work in my spare time. Ideally I would like to make the jump to full-time art - working on comics, illustration, games, and other projects, appearing at conventions to sell my wares, and help give instructional panels, etc. while still adulting and paying evil bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy personal goal is to create a monthly piece of finished art to share!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge, know it\u0027s a PER CREATION pledge. (ex. You pledge $5 per creation, if I make 4 Paid Content posts in a month, you would be charged $20. If you do not want to pledge that much support, change your pledge or set your maximum amount appropriately.)\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I\u0027ve got this set up Per Creation instead of Per Month, is mainly because I don\u0027t want anyone getting charged money if life happens, and I don\u0027t finish a main illustration/project in a month. You should only pay for the thing, if I do the thing!\u003cbr\u003eI also don\u0027t plan to make a ton of Paid Content posts. So don\u0027t worry about racking up charges. My plan is for only ONE finished Patreon Illustration per month max. All other art will still be posted, but not as Paid Content. If this changes, Patrons will be notified before-hand, so they can make pledge adjustments if needed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this Patreon isn\u0027t to put all my art behind a money wall. It\u0027s to somewhat fund more time for art/take fewer hours at my day job.\u003cbr\u003e\nI also want to use this Patreon to more closely collaborate with my audience; creating things that we all enjoy and can learn from. I want to use my art to help any other aspiring artists out there, as I have been helped, with advice and inspiration.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m new to the Patreon thing, so expect some changes to tiers and goals as I go - I\u0027m starting small and will change/add goals and rewards as I get used to the process and schedule, or as you guys help me decide what to work on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDon\u0027t worry if you can\u0027t/don\u0027t want to pledge. I don\u0027t intend to post any less free art in my usual galleries and websites than before. Patrons get additional perks, like seeing stuff sooner, getting to help pick themes, and getting some extras like more progress shots, high res files, random sketches, etc. :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere are some examples of extras I want to \u003cem\u003eeventually \u003c/em\u003eoffer Patrons:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to my Patreon feed, where you will see:\n\t\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFinished pieces early, before anywhere else online.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProgress sketches/random doodles that I don\u0027t usually share.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEarly notice of live art casts \u0026amp; Q\u0026amp;A chats.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTutorials and progress videos.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSpecial variants (NSFW and other) of finished pictures.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHigh-Res printable files of finished pictures.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSigned, numbered, limited edition, poster prints.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSwag items \u0026amp; Commission raffles (Raffles are a thing I will do on my own and ask you to sign up for off-site, as Patreon doesn\u0027t allow forms of gambling.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026amp; More as we come up with fun stuff!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nSo, if you\u0027d like to support an artist, get exclusive updates, be the first to see new projects, have input in what you see from me next, and get various goodies in thanks for your support, then please consider making a pledge.
