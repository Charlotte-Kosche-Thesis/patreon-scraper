Courses are numbered as 1, 2, 3..... so that you will know which video(course) you use in your Yoga practices. Each video(course) is \u00a0the course for the practice of the week. For instance Video3(Course3) is your third week\u0027s practice. \u00a0Practicing each week\u0027s video 2 times(days)in relevant week is ideal for students. Determine a schedule for Yoga practices that you can follow according to your daily flow of live and stick with it as much as you can. In this way, one can maintain the schedule and form \u00a0healthy habit of Yoga practices. Once a week is the minimum. You can practice 2 times, 4 times or more or everday in a week. Everybody should start from video1(course1) and continue consequently. It doesn\u0027t matter how flexible you are, how strong you are. You can be\u00a0balerin or a very successful soccer player or a professional sportman or performer. Or you may think you are advanced or you are a begginer. You \u00a0can have heart problems, spine problems, hernia,\u00a0Fibromyalgia, spasm etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is because Yoga, when it is practiced originally, \u00a0is not just about the body. It is a integrated personal development system at all levels body, mind, emotions, soul, energitic levels. Yoga\u00a0transforms your energies, increases the vibrations. \u00a0Every emotion and every thought is energy.For example, \u00a0Love is energy. Hate is the low vibration of love energy.

In\nthis way, in each Yoga session with the application of 8 stages both the\ntechniques in each stage are performed more correctly and effectively, but also\nin the next Yoga session, techniques in each stage are performed at a more\nadvanced level.  For this reason, not\nonly the sequence of the techniques in one Yoga session is important but also\nthe determination of the program and progress of the courses in the consecutive\nsessions are interrelated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHINGS\nTO KNOW ABOUT YOGA\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYoga is a\nuniversal and the most effective personal development system that humankind has\nwhen it is practiced in its \u003cem\u003eoriginal\u003c/em\u003e\nway. When the word Yoga is used in this article, Yoga practices that are\nperformed in the original way are meant; and all the things that are stated\nhere are valid for these kinds of practices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nYoga is the most\neffective sport:\u003c/em\u003e Without forcing the body, i.e. muscles, joints, cardiovascular\nsystem, respiratory system etc. and without causing fatigue and exhaustion,\nYoga provides to take the best  form that\nyour  DNAs allows you to have with the\nregular and persistent practices; Yoga can also provide you with the\nopportunity  to go  beyond even  your genetic limitations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYoga is therapeutic\nand detoxifying methodology:\u003c/em\u003e Yoga does not only strengthen and stretch muscles\nbut also active internal organs and glands. Yoga affects fundamentally endocrine\nand nervous systems. By the its positive effects on endocrine and nervous\nsystems, the other systems work in balance and organism gain and protect its\nhealth. It is an unrivaled tool to gain the spinal health back and to protect\nthe spinal form and health. Diseases and disorders result from the distortion\nof mental and physical balances in the organism. Regular Yoga practices is a\nrequirement to protect the balance and health especially for people those who\nare living in the big and crowded cities far away from the nature and under\nheavy stress. Diseases and disorders, at their first stages, cause distortions\nand blockages at the energetic dimension, then they are felt physically and\ncreates problems in the harmonic functioning of the organism. With regular Yoga\npractices, blockages are removed, imbalances are fixed; and energy field of the\nindividual becomes stronger. Yoga both keeps the potential of the body at the\nmaximum level to heal and fight the diseases and also diseases are cured\nwithout materializing in the physical dimension. During Yoga practices, all\ninternal organs get smooth massages and the parts that blood and lymph\ncirculation has gotten stagnant are activated; and accumulated toxins in these\nareas return to circulation and removed from the body.  At this point, the existence of the stages in\nperforming postures, that is, entering to the posture, staying in the posture,\ncoming-out of the posture and the relaxation after the posture and the\nimportance of correct breathing need to be highlighted. Toxins that are released\nand returned to circulation during the performance of the postures are removed\nwith breathing, and the areas that are cleaned from the waste and accumulated\ntoxins are fed with highly oxygenated blood. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYoga is the most\neffective personal development system\u003c/em\u003e: Yoga gives mental and psychological strength\nand balance by reducing and eliminating the effects of negative thoughts and\nfeelings on mind and body. Increased level of awareness that are reached by\nthis strength and balance leads a decision making process that serves most to\nthe person\u2019s individual development by providing the better understanding of\nself and environment. Yoga, about which pages long explanations can be made, in\na nutshell is the user guide of human body that we reside in.  The positive actions that you are going to\ntake by learning how it works not only will improve your personal life and\nexperiences but also will be the steps taken for creating a more positive\nsociety and the World.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYoga has 8 stages\u003c/strong\u003e: Yama (Universal\nAction Principles), Niyama (Personal Action Principles), Asanas (Postures),\nPranayama (Breathing and Bioenergy techniques), Pratyahara (Chakra, Kundalini\nand Astral Techniques), Dharana (Concentration), Dyana (Meditation), Samadhi (Supermeditation)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYama and Niyama\u003c/strong\u003e principles presented in original Yoga sources,\nwhich are opening the way to gain universal perspective and better\nunderstanding of individuals own actions and their results, are the principles\nfor strengthening and speeding up the purification process that is obtained by\nYoga practices and for exponentially increasing the awareness which is the result\nof yoga practices. While the individual is progressing in Yoga practices,\nactions that are in conformity with Yama and Niyama principles occur naturally.\nThe individual reaches such a high level of awareness and consciousness that\nhe/she is not able to feel sad or hate even though he/she wants to do so by clings\nto his/her past habits or old mental conditioning. This does not mean that the\nindividual wears pink glasses all the time or suppress his/her feelings,\nactually the exact opposite occurs, i.e not wearing any glasses, seeing the\nreality as it is. Because the experience of seeing the reality as it is, not\nfrom the window of mind,  helps the\nindividual to find constructive solutions to all problems that he/she faces\nwhich put the person in a mental and emotional state where there is no place\nfor disappointment, desperation, fear, worry, rage and hate.   You\nwill not fight with the rocks or mountains blocking in your path; you will\nbecome like water and flow around its edges.  Apart from this mental and emotional strength\nthat you gain for the outside influences, Yoga also provides one to perceive\nall the negativity inside of his/her own by putting light on the oneself and\nbringing awareness of selfish acts and wishes, mental conditionings and\nprograms which cause negative situations for both oneself and the others. With\nthe awareness of these, the individual understands his/her share/role in every situation\nand experience that he/she had.  By understanding of that he/she is the one who\nholds the responsibility for his/her own life, the individual makes his/her\nchoices in life accordingly with a complete maturity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAsanas (Postures)\u003c/strong\u003e are Yoga postures, not gymnastic movements;\nthey are specific body postures. Asanas are ought to be performed in a sequence\nso that the effects that are mentioned above can occur. That is, the important\nthing is not to perform Asanas one by one rather to perform them in an order. It\nis quite like a constructing a building from the bottom to the top. Asanas are\nthe first stagethat prepare body and mind for the next stages.  They eliminates the tension in body and mind,\nremove the blockages in the energy channels and fields. Asanas prepares the\nbody, mind and energy channels for the next stages without causing any imbalances\nin body and mind and without pushing the limits of body and mind. Asanas allow getting\nthe most out of from Pranayama techniques. There are hundreds of Asanas; and Yoga\npractices is programmed in such a way that the order of Asanas  not only in one session but also  in the next sessions are interrelated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePranayama (Breathing and Bioenergy techniques),\u003c/strong\u003e in the physical level, improve the health of\nrespiratory system and develops the breathing capacity, speeds up the\nregeneration process by increasing the oxygen level in the blood, hence, in the\ncells. In the energetic level, Pranayama eliminates and removes the blockages\nin the energy channels and centers, fills up the energy channels and centers\nwith universal energy, which is called prana, and activates the energy centers.\nThere are hundreds of Pranayama techniques; it is very important to apply these\ntechniques at the right time and in the right way; otherwise techniques may\ncreate tension in the respiratory and nervous systems, may give damage to the\nheart and brain, and may cause adverse psychological effects. It should not be\nforgotten that Pranayama, i.e breathing exercises, is just the one of the\nstages in Yoga, is just a part of  a whole.\n Bioenergy techniques are a part of the\nPranamaya stage in Yoga.  Bioenergy techniques\nremoves and activates the energy layers which \nsurrounds the physical body, and by strengthening the energy field (the\nterm \u201caura\u201d is related to energy field and describes just  one of the functions of energy field) protects\nthe individual from the negative outside energies. When the psychosomatic\nnature of the energy is understood, the puzzle of how Yoga can be so powerful\nin every aspect of human nature is solved.  However, the only way to understand this is\npracticing Yoga regularly and persistently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePratyahara \u003c/strong\u003e(Chakra, Kundalini and Astral Techniques) is the\nstage where deep relaxation is experienced and conscious relaxation is learnt.\nThe most powerful healing occurs when the body is deeply relaxed. The ability\nof relaxing consciously has important effects on brain functions. In this\nstage, the perception and awareness of energetic dimension improve. Chakras,\nwhich are the energy centres in the body, function as the doors where universal\nenergy goes into the body.  When these\nentrances are blocked, the energy that enlivens the body is restraint.  Chakra techniques eliminate blockages in the\nchakras, balance and activate the chakra system of the body that is  comprised of 7 main and 6 intermediate\nchakras. Kundalini techniques prepare the body for awakening and rising of the\nKundalini energy that is located in the body potentially. It is described as\nevolutionary energy due to the fact the activation and rise of this energy\nactivate the parts of the brain part that is not used. The Kundalini energy is\npotentially located in the body for individual\u2019s spiritual development and\nevolution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDharana (Concentration)\u003c/strong\u003e\nstage involves the application of specific techniques to increase the\nconcentration power of the mind. This is the very first step of \u003cstrong\u003eDyana\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e(Meditation)\u003c/strong\u003e.  Due to insufficient\nand incorrect information and experience, concentration (Dharana) and\nmeditation (Dyana) are considered to be the same things. Dharana techniques\ndevelop the concentration power needed for successful application of meditation\ntechniques by releasing the negative mental energies and increasing the\npositive energies. Dyana is, however, fundamentally comprised of the techniques\nthat provide the individual to experience real inner self. Required mental\npower and concentration to be able to apply these techniques correctly are\ngained in Dharana stage. Listening to music, dancing, focusing on a work or\nfocusing on a thought is to use the mind for something you love, enjoy or\nwhatever purpose you have. This is neither Dharana(concentration) nor\nDyana(meditation). In Dharana, Dyana and Samadhi, the purpose is to go beyond\nthe mind not to use it.  In Dyana, the\nhigher levels of consciousness are experienced. The mind is an energetic\nstructure; so are the thoughts and feelings.  The mind and how the mind works in the context\nof this article can be explained with the following metaphor: If the mind is\nlike a sea; using the mind is like creating riffles in the sea. Listening to\nmusic, thinking, dancing, experience an emotion etc. they all cause the mind to\nvibrate like riffles in the sea. When the surface of sea is flat, one can see\nthe bottom of the sea.  In Dharana, one\ngains the ability to stops the riffles in the sea and in Dyana, real inner self\nis experienced like being able to see the bottom of sea.  \u003cstrong\u003eSamadi\n\u003c/strong\u003e(supermeditation) is the highest state of consciousness where the\nintegration between the Universal Soul and individual soul occurs. When the\nmind loses the feeling of the distinction of individual self, Individual soul\nunites with the Universal Soul.  There is\nno clear-cut distinction between Dharna-Dyana-Samadhi stages. This process is\nlike falling into sleep; happens naturally. The important thing is the\nawareness of the fact that Dhara, Dyana and Samadhi is not sitting in a cross\nleg position and diving into ideas. In fact, everything that is done until Dhara,\nDyana and Samadhi prepares body and mind for these stages. That is, previous\nstages  heal, strengthen and relax the\nbody in order for one to sit in a meditation position for a long time and  teach the mind so that one can apply the\nmeditation techniques at ease. It should be emphasized that the most effective\nhealing occurs in Dyana (Meditation) stage. Therefore, one of the biggest\nmisunderstandings is that mediation and Yoga are different things or the same\nthings. Meditation,i.e. Dyana, is the seventh stage of Yoga. Meditation is not\nYoga. Or Yoga is not meditation. At this point that misunderstandings about\nYoga is emphasized, it should be stated that Yoga does not belong to any\nreligion. Religions like Buddizm and Hinduizm make additions to their rituals\nfrom Yoga.  For instance, in some sects\nof Hinduizm, chanting to their gods is performed under the name of meditation\npractice and named it as a \u201c\u2026. Yoga\u201d as if there were many kinds of Yoga.  As a result, many kinds of Yoga have been produced,\nwhich cause a big confusion and lack of information about What Yoga is. While\nYoga provides incomparable benefits for human-beings when it is applied in the\ncorrect and original way, incorrect applications may bring serious harm ranging\nfrom psychical injuries to psychological disorders.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven\nthough there exist 8 different stages in Yoga, there is interaction between\neach stage and they work as a whole. In each Yoga practice, one get the most\nout of it  when applying the techniques\nas much as he can without forcing the body; and the whole system, body and\nmind, is improved one step further. For instance, when one comes to Dharana\n(concentration) stage, one\u2019s ability to focus improves as much as possible in\nthat Yoga session. This improvement will increase the ability to apply Asanas with\nmore concentration, which leads to more correct application of Asanas. This\nwill allow one to apply Pranayama techniques with an increased capacity, and\nlike chain reaction, this will strengthen the body, mind and energetic field in\na way that techniques in the rest of the stages will applied more effectively.\nIn this way, in each Yoga session with the application of 8 stages both the\ntechniques in each stage are performed more correctly and effectively, but also\nin the next Yoga session, techniques in each stage are performed at a more\nadvanced level.  For this reason, not\nonly the sequence of the techniques in one Yoga session is important but also\nthe determination of the program and progress of the course in the consecutive\nsessions are interrelated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe information\nabout Yoga may motivate one. The important thing is always the practice.\nWithout practice, just taking the information does not provide any\nprogress.  With the combination of theory\nand practice, the progress occurs at the maximum level. Based on my experience,\nthe most useful advice that I can give to students is: Determine a schedule for\nYoga practices that you can follow according to your daily flow of live and stick\nwith it as much as you can. Even tough, you are going to feel the positive\neffects in your first practice, to form such a discipline will\nbring you in a place where you will practice Yoga without the need of any\nmotivation like taking a shower.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
