As their paths slowly intertwine with those of four elemental beings in a parallel universe filled with monsters, magic, and treacherous secrets, the ancient mystery that keeps their worlds apart begins to unfold\u2026 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow your support helps:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started what would become Torus Link, I did not have confidence in it. \u003cbr\u003eI had a group of main characters whose stories I was passionate about; elements I wanted show in them (quite literally the elements fire, water, earth, and air), NO idea how I could ever bring them all together and solve their conflicts... and so so so sooooo little faith in my abilities to share a story that\u0027s about the heart of me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I went abroad for the first time in my utterly shy life, to study illustration in Scotland. And what happened to me there put me on my path--- I knew that I had to share this story\u2026 and that somehow, I would. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I started a website on my own, learning basic coding, and refining rough edges as I went. I struggled day after day to compile sketches, world maps, character charts, outlines, thumbnails of pages, designs, and concepts of the Torus Link world.  I\u0027ve worked endlessly writing, drawing, and coloring pages. I\u0027ve BELIEVED in this story, my love for its characters pushing me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI keep producing TL and putting it online for free both because I love it, and because I am determined to tell a different kind of story about relationships\u2026 that shows how our dreams, our true selves, and our ties to one another are all connected. However, doing so requires me the time and effort of a full-time job, without enough resources to support myself IN that full-time job effort. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your patronage, you give me means of support that I can fully dedicate myself to sharing this story, that it can inspire others to overcome the obstacles to their dreams; to living to what\u0027s true in their hearts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get in return (along with this awesome story!): \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLinked Up: Exclusive access to any mini comics, special drawings, sketches, and trivia I upload, plus any additional accessories featured in my videos on Youtube such as music clips and more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://toruslink.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2_28_18-patreon-video-me-sample.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Gold Linked: \u003cstrong\u003eMonthly collections of Torus Link character and development sketches! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://toruslink.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2_28_18-patreon-sketch-sample-2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlatinum Linked:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonthly collections of Torus Link world-building concept sketches! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://toruslink.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5_21_18-convent-exterior-concept-Patreon-Sample.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy sincerest thanks for your patronage and support. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://toruslink.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10_29_17-You-rock-Ren-trophy.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
