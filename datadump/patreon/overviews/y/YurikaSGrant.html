    "summary": "Welcome to\nYuritopia. My name\u2019s Yurika, and I\u2019ll be your \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_(genre)\"\u003eyuri\u003c/a\u003e guide for today and,\nI hope, the foreseeable future going forward. It is a scientific fact that girl\nlove is 1723% more healthy for you than going for a 26 mile run, so stay awhile\nand enjoy my stories. You know it makes sense.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll\nsilliness aside, welcome to my humble Patreon! I write, for the most part,\nyuri/lesbian fiction in a cute and playful sort of flavour. Drama features when\nnecessary and sometimes I\u2019ll write things that can be pretty serious, but my\nspecialities lean more towards cute, fun, naughty, and playful. I focus most heavily\non serial content with ongoing, overarching stories split into individual arcs\nfocusing on specific characters, relationships, or plot threads.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJapan and\nJapanese culture are a huge source of inspiration for me, both their games/anime\nand in general, so a lot of my fiction has similar genres/themes with my own\ntwists. I love idols and magical girls, so those feature, but I also write\nother things like sci-fi and fantasy in a more western style. And often I\u2019ll\ncombine these different genres and styles into one setting. Both \u003ca href=\"https://www.ysgrant.net/aida-an-idol-romance/\"\u003eAida\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.ysgrant.net/starlight/\"\u003eStarlight\u003c/a\u003e, my two main works right\nnow, are good examples of this!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI often\nuse an easy-going writing style I would describe as chatty and conversational, with\nlots of character interaction and dialogue while building an interesting world\nin the background. Some of my works are erotic with sexy scenes, some are\nmerely naughty and suggestive, others have FxF relationships without being\novertly sexual. It just depends what I happen to feel like and what fits the\nstory in question.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor\nspecifics on my fiction works, please see the \u003ca href=\"https://ysgrant.net/yurika-fiction/\"\u003etop menu on my site\u003c/a\u003e. And if you\nenjoy the content here and would like to help me do more, you can support me here\non \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/YurikaSGrant\"\u003ePatreon\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.makersupport.com/YurikaSGrant\"\u003eMakerSupport\u003c/a\u003e (Patreon is\nthe main, MakerSupport is a backup in the event Patreon do \u003ca href=\"https://blog.patreon.com/not-rolling-out-fees-change/\"\u003esomething stupid\nagain\u003c/a\u003e), or you can \u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/YurikaSGrant\"\u003ebuy me a coffee\u003c/a\u003e\nor two, sometimes known as Writer Fuel, if you\u2019d rather not commit to a monthly\npayment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll\npatrons get additional content in the form of spin-off stories for the main\nworks that wouldn\u2019t really fit in the main narrative. At $3 a month you get\nfull access to all my novels and novellas several months before they go up on\nAmazon (at the current time this is \u003ca href=\"https://ysgrant.net/aida-an-idol-romance/\"\u003eAida\u003c/a\u003e book 1 and book 2,\nplus two upcoming novellas).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd at $5\nyou get all of the above plus early access to drafts, sneak peaks, notification\nof upcoming works before anyone else, and maybe even a look at old drafts,\nnotes, and other things I\u2019d never normally share publically.
