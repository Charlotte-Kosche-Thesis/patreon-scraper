    "summary": "First off, thank you for your interest in my writing. My patrons make all the difference in my ability to keep doing the things I love: writing and sharing that writing with people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Because I have more projects than sense? Because I write more than just one thing - I have the \u003cem\u003eVampires\u0027 Three Jewels\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0novel series (first draft of the first novel finally finished!), a new semi-personal zine, and a whole bunch of short stories in all sorts of contexts. Patreon is the modern-yet-traditional way for an artist to get funding and I\u0027ve long felt my odds are better here, as a queer POC, than in traditional publishing. Queer stories are gaining ground in traditional publishing, yes, but only certain queer stories told in certain ways and/or by certain voices. I\u0027m not giving up on more traditional publishing altogether, but I\u0027m pessimistic enough to think I\u0027m going to need your help to get there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Some of my content will always, eventually, be free to the public, it\u0027s true. It\u0027s also true that, at some point, both the zine and the novel will most likely be available for purchase outside of Patreon. BUT supporting me here will get you those things faster. PLUS you\u0027ll have those good karma points from knowing you\u0027re supporting the voice of a queer, disabled Woman of Color.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOTE: There will be times when the content I post may be somewhat erotic in nature. It\u0027s always text and only text, and I will always make it completely clear if an entry has sexual content (and if that content is gay, straight, or other).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere\u0027s your intro video?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0To put it bluntly, I don\u0027t have one because having to produce a video with my face and voice would trigger my dysphoria to an extent that is just... not something I can force myself to do. Obviously, since I\u0027ve been on Patreon for awhile now and still haven\u0027t made a video. There\u0027s not anything a video would say that isn\u0027t here in the text available anyway. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eREWARD INFO\u003c/h4\u003eOr what you get for giving me your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eReward Tier 0: pledge any amount to unlock weekly progress update posts. Also unlocks early access to the first issue of \u003cem\u003eOtra Vez M\u00e1s\u003c/em\u003e and the first Dragons short story.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReward Tier 1: pledge at least $1 to unlock pre-release access to fanfiction and self-challenge fiction posts. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReward Tier 2: pledge at least $2 to unlock access to at least some of the Dragons short stories.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReward Tier 3: pledge at least $5 to unlock the first reward token, token-exchange fiction posts and the rest of the Dragons short stories.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReward Tier 4: pledge at least $10 to unlock a second reward token and regular access to issues of\u00a0\u003cem\u003eOtra Vez M\u00e1s.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReward Tier 5: pledge at least $15 to unlock regular pre-release access to finished Dragons short stories.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReward Tier 6: pledge at least $25 to unlock a third reward token and content polls.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReward Tier 7: pledge at least $50 to unlock the fourth and fifth reward tokens, access to beta drafts of \u003cem\u003eVampires\u0027 Three Jewels\u003c/em\u003e, and early access to any NEW projects.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eSo what are reward tokens and how do they work? Simple: one token is worth 200 words of YOUR CHOICE of fiction. You pick the universe and prompt, I do the writing. At this time, tokens NEVER EXPIRE, so if you want to collect them until you have enough to insist I write a 50+k word epic ... well, it\u0027ll take you awhile, but yeah, sure, go ahead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[ If I later decide to put an expiration date on tokens, I promise there will be plenty of warning. ]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of how Patreon\u0027s payment system works, tokens will not be credited to patrons until the month AFTER you pledge - once a pledge has been processed into a payment, your \"account,\" so to speak, with me will be credited with the matching reward token(s). Tokens are unlocked according to the above tier system (so, for example, all pledges between $25 and $49.99 will still receive only 3 tokens. Only pledges above $50 will unlock the 4th (and 5th) token).\u003cbr\u003e"
