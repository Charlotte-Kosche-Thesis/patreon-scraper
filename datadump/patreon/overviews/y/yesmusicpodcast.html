Many listeners have contributed via voicemails, comments, sending in photos and writing reviews. This meant that the website was getting slow as it tried to cope with the volume of interaction and the amount of content already there. Unfortunately, some listeners lost comments they had spent time writing or were frustrated waiting for the website to load. We have now moved to a new home thanks to the support of Patrons! Thank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNow we can concentrate on keeping the show running for another 6 years and developing new features like the mobile apps and more!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have enjoyed listening to the podcast we\u0027d love to welcome you as a patron and you can pledge as little as $1 a month. All contributions are most welcome.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, show your support for the podcast and, more importantly, the world\u0027s greatest progressive rock band - YES!\n\u003cbr\u003e"
