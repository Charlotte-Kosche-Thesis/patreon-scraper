    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to YOGA ON TAP! Canada\u0027s first mobile beer + yoga studio offering classes, workshops + events that combine three of our favourite things - FITNESS, BEER, COMMUNITY!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSince 2015 YOGA ON TAP has been combining fitness + beer through fun community programming to create a conversation around physical + mental health, encouraging participants to make them both more of a priority by making choice + taking responsibility.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo much of our unhappiness + poor health is caused by the choices we make + things we prioritize as \"most important\" in our day to day. We have millions of choices available to us, something that can easily become overwhelming because we aren\u0027t always certain about which one is correct. Similarly, with a spike in the craft beer industry, there is now a craft brewery around every corner in most large cities + at least one in close radius for more rural locations! That is too much awesomeness to experience, especially if you don\u0027t know the difference between a lager and an ale or ESB from Pale Ale. Where to start?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo next thing you know you\u0027re trying all the beers out there + still 6 months later you haven\u0027t learned anything about these beverages you\u0027ve been consuming or where they come from because you\u0027ve been distracted by everything else around you + your to-do list in your head. Apply this scenario to the choices we have in other areas in our lives + we begin to see a big theme linking them together. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eChoice\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eis always available to us but the challenge is to take control of each moment to make the right one + then own it regardless of it\u0027s outcome. Why work a job you don\u0027t like + why spend the money you make from that job on things that aren\u0027t adding value to your life? If you don\u0027t really care for the beer you\u0027re drinking, why are you drinking it? It is this responsibility we take over our choices that leads us to better prioritization of things that matter, which is directly linked to our physical + mental health as well as overall happiness in life.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBased out of Ottawa, Canada, we are excited to share our products + services with you through Patreon so you can experience the health + happiness that comes from practicing an active + balanced lifestyle from anywhere in the world! Free yourself from physical tension + mental clutter so you can mindfully enjoy the things that matter most!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what are you waiting for? Grab a beer, your yoga mat + let\u0027s practice! We\u0027ll be uploading only a few number of programs to tune into at first but with your support this can grow not only the # of classes available but also our goal of one day opening our own studio! With gratitude,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#YOGAONTAP\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.yogaontap.ca\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.yogaontap.ca\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/yoga.ontap\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@ yoga.ontap\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"mailto:cheers@yogaontap.ca \"\u003echeers@yogaontap.ca\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
