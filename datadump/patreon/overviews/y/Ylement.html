    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello Everyone!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThree years ago, a lone spark triggered the creation of a new fantasy universe. Ever since, this universe has been continuously expanding; it eventually became known as the world of Timepact. Now, it appears your curiosity has led you into this world. One echoing with ancient and mysterious magic, in which adventure awaits those brave enough to seek it. A world pulsating with the emotions carried deep within the souls of the characters, whose journeys have shaped the course of this tale. Stories of the many beings, scattered across the island of Arvaleen, from the spiritually linked members of the Erek\u2019Khar race, to the mighty, intimidating tribes of the Furudem, yet not without the presence and cleverness of Humans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTimepact: The Twin Bond\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"We Temporals watched over the worlds that had been granted to us. We forged the destinies of all forms of life roaming across our domain. We stared idly from a distance as their time dwindled and faded. From parent to child, we\u0027ve watched them changing, as wisdom was passed through their blood. A mere few, however, strayed away from their heritage, seeking a fate of their own.\"\u003c/em\u003e - \u003cstrong\u003eVithos, the last Temporal\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho\u2019s developing Timepact? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlex, Sebastian, Viesturs, Laura; aka. the writer, the designer, the coder, the marketer. More or less\u2026 The strength of our team consists of our multidisciplinary backgrounds and more importantly, of the overlap of skills that allowed us to forge the Timepact fantasy universe. We want to deliver a fantasy experience on a completely different scale, with constant artwork, community interaction, music and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake part with us in this wonderful journey!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been working on this project for nearly 3 years, next to university studies and our full time jobs that allowed us to keep this dream alive with the desire to one day share it with all of you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you enjoy creativity and share our burning passion for storytelling? Then we\u2019d love to welcome you to our community, where you\u0027ll become an essential part in the development of the Timepact Universe!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
