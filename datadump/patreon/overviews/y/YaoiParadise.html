    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eHello internet! My name is Leveret Moreau, but feel free to call me Lev (it\u0027s less letters).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a twenty-something, gender fluid child playing at being an adult. I am also a self-published writer trying to make his way in the world, and hoping to be able to put my entire effort into writing. Unfortunately, that takes a lot of effort and a lot of support from dedicated fans- like you. Every donation is hugely appreciated, and I do my best to make it worth your time and donation!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as working under my own name, I also work with Siryn Seung under the pen name Lilia Blanc; we\u0027re working on a major series together, and have just published our debut work with Inkitt, \u0027King\u0027s Lament\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat should I expect from your novels?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere is only one guarantee with my projects- an LGBT focus which promotes tolerance and acceptance. Though most main characters are gay men, supporting cast spans the range of lesbian, transgender, or any other label under the widening umbrella of the term, the main characters are simply outside the \u0027normal\u0027, whitewashed straight character seen in most books.     From there, my projects span genres, though most of what you\u0027ll find is dark and/or urban fantasy with the occasional science fiction or slice-of-life exploration. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost, if not all, of my novels are an emotional journey from beginning to end, featuring deeply designed characters set in just the right plot to be tortured in every way I can thing of- though they\u0027re usually lucky enough to obtain their \u0027happily ever after\u0027 by the end of the serial.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you working on?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI always have a few projects going on at the same time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy main project is\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eBlood Moon \u003c/strong\u003e(werewolves). The whole first book of the novel is finished, and we have just begun work on the comic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow long are your projects?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe length of every project depends on the depth and complexity of the plot. Each project is exactly as long as the plot demands to properly portray the characters and put them through just the right amount of hell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a rule of thumb, slice-of-life novels tend to be shorter, closer to normal novel length, while fantasy novels tend to be longer, up to several novels\u0027 worth in each serial novel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere do I find new chapters?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe majority of my works are being posted on Tapas, which can be found both on the web and on the mobile app. They are also available on wattpad, also a web and app availability. You\u0027ll be looking for \u0027YaoiParadise\u0027 in either of those places, but I\u0027m sure you knew that ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a quick link to Tapas, where I put most of my energy and also where all of the comic versions of my projects are posted, please click here:\u00a0https://tapas.io/YaoiParadise\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often are new chapters posted?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, it\u0027s a little sporadic. I have a full time job, I\u0027m chipping away at a small business management degree, and living with a busy family. I\u0027m doing my best to get back on a regular schedule, and will announce that when it\u0027s here!\u003cbr\u003e"
