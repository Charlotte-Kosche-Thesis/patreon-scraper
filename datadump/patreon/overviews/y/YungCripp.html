I have Spinal Muscular Atrophy type 2 and have been wheelchair-bound since the age of five so going out and doing things to try and meet people is a bit more challenging, that is where the internet has been a blessing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making content as of recently in the form of Twitter videos and YouTube videos and people have been saying I do a good job and I\u0027m having a lot of fun doing it. I have more planned but the problem is that I don\u0027t have the means to do so as of right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeeing is that I have a disability I only have financial aid to help me get by and that doesn\u0027t leave a lot for any hobbies of any sorts. So any of the money that I would receive would go into helping making my channel grow and have better quality. New equipment, props, ect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to give back as much as I can to everybody that has been so generous to me throughout this whole process and period by making people laugh and smile. This whole thing with entertaining people on the internet has really given me a sense of purpose and drive that I haven\u0027t had before and I wanted to take advantage of it as much as I can.\u003cbr\u003e"

It really gives me a sense of pride and purpose whenever I can make content to brighten anyone\u0027s day whether it be with a funny laugh or some helpful advice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking videos has been something very life-changing and therapeutic for me as of lately and I want to continue doing this for as long as I can.\u003cbr\u003eI am a very friend believer of doing what it is that you love and anything else is just a plus that you gain. This is sort of my Plus. If anybody wants to help further support me and my  ability to do more content making by donating it would mean a lot more than you think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t want to play a sympathy card by bringing up my disability but it is a reality that I deal with and it does make things a bit hard when it comes to saving up money for better equipment and such. So any donations really would be put right back into either things for the channel or bettering my quality of life.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI think every single one of you from the bottom of my heart\u003cbr\u003e",
