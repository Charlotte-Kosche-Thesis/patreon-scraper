Official Card Game for an English-speaking audience, so that English-speaking players of the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game can look forward to those releases when they make their international debut. (Most of those releases make their journey from the OCG\u0027s regions of the world to the TCG\u0027s regions of the world within a few months.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t stop there, though. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen KONAMI posts a Q\u0026amp;A from the OCG, we bring the Q\u0026amp;A to you in a translated and easily-understood form, and we update our translations to ensure you have as much info as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen an OCG card is finally released for gameplay in the TCG, we continue our coverage by bringing you detailed information on the card\u0027s localized name and text, so that you can look for the cool cards you\u0027ve been waiting for at your local hobby shop.\u003cbr\u003eWhat about cards that are released in the TCG first? We inform the world about those too, including when they travel over to the OCG!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat about the anime? What about the manga? We cover them too, whenever we can - we want to be your favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! fan-made website, for both the card game and other matters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur hope is to help you have more fun, and our mission is to bring you the best information possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we will continue with all of our current content for free. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe fun has just begun - help us in our mission!\u003cbr\u003eWe have, so far, kept things going through our own efforts - we\u0027ve managed to find time and money to keep things rolling, and we\u0027re happy to do so. We want to cover Yu-Gi-Oh! news and entertainment for as long as Yu-Gi-Oh! exists. We are happy to serve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, we\u0027ve noticed that as more and more fans find us, the costs of running a free news site are beginning to hit us hard, even after accounting for the few advertisements we allow. The more visits we get, the more our server costs go up, for example - and our team cannot handle the costs alone forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also want to keep the number of advertisements on our website low, so that our visitors don\u0027t get flooded with unwelcome and annoying messages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also have a lot of ideas about what bigger things we might be able to do, if we had more time and resources. We want to cover more news and events, and we want to look into other cool ideas as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where this Patreon page comes in - we humbly ask for any help you can provide, so that we can continue what we\u0027ve started, and serve this community of fans and gamers in bigger, better ways. \u003cbr\u003eWith your help, we can keep covering news, keep ads low, and keep growing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support, and thank you for reading this page. We\u0027re grateful beyond words, and we\u0027ll keep working hard and burning the midnight oil to prove it. YGOrganization.com is here for you!\u003cbr\u003e"

We\u0027ve been told Patreon is a great way to connect with fans as well as help us in our struggle to stay online (as our server costs continue to increase; we\u0027re too popular!). We\u0027re hoping this project can be mutually beneficial and deal with the ever rising needs as the site presently is non-profit entirely. I\u0027ve been working full time to keep the site online (and this hinders site growth tremendously!). Thanks so much for checking out our page. We appreciate each and every one of you!",
