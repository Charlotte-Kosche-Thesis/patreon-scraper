This is the one-stop shop for all things YummyTiger Gaming has to offer. If you are new to Patreon, please be aware that Patreon is not a simple one-time donation. If you decide to support YummyTiger Gaming, you\u0027ll be charged with each major game update (see below for more details on what constitutes a \"major update\")\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/e7gulqT.jpg\"\u003eWhat is YummyTiger Gaming?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYummytiger Gaming is my foolish attempt to create and share my deviant creations. These creations will come in two primary forms: 1) Original games designed and developed by the YummyTiger team, and 2) Game translations of Japanese RPG Maker games so English users can enjoy them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll about me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/M96ldYW.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, I am just a wannabe game designer... I love games, naked women, and games with naked women (not always in that order). Given my love of games, the notion of creating original games for people to enjoy is incredibly appealing. Plus, I\u0027ve always enjoyed writing (perhaps you\u0027ve seen a short story or two by YummyTiger!). By moving my creative juices towards game development, I get to not only write a story, but I\u0027m able to add artwork to really bring that story to life. I\u0027ve spent the last few years trying to hone my artistic ability in an effort to create a truly epic experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/M23m19V.jpg\"\u003eWhy Pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges show me that you like and appreciate my work. YummyTiger Gaming creations are currently free. This is possible because of people like you! By funding development, I\u0027m able to release games so that everyone can enjoy them, regardless of their financial situation. That truly is awesome! Therefore, even if you ultimately decide not to pledge to my little endeavor, you will still be able to play with my creations. Either way, please don\u0027t hesitate to let me know what you think!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow pledges work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatrons will be charged every time a\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003emajor game update \u003c/strong\u003eis near release. When I\u0027m nearing the release of a major update, I will create a \"pledged post.\" These posts will be clearly labeled so you know when you\u0027re going to get charged. If you are a patron when a pledged post occurs, Patreon will then set your account to be billed at the beginning of the \u003cstrong\u003efollowing month\u003c/strong\u003e. Please note, you do have the option to decline specific pledges if you feel the update is not worth it. You also have the option to\u00a0set a cap on the number of times you could be charged in a single month--even though I highly doubt I\u0027d ever release more than one major update per month. Finally, given that you often will not receive the major update until after you\u0027ve been billed, YummyTiger Gaming offers a \u003cstrong\u003efull refund for your last pledge\u003c/strong\u003e. If you are ever unsatisfied, message me and I will start the refund process. The control over your money is \u003cstrong\u003ealways\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0in your hands!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, you might be wondering what constitutes a \"major content update?\" Good question! Major game updates will represent a significant portion of one of my original content games, or the completion of a side project. Major game updates will always contain multiple hentai scenes and provide hours of playtime. This means\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eyou will never be charged for a minor update or patches! \u003c/strong\u003eI take your support very seriously, and I only want to get paid if I\u0027ve provided you with an experience worth paying for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eCURRENT PROJECTS:\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eOriginal Game\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gbVqEpq.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAylia\u0027s Story is a tale of redemption.
