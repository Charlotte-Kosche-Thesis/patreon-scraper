    "summary": "Hi everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am Bradley Paulson (stage name: Young Bradley) and\u00a0I am here in pursuit of my dream; which is creating hiphop-rap music and video contents for my audience to enjoy. Growing up, I would see and hear other successful hiphop-rap artists on TV and the radio such as Drake, The Weekend and Kendrick Lamar making it in the ever-competitive music industry. \u00a0So, I just got to a place where I asked myself, \"Why them, and not me? If they can create music and be successful at it, why can\u0027t I?\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a personal level,\u00a0writing music has always been my comfort zone - my self expression through art (i.e. poetry and story-telling.) When I see others creating music, I feel compelled to hear others telling their stories of their struggles for success.\u00a0From that moment on, I knew I can do much more to inspire others in pursuit of their dreams. Through much courage and a leap of faith, I took my very first step and quit my full-time 8 to 5 job in pursuit of this dream. Some might think I am crazy or question why would I take this huge risk for myself, but I chose to not care anymore. Struggles and sacrifices comes with achieving the impossibility. I don\u0027t expect success to happen over night. This is the reason why I created this patreon page; so if anyone would like to participate on this journey with me in achieving my ultimate goal and dream; they can too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there is anything I would like you to get out of this, whether you decide to pass the message or contributing, I\u00a0really hope my music will give others the kind of identity to make others go out to pursue their dreams because time is very limited. As one of my admiring filmmaker, podcaster, and director Kevin Smith once said in an interview of his struggles for success, he said, \"I\u0027ve spent my 21 years chasing someone else\u0027s [dream]. A lot of people don\u0027t want to try to do stupid s--t or things that might not work. Everyone wants to try the \"sure\" thing, and there is no such thing as a \"sure\" thing. If you\u0027re constantly looking at somebody else\u0027s work to try to [en]gage your own, as I have for years, you will constantly feel like a failure. Instead, concentrate on telling your story. Your voice is the only currency in this life. That\u0027s all you got.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you....thank you....THANK YOU!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
