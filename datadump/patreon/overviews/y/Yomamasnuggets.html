I wouldn\u0027t have meet The Simpletons without it.\u00a0 They are a great group of people and content creators that i am so happy to have found.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI play all sorts of games, Minecraft, ARK, Guild Wars 2 mostly but i also try a ton of others and am open to suggestions for more. I love doing redstone. It was the thing that got me interested in Minecraft in the first place, how can i make something to do this or make that easier.\u00a0 Then i was hooked. I also have fun building or designing a base and possibly talking everyday life stuff.  I also stream Saturdays or whenever the mood hits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my favorite things about being a \"content creator\" on Youtube, Twitch and Mixer\u00a0 is the interaction with other gamers. I make a conscious effort to reply to, and interact with, every single person that takes the time to comment on something I have done. Its one of the things that makes me want to keep doing what i do."
