    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT YTG\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re a registered non-profit organization in Japan (NPO Hojin) that makes modern, multilingual, and international theatre. We\u0027ve been around since 1900, but we\u0027ve really only been in the modern theatre game for 7 years or so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT THE EVENTS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are three types of events that you will be supporting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMainstage Shows\u003c/strong\u003e - Simple enough. These are the mainstage shows. Usually, these are new works developed by an ensemble in rehearsal. Occasionally, these are pieces written by a company member or two. More rarely, these will be adaptations, interpretations, or deconstructions of existing public domain works. Despite the name \"mainstage\", these shows may be performed in non-traditional venues or even outside of Japan on tour. They may, from time to time be shows by other companies touring in that YTG produces, or shows by companies with whom we have an agreement to release videos of their production to you. It is our hope to have 3 - 6 of these a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorkshops\u003c/strong\u003e - Public performances of works-in-progress. This is how we test drive new ideas. Videos for these shows will come out faster because we won\u0027t be working as hard to make them look pretty. Expect anywhere from 0 - 4 of these a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvents\u003c/strong\u003e - Large-scale (for us) events to raise money or awareness. These are always performance-oriented somehow and include poetry slams, storytelling evenings, etc. Again, like workshops, these videos will be released more quickly. Expect 2 - 4 of these per year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will not be more than 12 shows, workshops, or events per year total; probably less. Our goal for the 2016/2017 season is 6.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY YOU, WHY NOW\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou and others like you are very diverse and are spread throughout Japan and the wider world. When we mount a show, only a small fraction of our potential audience are able to come to the shows. That\u0027s a side-effect of having an international and expat audience. Of course, we\u0027re trying to build our native Japanese audience, but that is a project that will take time. In the meantime, we want to make it easier for the people like you who want to support us to do so.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what this Patreon page is about!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW IT WILL WORK\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will pledge to give us any amount you choose every time we make a show, workshop, or event. There will be between 6 and 12 of these every year (6 is our target for the 2016/2017 season). Your donations will help us by providing a stable and predictable amount of money for each show  which will allow us to put more focus on the artistic side of each production.\u003cbr\u003eShortly before or shortly after a show, we will post a thank you video that will trigger a payment. Any rewards (like a video of the show) will follow when they become available. Video for shows by other companies will trigger a payment only when the video is released.\u003cbr\u003eOur Patrons will be considered \"members\" of the organization at the $20 level and up. Members will see shows for free. If you miss a show, or if you live abroad, you will get access to a recording of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ\u0026amp;A\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow are a few questions and answers we think that you might have. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ.\u003c/strong\u003e What is the money used for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA.\u003c/strong\u003e Your money will be used directly on the production in question, or to support it and future productions. This may include things like costumes, props, and set; theatre rent; professional services; transportation allowances; and honourariums. It may also include office supplies (scripts need to be printed, after all) or critical equipment, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ. \u003c/strong\u003eWhen will I get my rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA.\u003c/strong\u003e Physical rewards like show programmes will be sent out within 10 days of a show closing. They may even be sent out sooner, depending on the show. Recordings of the show will be made available via an unlisted YouTube or password-protected Vimeo link when the video editing is complete. This will be within 6 months of show date. (We hope earlier, but it will depend on who is available to do the editing and whether it\u2019s a mainstage show, a workshop, or an event.) For tickets, see the next question.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ. \u003c/strong\u003eMy reward includes show tickets. How will I receive them?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA.\u003c/strong\u003eYou will be asked to reserve your tickets using a special form slightly before tickets go on sale for the general public. Tickets will be held in your name at the box office and you will pick them up on the day(s) you attend the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ. \u003c/strong\u003eI can\u2019t afford $20 US per show to be a member. Is it worth it to give a smaller amount?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA.\u003c/strong\u003e It\u2019s worth it to us! A pledge of $10, $5, or even $1 per show is a meaningful gesture that says you support us and our work. And even non-members will receive the warm, fuzzy feeling of supporting art as we thank you on twitter, Google+, and Facebook. News updates will hit Patreon before they hit the wider web or our regular newsletter, so you\u0027ll see them first. You won\u2019t get the show videos, but you\u0027ll get access to promo videos and other free stuff slightly earlier than the general public as well as Patreon only material (short stories or poems written to support a show, or unused art for a programme or flyer, just to give a couple of examples).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ.\u003c/strong\u003e How many times will I be charged for one show?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA.\u003c/strong\u003e Once for each run of a show, whether that run is one night or two weeks or even longer.\u003cbr\u003eSeparate productions of the same show will each count as a separate show. For instance, the May 2015 Kawasaki production of \u003cem\u003eKikai-ga-shima\u003c/em\u003e and the September 2015 tour of that show to Taipei would be considered two separate productions because they will be quite different and have different teams working on them. However, the 2010 tour of \u003cem\u003e39\u003c/em\u003e to three Canadian Fringe festivals would have counted as a single production because the aim was to recreate the show faithfully in all three cities.\u003cbr\u003eIf there\u2019s a significant time gap or change to the show, and we think the result will be interesting to you, then it will be considered a separate show for the purposes of your sponsorship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ.\u003c/strong\u003e Why do you need my snail mail address if I\u2019m not receiving anything from you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA.\u003c/strong\u003e \nThe term \u201cmember\u201d isn\u2019t just something we\u2019re making up. You\u2019re actually \non a membership list that we submit to the municipal government in \nYokohama every year. This gives you the right to attend our Annual \nGeneral Meeting every year, if you so desire. You\u2019ll also receive YTG\u2019s \nannual report so that you can see how your donations are being put to \nuse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ. \u003c/strong\u003eHow did you come up with the reward levels?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA. \u003c/strong\u003eWe tried to price the lowest member tier slightly lower than our current \u201cspecial offer\u201d ticket price of 2500 yen. In a sense, you are making a donation rather than buying a ticket through the normal route. For the levels above that, we just incremented in a way that seemed logical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ.\u003c/strong\u003e I don\u2019t want to do recurring donations. How can I make a one-time contribution to support YTG?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA.\u003c/strong\u003e Head on over to \u003ca href=\"http://sponsor.ytg.jp\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://sponsor.ytg.jp\u003c/a\u003e and make a one-time donation. Patreon doesn\u2019t support non-recurring donations at this point in time."
