    "summary": "Yasmeen sings in a language of sound glossolalia, she is a Celtic harpist, a soprano vocalist, composing her own music. In her studio she paints colorful paintings of her dreams and visions, she writes poetry and illustrates her various writing. We can expect to be engaged by Yasmeen\u0027s publication of her new ethereal, music, compositions, art , concerts, workshops on harp playing and vocalization. Exhibitions of art, dance, poetry and music. After some years of taking time to raise her children Yasmeen is now fully immersed in her craft and welcoming any contribution to assist her journey as the musician and artist she is.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote from Yasmeen:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so grateful for all the care and goodness shown to me over the years by good friends, family, and fans. So grateful to those people who encouraged me to continue making my music and art.\u00a0 Art and music are my lot in life, it has been so from the time I was a little girl, my intention is in my inspired willingness to serve the highest in my music, painting and poetry. I pray that my work benefit my beloved human being friends, animal, plant and fairy friends from all different parts of this earth, on all different walks, those dear ones, who love our beautiful diversity, who respect and cherish one another with genuine kindness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe message of Oneness of humankind is now embracing all different aspects of learning, the global wealth of knowledge that we can now access in this day and age has enormous meaning.\u003cbr\u003eHistory has shown us that judgement and condemnation, alienation of people\u0027s has only created greater rifts in the fabric and knowledge of our human community. It is for this reason I sing in tongues, to transcend the barriers and challenge self proclaimed identity, to invigorate the mystery that is clearly abundant and manifest all around us. Mystery and wonder are the faculties that endear us to our human nature, the pure capacity to experience genuine awe is the drive behind the search for knowledge and meaning and in itself is the depths of true wisdom.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
