So of course, when Peter Hollens tells you to do something, you do it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo! \u00a0I am interested in releasing one to two political parodies a month. My plan is to ask you to contribute per work piece. \u00a0 Each piece I publish will incur your donations. \u00a0 But it will never be more than two a month! \u00a0If I somehow see a huge success in producing these videos, I will do a monthly charge and churn out more videos. \u00a0But with my current schedule, this seems the best route. \u00a0And PLEASE: \u00a0If you\u0027re struggling to get by, PLEASE don\u0027t donate. \u00a0I will make videos regardless. \u00a0I promise! \u00a0 But for those of you who may have an extra five dollars or more a month to spend on a video for social justice and political awakening? \u00a0I\u0027d love if you helped donate!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Keith Rubino :)"
