    "summary": "My name is Ben, I\u0027ve been drawing webcomics for over 5 years. My comic Zoe has changed a great deal over that time, and other comics have come and gone as well. I started out with the goal of using webcomics to build an audience to crowdfund a horror film I\u0027ve written and hope to someday make. 5 years in and still have nowhere near the audience to hope to accomplish that, and probably never will. I\u0027ve stuck with it hoping to someday have those tens of thousands of readers but that is just wishful thinking at this point. I would settle for just keeping my head above the waters of student loan debt.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI use Patreon to help ease the burden of bills, and maintaining the site. I keep Zoe fully free and make nothing off advertising (the 40 cents a day I do make goes back into advertising on Project Wonderful). I will continue to keep Zoe free, so feel no pressure to support this or lose Zoe as that won\u0027t happen. Instead I\u0027ve created exclusive oneshots and drawings that I post here as a thankyou to those of you who become my Patrons. \u003cbr\u003eThe oneshots vary in style and story but are all sexy. Incest is the most common theme of the comics though I also try to embrace other niches. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
