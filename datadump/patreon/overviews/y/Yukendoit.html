    "summary": "\"Nothing can be started without actually trying\", I think this is an important thing to remember when you are thinking about the future.\u003cbr\u003e Hi, my name is Scott. I use to live in Florida but now I\u0027ve moved out to Osaka,Japan to help give back to the world through teaching. But I love film and the idea of film connecting people. During college I spent many a day on film sets, writting scripts, setting up shots, and trying to make my hobby in to full time job. I never stopped creating almost every weekend or any of my off days I\u0027d be setting up working on videos with friends. To suppliment my passion, I worked at Disney world, Universal Studios, Halloween Horror Nights, and a crap ton of other places doing various jobs in different industries. But my love has always been film. It wasn\u0027t until I was inspired to leave America to persue careers that would allow me to give back and help the world. That I decided to start making videos just about my daily life. Filmed on my iphone, edited on my iphone, and put up on youtube. This brings us to now, I\u0027m been in Japan for just over a year and BOY GOLLY I DO LOVE IT. After two years on youtube I\u0027ve decided to make a patreon, as I\u0027d like to start thinking about upgrading my camera and it would allow me to travel more easily through the country of Japan. If you even think about going further it means you\u0027ll be supporting my videos and in turn myself.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hello all you wonderful people! If your even on this page looking at this, first of all thank you. As of right now, I\u0027ve been on youtube for roughly two years and have made over 200 videos. I created the channel in order to prove to myself that I could do something and I could show people that if I can do it, you can do it. It\u0027s been my theme since I started this whole shabang, as the cool kids are saying. Flash forward to now and I\u0027m in Osaka Japan doing something I never thought I\u0027d do. Live, Work, and view Japan. Of course I take you guys out for the ride. If youv\u0027e followed me for awhile you might know that Im a former scareactor from Halloween Horror Nights, Amphicar Driver, Disney castmember, and Universal Studios team member. Now I\u0027m a teacher, but one with a real heart for adventure. When I\u0027m not in class I\u0027m thinking about crazy places to go and amazing things to do. If you choose to donate, you will be donating directly to me allowing me to travel to different places see different things. I prefer it be per month because I do make a lot of videos on any given month depending on how much free time I get.",
