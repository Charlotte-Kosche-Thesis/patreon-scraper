For those new people though I will try to keep this short!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI draw comics!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk that was too short.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince late 2003 I have been drawing and writing the comic Yosh! It\u0027s still going and it\u0027s a lot of fun creating things for people to read and enjoy. It\u0027s about an alternate Earth with magic returning after a long period of suppression from an ancient group trying to free people from the tyranny of a cabal of Mages known as the Five Magi (Which is actually 6 just to keep it real confusing). \u00a0The current group of \"heroes\" is discovering the past and forming alliances and friendships with powerful people, including the descendants of the Magi themselves. It\u0027s focus is Comedy, Action, and Fanser- Romance? The comic spans over 1800 comics and is still going!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read Yosh! Here! It updates every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://yosh.katbox.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYosh! -Click here to see the comic-\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYosh! isn\u0027t the only comic I work on though! I also started a project called Artificial Incident! Artificial Incident is a LitRPG story. Seeing as LitRPG isn\u0027t a very well known genre, it\u0027s basically Literature (Or Stories) about people playing a Role Playing Game much like a Dungeons and Dragons game or a Video game. AI focuses on a character that plays in a Full VR RPG stuck inside his characters avatar trying to figure out why and how she has been melded with her character. I don\u0027t want to give away too much, so if any of this have peaked your interest check it out by clicking the link below!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ai.katbox.net/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArtificial Incident - Click here to see the comic!-\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging money is completely optional. \u00a0Your support will make it possible for me to continue to create these stories. \u00a0I chose to make my Patreon account a monthly thing because I believe in contributing what one can, and since I update 4 days a week every week even a dollar per update can be too much for some (an average of 16 updates a month would mean 16 dollars a month at 1 dollar per comic). \u00a0At the per month people can support my work how they can afford it without it changing from month to month because an extra day falls on an update day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the rewards offer pictures as a reward, and these pictures are what are displayed on the Patreon page. For comic updates you\u0027ll need to check the website but any updates to Patreon will be artwork done each month for many donators and almost all of it is done on a stream on Picarto! If you are interested in seeing me work I stream every Friday night at 9pm EST at this link!\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://picarto.tv/sagesaga\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e-Picarto-SageSaga-\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ll do everything I can to make your pledge worth it! Thank you so much for your time and I hope you enjoy my work and my continued journey in improving my art and stories!"
