    "summary": "Hi, my name is \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/AurianTitan\"\u003eYuttho\u003c/a\u003e and I am a YouTube content creator for the game, \u003cstrong\u003eCities: Skylines\u003c/strong\u003e. One of the most enjoyable feelings in life for me is when you learn something new. You know the phrase, \"Today I learned... (TIL)\". And that is an experience I want to create for my viewers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what I do on my newest series,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/2px2Pyi\"\u003eBuilding Osaka\u003c/a\u003e, which is a series that is reminiscent of my original series, Building Tokyo from SimCity (2013). This series will be a tour of exploring the many districts and landmarks of Osaka by accurately creating them on Cities: Skylines.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my other series, \u003cstrong\u003eAstergea\u003c/strong\u003e, is about a future city set 3000 plus years from now during a post-apocalyptic era on Earth and focuses on building an urban design plan for a futuristic world capital city derived from the natural sciences, the humanities, and innovative urban designs from around the world. The story is an allegory of the fall and rebirth of humanity. The series is conducted in a humanistic and ecological narrative of producing the world\u0027s capital that is ecologically friendly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePutting the fictional backstory aside, opposed to producing a normal series that is strictly a \"Let\u0027s Play\", \u003cstrong\u003emy mission\u003c/strong\u003e as a YouTuber is to share information with my audience about the world we live in and how it affects us. I share information brought through by extensive research or interviewing experts in the field. One of example is that I\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkdImAskYLM\"\u003einvited city planner and urban designer, Jeff Speck,\u003c/a\u003e to talk about walkability and how to achieve that in our cities. I used his knowledge to then demonstrate that in my Astergea city.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \u003cstrong\u003eultimate goal\u003c/strong\u003e however, is to be able to travel the world and document the amazing architectural achievements and city-planning innovations from different cultures and situations to share with my audience by integrating it into my Astergea series. I want to develop a fun learning environment by using the Cities: Skylines game to inform and encourage my viewers to become participants in shaping our cities for the better. Similarly, I would like to return to Japan and integrate live footage of Osaka into my Building Osaka series.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
