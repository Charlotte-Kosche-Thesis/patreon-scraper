    "summary": "UPDATE MAY 30 2017:\u003cbr\u003eSince about a year ago my life has kind of gone to shit because of some health problems, mostly related to my sleeping mechanism not working almost at all anymore. I don\u0027t know when or if I\u0027ll be able to update this again, but you\u0027re free to hop on board in the meantime. I\u0027ll only update if I have something to update with. I\u0027m trying to remain optimistic and you\u0027re welcome to be optimistic with me by pledging a very small amount (such as a few cents) to keep in the loop and get a notification in case I do update again someday.\u003cbr\u003e---\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a reclusive sort of person, so I get really lazy with posting stuff and interacting with people. I have a lot of art strewn about my computer that isn\u0027t really going anywhere, and probably wouldn\u0027t ever go anywhere without an incentive like a core group of folks who would definitely be interested in it. Of course, there\u0027s also plenty of stuff I\u0027m embarrassed about, and at least this way, I always know who\u0027s looking at it. In addition, I upload a lot of work exclusively to Pixiv, and I\u0027ve been trying to find other channels for that work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you\u0027ll get every week or two:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eArt scraps: any and all art I wouldn\u0027t be posting otherwise\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eProbably something I\u0027d been too embarrassed to post elsewhere\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eUpdates on projects and ideas I\u0027m working on, including sequential art and costume construction\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nIn addition, I sometimes make music, hold private art streams, and do Let\u0027s Plays, so add this to the pile:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eLil tunes here n there\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eAccess to private streams in which I\u0027ll be taking requests\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eNotification of and access to Let\u0027s Play streams, and ability to request any game\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nThose in higher tiers will receive preferential treatment when I ask for requests in streams and Let\u0027s Plays. Higher tiers will also see more embarrassing stuff and project ideas, and be invited to more streams.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat about covers it! I hope you are well in your life. Health to you and those you love."
