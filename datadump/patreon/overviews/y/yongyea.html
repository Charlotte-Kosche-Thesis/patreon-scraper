    "summary": "I started YouTubing back in 2011 as an outlet to express my love and interest in video games, but little did I expect that what began as a fun experiment would flourish into a vibrant community of passionate and caring gamers. So taken aback have I been by your support that I\u0027ve refused to ask for any additional support. The simple act of someone watching, liking, and sharing my videos was all I could ask for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, life circumstances change. When the time is right, I will be moving out of my home in Newark, Delaware and into Los Angeles, California. While I love my current peaceful residence, I also can\u0027t deny that I feel stuck. I\u0027ve come to realize that I won\u0027t be able to find true happiness and fulfillment unless I leave the nest and see what the rest of the world has to offer, and I believe LA is where I\u0027ll be able to expand my horizons in video game journalism and, eventually, voice acting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe prospect of this new venture is both exhilarating and terrifying. For the first time in my life, I will truly be on my own. Well, not entirely. I\u0027ve got you beautiful people constantly inspiring and motivating me to keep pushing forward. But the transition from a suburban lifestyle into an urban one is, well, an expensive one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve considered avenues such as sponsorship, but I detest the idea of a third party entity or corporation having any semblance of control over my content and opinions. Instead, I want this to be a community run by the people for the people. It\u0027s only fair that I place my fate and the fate of our community in your hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for what your contributions would be used for, additional funding means I will be able to dedicate my time solely to creating content on my channel. It means better equipment to improve quality of content. It means being able to attend more gaming events around the country to do more coverage. It means being able to sustain YongYea as a viable career\u00a0while remaining independent of third party sponsorship and corporate influence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf this is an idea you are behind, I welcome any support you can provide. The means to shape my channel, my content, and our community is in your hands. No one is more deserving of that power than you, the loyal viewers and fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut hey, even if you can\u0027t or won\u0027t support this campaign, I will be just as grateful to see you watch, like, and share my videos. In return, I\u0027ll continue to provide the highest quality, most informative, and most entertaining gaming videos possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for everything, and I\u0027m excited to see what the future has in store for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003e-Yong"
