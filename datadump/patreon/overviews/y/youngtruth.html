I want to give my fans and supporters a great experience and become more consistent with content. I need you on the journey. I am nothing without the ones who truly believe in me. Releasing at least 1-2 videos a month is ideal to me. I know you all would love to see more from me as much as I want to see more from myself.

     "about": "Born William McMillan on September 20, 1987, The Up and coming MC known today as Young Truth is a product of the culturally diverse neighborhood of Harlem, NYC. Home to the Apollo, Harlem has been responsible for quite a number of legendary contributors to the music and culture that is the beloved Hip Hop genre. A form of escape from the hard realities outside of his window, Young Truth gravitated to the expressive nature with which some of favorite MCs delivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cMy list of favorite MCs reads like a study in iconic figure. We\u2019re talking \u003cstrong\u003eB.IG. Jay Z, Rakim, 2Pac and Wu Tang \u003c/strong\u003eto name a few.\u201d\u003c/em\u003eIntrigued by not only their style but their control of the mic, the upstart took to penning his own rhymes while a senior in High School.  Putting the pieces together along the way, his brand today stands in a very favorable position as many of the Big Apple\u2019s tastemakers have caught wind of potential. Appearing on a selection of dope projects highlighting standout indie artists has only helped with the push of his solo efforts \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/youngtruthmp3/sets/tunnel-vision-ep\"\u003eTunnel Vision\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (2013) and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/youngtruthmp3/sets/unwritten\"\u003eUnwritten\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (2015) both of which have received critical acclaim. Performance wise his recent marks include \u003cstrong\u003eSantos Party House, Karma Lounge, Drom NYC, The Pyramid, Allure Night Club \u003c/strong\u003eand\u003cstrong\u003e The H Loft\u003c/strong\u003ewhich is situated a stones throw from where he was raised.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cI don\u2019t think I can fully put into words what the experience of performing in front of my peers and Day 1s really means. Hitting the H Loft is always a dope experience. It is one of the places where you can truly see that Harlem Sticks Together and there is a lot of dope talented within these blocks.\u201dWith the support of respected internet broadcasts \u003cstrong\u003eDa Matrix Studios, FLOempire, and DTF Radio \u003c/strong\u003ethe word is spreading quickly about what the future will hold for Young Truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
