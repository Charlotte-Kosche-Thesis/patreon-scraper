    "summary": "I\u0027ve never been a fan of the word \"critic\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t enjoy thinking critically about film.  I love to process the world around me, entertainment and otherwise.  I am a classic over-thinker. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t identify with the critic\u2019s goal. Critics tear things apart to assign an objective rating, as if they can define the absolute worth of something through their own deliberations. I don\u2019t see that as within my purpose (or to be honest even my ability).  My goal is to offer the information you need to make sure you\u2019re investing your time and money wisely.  Everyone has that person they know who watches WAY too many movies and WAY too much TV, but when they want an honest opinion on what\u2019s good they seek them out.  That person that can give perspective on whether or not it\u2019s worth the $20 and 120 minutes to see.  That person that even though you don\u2019t always agree with on what\u2019s good or not, you can gauge how you might feel by how they feel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou know, a friend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo with your help I\u0027m building \"Your Movie Friend\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve always found reviews from friends to be so much more valuable than reviews from critics, for many reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA friend is personal.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCritic reviews always seem to be cold assessments, but when I talk to a friend about a movie, I get a sense for how their own personality played into the experience. In journalism, you\u2019re taught to avoid the words \u201cI\u201d and \u201cme\u201d.  That ain\u2019t happening here.  Part of why we love movies is because they are so personal, not because some sort of abstract art math equation has deemed them valuable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA friend is singular.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis hasn\u2019t always been the case, but so much of modern movie criticism has become about averages.  Rotten Tomatoes percentages have become the go-to source for movie ratings. My cell gives me a viewer average and a critic average when I look up a movie.  But what does that mean?  It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s valuable, I often use Rot-Tom scores to get a general sense for a film\u2019s buzz.  It\u2019s just that it doesn\u2019t give me a decent sense for how \u201cI\u201d will feel.  When I go to a friend, I know what they like, where we agree on things, and where we disagree. This allows me a level of confidence in how I process their opinions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA friend is biased.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWait? Isn\u2019t bias a bad thing? Nope, it\u2019s a life thing.  The way we see the world by necessity affects the way we see everything in it, and that includes entertainment. It\u2019s not that objectivity is bad, it\u2019s just dishonest.  We all have proclivities to love certain things and hate others.  Knowing those things is what allows us to honestly evaluate when a friend rants or raves about something.  When a critic represses those biases they are disallowing their reader/viewer the ability to fully understand their perspective.  We are all fanboys of something, let\u2019s just get it on the table and take it into account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA friend is selective.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere must be a list somewhere of all the aspects of a film you are supposed to cover as a critic.  A checklist I\u2019m sure that includes cinematography, script, acting, directing, score, visual effects, and so on and so forth.  But not everyone of those things is necessarily important to every review.  Sometimes I feel like critics can spend time expounding on things that really have no impact on whether or not I will enjoy a movie.  But a friend eliminates those things.  They have a built-in idea economy that connects to the things about the movie that are interesting or of note.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want my reviews to be \u201cfriend reviews\u201d, a place you can come and find personal pop culture opinions from a biased, selective, singular source.  At their most basic these \u201cfriend reviews\u201d will answer three questions; \u201cWhat is it about?\u201d, \u201cDid I like it?\u201d and \u201cWill you?\u201d  My hope is that I can quickly give you my personal, specific take and the best shot at seeing only the things that are worth your valuable minutes and monies. As \u201cYour Movie Friend\u201d my goal is simple: record 4-6 minute takes on pop culture you might want to hear about from a friend\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003enot a critic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand If that could save you from seeing one movie each month, maybe send half that movie ticket cost my way? \u00a0Thanks!\u003cbr\u003e"

Maybe an opinion video on a particular topic, or maybe reviews of tv or tech. Once this goal is reached I\u0027ll make it happen! Thanks!",
