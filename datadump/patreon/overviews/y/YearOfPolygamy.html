     "about": "he Year of Polygamy podcast started out as a weekly series for the \u003ca href=\"http://fmhpodcast.org/\"\u003eFeminist Mormon Housewives Podcast\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://feministmormonhousewivespodcast.org/\"\u003e.\u003c/a\u003e Due to its national popularity, this site has been created as a better way to manage these important Mormon histories.For over a decade, Feminist Mormon Housewives, a blog NPR\u2019s Krista Tippets called \u201clegendary\u201d, has published essays on subjects pertinent to Mormon women. Ranging from ridiculous tales of the drudgery of homelife to heavy hitting religious critiques and feminist theory, FMH has been a bright spot that readers could turn to when they felt alone in their local wards. Since 2013 The FMH Podcast has taken those same topics and tackled them through the new medium of podcasting by hosting panel discussion, monologues, and Lindsay Hansen\u2019s searing and provocative historical research series, The Year of Polygamy. Over the course of 75 episodes Hansen takes research hidden away in archives, brushed aside by religious authorities, left out of official histories, written professionally in abstracts and journals, and compiles it all in a narrative respected by leading historians and compelling enough to interest any casual listener.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe series follows the Mormon faith through the lens of \u201cThe Principle of Plural Marriage\u201d from its genesis in 1831 with its originator Joseph Smith, through the hidden history and governmental pressure, to today and contemporary practicing Fundamentalist Mormons. For the first time polygamy is dissected through a feminist viewpoint, with attention given to the experiences of the women, women who sacrificed everything and suffered long and are never mentioned in museums or landmark tours. Their experiences, along with interviews with experts, sc\u003ca href=\"http://www.yearofpolygamy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/20140302_130747.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.yearofpolygamy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/20140302_130747-194x300.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\" width=\"194\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eholars, historians, and those still affected directly by the practice, paint a new portrait of how the west was shaped, by the hard work and toil of these invisible women, hidden away through controversy. Through Hansen\u2019s careful work, we see how the practice of polygamy affected every aspect of the LDS church\u2019s formation and is still a shadow hanging over the church, visible in it\u2019s approach to marriage, the role of women, and the temple ceremonies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Instead of the historical footnote \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.yearofpolygamy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1798821_10154492241640226_2144954335118804960_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.yearofpolygamy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1798821_10154492241640226_2144954335118804960_n-300x300.jpg\" style=\"margin-right: 15px; float: left;\" width=\"300\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003epolygamy is often treated as, Hansen shows how this practice, started in secret and a direct cause of Joseph Smith\u2019s death, responsible for driving the saints to Utah, and then outward again to Mexico and Canada, the root of power struggles both in the church and out, the cause of suspicion and eventually violence including the Mountain Meadows Massacre, was an instigator to most of the history of American West. For the first time, The Year of Polygamy shows how the west was settled not only to claim land and mineral rights, but in a very real way to control the bodies and sexuality of women in a way that reverberates today.\u003cbr\u003e",
