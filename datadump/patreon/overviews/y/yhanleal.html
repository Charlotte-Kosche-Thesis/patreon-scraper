I want to fund all my future music releases and activities via a fan based monthly subscription, basically a fan based record label. To those of you who have already subscribed, \u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an independent music artist from Bellingen, a peaceful riverside town on the east coast of Australia. I\u0027m a full time musician, performing, writing, recording, creating and managing my career myself. I have a family to support and it\u0027s my pleasure to do this doing what I so passionately love, music. But being indie means I have to do all the management and promotional work myself, as well as playing live nearly every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to play live but I also need time to write, record, book tours, market my current releases and collaborate with other artists. I also need more time with my family, and even time off to rest.\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I can realise this dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to start with the creation of 30 song sketches or demos for album four, the process and thereby creation of audio, video, lyrical and photographic content will only be available to subscribing supporters. I\u0027d like to make the whole process an interactive journey of creativity that culminates in a wonderful, amazing and euphoric fourth album.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo you\u0027re in? beautiful, thank you! xxxooo\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy music video above \u0027up on the Mountain\u0027 is a collaboration with visual artist Julian Wolkenstein, the song is from my current album \u0027Yhan leal\u0027.\u003cbr\u003eBoth the video and album were made possible by crowdfunding, and my goal here is to continue to create such works indefinitely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love and hope \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYhan Leal\u003cbr\u003ehttp://patreon.com/yhanleal\u003cbr\u003ehttp://yhanleal.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

     "about": "It\u0027s been two fertile years for Yhan Leal since he released his last recording. Quietly determined, Leal has come from busking nightly outside Bellingen\u0027s local supermarket, to developing a career as a bona fide touring and recording artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLeal\u2019s new album, the eponymous Yhan Leal, was recorded between Leal\u2019s home in Bellingen and in various Sydney studios with Producer Ryan Miller. The new full length album contains all the ethereal dreaminess, melodic guitars and haunting harmonies that are the halmark of Yhan\u0027s hypnotic style, but also takes a new direction with the augmentation of a full band and production on several tracks. Themes of love, loss and grief, travel, peace and freedom, are explored with a maturity and honesty, that has developed with Leal\u0027s own journey of genuine musical evolution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBiography \u003cbr\u003e\u201cBorn the son of Colombian poverty, reprised a migrant under Australia\u2019s burnt sun. Raised by an angelic mother in wilderness scrub. The youngest of four brothers, I didn\u2019t walk the path of a modern nuclear family. Seeking freedom from hardship my eyes and heart opened to a new way of living. Young and hungry I found my path in music.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the story of Yhan Leal, a truly gifted musician with a powerful personal story. As a boy growing up in Cali Colombia life wasn\u2019t easy. Classical guitar came naturally, working his magic on Lennon, Elvis and Richie Valens. Writing his first compositions to suit his older brother\u2019s poetry he nurtured a pure talent for songwriting. Music marched through his teens and to the stage. The turmoil came too, and his path took route through buddhism and bouts of meditation. Having ridden the undulatory throws of life, a man emerges wise and courageous with music that moves those inescapably drawn into his circle. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no pigeon hole for Leal\u2019s music, but if one was to categorise the genre it might well be Post Folk.",
