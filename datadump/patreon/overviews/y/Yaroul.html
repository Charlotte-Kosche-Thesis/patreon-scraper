    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo who am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Yaroul. I am an artist who\u0027s been \ndrawing since I could hold a pencil and at just 8 years old I was \nalready making my first commissions from fellow students in my \nclassroom. You could say I\u0027ve always known I wanted to be a freelance \nartist. My gallery can be found at: \u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/yaroul/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/yaroul/\u003c/a\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e*caution R34 content*\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy \"Patreon\"?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon is a means for me to get more personal artwork done, \nexperiment with techniques and improve my abilities as an artist. \nCurrently most of my time is spent on commissions that I cannot branch \nout into more experimental forms that I would like to try because I feel\n people are expecting the quality of art they\u0027ve already seen and thus \nif I experiment with their work, I end up thinking I am disappointing my\n commissioners with techniques they may have not wanted in the first \nplace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have two projects planned for this Patreon... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first is a R34 Pokemon Sketch Project, which will feature every pokemon through all of the generations in National Pokedex order. I will attempt to make one sketch every other day until I have completed the entire dex. \u003cstrong\u003e-Note, the sketches in this project are already posted at Full Res-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003esecond project is to experiment with coloring, sketching and techniques with art. I will make -one- Experimental color piece a month (more to be unlocked as milestones are reached)\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ewhich members can vote on a character based on the topic subject I present for that month in a poll. I will only post R34 so all suggested characters will be of age or will be aged to be of consent. Topics will always relate to a game, novel, movie, etc.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLastly, I have the Request-A-Sketch streams that I will hold twice a month for the 10$ and 20$ Tiers. More info on the Request-A-Sketch is below.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eHow does it work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the R34 Pokemon Sketch Project is free for everyone, Patrons and non-Patrons... The other content is not (Experimental colors, the Vote Poll, Request-a-Sketch and any other R34 art I make). To get the content, you must wait until your card has been successfully billed at the end of the month. The content will be distributed in an offsite folder you can access and download from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePayments are on a by month-to-month basis, if you wish to have access to older art that you happened to miss, you will need to pay for the access and note me with what month you\u0027d like the folder from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the Request-A-Sketch?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGreat question! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRequest-A-Sketch (or RAS) is a stream-only event taking place twice a month for the 10$ and 20$ Tiers (More RAS can be unlocked in the milestones!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow it works is for all attending Patreon members will have a chance to get a single free sketch. Sketches can ONLY be obtained when attending a RAS stream, if you do not attend, you will miss out on it! The single sketch will always need to follow the topic/theme of the month otherwise it is not valid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA big note to mention of the RAS, I am giving outmost confidence that those who pledge will actually keep to their word because the RAS Stream is scheduled before the billing cycle... if you pledged a specific amount and do not pay up at the end of the bill cycle or change your pledge to be cheaper, you will NOT receive the sketch that has been made for you. This is set up in place to prevent misuse and abuse of the RAS I am providing.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou do not have to support me... but I would appreciate it. If you support me, then I feel all the more encouraged to succeed as an artist, which has been my dream job since I was a child. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider sending your support to an artist wishing to expand their techniques so I can make even better work!\u003cbr\u003e"
