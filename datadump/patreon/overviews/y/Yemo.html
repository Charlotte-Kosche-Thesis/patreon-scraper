So we will have to wait for KSP 1.2.x to fix things. Unfortunately 1.2.x is supposed to bring new features as well, which might bring new bugs or require tuning in smaller patches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith those circumstances, mod dev has to adjust:\u003cbr\u003e1.

SETIcontracts is recompiled for 1.1.3\u003cbr\u003e4. UbM is updated for 1.1.3, with significant early game balancing changes (getting science is much more challenging).

For example, I am in Germany (Euro).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eHow do I donate once, instead of monthly?\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eCurrently the best way to do so is to pledge a monthly amount and then retract the pledge after it is transferred (which happens between the 1st and 4th of the month by default).\u003cbr\u003eI will write a monthly update on patreon around the mid of each month, which thus may also serve as a reminder to cancel pledges that are supposed to be one-time donations.\u003cbr\u003eedit: I will include a paypal donate button later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e How much of my contribution will come through?\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon takes 5%, \u0026lt;2% is taken by the transfer from Patreon to me, and if you transfer money from you credit card to patreon (instead of paypal), the credit card company takes 4%. So roughly 90% goes through, which is incredibly good. If you were to donate via a paypal donate button, paypal would take 33%. If you pay for a game on steam, steam takes at least 30%.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \u003c/strong\u003eThe license of the major modules of SETI is ARR, why is that the case and what happens when you lose interest in KSP?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e The reason for the AAR license is some bad experiences while modding for another game. That other game started independent and community friendly, so people started modding it. Unfortunately the dev/publisher turned greedy and started actively scamming customers. Some modders did not want to support a scamming dev/publisher and \"pulled\" their mods. As usual, some fanboys without morals sprung up and took over the mods not licensed ARR, rendering the protest largely useless. The tale ends with only one winner, (the dev/publisher who turned greedy) and many losers (customers, modders, fanboys who later complained about a toxic community and dwindling forum activity...).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e So what happens when you lose interest in KSP?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e As I felt a moral obligation to protest against a dev/publisher starting to scam customers, I feel a moral obligation to all contributors (those contributing code, textures, dollars, ideas, etc.) to not let a mod die for egoistic reasons as long as that does not support greed by proxy. Thus if I leave for good, I will hand the project over to someone else and/or remove the ARR license.\u003cbr\u003e"
