Stick here. \u003cbr\u003e\nIf you don\u0027t already know me in real life or from social media, I\u0027m this strange tiny cat-lady. I quite enjoy snapping images that catch my eye, and having fun with them in Photoshop. I\u0027m also an aspiring author, and soon to be a stay-at-home Mother to a little pirate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYardBird Studio is the name of the photography studio that I run, with the help of my lovely husband. My favorite images to capture are of the beautiful and unique human form, but nature photography comes in at a close second. For the past fourteen of my thirty or so years on earth, I have been on this amazing journey in life through photography, modeling, writing, and creating that has led me to places and introduced me to people and events that I had never even dreamed of. \u003cbr\u003e\nPhotography and modeling not only boost my own self-confidence but also provide me with an outlet to show people that you can be weird and still be down to earth and awesome in your own way. Writing has been a passion of mine since childhood, and it only got stranger and stronger as I got older and my vocabulary expanded. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis page will mainly be focused on my photography and modeling. My writing will also be promoted on this page as well, and as a Patron you will get first looks at pieces of my novels and other books I may publish. However, the plan is to build this page up over time and continue to grow as \nan artist, ever expanding the amount and types of art I create each \nmonth. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(235, 241, 221);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(235, 241, 221);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0~ Why Patreon? ~ \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThat is where you, my wonderful Patrons come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI could never do this without your help, and frankly, I wouldn\u0027t want to. Your feedback and support help drive me to bigger and better creative projects. The fire that you help to fuel is growing more each and every day. \u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a really great way to help artists do just that - simply BE artists and focus on their art! \u003cbr\u003e\nNo more having to suffer a full time job and try to create art in what little time there is after that job and all of life\u0027s other normal responsibilities. With Patreon - THIS - is the job! Artists get to do what drives them and share it with you, the people that enjoy their art, the Patrons! \u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons back in the day have helped fund some of the great artists of history. Now it is your chance to step up and help out artists that you deem worthy of your dollar. You can contribute as little as one dollar or as much as your favorite artist maxes out their rewards levels at. It is all up to you on how much you want to support. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(235, 241, 221);\"\u003e\u00a0~ What do you get out of all this? ~ \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s so wonderful that a community like this exists so that we can share our work with people that want to support it. Of course, you aren\u0027t doing so in exchange for nothing! (Even if you\u0027re only contributing $1 a month, you still get blog updates and the satisfaction of knowing that you\u0027re helping an artist whose work you enjoy. All of those $1 supports really do add up!) \u003cbr\u003e\nThere are many levels of support you can sign up for and all come with their own set of unique rewards. \u003cbr\u003eIf you sign up to support me, you\u0027ll be rewarded with things such as: \u003cbr\u003e\n- photo prints of various sizes and content\u003cbr\u003e- a first look at writing and photography projects \u003cbr\u003e\n- personalized stories \u003cbr\u003e\n- access to exclusive content (including cell phone pictures and complete photo sets)\u003cbr\u003e\n- updates before they are posted on other social networks \u003cbr\u003e\n- updates that aren\u0027t posted on other social networks at all\u003cbr\u003e\n- and so much more (What do you want as a reward for your support?

Art is my passion, and it shows in all mediums I sink my claws \ninto.\u003cbr\u003e\nPhotography and modeling have been passions of mine for over ten years. \nWhen it comes to portraits, I stand apart from other photographers in my\n area because of my experience on both sides of the lens.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is not uncommon to find me in a cafe curled up with a comic book, or \nwith a journal and a pen working on a novel. Often times you may see me \naround town snapping photos of birds and flowers, when I don\u0027t have a \nclient wanting portraits, or a local event to photograph.\u003cbr\u003e\nAt present; nature is my backdrop (along with the beautiful Delano \nMansion Inn Bed \u0026amp; Breakfast, thanks to my wonderful friends who own \nthe place), but I would love to own my own studio some day. With all of \nthe wonderful downtown development happening in Allegan, that dream may \nnot be far off!\u003cbr\u003e\nLife is only as good as you make it, so fill it with positivity and enjoyable moments.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re only here for a limited time, let\u0027s have fun, get along, and make the world a more beautiful place.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u0026lt;3 (^..^)~ Stick",
