We are that message!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support makes this show possible. From the weekly shows, to the IG live, to special guests every dollar supports the mission of fostering love, belonging, and connection. I want this show to continue to be a free resource for people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027ve said before, if you aren\u0027t able to comfortably walk into Chipotle and add guacamole (because it costs extra) then please don\u0027t contribute, I do not want this to be a burden to you. But, if you can get guac and/or guac on the side, or maybe double chicken, then I appreciate your contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
