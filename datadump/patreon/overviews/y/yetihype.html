I love creating content and interacting with my community but unfortunately, it can be very time consuming. Especially as I move into exclusively edited content and strive to push the quality of everything I produce forward. Until recently, I have mostly been able to work on YouTube projects at my own pace however, in the coming weeks I will be beginning a full time University course in Film making. This course follows \u0027industry hours\u0027 meaning at peak workload, I could be looking at six 12 hours days a week. Although there will be downtime amongst this, being able to spend the time I want to on YouTube will become somewhat of an issue. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust due to the intensity and inconsistency of the course I am on, it will be hard for me to maintain a job and YouTube whilst doing the course. Although I do have student finances, if money become and issue then so will continuing YouTube. I do monetize my videos and as a result earn money from them but it isn\u0027t much. It is my dream to one day do this as a full time job but for now, baby steps. I have set up Patreon as a way for you awesome people to support me in what I do if you so choose. I will never put my content behind any sort of pay wall so remember, this is always optional.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy pledge?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging to me, you will be supporting me and what I do. If you pledge $1, you are already giving more than I will make from one person\u0027s worth of ads\u00a0in one month! If you are interesting in helping then become my Patron!
