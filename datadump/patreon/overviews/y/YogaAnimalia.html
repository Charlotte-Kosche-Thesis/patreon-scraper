    "summary": "Welcome to sanctuary! I am honored that you have come to my Patreon page! My name is Cameron and I am the traveling sancuary photographer behind the Yoga Animalia Project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started the Yoga Animalia Project in December of 2013 after many months of dreaming. I was visiting Ching Farm Rescue \u0026amp; Sanctuary in Herriman, Utah, showing up with three rescued turkey friends whom would live out their lives at the sanctuary. I stepped out into the hard-packed snow in my Vibram toe-shoes (my Southern California roots obviously showing), and I fell in love with the residents and that place. I started creating portraits of the residents and the first glimmer of the project was realized: I did not intimately know Costailo, Clementine, and the other residents yet, but I was able to create meaningful images that celebrated their personalities and individuality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to today and I have traveled to 74 sanctuaries all over the United States. I have done this fueled by savings, frugality, sales at festivals, and the overwhelming kindness of many people. There is no true \"end\" for the Yoga Animalia Project, as it seems I learn of a new sanctuary every other week, and I would like to continue traveling and creating portraits, spreading stories and compassion. I can do this with your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a patron gives you access to the community of sanctuary I am building, and it fuels my art and ability to share the voices of sanctuary residents. This work is my life purpose, and I am truly grateful for those who have and will join me in this journey. \u003cbr\u003eMay joy find you,\u003cbr\u003eCameron"
