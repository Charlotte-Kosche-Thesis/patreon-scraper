I do many types of drawings and I draw best when someone wants the drawing. I am a 21 year old woman who has the heart of an innocent child. Drawing is something that runs in my family because my real dad does amazing airbrushes and my father\u0027s dad does them just as well. My other side hobby is writing, my real mom is a book writer even if she only has 2 books published. Shelia K Lytle or now Shelia K Monette is my mother and her books are currently off the shelves I think so she can rewrite them. well that\u0027s a bit of my history but it doesn\u0027t explain WHY or HOW I got here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHow I Got Here\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI ended up here on patreon because of a close friend. she told me \"you should make a patreon for your drawings people would pay for these I just know it\" I didn\u0027t think my drawings were any good for paying for but I do try and a little bit of funds to buy better supplies and maybe eventually make them digital wouldn\u0027t hurt. I figured I\u0027d give it a shot since my life couldn\u0027t get any worse. Help with struggles to keep up or even everyday tasks is what my drawings represent. however they can mean much more like my profile photo and cover photo. they are character arts for my book.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhy I\u0027m Here and a little more\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eto put it simply I\u0027m here because I enjoy drawing for people. if I do a drawing meant for myself it doesn\u0027t look as great as it should because I lack the motivation to fix mistakes.

I\u0027ve been through almost every situation and I\u0027m only 22....\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been raped and the guy got away with it. I\u0027ve been threatened emotionally, I\u0027ve had a knife against my wrists...I\u0027ve been accused of some horrible things. so trust me...I\u0027ve been there...what helped me the most was hearing someone tell me \"hey its ok to not be perfect\" and my drawings relay such messages a lot because trust me my mind can get really dark. I\u0027m kind and generally don\u0027t charge for anything I do...I\u0027m only doing it with my drawings so I can improve them and feed my animals....I have 4 outside cats, 1 inside cat, 1 great Pyrenees (large sheep dog), a lot of chickens, and two pigs feed for them may not all fall on me but to keep the cats and dog I have to buy their food....otherwise they\u0027ll be back on the streets where they came from.",
