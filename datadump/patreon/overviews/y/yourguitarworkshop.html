To be able to make time to continue this channel in my busy schedule \u003cem\u003eI need your help\u003c/em\u003e!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven the smallest bit of support is felt and used for new channel productions like tutorials, music videos (covers and originals), reviews, vlogs, live streams, etc. To give you an idea, even the simplest cover videos take up to 10 hours to record and edit. Especially when these covers are duets, I need to practice with the other musician, do a 2 - 4 hour recording session (including setting up camera\u0027s and lights), and then still edit the footage and put it online. (with all the tags and extra info that goes with it).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTime for these videos is taken away from either my other work (Musician, guitar instructor at Selkirk Music College, and online lessons at yourguitarworkshop.com) or from my family. It is hard to balance time between all these things but YOUR support as my patron at least makes sure I will be able to continue with what I\u0027ve been doing for almost 8 years now.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Learning the chords to \u201cHotel California\u201d from a friend really changed where I would be going and what I would be doing later in life. Even tough I had been surrounded by music and instruments all my life I never really considered playing anything until I started strumming those first chords. It\u2019s safe to say me and my guitar got married shortly after we\u2019d met and it is a marriage that is still going strong today!\u003cbr\u003eIn those first years I absorbed just about anything guitar related, of course filtered by my own music preferences(Rock and Metal at the time). One of my first teachers taught me to be openminded about music and introduced me to new music on a weekly basis. He would give me a tape and say:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u201cListen to this, at least 5 times. You can like it, dislike it, but I want you to listen.\u201d\u003cimg height=\"150\" src=\"http://cdn6.yourguitarworkshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/fridaynight_in_sanfrancisco-150x150.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 24px 24px 0px;\" width=\"150\"\u003eThe first tape he gave me was \u201cFriday night in San Francisco\u201d by Al di Meola, Paco de Lucia, and John McLaughlin. I must have played that tape a thousand times over. I was amazed by their improvisations, technical skills, passion, and musicianship. Whenever he would give me another tape I would listen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003eStudying at the Conservatory\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg height=\"224\" src=\"http://cdn7.yourguitarworkshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-11-22-at-11.13.13-392x224.png\" style=\"float: right; text-align: right; margin: 0px 0px 24px 24px;\" width=\"392\"\u003eAbout 4 years after I played those first chords I started studying Jazz music at the conservatory of Amsterdam (Hilversum at the time). I would later on switch to Rotterdam where they had a world music department where I\u2019ve spent many happy years playing Jazz, Argentinean Tango, Brazilian music, Latin, Latin Jazz, Funk, Pop, Rock, etc. I\u2019ve never really specialised in a specific style but rather absorbed as much as I could of all styles! After graduation I started to broaden my horizon even further by delving into fingerpicking, classical music, and specifically learning all about Barrios and Tommy Emmanuel who\u2019s skills became a new goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTeaching and the beginning of YGW\u003c/h3\u003eSince the age of 19 I\u2019ve been giving guitar lessons to students of all ages at home and around my 27th birthday I started teaching at a large music school in the Netherlands. There I taught private lessons, group lessons, large workshops, and music projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"224\" src=\"http://cdn7.yourguitarworkshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/video_andre-398x224.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 24px 24px 0px;\" width=\"398\"\u003eSince 2006 internet has been becoming increasingly more important in my lessons leading to the foundation of Your Guitar Workshop.

So when you love my teaching you\u2019re gonna love all the lessons and courses!\u201dI guarantee I\u2019ve personally made every lesson, exercise, and backing track on this website. This will speed up your learning process tremendously as my philosophy on learning and teaching is embedded in each and every lesson.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEfficiency\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u201cAll lessons are written to complement each other so you\u2019ll hardly find any duplicate info on this website!\u201dI\u2019ve started playing at 16-17yrs old, at 21 I was studying music at the conservatory. If anything what I\u2019ve learned in those 4 years prior to the conservatory is to study very efficiently to get where I need to go as fast as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eMy courses and lessons are designed so you learn what you need to learn and then be on your way again.
