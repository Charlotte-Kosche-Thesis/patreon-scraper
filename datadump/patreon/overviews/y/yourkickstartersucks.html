You got your meals, snacks, games, a box full of Suicide Squad dolls, and all the essentials coming to you in the mail every single damn month. Just a few clicks and you\u2019re hoggin\u2019 off the teat of the USPS for life. But here\u2019s the catch: once you get your anime Harley Quinn Stuff-Plushie 2.0 out of the packaging and wipe your drool off of it, then what? You still got a damn box to deal with! And the little pieces of shredded-up Batman V. Superman IMAX tickets they stuffed it with, too! What a pain, what a hassle. What an expense!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what if I told you there was a way you could subscribe to a service that would take money out of your account every month, potentially even more money than you were giving to those godawful snack hawkers, and without the unbearable existential horror of dealing with a minor amount of cardboard on your kitchen table.
