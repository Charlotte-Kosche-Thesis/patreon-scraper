He leaves his apartment to sell stolen tech to his best friend Lenny. She owns a big pawnshop in the city. After Noah decided to get some food, Dogtails, really good stuff these days, he is run over by a guy who is chased by the police. What Noah doesn\u0027t know, after picking up his stuff, he unintentionally grabbed a disk from the guy. At the pawnshop Lenny takes a look at the disc. Her guess: it contains valuable information about the Zone. Instead of handing it to the resistance, an anti-government Organisation, Noah wants to sell it for a fortune.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAfter telling his plan to his ex-wife on the telephone, Noah witnesses Lenny being arrested by the police.
