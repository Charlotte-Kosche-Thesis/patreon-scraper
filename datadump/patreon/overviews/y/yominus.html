    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome\u003c/strong\u003e, if your not sure who I am yet well I go by the alias YO MINUS but my close pals call me Mark. I\u0027ve been making funny cartoons and music videos online for years now and have been loving every single minute of it.  Lately my focus has been centered around creating new music so I have had little or no time to make cartoons; or what I like to call \u003cstrong\u003e\"YO TOONS\"\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003cstrong\u003e1-3 mins cartoon parodies about famous celebs or current events\u003c/strong\u003e) One of these cartoons can easily take me hundreds of hours to finish and being a parent working a \"9-5\" it becomes extremely difficult to sacrifice this amount of time.  Also YouTube age restricts the vast majority of my videos so I am unable to generate any real income from my channel at all. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmpower Me To Create The Maximum Amount Of Content!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI give the vast majority of my products away for \u003cstrong\u003eNext to nothing\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eor (Pay what you want - donations)\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.yominus.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere!\u003c/a\u003e in hopes of working with as many talented artists as I can regardless of ones financial situation. So why not help empower me to create the maximum amount of content I can by becoming my patron!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I haven\u0027t been able to create many new cartoons because my focus has been entirely on my music, but with your support\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e(see awesome reward!)\u003c/strong\u003e I believe I could create at least 1 or even 2 cartoons per month! And eventually be able to hire an animator or two so I can start releasing even more content: \"\u003cstrong\u003eYO TOONS\", Music Videos \u0026amp; New Music\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ewhich will be totally awesome. Since I release the majority of my source content for less than a $1 as mentioned above who knows the collaborations that your support will bring... These are exciting times my friend so come hop on board and become a partner on this amazing journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
