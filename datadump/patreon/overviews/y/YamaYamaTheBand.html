Much more than VGM covers, our arrangements feature the band\u0027s diverse musical backgrounds and take the music to levels one would never experience in-game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe all work full-time as freelance musicians and spend countless hours creating new arrangements, recordings, and videos for the group. We are very passionate about new music and hope to push video game music into new territory, and with the help of Patreon, people like you can support independent bands like us and have a direct effect on our development and growth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is a funding platform that uses recurring contributions instead of large single donations. Your contribution as a patron to YamaYama would help us release more music with better production more often. We usually release a video about once a month, but if you\u0027re concerned about going over your monthly budget, you can set a cap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re not able to become a patron at this time you can still support the band by watching and sharing our videos. You can also purchase our music from \u003ca href=\"https://loudr.fm/artist/yamayama/AP8e2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLoudr\u003c/a\u003e. All of our videos on Youtube will always be free, and we\u0027ll always love our fans, but our patrons have a special place in our hearts. Thank you Patreon for making it possible for fans to directly support creators, and thanks to our awesome fans for keeping new music alive and thriving!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\"The best part about the complexity in their music is that it doesn\u0027t hurt your head to absorb it, and can often cause other body parts to move to the shifty beats.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eS.
