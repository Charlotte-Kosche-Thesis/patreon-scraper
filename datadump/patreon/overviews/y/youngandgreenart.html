    "summary": "Hello! My name is Jordan Thornton. I am a visual artist: a printmaker, arts educator, and, occasionally, an illustrator. I make work on my kitchen table and own the smallest printing press I\u0027ve ever seen. When I\u0027m not in my dining room studio, I am an Artist-in-Residence through both the South Dakota Arts Council\u0027s  and the Nebraska Arts Council\u0027s Artists in Schools and Communities programs, and I also double as an arts instructor and gallery interactor at the Washington Pavilion of Arts \u0026amp; Sciences in Sioux Falls, SD.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Over the last couple years, I had the unexpected opportunity to leave the world of full-time employment and jump feet first into being a freelance artist and arts educator. I adore having the ability to work in the creative world full time, but the world of freelancing is a bit scary. Thankfully, there is a kickass supportive community in this world called Patreon. So, here I am, sharing my work, the more intimate aspects of my process, and all of the excitement and anxiety that comes with it. I\u0027d love to have you join my creative journey and become ones of my Patrons! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far as the work I make goes, I was attracted to printmaking as a medium because of its ability to replicate imagery; to be able repeat an image, but to retain unique charms in each individual print. Through relief printing, I found a rhythmic sort of therapy in the carving techniques. At the same time, I am unsatisfied with traditional ways of displaying prints. I find much more conceptual depth and challenge in creating installations or collages, or putting prints into a shadow box. I am constantly exploring new ways to display my prints and create unexpected levels of intrigue for the viewer. My work reflects my curiosities outside of the studio: botanical imagery, animals such as snakes, bears, birds, and portraits of those who have influence on my life and emotions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll contributions made to me and my work will be used to purchase supplies, pay studio rent, and to make more time available for me to create new work and fine tune my craft. Thank you so much for all of your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
