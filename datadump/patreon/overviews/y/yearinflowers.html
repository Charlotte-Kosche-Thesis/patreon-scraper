    "summary": "One day, I was walking around my city block with my daughter\u0027s dog, Pepe the Chihuahua, mulling over something I had recently learned: that the city is its own ecosystem, with its own climate, water sources, animals and plant life. Suddenly a pussywillow catkin fell on my head and I realized (after hurriedly brushing it off, thinking it was a soggy caterpillar), that nature was all around me. I didn\u0027t have to go hiking in the mountains. I didn\u0027t have to camp in the woods. I could just observe the nature all around me. Mostly plants.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was so naive, I decided to focus on flowers, thinking they were a unique form of plant, not realizing that all plants, even trees, have flowers. Because I am a calendar creator and a teacher and a passionate advocate of seasonal time (I wrote a book called Slow Time about the difference between natural time and artificial time), I decided to assign myself a different task each month, based on an intuitive connection between the month and the topic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to support from various generous arts programs, like Hedgebrook, Jack Straw Cultural Center and Artist Trust in Seattle, I wrote several essays. And I taught a class based on my ideas for one year through my website, Living in Season. But I found that I only reached a small number of people that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do have a book proposal and I will be sending that out, hoping that a publisher will see the value of this approach, but meanwhile I wanted people to enjoy and use my ideas so they could\u00a0 explore nature wherever they lived. As a teacher, it\u0027s also important to me to get feedback on what is working and what is not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I decided to set up this Patreon account and hope to connect with enough patrons to pay for my time reading, researching and writing the essays. Knowing that people are waiting for the next month\u0027s essays will help inspire me to\u00a0do research and finish the essays that exist only in rough draft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a big dream of someday publishing a letterpress version of the book, with beautiful illustrations for each month.If I earn $2,000 a month, I will put aside half of the money to fund that project."
