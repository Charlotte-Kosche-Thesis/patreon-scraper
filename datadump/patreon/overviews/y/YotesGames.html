    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHey there! I\u0027m Tony Yotes and I\u0027ve been working on\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eBattle Gem Ponies\u003c/strong\u003e since December 2014.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/FTmXm2f.png\" style=\"width: 293px; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNever heard of it? There\u0027s a giant forum post about it \u003ca href=\"https://forums.equestriadaily.com/index.php?/topic/1190-battle-gem-ponies-pre-alpha/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. But to quickly summarize, it\u0027s a fully animated, turn-based, monster collecting RPG featuring super-powered shapeshifting ponies. Both adorable AND awesome! It\u0027s a passion project that inspired me to learn programming in high school and evolved from a simple fan game to a full-blown indie game production over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Yotes Games team is made up of myself and the talented orchestral \u0026amp; chiptune musicians E^2 and Bluco, pretty much on a budget of zero, with the hopes that the game pays off when it finally releases. The end goal is to be able to hold a stable career as an indie and make bigger and better games over time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided to open up a Patreon as an easy-to-use donation pool to support the game\u0027s development. Previous funding efforts with my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.yotesgames.com/p/games.html\"\u003eother 6 games\u003c/a\u003e and direct donations has led to things like new equipment, website hosting servers, Unity Engine tools, and convention panels. Patreon would be a great help for allocating a much bigger budget to do even more to make \u003cstrong\u003eBattle Gem Ponies\u003c/strong\u003e the best game it can be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/dXGO01B.png\" style=\"width: 337px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m deeply thankful for the people that have been supporting me and this project since its conception and I want to do right by those who have been going the extra mile and donating their hard-earned cash to my gamedev efforts. I\u0027ll be making sure every cent goes towards making the game better and getting it in front of as many people as possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePayment through Patreon would be a recurring monthly donation to my Yotes Games business account.
