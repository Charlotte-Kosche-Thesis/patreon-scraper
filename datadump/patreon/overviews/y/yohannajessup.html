    "summary": "Presence is magic. It\u0027s that something special that makes each person unique. \u00a0It\u0027s what makes you turn your head when someone walks in the room. \u00a0It\u0027s what creates a hush when you feel moved. It\u0027s how we connect to each other without words, in ways that have meaning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI focus on presence in everything that I do. \u00a0With fine art, this means I look at the essence and find the visual elements that will best express it and can bring it to life. \u00a0In this current body of work my focus is on creating devotional objects that radiate presence.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend most of my days in a meditative practice of making devotional art. This means I live in a meditation retreat center in Northern CA which is incredibly enriching for the creative process, and yet challenging in terms of the isolation. \u00a0Enter Patreon! \u00a0A beautiful way to connect and share about the process of making high quality devotional art, and receive support for doing so. \u00a0It\u0027s a win-win. \u00a0I love that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo check out all the goodies you can get for pledging your support on this page. \u00a0And most of all I want you to know that when you do, you make a real life difference to me and make it possible for me to keep creating.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
