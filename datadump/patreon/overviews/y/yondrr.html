Maybe about how they became a craftsman, or the journey starting a business, or how they fell in love, or even a ghostly encounter. Then those videos are posted to the\ninternet for their families and community \u2013 and you! \u2013 to enjoy and share.  Finding stories that want to break out and be\ntold requires time, travel, and sleuthing. It\u0027s a job that is only as good as\nmy working budget, as budget directs how far I can go, where I can go, if I can\ndine in a restaurant or fast food parking lot. That\u0027s really what this site is\nabout...funding my budget. So for the fact you are even here considering\nbecoming a patron, I thank you. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePATRON?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eLeonardo,\nMichelangelo, Raphael, Pablo Picasso, Ludwig van Beethoven, Vincent van Gogh\nall of these renowned artist had patrons.

Now I need your help. I\u2019m not saying to compare\nme to these amazing artists, but I want to do something pretty great...\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eSupporting\nYONDRR on Patreon creates a means for the continuation of great oral\nstorytelling and opens them up to the global audience they deserve. Financial\nsupport is important for all the behind the camera costs. Creating an editing\nbudget, I can hire an assistant editor to do much of the basic work so I can be\nfree to research and find compelling stories that must be told. In the end, the\nbest stories \u0026amp; interviews will be used to create a feature length\ndocumentary.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHOW?\u003c/strong\u003e How can you help? Select monthly subscription (cancel\nanytime, really). Every little bit\nhelps. Can you spare as little as $1/month? The $1/mo level provides access to\nthe Patreon feed here AND the Patreon Exclusive YONDRR podcast (audio versions\nof the videos.) Get the news first by supporting me through subscription. My\nsubscribers won\u0027t miss out!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ePick any\nof the larger support levels if you\u0027d like to go above and beyond to help keep\nthe vehicle running, get YONDRR into events, invest in equipment and more. It\nwould certainly help a lot! I could use a hot meal in a restaurant a\ncouple times a week. Gas and snack money. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for your financial support.\nWithout you, I\u0027m just a guy out of gas on the side of the road. But together, we\ncan make some cool stuff and capture a bit of our personal history to pass down\nto others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
