Welcome to the Patreon for \u003cstrong\u003eYuri Hell\u0027s Kitchen\u003c/strong\u003e, the surprise hit of THE GIFTENING 2016, now in perpetuating form because YOU demanded it! And we like paying our mortgages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you just joining, Yuri Hell\u0027s Kitchen is the brainchild of \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://patreon.com/docholligay\"\u003eDoc Holligay\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, foisted upon her so-called friend \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://patreon.com/jetwolf\"\u003eJet Wolf\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Doc can cook, and very well! Jet Wolf, perhaps less so. In YHK, Doc surprises Jet with a recipe with relatively minimal instructions (at least as far as JW is concerned thank you), which Jet will then try to cook as Doc waits for the inevitable hilarity to ensue. Jet Wolf\u0027s hubby Mike is roped into tasting and reviewing the results. Pray for Mike.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith this Patreon, you\u0027ll be able to help us finance the ongoing Yuri Hell\u0027s Kitchen experience, on a per-video basis. Our plan is to have four videos per year, so one every three months or so, with the faint possibility for one or two special releases if circumstances allow or we\u0027re particularly inspired.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPer video, we have an assortment of different tiers that will allow you to share in the experience. If you have any suggestions for something else you\u0027d like to see, don\u0027t hesitate to let us know!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n WE ARE HERE TO COOK BADLY AND LAUGH ABOUT IT FOR YOU\u003cbr\u003e"
