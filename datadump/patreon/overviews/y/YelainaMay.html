    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts a site for supporting artists. You basically pledge whatever amount you want on a monthly basis and depending how much, you get rewards. (they are all listed below) It helps me create more and bigger cosplays and gives you access to exclusive content. You will be able to add your input on what costumes I should work on next and tons of other things just for this little group. Plus a more one on one experience with me because there are far less people on here. That\u0027s the basics. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask!\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get when you sign up:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, you do NOT have to sign up. I will keep posting everywhere else like always, but this is for the people who really want to see inside what I do! I am really trying to make this something I m completely dedicated to and update regularly with in depth and exclusive content.

I have always loved to create things but never found the perfect outlet. Cosplay allows me to always challenge myself and learn new things. I have never had any sort of formal schooling in any arts so everything is a giant learning curve, and I love it!\u00a0However, my absolute favorite thing is the people. This is an amazing community with amazing people. The best feeling is going to a con in the beautiful outfit you created, and making new friends!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yelainamaycosplay\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yelainamaycosplay\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/yelainamcosplay\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/yelainamaycosplay\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitch\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e|\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://yelainamaycosplay.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjkPWq4Bxd_AkjdeR_83nfQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAny donation you make will go towards cosplay materials, equipment and convention travel expenses.
