I\u0027ve been working as an online multiplayers games programmer for the better part of the last 17 years (a position I no longer hold).\u003cbr\u003eI picked up woodturning as a hobby at the end of 2012, after consuming endless Youtube videos made by great teachers, such as Carl Jacobson (you can also find him on patreon), Sam Angelo, Erik Anderson, Mike Waldt and Stephen Ogle. I keep learning from these wonderful people and many more while I try to post videos of my own, to help others learn as I did.\u003cbr\u003eFrom bowls to vases, from lidded vessels to boxes, pen turning and decorative pieces, hollow forms and someday soon, even segmenting, I hope to touch and show as many aspects of woodturning as I learn these techniques myself.\u003cbr\u003ePledges made for me and my channel will help me stock up on materials, from wood to finishes, from dyes to glues, and will help me rest easier while trying to produce the best videos I can for the educational and entertainment values I hold dear."
