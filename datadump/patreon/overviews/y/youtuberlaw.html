    "summary": "Thank you for considering supporting YouTuber Law Channel. For the past 18 months, I\u0027ve produced some 250 videos analyzing the legal issues that matter to you. Whether your an online content creator, entrepreneur, gamer, influencer, advocate for free speech or content consumer, you\u0027ve found a home here. From legal how-To\u0027s to current legal disputes. From online disagreements to mob suppression of free speech, we\u0027ve not shied away from speaking tackling the tough issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you know why I do this? Because I love it. In doing the videos I found a renewed love for the law that I long forgot. For that I have to thank you. I recorded videos with 0 subscribers and never stopped even when getting 3-5 views. So while you don\u0027t have to, if you\u0027d like to support this channel I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Every penny goes into newer and better equipment and the legal research tools that cost way too much each and every month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI strive to educate, inform and entertain you. When problems in our online community arise, I strive to add some unbiased legal perspective to the issue. I hope that through your support, the channel can grow to support more and more of your needs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLior"
