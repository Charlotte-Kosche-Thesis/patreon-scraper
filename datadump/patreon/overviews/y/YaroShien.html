My name is Arron Pleitner AKA YaroShien and this is my Patreon. So first and foremost, who am I? Well to start off, I am a Southern Californian Content Creator, Voice Actor, Sound Effect Designer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have done a lot over the past few years. I created the show How to Be An Adventurer (DanMachi The Abridged Series), creator of the Live D\u0026amp;D Show, D6. I have worked with animators and content creators like GregzillaGT, Shippadge, Blaze Manga, Moonshine Animations as well as Misty Chronexia on Sound Effect Design and Voice Acting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/eda3/f/2018/016/2/f/patreon_spacer_1_by_yaroshiendma-dc07ugj.png\" style=\"width: 648px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"You Make Anime Parodies!? You Should Just Only Do That!\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as people wanna believe this argument is finite, let me explain something. making How To Be An Adventurer is not making me money. At all. That\u0027s it. Yes, this Patreon is set up to where I can produce it, but there is no return on investment on making content like Abridged series. Instead, I implore you to think about the other things I do that does make money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginal content like Spicy Anime Reviews, #AskYaro, D6, Skits, hell I even one day wanna make a Vlog series and maybe bring back the AV Podcast, but reality is, money is a factor that plays into making those things and the money I get back from it is in AdRev, but with Youtube being all \u201cHey Demonetized and views throttled\u201d you can guess why Patron is a saving grace. On top of that, I have to push out as much content in between abridged projects to remain relevant to Youtube\u0027s system because making one episode can take months!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh and on top of that, I have things to pay for such as rent which is where the majority of the money from this has been going last year and not much being left over. So you can see where I am at my limitations. I have to get sound design jobs and voice over jobs just to make ends meet for the month. Sometimes that doesn\u0027t even happen, pushing more stuff back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/cb8c/f/2018/016/0/2/patreon_spacer_2_by_yaroshiendma-dc07ugb.png\" style=\"width: 652px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Why Do You Have A TV for A Head?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I call this little OC, AV. He\u2019s a character I have been developing for the past couple of years and he\u2019s become a bit of my own persona if you will. I got to conventions with this guy and have been wanting to make a Convention video series on it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/3be1/f/2018/016/7/9/patreon_spacer_3_by_yaroshiendma-dc07ug1.png\" style=\"width: 652px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"What if I Don\u2019t Want To Be A Patron?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother great question. So here is the thing, I get that some people don\u2019t want to dedicate a lot of their money every month to support a guy on the internet. However, you have options. I have two for you fine Lads/Ladies. The first is \u003ca href=\"http://paypal.me/yaroshien\"\u003ePaypal\u003c/a\u003e, you can donate however much you want. As well as my \u003ca href=\"http://a.co/8vV11H2\"\u003eAmazon Wishlist\u003c/a\u003e will only contain things that I need for making videos and streams. But note that being a patron only costs you 12$/year\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/fd12/f/2018/016/b/8/patreon_spacer_4_by_yaroshiendma-dc07ufo.png\" style=\"width: 652px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Is There More Than We Can Expect From This Patreon?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood question. And Yes! Aside from the rewards that are already provided, I always try and aim for new rewards every time we pass a goal. Currently, the Full Time goal is our biggest uphill battle. But should we achieve and maintain the goal, I will start doing raffles for T-Shirts that I come out with. As well as starting a shout out to all my Patrons. I may even start making that Vlog series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/d532/f/2018/016/7/b/patreon_spacer_5_by_yaroshiendma-dc07ufj.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Okay, You Have My Money. What Now?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a general rule of how I run things. At the beginning of the month, your card/PayPal will be charged. By the 7th(Generally), you will see a master post containing links to your rewards, info to claim certain rewards (Like The Patreon Stream) as well as an update for what plans are intended for the month. Now keep in mind, sometimes shit doesn\u2019t happen. I get it, but at this stage of the patron, everything is a very hard maybe. I will constantly struggle to provide entertainment in a timely manner, that I can assure you. Also, thank you so much for your patronage, I hope to make amazing watchable content. As well as continue to receive your ever so gracious support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
