    "summary": "I create a daily podcast called \u003cem\u003eYour Creative Push\u003c/em\u003e, which inspires YOU to pursue YOUR creative passions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI suffered from many different creative blocks, and always wish I had a friend to motivate me or a podcast to inspire me every single day.\u00a0 That is why I created this podcast -- to be that daily support system for people with full-time jobs and full-time lives to be able to express themselves through their creative passions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter 100 episodes, however, the podcast has turned into a more-than-full-time second job.\u00a0 And while I absolutely LOVE doing it, I simply don\u0027t have enough time and resources to be able to keep doing it five days a week, and have to cut it down to three days a week.\u00a0 I was even leaving my job early on a consistent basis in order to get each day\u0027s episode ready to go (which, of course, has become quite costly).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will initially go to cover the costs of the show (web hosting, media hosting, etc).\u00a0 It would be a wonderful monthly relief to be able to break even on that front.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, your support will go towards my ultimate dream of being able to make this my primary job.\u00a0 If you listen to the show, you know how lucky I feel to have found my life calling with \u003cem\u003eYour Creative Push\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 To be able to inspire people to have the courage and the motivation to \u003cem\u003eactually\u003c/em\u003e go after the creative passions that they keep pushing off is the thing that I want to continue to do for the rest of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I want to get back to doing it five days a week.\u00a0 Maybe even seven.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only way I can do that is by making the podcast be a source of income.\u00a0 So that I won\u0027t have to spend my limited time doing a completely non-creative job that is pulling me away from YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf Your Creative Push has helped to push you, I can\u0027t tell you how much it would mean to me if you might consider sacrificing your daily Starbucks cup of coffee, just once a month.\u00a0 Or more, which is awesome.\u00a0 Or less, which is totally cool too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven one dollar a month is just about the nicest thing you can do for the show.\u00a0 And to me, it is so much more than a dollar.\u00a0 It\u0027s your voice being heard.\u00a0 And it is a PUSH that \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e can give \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e as I try to get this thing going so that together, we can push so many more people into pursuing their creative passions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf money is tight for you and you\u0027d still like to support the show, a HUGE way that you can support me and the show is by SHARING.\u00a0 If you know someone that could use this podcast in his or her life, please send them a link to your favorite episode.\u00a0 Or even share it on your favorite social media platform and tell your family and friends what the show has meant to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you are able to give a lot, a little, or nothing at all, I sincerely appreciate you listening.\u00a0 You have changed my life and helped me to realize the thing that I always try to tell YOU in the show -- that life is about so much more than the career that we have chosen for ourselves.\u00a0 It is about having the courage to express ourselves and the dedication to do that every single day, whenever we can find the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much.\u00a0 I love you.\u003cbr\u003e"
