     "about": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eYahya McClain, CEO of YAH Filmworks, has been involved in the entertainment world for more than 30 years.  Yahya not only succeeded as a professional boxer, becoming a Two Time World Champion, but he also learned the management and promotional aspect of the entertainment business.\u003cbr\u003eIn 1990, he founded Yahya Worldwide, a promotional company that promoted jazz concerts in Atlanta, Georgia and Las Vegas, Nevada, with artists such as Najee, Will Downing Jr, Jon B and Aaron Hall among many others.  In between training and boxing Yahya co-wrote and co-produced The Soda Pop Dance Show, a teen dance show that aired weekly, live on cable TV in Las Vegas.\u003cbr\u003eIn 1994 Yahya toured the East Coast promoting step shows at various HBCUs.\u003cbr\u003eIn 1999 Yahya began training and advising his ex wife, Laila Ali. Securing endorsements with large companies such as adiddas, Ford, and Soft Sheen Carson to name a few. Yahya also spearheaded her entire boxing career under his promotion company Absoloot Boxing. He worked tirelessly to make sure Laila stayed on course at the right pace.\u003cbr\u003eIn January 2001 Absoloot Boxing created the boxing event Ali Frazier IV (The Daughters 30 Years Later). The Ali Frazier IV fight was the first time in history that a women\u2019s bout was the main event on a Pay-Per-View show. The event was projected to sell only 30,000-40,000 buys, but well beyond expectations, the fight sold more than 100,000 buys.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2002 Yahya opened Absoloot Boxing and Fitness Gym, home of the Absoloot Awareness Foundation (AAF). AAF is a foundation set up to fight obesity in youth through boxing, education, and mentoring. To ensure that kids are better equipped to be successful, upstanding citizens of society.\u003cbr\u003eYahya\u2019s entrepreneurial mind has taken his career in many directions. In 1995 he began acting, but has since developed a strong passion for bringing his thoughts from script to screen. Yahya created YAH Filmworks  a production company to develop his own movies and television shows. \u003cbr\u003e        Yahya has also been hired as the personal trainer of some of the biggest named celebrities in entertainment such as Musiq Soul Child, Dru Hill, Nivea, Paul Wesley, Idris Elba, Omari Hardwick and most recently completed a European tour as the personal trainer for 2 Chainz. Miles Teller and Mike Trevino are the latest Hollywood stars to come under Yahya\u0027s guidance for greatness as they prepared for lead roles in two different feature films as boxers.\u00a0\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
