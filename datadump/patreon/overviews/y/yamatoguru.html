    "summary": "Hello there, I am \u0027YamatoGuru\u0027 Josh Lambright.\u00a0 I am probably best known for my work as a content creator and the project coordinator for the YouTube channel StarForce Media.\u00a0 My most extensive work for the channel has been my role as director and editor for the motion comic dub of the TMNT comics series.\u00a0 It is a project that I\u0027ve already put hundreds of hours into and one of many that I hope I\u0027ll be able to continue going forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReleasing quality content in a timely manner has always been my goal and I\u0027m constantly striving to improve editing techniques to deliver the best content possible.\u00a0 Up until recently I\u0027ve been able to dedicate enough time to my work to keep up with the regular release schedule of the series, but, after starting a new job recently to keep the bills paid, my free time has been drastically reduced.\u00a0 I want to be able to continue producing content for our viewers with the same frequency and quality that fans have come to expect and for that reason I have turned to Patreon.\u00a0 For just a few dollars a month, you can become one of my patrons and provide me with the financial backing I need while picking up some nice rewards for yourself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT ARE RAISED FUNDS USED FOR?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow for clarity\u0027s sake, the majority of the comic dubs that I and the other content creators work on are indeed unauthorized fan productions.\u00a0 Much like other well known fan production creators (ex. Team Four Star) we have never nor will we ever lay claim to any of those properties.\u00a0 Our videos are free to view and always will be.\u00a0 They are un-monetized (except in the case of certain rights holders who allow us to use certain elements such as music) and none of us make any money from them.\u00a0 If you make a monthly donation to me that money will not be paying for the video content (which will continue to be released free no matter what) but instead for the time I need to be able to work on SFM projects.\u00a0 Those funds will be used to cover my basic costs of living (food, water, shelter, the internet :P) so I can spend less time going out to make money and more time being creative.\u00a0 My ultimate goal is to be able to leave my daily job and work exclusively for YOU, my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE FUTURE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to continue making videos whether this Patreon experiment is successful or not, but if it is not those videos are going to take A LOT longer to produce going forward.\u00a0 The good news is it doesn\u0027t take much to make a difference.\u00a0 If every subscriber to our StarForce Media channel donated only at the lowest tier (just $2 a month) I would be able to quit my job and put all of my resources back into the work I love most.\u00a0 And for those who are able to donate even more a month, I have plans to show my gratitude through exclusive experiences and special rewards, just take a look at those incentives! --\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if I\u0027m able to gain pledges beyond just the basic costs of living I have plans to start producing new and original content including perhaps a special podcast show which would highlight the amazing voice talents and content creators of the internet.\u00a0 Working on various projects over the years I\u0027ve met all kinds of amazing and talented individuals from all around the world with amazing stories to tell and I\u0027d love to provide them with a platform to do just that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you\u0027re able to give or not I want to thank you all for the support you\u0027ve shown (and continue to show) for both myself and all of the content creators of StarForce Media.\u00a0 A few years ago I wouldn\u0027t have thought it possible to have such support but you have all amazed me and made that impossibility a reality.\u00a0 Let\u0027s see if we can do it again!"
