Basically, it\u0027s like a monthly subscription - in this case, to That\u0027s So Maven! You get to choose how much to donate each month, and you can \u003cstrong\u003echange your dollar amount or cancel at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe dollar amounts listed are suggestions only, but you can also \u003cstrong\u003edonate a custom amount \u003c/strong\u003ethat works for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote: \u003c/strong\u003eDollar amounts are in USD.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW \u0026amp; WHY DID THAT\u0027S SO MAVEN! GET STARTED?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an entrepreneur - and a femme-identifying entrepreneur - can be a very isolating thing, both physically and emotionally. It\u0027s all too easy to feel like you\u0027re the only one struggling what what are normal, everyday challenges for all business owners. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this podcast to create a network of support. A place where we can talk about business, life as an entrepreneur, and life as a femme. A place to be open, real, and vulnerable. A place where we can celebrate huge successes and the huge failures that got us there. A place to embrace diversity and inclusivity. A place without judgement or hate of any kind, where collaboration over competition is to go-to, every single time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT GOES INTO MAKING THAT\u0027S SO MAVEN!?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s So Maven! is a huge job that as of now, I do for free*. I did some quick math, and I\u0027ve donated over \u003cstrong\u003e1000 hours\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0of work to That\u0027s So Maven! How does that break down? I estimate I put about \u003cstrong\u003e10 hours a week\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/i\u003einto creating That\u0027s So Maven! That includes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Correspondence\u003cbr\u003e- Website maintenance and admin\u003cbr\u003e- Scheduling interviews\u003cbr\u003e- Conducting interviews\u003cbr\u003e- Photography\u003cbr\u003e- Editing the podcast\u003cbr\u003e- Editing photos\u003cbr\u003e- Prepping episode blog posts\u003cbr\u003e- Running social media\u003cbr\u003e- Travel time\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also pay for travel, parking, website domains and hosting, and equipment out of my own pocket.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*That\u0027s So Maven! has been a member of the Alberta Podcast Network, powered by ATB Financial, since August 2017, which does pay me a small amount ($25) per episode. Thus far, I have been able to pay for web hosting and domain fees from 2016/2017 with funds raised from the network.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, it\u0027s a big undertaking, to say the least. Especially since I do all of this in addition to running my own business and doing the entrepreneurial thing 24/7.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, I\u0027ve been called crazy. I\u0027ve been told I should never put that many hours into something that doesn\u0027t pay. I\u0027ve been asked many times why I don\u0027t just throw in the towel and scrap the podcast altogether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do this because I believe so deeply in the show, its message, and what it contributes to the community.\u00a0This show is incredibly important to me. I think it\u0027s filled a huge gap within the community and beyond by creating a safe space for us to open up about being in business and everything that goes along with that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve seen the impact it\u0027s had. I\u0027ve watched people connect and collaborate because of the podcast. I\u0027ve received countless emails from folks who tell me that they now use my podcast and website as a way to find people to hire, work with, collaborate with, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate goal is to have guests on the show from all corners of the world, from all industries, of all races and religions and gender identities, at a variety of points in their careers. I think what we\u0027ve got so far is an incredible and inspiring start. And I\u0027m always excited to meet new people and keep the network expanding further and further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT WILL PATREON FUNDS BE USED FOR?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I mention in my video, I\u0027m not looking to get paid for every single hour I put into this show. What I\u0027m hoping to do is supplement my income so that I can feel a little less pressure in my \"day job\" to make ends meet. I won\u0027t lie: right now, I\u0027m working an impossible amount of hours to meet my needs and run the podcast simultaneously. If I can earn a portion of my monthly income from the podcast, I can happily and healthily commit more time to it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd there\u0027s so much more to come - more podcast episodes, new directions with the podcast, live events, educational resources, maybe even some video content. There are so many ways we can grow this thing, and I want to make sure I\u0027m doing so in a way that benefits my audience the most. Which is why lots of the perks available to patrons get you directly involved with the show!\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, I just wanted to say \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for being here. Whether you can donate financially or not, your support of the show is incredibly important to me. If you could help me spread the word about this campaign, and about That\u0027s So Maven! in general, I would be eternally grateful! The biggest thing this podcast needs to succeed is an audience, and I so appreciate you being a part of that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
