     "about": "Manning his position as 1/4 of the Classic Hip Hop Group Brand Nubian, Lord Jamar has garnered a reputation for no filter speak on the mic outside of the confrontational rhyme talk he is renowned for. A cultural critic at large, Lord Jamar is waxing viral for his interviews that lend a much-needed insight seldom heard in the mainstream discourse. A proud member of the 5% Nation, Lord Jamar imposes a narrative on contemporary matters, and those with the stomach to listen will in no doubt take away a fresh perspective on culture and trending topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLECTURE / TALK SERIES\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday Hip Hop is a globaly consumed and generated culture fast becoming a teachable curriculum. As academia seeks to fit Hip Hop Culture into a Wiki-Like Grid, the emergence of Lord Jamar and his will to stand in the gap between institution politics and the voice of the originators is much needed to put it mildly. Currently growing in popularity through his frequent appearances and commentaries on VLAD TV, Lord Jamar has patented a stoic disposition while being tossed hot-button questions, steady delivering even toned witty responses while keeping his B-Boy Swag intact. THE GODCAST, part of a number of media offerings slated for release under the Yanadameen Brand, is a forum in which Lord Jamar can curate the direction and tone of the commentaries/engagement between his guests.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2018 Lord Jamar will venture into the lecture circuit touching down in the throes of academia with his lecture series, and workshops, guaranteed to blindside those that feel they have the compete Hip Hop Story. Included in these workshops will be oral presentations, Q and A\u2019s, and live programming demonstrations. To all those that fancy themselves guardians or shapers of all deemed canonical, DUCK! Yanadameen respectfully wishes to contest the flimsy gospels, and add shape to the philosophical mess\u2026\u003cbr\u003eRUMBLE YOUNG MAN RUMBLE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLORD JAMAR\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e(DISCOGRAPHY)\u003cbr\u003eBorn in the Bronx in 1968 \u0026amp; raised in New Rochelle.\u003cbr\u003eFormed Brand Nubian in 1989 \u0026amp; signed to Elektra records\u003cbr\u003eReceived 5 mics in the source for \u201cOne for all\u201d album\u003cbr\u003eGrand Puba left group \u0026amp; Sadat \u0026amp; Lord Jamar made two more albums as Brand Nubian, \u201cIn God we trust\u201d (1992) \u0026amp; \u201cEverything is everything\u201d (1994) respectively.\u003cbr\u003eDiscovered Dead Pres and signed to Loud records in 1998\u003cbr\u003eGrand Puba returned to Brand Nubian \u0026amp; they released \u201cFoundation\u201d on Arista records also in 1998\u003cbr\u003eLanded a primary recurring role on HBO\u2019s \u201cOZ\u201d as SUPREME ALLAH in 2000 (11 episodes)\u003cbr\u003eReleased \u201cFire in the hole\u201d with Brand Nubian on Babygrande records in 2004\u003cbr\u003eReleased only solo album \u201cThe 5% album\u201d in 2006 on Babygrande records\u003cbr\u003eWas the voice of ESPN\u2019s \u201cX GAMES\u201d \u0026amp; \u201cWINTER X GAMES\u201d from 2007-2011\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 Lord Jamar spoke on VladTV about Kanye West wearing a skirt \u0026amp; how that wasn\u2019t part of \u201ctraditional Hip Hop fashion,\u201d the subsequent support, as well as backlash Lord Jamar received, proved him to be a thought-provoking, yet at times polarizing figure.\u003cbr\u003eSince then Lord Jamar has done countless videos with VLADTV \u0026amp; has garnered hundreds of thousands of views per video, as well as becoming a \u201cviewers favorite.\u201d\u003cbr\u003eThus his fans have DEMANDED that Lord Jamar start his OWN PODCAST on his OWN PLATFORM!
