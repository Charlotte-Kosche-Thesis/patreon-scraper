    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eDance\nin Ritual\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy Yuko Kominami (representative of the project)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy urgent question is why do we dance, why do I dance, what\nis it for? What can be the benefit of all this? \u003cbr\u003e\n\nDance has been a way for me to connect to things and their\nmovements. Things visible and invisible, past, present and future. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe question has always led me to dance related to rituals.\nIn Japan, historically, dance has strong connections to rituals. It has been a\nmeans of communication with gods, the movement of the visible and invisible\nmatters, affirming and emphasizing connections to these movements. And from\nwhat I know, there are many other cases in the world, where, dance is deeply\nrooted in rituals. In rituals dance has a concrete meaning, in this way, I find back\nagain a meaning in my dance and dance in general.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI started Butoh (Japanese contemporary physical expression -\nmy background in dance) because I was attracted by the way it makes appear\nconnections to the ever-changing world and lets unfold an extreme way of\nexisting and being present. And also how it embraces the dilemma of being torn between\nthis modern world and traditional Japanese ways to relate to the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter certain years of dancing and teaching, more and more, I\nhave learned to respect this world and its movements and all woven connections.\nIt has already become some kind of ritual I would like to take part in and\nshare with others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have begun a search for exploring this experience deeper,\nand on the way, I met Benjamin and Joana. I was really excited to meet these\ntwo beautiful artists who share a similar question as mine and exploring it\nwith their honest ways. Benjamin with Arawo, where he keeps alive the\nconnections and rituals that is concretely embedded in the life and in the\ncommunity. Joana with her sincere and severe research for her own rituals in\nher contemporary dance field.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am excited meet together and experience, share and gain\ninsights into three different approaches to dance and ritual, (different but\nsharing a lot of spaces in common.) Those three approaches complement each\nother to draw a whole picture. Connecting tradition and present and excavating\nand reaffirming the meaning in dance.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBIOGRAPHY\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYuko Kominami\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBorn in 1973, Japan. She studied butoh and dance in Tokyo. After finishing her\nBA in Japanese history at Waseda University, she did a Professional Diploma in\nCommunity Dance Studies and an Independent Study Programme at Laban Centre\nLondon from 1998 to 2000. She obtained her MA in Dance Cultures, Histories and\nPractices from the University of Surrey with distinction in 2006. She has been\nworking as an independent dance and performance artist. She has collaborated\nwith other dancers, choreographers, artists, musicians and theatre directors of\nvarious landscapes. She has performed her work in prominent festivals such as\nFestival June Events - Atelier de Paris Carolyn Carlson, Les Rep\u00e9rages Danse \u00e0\nLille, Festivalul International de Teatru de la Sibiu, Bodyradical in Budapest,\nOdisha Biennale in India and so on. She has also worked and performed in\ncountries around the world \u2013 including Luxembourg, France, Germany,Belgium,\nSpain, Portugal, Italy, Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Finland, Turkey, U.K. , Japan,\nChina, India and Peru.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHer\nwork consists of experiments with movements in-between (movements of becoming)\nwhere intensities of individuals intersect. And through these experiments she\naims towards affirmations of multiple and fragmented movements of \u2018a life\u2019.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cfont\u003eHer work includes \u201cOnes Voices\u201d collaboration with Steve\nKaspar (2004)\u201cLinnunrata\u201d\n(2007), \u201creMEMBRANEce\u201d collaboration with Catherine Richard (2009) \u201cProject O\u201d\ncollaboration with Rajivan Ayyappan and Emanuela Iacopini (2010)\u201cMayu\u201d (2011) \u201cWinter Worm- Summer Grass\u201d\n(2013) \u201cThree Short Stories\u201d collaboration with Sayoko Onishi (2015) \u201cDreaming\nScarlet Medusa\u201d (2017)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.yukokominami.com/\"\u003ewww.yukokominami.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nvideo links:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/103692772\"\u003ehttps://vimeo.com/103692772\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/138799672\"\u003ehttps://vimeo.com/138799672\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
