That\u0027s the fanciest way to say: Welcome to the place you can directly support Matt and I in our creative endeavors. After a year of doing this podcast (and several years for Matt on YouTube) we\u0027ve learned two things: first, we love doing this! You guys are probably the most laid back group on the interwebs. We genuinely dig hanging with you, and making content for you to enjoy (or make fun of, whatever). Second, we want to improve. You can see just how in the goals to the left, but briefly we want to make longer episodes, and set up our website (yovideogames.com) to include more reviews, and editorials. In addition, we want to continue boosting the production value of our shows, getting interviews with the most inspiring talent in the industry, and working on hangouts to meet more of you in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can you help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, just checking out the page was a massive compliment, thank you! If you guys have a dollar to drop on us each month, that money would go towards drastically improving the show and changing our lives. One day, we hope to go to full time content creation, and that would be a dream come true. The deal is, you give what you want, and we make the same great content, but we also toss in additional stuff to make the daily grind more bearable. Whether it\u0027s a dollar, or twenty, know that we appreciate every cent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShine on doods!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
