No content will be locked off, because I think punishing fans is a dumb concept. The only Patreon exclusive thing would be a special stream where we just hang out, maybe I\u0027ll make a video live, something fun :D. Though my internet isn\u0027t good enough to do that right now, so that will wait for the time being, just an example though :3.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, if you want to support me and the creation of more videos on the internet, I\u0027m eternally grateful towards you, and if you can\u0027t, or just don\u0027t want to support me through Patreon, I\u0027m still grateful for you even watching my videos in the first place. Also, I\u0027m sorry about all the faces, force of habit. :3\u003cbr\u003e"
