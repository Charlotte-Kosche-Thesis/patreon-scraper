For just a dollar each - quite literally, for less than a bag of chips. The other tiers go into greater detail about the extra stuff that can also be yours if you\u0027re wanting to donate a little more, but what you\u0027re fundamentally getting with a dollar is one in-depth analysis per week, for four weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat about months with five weeks, you ask? Well, that\u0027s a week I\u0027ll be spending working on next month\u0027s material, a decision I made simply so I can avoid burnout. It actually benefits you a lot more than me, since it means every piece I put out will have had more time put into it, so you\u0027re getting more for your buck.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLike all adults know, life comes with looming debts. I have an impending college tuition to cover, supplies to buy and replace, and so forth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve tried freelance writing with various companies and I\u0027ve been lucky enough to have a few small successes, but it\u0027s pretty hard to consistently find gigs when it comes to professional writing, especially if you have no degree. Even the ones you get almost all treat your work as \"on spec\" writing, meaning that they can essentially choose whether or not to pay you, meaning of course that you will almost never be paid anything at all. The logic is that freelancing means submitting unsolicited work in \u003cem\u003especulation\u003c/em\u003e that you\u0027ll be paid for it, so they shouldn\u0027t be required to pay you. Sensible from their perspective, I suppose, but it still screws the freelancer over, and considering that there\u0027s no way a company would neglect to pay a writer if they were an employee, it makes it feel like you aren\u0027t being treated like the professional you want to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn either case, Patreon is a place where so long as you have an audience, you have guaranteed income, something which cannot be said of practically any other kind of freelance writing opportunity. I am also technically running a business by doing this, which is invaluable experience that I can put on my resume in order to much more easily find career-related work during and after college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, Patreon will be my favorite place to write because it\u0027s where I have the chance to be most like myself while still providing the best work I can. Of course, Patreon won\u0027t be my \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e source of income, but it will be a prioritized one for exactly this reason.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the Money Going Towards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFunding the college experience, first and foremost. I\u0027ve already mentioned that Patreon is just one of the streams of income I\u0027ll be using in the upcoming future to start paying off my impending college costs, but even if this weren\u0027t the case, you\u0027d be surprised how much of a difference a few extra bucks can make on day-to-day quality of life. I\u0027m going to need to replace common small supplies quite often - pencils, erasers, phone chargers, earphones - and knowing that I can do so without having to ask anyone, that I can effectively take care of some of my own needs, goes a long way towards giving me greater experience with financial independence. And, of course, this translates towards greater motivation and opportunity to provide you with high-quality content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome Patreon creators say they need money specifically to finance their own work, which is usually true - animators need up-to-date software, someone always needs a new computer or better recording equipment, and so forth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith me this doesn\u0027t really apply, since all I need and already have is my laptop and a decent Internet connection, which is why my tiered rewards aren\u0027t very high.\u00a0I\u0027ll certainly introduce higher ones if someone wishes to donate more, but we\u0027ll begin with the ones I\u0027ve made for now.\u003cbr\u003e"
