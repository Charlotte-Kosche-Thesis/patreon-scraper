Our team of volunteers on the ground in Yemen + the edtiorial staff based in Europe and America works closely together to get the message spread.\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/yjn7y93vz/Whats_App_Image_2018-01-26_at_17.18.00.jpg\" style=\"width: 470px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe write articles based off of Yemeni national media, in such a way that the common westerner would find it understandable and interesting. Furthermore, our team heavily rely on firsthand sources whose only job is to report when something happens. We also keep close track on potential civilian casualties as a result of indiscriminate Saudi bombardment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can we provide?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe can provide independent \"watchdog journalism\" on our website through various articles, aswell as creative content through video production and graphic design. Our organization is heavily embedded in the social media world, in order to maintain a steady flow of information being published by us. We can also provide in-depth analysis and reports on events and clashes as they happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Yemen?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYemen is the \"forgotten war\" the mainstream media will not talk about. it is a very gritty and dark conflict, with minimal information to make use of. And whenever Yemen is finally mentioned in the media, it\u0027s almost always portrayed as a \"civil war\" with an \"iranian-backed militia\" standing first in line with aggressions. That is simply not true, and that\u0027s what we want to change. We want to shift the public opinion in the favour of Yemen as a nation - the poor country being invaded and bombed by the wealthiest country in the region. We see this as extremely unfair, and Yemen has every right to resist, with any means necessary.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe hope you would like to support us with even a small fee per month. They help us maintain our website fees, and it keeps our content professional and widely available. Any contribution is well received. Your contribution will make a huge difference in the \"media war for truth\", which have been raging for many years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Rune Agerhus\u003cbr\u003eExecutive Director\u003cbr\u003eYemen Resistance Watch\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
