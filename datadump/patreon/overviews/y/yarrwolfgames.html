    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHey folks, YarrWolf Games here, welcoming you to my patreon page. I wanna thank everyone first off for coming here and joining me on this journey as we build this company from the ground up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO AM I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eWell I am glad you asked, my name is Steven, sole owner of YarrWolf Games. I am a growing youtube content creator as well as aspiring game designer. I grew up in a small town in Colorado where I lived and breathed video games, as I was that nerd who found more solace in the stories I found within games, rather than the outside world. Now while that still remains fairly true, I now spend my days at a full time security job and my nights taking care of my wonderful daughter and finally pursuing my dream to make YarrWolf Games a full time company and with your help I hope to succeed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT SPARKED MY DREAM?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I spent several years as a kid in California, and during a birthday for my brother, he received the then, brand spankin new Nintendo 64, a copy of Super Mario 64, as well as what I could only describe at the time as the most beautifully groundbreaking game ever, Starfox 64. Now while I may have been wrong with my assumptions, that game engrossed me and made me start looking at games in a new light. how do the ships fly? what makes them move throughout the level? what dictates how enemies attack? All of these questions flooded my thoughts, however, through depression in my later years and a lack of self esteem I found myself never pursuing my dream until I was almost 26 where I ended up trying college out for game design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT HAPPENED TO COLLEGE?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I never ended up completing it due to home life issues, but the passion never left and as of the beginning of 2017 my life started to settle again, and YarrWolf Games was born. Anyways when I was in college I took a small game design class, that delved more into the teamwork side, as well as design documentation and proper planning. In the class, I created a game using RPG Maker VX Ace, called crops and monsters which is still on my agenda to recreate and turn into a complete game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOUTUBE CONTENT DO I CREATE? (Edit- See new schedule)\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Well after many schedule changes I will now be mainly focus on game design which will be streamed, as well as monster mondays which consists of monster hunter world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN YARRWOLF GAMES?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Just myself currently with the often help of my friend Ravio and his wife Weeping Angel, however with my personal hope to push directly for programming, I hope to eventually have at least an art partner who can hold that side of the work load, as well as be a fresh perspective on the planning of future games. However until i\u0027m more accustomed to the companies workload overall I will be the sole Owner of YarrWolf Games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW DOES PATREON WORK?\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Patreon allows you to pledge your support to content creators through a reward system which you can choose from to the right of this. You can cancel your pledge at any time. Here on my page you can ask me questions, discuss upcoming content and bring up any issues you may be having. If at any time you feel like I am not rewarding properly or you need to go over my head with an issue, patreon also has support that you can contact as well. Also the game polls are always open to the public, so anyone patron or not, as long as you watch my channel, are absolutely able to vote on upcoming games played.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0***\u003cstrong\u003eCURRENT SCHEDULE \u003c/strong\u003e(Full Time work is normally 8AM to 4PM MST)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonday-\u003c/strong\u003e Monster Mondays (7pm to 9pm MST)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTuesday-\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Tuesday Stream (7pm to 9pm MST)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWednesday-\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Wicked Wednesdays (7pm to 9pm MST)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThursday-\u003c/strong\u003e Game Design and review video (updates to come)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFriday-\u003c/strong\u003e Game Design and Final Fridays (updates to come, FF uploaded at 5am MST)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSaturday- \u003c/strong\u003eFree time with Yarrspawn\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSunday- \u003c/strong\u003eSupernatural Sundays (8pm to 10pm MST)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* It is the current schedule however with work, as well as my kiddo is subject to change on short notice (there will still be notice as soon as I know as your time and support is very important to me and I will not waste it).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAS A FINAL NOTE, IF ANYONE IS EVER CURIOUS ABOUT ANYTHING, ALWAYS FEEL FREE TO ASK.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003e"
