    "summary": "Hello, I\u0027m your evil twin.\nI make \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/youreviltwinLP\"\u003e\u0027Let\u0027s\nPlay\u0027 game walkthrough videos on YouTube\u003c/a\u003e, with commentary that is thorough, informative, and has a dark sense of\nBritish humour.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI started making Let\u0027s\nPlays as a hobby in 2012. Right from the start I established a style that\nshows off absolutely everything that a game has to offer, rather than rushing through in the most obvious or efficient way. Whether a game is a triple-A\u00a0blockbuster or a forgotten title with poor reviews, I always play a game to the\nfullest extent, using every tactic, weapon and special ability to its full\npotential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also create mini-documentaries regarding the development of games, the science behind their\nsci-fi concepts, and the historical events that inspired their stories and\nsetting. If a game does not include subtitles for in-game\ndialogue, I add my own custom subtitles to make the story more accessible to\ngamers that are hard-of-hearing or not native English speakers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlthough my Let\u0027s Plays\nare detailed and comprehensive, they are also very enthusiastic, with a comedic\nattitude rather than being a dry facts-only walkthrough. When I defeat enemies\nI often say a cheesy one-liner or pun, and I\u0027ve been known to indulge\nin maniacal laughter when using a giant death-ray, minigun or flamethrower.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have always appreciated the kind comments and words of encouragement from my viewers, and for 5 years that has been a great reward for the effort I put into my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, several of my loyal\nviewers have repeatedly suggested setting up this Patreon, so that they can\ndonate money and help turn my videos into a source of income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Nowadays adverts on YouTube videos generate far less money per view than they used to, and everyone uses Adblock anyway, so YouTube adverts are pretty much worthless.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am\npleased to announce that I have changed my work and family circumstances so that I can produce videos regularly and frequently. As well as YouTube videos\nI am now also able to do livestreams of games, so that fans have an\nopportunity for live interaction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a fan of my videos but you aren\u0027t able to donate, that\u0027s OK! My Let\u0027s Plays will continue to be free for\neveryone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecoming a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe way Patreon works is that you can donate whatever you want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. Anything, from $1/month up, is hugely helpful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to become a Patron you\u0027ll help improve my quality of life and in turn you\u0027ll also\nhelp increase the number and frequency of games that I am able to do Let\u0027s Plays of. As a thank you, you\u0027ll have\naccess to my patron-only feed, submit questions for Q\u0026amp;A videos, be able to connect with other supporters and get sneak peeks of what I\u0027m working on. I\u0027ll also follow you on social media, and I\u0027ll thank you in a shout-out on social media as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re able to donate a\nbit more, you\u0027ll gain access to higher reward tiers where you can vote on which games I should do Let\u0027s Plays or livestreams of next. I\u0027ll also give you a shout-out in the final video of the next LP I finish. At the level above that you can actually suggest which\ngames should go into those polls for patrons to vote on. At the highest reward\nlevel you can also ask me to do special one-off videos or streams covering a\ngame of your choice.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for your kind\nsupport!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nyour evil twin\u003cbr\u003e"
