Not only will you be able to go to all the normal destinations through quick travel, but you will also be able to grid travel and explore the area\u0027s around you and maybe even houses in your neighborhood ;). This game is based on the game development engine named QSP where you control a player\u0027s life and all the interactions therein.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eTLDR\u003c/strong\u003e; RP-Life is an adult browser game where you take control of a person\u0027s life and all the activities afterwards, be it bringing out the lewd nature of your character or some other surprises that are in store for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eRP-LIFE contains erotic, violent, strange and just genuinely dirty scenes. Viewer discretion\u00a0is advised as you should be at least be 18-21 years old depending on local law\u0027s, if you do not know your local laws, look them up before! All characters depicted in this game are of at least 18 years of age or older, there are no actual or identifiable minors used in this browser game.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy a browser game?\u003c/h2\u003e\nWhy out of all game engines that you could have used to create this game do you choose to make it in a browser format?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSimple! Because I am a web developer and the browser is my medium. I feel if I chose something else it would not be nearly as well made, so I stuck with something I know I can create fast and clean. I decided I will not only create it in a browser style, but I will also be able to store the user\u0027s saved data as well, so no need to keep track of save files guys! This game will basically work like a normal browser mud, where you log in and are connected to a database, all actions will be saved and if you wish to start over or undo an action, it will be as simple as hitting a button!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDevelopment\u003c/h2\u003e\nCurrently it is fairly early in development as it has been a side project, as a lot of the technical stuff needs fine tuning. However that is why I came to patreon, to show other\u0027s what I want to accomplish with this game and hopefully will be able to put more time into the game then I have before.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrent games in active development:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e(RP-Life)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIn Development:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMain images\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNPC fight/rape system\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSave/Load system\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRedo site layout\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVarious things I mention in posts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rb7fIp3.png?1\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
