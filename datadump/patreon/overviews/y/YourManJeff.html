I have a deep passion for technology, science, space, adventure, travel and more. I want to live my life to the fullest, but occasionally, I love to sit down and reflect with several thousand of my best friends. So whether we are talking pop culture, politics, space, music, business, self-help advice, or any other random thing (I like to talk about scotch, beer, candy and more). I am sure we\u0027ll have a good time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of Patreon I can upgrade my home studio, Invite or travel to my guests, attend conferences, hold contests, interview people I never thought I\u0027d meet, and so much more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of how well we get funded, I\u0027m going to do the podcasts weekly anyway. As an added bonus, I will be live streaming several times a week when I\u0027m not at work. I will also occasionally livestream gaming sessions through Twitch or other sites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with most things in life, I want to be successful, but this is an experiment. I appreciate everything this community has become and everything you all will do. I love supporting the groups I do and I hope I can provide the same value, entertainment, and happiness that they give me."
