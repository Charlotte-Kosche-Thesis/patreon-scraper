    "summary": "Hi! I\u2019m Yale Stewart and I\u2019m a cartoonist. Thanks for stopping by to check out my Patreon! A lot of you have asked me about when I\u2019d start a Patreon, and it looks like the time has finally come. On the other hand, some of you may be wondering why I need a Patreon at all, so let me explain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy claim to fame is webcomics, which I put online for everyone to read for free. I love doing that, as it means anyone and everyone can read my comics at no cost to them. However, since it doesn\u2019t pay, I generally have to find outside sources of income, whether it\u2019s freelance work, commissions, or hitting the convention circuit. Frankly, I enjoy all of those things, but sometimes the overall workload can get in the way of my favorite thing: making comics. With Patreon, I\u2019d like to achieve a greater amount of both financial\u2014but also production\u2014stability. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFinancial stability speaks for itself, but let me talk a little bit about production stability. If I have a better idea of where my rent is coming from, I can spend less time on random oddjobs, and can focus on making comics. To start, I\u2019d love to get to a reliant, page-per-week update schedule. With enough support, I hope to even get back to two-pages-per-week. Patreon could also open up other possibilities, such as live streaming the creative process on platforms like Twitch, or exploring other genres that interest me, whether it\u2019s fantasy, biographical, or particularly comics inspired by music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo break it down, here\u0027s what Patrons will receive from my page regardless of how much I earn:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to all the comics I create\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBehind-the-scenes content, like step-by-steps of the process\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\"From The Vault\" content: commissions or prints you may\u0027ve missed\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThe more I\u0027m able to earn monthly, though, the more content I can create, in both volume (the number of comics) and diversity (videos, tutorials, AMAs, etc.).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor now, though, I\u2019d like to just be able to produce comics steadily and reliably, and further develop the community of all of my amazing supporters who\u2019ve helped me make this my career for the past 6 years. If you can chip in, I appreciate it more than you could ever know. If you can\u2019t, hey, that\u2019s totally cool, too. Either way, you\u2019ve been helping me live the life I\u2019ve wanted for myself since I was five years old, and that\u2019s good enough for me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
