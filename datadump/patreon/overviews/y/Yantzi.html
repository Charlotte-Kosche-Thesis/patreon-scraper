    "summary": "If you enjoy my Twitch streams, and if you\u2019d like me to continue to make more, please consider giving me a couple dollars (or however much you like) per month to keep my dream of streaming video game content alive!  I will be playing a mix of the hottest titles \u0026amp; older classics, while talking about the most recent gaming news.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently stream full time, work a full time job, all while trying to balance time with my wife \u0026amp; 2 kids. If I can get enough funds I could maintain my streaming schedule, while spending more time with my \u00a0family \u0026amp; get more than 3-4 hours of sleep per night. This will also free up time to expand to Vodcasts \u0026amp; Youtube video content. For now, other than a few designated family days, I primarily stream 6-7 days a week during the evenings after work, with a couple day time streams on the weekends. It\u2019s going to be a fun year!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that you enjoy my channel. Thank you so very much for your support!"

Hitting this goal would allow me to travel around to the big gaming events \u0026amp; conventions, Like Pax cons \u0026amp; Twitchcon. By doing this, I would be able to network with other content creators \u0026amp; new viewers to help grow my Youtube channel. More importantly, it gives me a chance to meet you, the fans, in person. Also, this will help me build more local events here in Kansas City.",
