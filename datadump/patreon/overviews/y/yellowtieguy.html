Shortly after that my daughter\u0027s mother and I separated and I became a single dad with full custody of my daughter, which made my career decision and execution that much more difficult, but also afforded me the ability to work from home during the day while my daughter was in school and perform at night while she was asleep and being watched by my very supportive family (for which I am truly grateful).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, I have performed as a solo acoustic singer songwriter while also acting as front man for alternative rock band YellowTieGuy. We\u0027ve since released two full length records (Joy In The Mourning and Play On Words) and are playing an average of a hundred dates a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI originally started using Patreon to be able to contribute to my good friends who created the web comic PhD Unknown. After being a contributor through Patreon for some time, I saw it as an effective way for me to deliver new content to supportive fans and friends and offer something exclusive that they couldn\u0027t find anywhere else. I honestly also feel that by being held accountable to you for delivering new content in this way that it will help me focus on songwriting more in a way that hasn\u0027t been entirely possible given the time constraints required to be a truly involved parent. I\u0027m hoping that we can take this journey together and share in the songwriting process as it is happening as well as the inspiration behind it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t thank you enough for your continued support as it allows me to do what I love while providing for my family!"
