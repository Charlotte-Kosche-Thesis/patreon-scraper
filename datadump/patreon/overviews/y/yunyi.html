    "summary": "Hello fellow romantics!\u003cbr\u003eI am Yunyi: a massive foodie, avid traveler and romantic at heart. With this heart, I would like to thank you all for the love and support you have shown towards Tangning and Mo Ting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are reading this, you must have made your way over here from the novel\u003ca href=\"https://www.webnovel.com/book/8212987205006305\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0Trial Marriage Husband: Need To Work Hard\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e which I am currently translating. It is currently on a schedule of 14 chapters per week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTranslating is not an easy job, especially when it is from a poetic language like Chinese. It can sometimes take hours just to translate one chapter. I know, in comparison to an ancient novel, a modern one is easier to translate, but it does have its own difficulties; have you ever tried to make sense of modern/internet slang (one of the frustrations of the modern language =p) or industry jargon? On top of everything, I am also my own editor, so it takes extra research and attention to detail to make sure everything is correct and makes sense.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApart from translating, I am also a blogger, graphic designer and content creator. I need to take on so many different jobs as I am a freelancer that works from my laptop. My income every single week is different depending on what projects I receive. So, by supporting me on Patreon, I can prioritize my time on translating and spend less time doing other things. Who knows, maybe someday translating will be enough for me to make ends meet and I won\u0027t have to do anything else (that is the ultimate dream).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll pledges big or small will be greatly appreciated and help towards my daily cost of living. If you like what I do, consider that $5 is a cup of coffee and $10 is a meal, so think of it as buying me a drink or a meal once a month. Maybe some day we can sit down and actually have a drink or meal together in real life. =)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll pledges will be charged at the beginning of each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart. xx\u003cbr\u003e"
