    "summary": "Those of you that have been listening regularly to the Yaron Brook Show know that it is unique in the landscape of podcasts and YouTube channels.  And while my take on the cultural and political events of our time in relation to Objectivism sets me apart, it also gives strength to the philosophical foundations crucial to fostering a productive and reason based social structure.  My show voices a distinct defense of reason, egoism, individual rights and capitalism that you won\u2019t hear anywhere else. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe overall goal of the Yaron Brook Show is to expose as many people as possible to the profound ideas of Ayn Rand while at the same time offering guidance in applying her ideas to one\u2019s own life.  I do my best to educate fans, followers and newcomers on the philosophical principles of Objectivism and how these principles apply to an individual\u2019s life.  I\u2019ve made great headway with the power of the internet \u2014 any of my shows can be accessed, for free, anywhere in the world.  But access alone is not enough; exposure reach is key.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUltimately, my vision is that by sharing these amazing principles and building a community with minds like yours, we can make a significant impact on the world around us, and more importantly bring about a culture where reason, individualism and capitalism are cherished.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo grow the Yaron Brook Show to a scale that can have a real impact, I need a legion of like-minds, starting with you.  Your membership will not only take the show to the next level \u2014 with increased marketing; improved audio and video quality; greater worldwide exposure \u2013 it will also offset production costs and be crucial in promoting the\u003cem\u003e Radical Capitalist \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eLiving Objectivism\u003c/em\u003e podcasts to listeners around the world on even more stations, listeners who also find value in hearing the Yaron Brook Show\u2019s pro-freedom, pro-individual rights message every week.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecoming a Yaron Brook Show Patron means being an exclusive member of a movement that will shake and change the world one podcast / video at a time!  And of course, there are some great personal perks that you can enjoy only as a member.  Be the force that amplifies the voice of freedom and invest in this exclusive opportunity to create a better future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJoin me as a Yaron Brook Show Patron today and be the voice that brings reason to tomorrow!\u003cbr\u003e"
