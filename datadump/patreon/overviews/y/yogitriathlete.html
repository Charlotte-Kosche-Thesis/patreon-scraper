    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAt its core, YogiTriathlete is about tapping into your inner badass; the part of all of us that remains unchanged no matter the circumstance. The YogiTriathlete podcast is a limb of this mother ship. It is a weekly show sharing stories of people who are looking, finding and living their purpose. People who have tapped into their inner badass and are willing to share what it takes to inspire others to put their dreams into action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn June of 2016, we rid ourselves of most of our material possessions to follow a call to the west coast. From the very first glimpse of our move, it was evident that there was something massive between point A and point B. That massive thing was the Ride the High Vibe Tour, a six-month cross-country trek to raise awareness that living a more vibrant life is within reach for all. It was a mission steeped in service and the podcast became a central focus as we were effortlessly connected with amazing people all over the country who are looking, finding and living their purpose.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is more important than ever to cultivate connection. Every time we can take a step in this direction, we are casting our vote for a stronger community and every time we put ourselves in service of others we strengthen that community. We want you to be a part of it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur intention with the YogiTriathlete podcast is to provide everyone with a chance to breathe, a moment to pause and remember that we are all here for a unique purpose. This show shares the power of others who have put inspiration into action and are living those results. We bring this podcast to life every week from our hearts as we continue to look, find and live our purpose.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
