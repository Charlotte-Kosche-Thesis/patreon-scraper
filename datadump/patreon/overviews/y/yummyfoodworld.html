    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI am Mrishtina Maharjan from Kathmandu, Nepal..\u003cbr\u003eCurrently living and studying in Germany, I try different varieties of food from different countries. I have also learned to cook many dishes from\u00a0countries\u00a0especially Italian Food. \u003cbr\u003eI have a YOUTUBE CHANNEL \u201d\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/c/yummyfoodworld\"\u003eYUMMY FOOD WORLD\u003c/a\u003e\u201d where I make a new recipe every week if time and situation permits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow and why I started Youtube Channel?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was always watching many youtube channels to learn and explore new foods from around the globe. As I was interested in making new recipes and trying them, I learned a lot.\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016 I realized that here was no proper Youtube Channel which was teaching new recipes in Nepali language.\u003cbr\u003eOne of my Nepalese friends brought me SUKUTI (Dried BUFALLO MEAT) from Nepal as a gift.\u003cbr\u003eI just made a video using that SUKUTI on 10th of march 2016 and uploaded it in youtube without having proper knowledge and tools for video shooting and editing. Somehow this video got some views. This encouraged me to make more new recipes.\u003cbr\u003eI learned a new thing every time I made\u00a0a new\u00a0video. This helped me to make a\u00a0better video next time. Every time I make a new video, there is always something to learn from it.\u00a0This helps me to make better video next time. And this process is still continuing.\u003cbr\u003ePositive comments and appreciation from viewers helps me a lot to improve. I learned many new things about video shooting and video editing in this\u00a02 year of time.\u003cbr\u003eAt first, I was having a struggling phase for my youtube channel. I got 40 subscribers in 1 month of time. This increased to 1000 subscribers in almost 5 months. My plan was to reach 10,000 subscribers in 1 year but I ended up getting almost 45,000 subscribers.\u003cbr\u003eI am more than happy to be able to present my Food Recipes to all the people out there seeking to learn Nepalese Food.\u003cbr\u003eI will also come up with much more continental Food in the future.\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am working on making YUMMY FOOD WORLD community bigger and reach all the Nepalese who have access to the internet at first.\u003cbr\u003eMy aim of life\u00a0is to be able to provide food to as many people as I can who are really in need starting from my country Nepal.\u003cbr\u003eI am not just dreaming about it, I will make it happen one day.\u003cbr\u003eIf you are one of those who want to create a youtube channel and have any problem or any questions or if you have any suggestions for me to improve, feel free to contact me at my e-mail: mrishtina@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003eI will try to reply you within 24 hours. If you are really interested in learning and if I am capable of helping you, I will surely help you out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWith love and Greetings,\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWISH YOU A WONDERFUL DAY AHEAD and HAPPY COOKING \u003ca href=\"http://emojipedia.org/smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/svg/1f60a.svg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
