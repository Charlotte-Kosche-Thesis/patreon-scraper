Well, get comfy, and I\u0027ll answer some questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e I\u2019m Yoshi, freelance digital artist with a passion for drawing animals and antropomorphic creatures. Throughout all my life, I loved to create different characters, stories and worlds in my head. When I was a kid, it was my favorite game! I was writing down bits of this stories and making drawings of key moments. Growing up, I became obsessed with the idea of creating my own comic. But after ten pages, I realised that I don\u0027t know much about the topic, and quality isn\u0027t good and, and... Well, we all know how it goes. I was too insecure about my abilities and too scared of a failure. So I stoped, hoping to continue after I get better. And everytime I was getting a bit better, I was thinking it\u0027s not enough, I need more, just a little bit more. That could go on forever. But a few years later the idea of that comic just stopped being appealing to me. It was the end of it. My fear of looking inexperienced killed the project. (Wait, you didn\u0027t ask about my life story? Too late!)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Years have passed, and I\u0027m more confident about what I do and why. I still have a lot to learn, but I\u0027m glad that I feel passionate about art again and enjoying the jorney, hope you\u0027ll enjoy it too! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy I need Patreon?\u003cbr\u003eFor a few months now, I\u0027ve been writing a script for a new comic, called \"Yoshi\u0027s adventures\". A comic about overcoming your fears, and becoming your true self. Such a big project takes a lot of time and effort, and as much as I would love to work on that all day long, I can\u0027t. Because bills won\u0027t pay themselves(silly things!). So I thought Patreon could be this little bit of stability in my life. Becoming an artist as a full-time job would be a dream come true. But of cource, I will work on the project and becoming a better artist no matter how it goes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you can get?\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t wanna hide behind the paywall, so all my finished art and comics will be published everywhere else as well, just a week later than here.\u003cbr\u003eBut as the patron you also get to see my WIPs, sketches, sneak peeks, studies and vote for what I should draw next! Let\u0027s go on this adventure together! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut seriously though, no pressure. You don\u0027t have to pay to see my work. My original projects and finished art will always be free to watch on other social media. Your support already has taken me very far! Your favs, watches and kind words mean the world to me! Hope you have a great day, wonderful people! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sincerely yours, Yoshi~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
