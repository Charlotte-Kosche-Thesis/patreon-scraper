I\u0027m Mark, and welcome to the Yesterworld Entertainmen Patreon! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now it\u0027s just me creating the channels content, including the research, writing, VO, editing, asset gathering, GFX, location shooting, etc. As much as I love creating these videos and have a passion for telling these stories, it\u0027s a lot of work to ensure quality over quantity, which tends to equal very little Ad revenue.\u00a0From the beginning, I\u0027ve done my absolute best to avoid the temptation of sacrificing production value in order to get videos out faster (which would = more ad revenue), but I am reaching the point where it\u0027s becoming more and more difficult to keep up that mentality. \u003cbr\u003eThis channel and it\u0027s videos quickly became a full time job (and then some), for which I am extremely grateful and humbled, as it has grown beyond my expectations.\u00a0But in order to help \u00a0cover bills and life obligations while ensuring the output is uninterrupted, I decided to start this Patreon. This will also help enable the possibility of additional content, such as classic movie reviews, Q\u0026amp;A\u0027s, etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you want to help support me in the making of future videos and find value or at the very least entertainment in the content I create, please consider helping to keep this channel not only going, but growing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out the page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMark aka Yesterworld\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYesterworldEntertainment@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
