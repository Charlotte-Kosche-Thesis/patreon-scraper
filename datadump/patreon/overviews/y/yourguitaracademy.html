Welcome to our Patreon page :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.yourguitaracademy.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYour Guitar Academy\u003c/a\u003e was built from the ground up, without any investment or any real funding. We are simply a group of passionate guitarists who love playing and love teaching. So, whether you are taking a 1-2-1 guitar lesson with one of our tutors, learning via Skype or using our collection of free online lessons, we want to say thank you!\u00a0We are working every day\u00a0\u003cem\u003e(far too many hours!)\u003c/em\u003e to bring you the highest quality guitar lessons, and it\u0027s all made totally worthwhile when we get feedback from our students across the world who are loving the lessons. We want to continue to make more videos, with more awesome tutors and to continuously make them better and better. This is why we have set up this Patreon page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe wish we could sit in front of the camera every day to create guitar lesson videos that will continue to improve your playing. We want this to be the reality, but there is a fair way to go! Every single person who donates to us is helping us make that dream a reality, so we thank you for that. We know exactly how we can improve our site, and exactly where we want to go to make sure that you are getting the best lessons possible, but are restricted financially (join the club right?). If you are here then you have seen that our videos and tutors are worth supporting, so again, thank you."
