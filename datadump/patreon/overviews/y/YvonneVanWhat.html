    "summary": "Hello there! My name\u0027s Yvonne and I\u0027m making, well, music \nvideos for your entertainment. Now It\u0027s mostly different kinds of synthesia \ntutorials but sometimes I\u0027m making orchestral covers or even posting my own compositions! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for right now, I\u0027m consistently making 2 synthesia tutorials on my main channel and maybe some extra stuff (like covers) on my second channel. And I have plans to start making more videos each week, maybe even daily (but that\u0027s a longshot). And that\u0027s because I LOVE music, I like making music and improving myself in that area. However, I can\u0027t dedicate all my time to it - there are a couple of reasons to it. First of all, pretty soon I\u0027ll be having my university finals and preparation takes a lot of time (and the trip to the uni itself takes a lot of money). Secondly, sometimes I feel like the amount of time I\u0027m spending doing Youtube is not completely covered by the ad revenue. Plus, sometimes I just want to take a week off doing Youtube (it can be too overwhelming) and play some game or just hang out, but I can\u0027t do that because as for right now it\u0027s my only source of income and I have to keep it steady. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will help me with all of these problems, and even more! For example, It will provide to me the chance to build a proper community and interact with you, guys, more. It would also allow me to purchase and upgrade the hardware and software I\u0027m using to make videos (it will help me make videos more often and improve their quality) And last but not least, Patreon will help me supporting the creators I like!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron, you will get access to my Patreon only Discord channel (with a cool role included), so you will have a space to talk - to me and to other members of the community! And at the higher tier you will be able to get the new videos instantly when I\u0027ll make them (for example, as for right now there are 8 videos just sitting on my channel and waiting to be published).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here is a interesting fact - 1$ donated here equals 3000-5000 monetizable views on the channel. Please, consider supporting the creators you love. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
