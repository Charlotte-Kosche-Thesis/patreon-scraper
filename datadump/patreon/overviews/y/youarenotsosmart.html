My fantasy and dream is to hire a reporter and a producer to make the podcast as deep and rich as my favorite storytelling podcasts like Radiolab, This American Life, and 99% Invisible. If enough Patrons add their support, we can make the show ad-free for all listeners and put our episodes weekly instead of once every-two-weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
