Sometimes for time constraints or if I have a commission that takes priority, but they will have to endure the shelf for months, sometimes years. At this point in my life I am not actively working towards being a \nprofessional artists. I have a full time job and a family that take a \nlot of my spare time and that would not be a realistic goal at this \npoint. I do, though, enjoy creating art and want to keep doing it. With this, and your support, it will give me the opportunity bring those down more often to work on them and share them with you all. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works:\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you would like to support me, select the reward level at the right if the page and follow the prompts.

I will then do a charge post and once I see a received payment the art will go up or be emailed out.
