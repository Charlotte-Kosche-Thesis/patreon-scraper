I\u0027m also a high school and college sex educator, a clinical social work student at Boston University, a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.forgelitmag.com/flm/2016/05/02/a-good-mother/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewriter of fiction\u003c/a\u003e, and a cat daddy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s29.postimg.org/chwndlmuf/Full_Size_Render_jpg.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI started Yaybody because in my role as a sex educator (and then-intern at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.thecsph.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe CSPH\u003c/a\u003e), I kept on stumbling upon life-altering information about bodies and relationships. This stuff saved my life and helped me learn to appreciate my body and my brain -- even through mental illness, even through rough patches in my relationships. Not only that, but it became clear as I delved into Yaybody that \u003cstrong\u003ethe more I learned, the better I became as a person\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share that with you. And I want you to walk away from Yaybody with the sense that \u003cstrong\u003eno matter who you are, you are valuable and worthy of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://yaybody.com/2016/01/05/what-is-good-sex/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003egood sex\u003c/a\u003e and\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://yaybody.com/2016/02/18/good-at-dating-bad-at-love/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e loving relationships\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAnd it seems like it\u0027s working. My most popular post -- about\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://yaybody.com/2016/02/06/beyond-yes-means-yes-navigating-differences-desire/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe importance of \"maybe\" in sexual consent\u003c/a\u003e -- has been read over 5,500 times! Which I know is small fry for the internet, but that\u0027s where you come in: \u003cstrong\u003ewhen you support Yaybody, that gives me the time and energy to make sure that \u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eeveryone \u003c/i\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ehas access to the information and tools that I\u0027ve got up my sleeve.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Okay, but like... it\u0027s just a blog. Shouldn\u0027t blogs be free?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe simple equation is:\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003emore money = more Yaybody\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to be honest: right now, I live right around the federal poverty level. And that\u0027s okay, for now. I\u0027m on Medicaid. I have an amazingly cheap apartment, an amazingly wonderful cat, and some amazingly amazing friends, coworkers, roommates, and partners who will take care of me if things go south. There is, after all, a reason I chose to start a Patreon for Yaybody rather than a GoFundMe for January rent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut the hustle is real, and it doesn\u0027t always leave room for Yaybody.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eEach of my blog posts takes upwards of 5 hours to research, write, edit, and decorate (those GIFs, yo!). The longer ones can take up to 10 or 15 hours. So when the going gets tough, I can only manage to pop out ~1 post per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s not a whole lot. At this rate, it would take years to publish all of the posts I\u0027ve got coming down the pipeline. Which is great for me, because it means I\u0027ve got years of content, but\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI want to make a Yaybody post every week. I want to make a Yaybody Podcast! I want to make sure that everybody has access to quality, affirming information about bodies and relationships.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho knows? Maybe this whole Patreon thing will be a flop. But it\u0027s worth a shot. If you\u0027ve ever read a Yaybody post that has affected your life for the better, consider chipping in to help make that happen for more people.\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
