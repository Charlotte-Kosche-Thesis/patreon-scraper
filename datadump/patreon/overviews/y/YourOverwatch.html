At the request of our viewers we have set up a Patreon to give our most devoted fans the opportunity to get more out of the YO experience and support the project directly. Remember that all rewards are OPTIONAL and our current content will remain the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the launch of Overwatch we were just another bunch of barely known gaming YouTubers who had a passion for gaming but now, as we approach the year anniversary of Overwatch\u2019s launch we have now come to make gaming media our full time jobs. A dream job indeed and a project we\u2019d like to expand. Patreon funding will be used to keep up the consistent high quality our fans have become accustomed to while we increase our production capacity by hiring additional help to speed up the process. It may surprise you how many hours go into some of your favorite YO videos! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving generous fans support us on Patreon will give us a direct line of communication to our most dedicated fans needs, as well as give us the resources to do MORE of our resource intensive content. This even includes possibly branching out into new exciting projects for you all to enjoy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTypes of Content YourOverwatch Makes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the three of us, our channel creates a wide array of Overwatch content.
