Whats that mean?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eAs many of you know, on my YummiR6 channel I am very into cars, or at least trying to learn and get more into them. With that said, beginning\u00a0to work on cars of all shapes and sizes is my ultimate goal. In the end I want to learn, and teach! Throughout this series the main goal is to get a car to be drive able or\u00a0pleasurable or customized, or even most likely, all of the above! In this series we will feature tons of things like polls, live streams, and even live chats with the \u003cstrong\u003ePIT CREW. \u003c/strong\u003eIn these live streams members of the \u003cstrong\u003ePIT CREW \u003c/strong\u003ewill help me choose what the next upgrade or part will be for the specific vehicle we will be working on. Through the support of the pit crew, we will be able to achieve a highly customized vehicle that was customized by you!! However, this isn\u0027t\u00a0the best part. The best part is at the end of the multi-video/live streams/polls of the current vehicle we will be giving the fully customized car to one of the members of the \u003cstrong\u003ePIT CREW \u003c/strong\u003efor a tiny amount of \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e$10!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eWhats the point of this?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTwo words, opportunity\u00a0and learning. This is an incredible chance for me to learn more and more about vehicles from a dummies stand point. Which in turn will teach you guys out there that don\u0027t know much about vehicles either!\u00a0The opportunity, the YouTube community has given me more than I could ever ask, what better way to give back than to give a fully customized car away to one of my \u003cstrong\u003ePIT CREW \u003c/strong\u003efor $10?!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere will we see videos? How often?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eVideos will be posted not only here for the convenience\u00a0of the pit crew but will also be posted on the YummiR6 channel once a week if everything is perfect. However, we all know that is not always the case. Just in case things take a weird turn you are \u003cstrong\u003eONLY\u003c/strong\u003e charged per episode, therefore, if there is no content, you wont be charged for supporting! So its up to \u003cstrong\u003eYOU \u003c/strong\u003eto bring this series to the next level of customization. Each car I am hoping to have done in around 12+ episodes, however, the more community support we get, the cooler the project will come out, taking longer periods of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I talk to you and enter into polls for the series?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you are already familiar with Discord, its as easy as joining the server and waiting for instruction! If you\u0027re\u00a0not familiar with it I suggest looking up videos on connecting to it to join in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill it only be cosmetic?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNOOOO!! With the support from the pit crew and this amazing community I hope to grow, I hope to take the cars we are building to the next level. Which includes exhaust, turbo, supercharging, etc... The sky\u0027s\u00a0the limit with this build and its up to \u003cstrong\u003eYOU\u003c/strong\u003e to decide where that limit is\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e*Disclaimer:\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThis is funded through our Patreon as a project.
