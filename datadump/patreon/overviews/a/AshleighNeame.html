No Aotearoa ahau.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! Thanks for dropping by my Patreon page! I\u0027m Ashleigh, and since I was 10 years old I\u0027ve wanted to write books for a living. In case you didn\u0027t understand what I wrote up there /\\, I\u0027m 23 years old and I live in The Land of the Long White Cloud...also known as New Zealand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a pretty ambitious writer, which isn\u0027t always a good thing. I\u0027m taking part in NaNoWriMo 2017 (yeah, yeah...I know, I\u0027m slightly insane). The project I\u0027ll be working on is a YA fantasy novel called \u003cem\u003eVenefica\u003c/em\u003e. You can follow my progress on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/user/AshleighNeame\"\u003emy\u00a0Wattpad profile\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of my writing, I also run my own website called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.theliteraturehub.weebly.com\"\u003eTHE LITERATURE HUB\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0. It started out as a book review website, and despite my attempts to make it more than that, it\u0027s pretty much still a book review website. I also work part-time as the sole Education Coordinator at the Papakura Museum in South Auckland, New Zealand. While I like the relatively steady income, I hope to one day be able to write full time. (That may be another 3 years away though, thanks to a car I have to pay off!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to join me on this daunting adventure to become a full-time writer, why not become a Patron of mine? I offer all kinds of rewards at certain levels, starting at $1/month. If you decide to become a Patron of mine, THANK YOU! Your contributions will make this writing thing so much easier.\u003cbr\u003e"
