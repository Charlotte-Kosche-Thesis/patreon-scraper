I have lectured at several universities and last year, after searching YouTube for Anthropology Videos, I realized that someone needed to make them. As a result, as of January of 2017 I launched a new YouTube Series called Anthropology in 10 or Less and more recently as of October 2017 I have launched\u00a0Anthropological Inquiries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnthropology in 10 or Less\u003c/strong\u003e will explore the four fields of Anthropology, which include: Biological Anthropology, Archaeology, Linguistic Anthropology and Cultural Anthropology. Each episode will focus on a specific topic within these four fields and cover the topic in less then 10 minutes, making Anthropology more accessible to the general public and as a teaching tool, or study tool for students.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnthropological Inquiries\u003c/strong\u003e brings real-world anthropologists on live shows to talk about their work and how they are using Anthropology in the real world. This show is for those who want to go deep into anthropology and really understand the many ways to be an anthropologist."
