    "summary": "Hi! My name is Arctix and I\u0027ve been part of the Justin.TV / Twitch.TV community for years. I\u0027ve helped a number of streams out with Management and Growth because I have such a passion for the Twitch community. I moderate for some large channels as well, including but not limited to SourKoolaidShow, RetroGaijin, BuffDaddyHD, TayZondayGames, MrBoombati, as well as have been requested by name to moderate heavy traffic for FuturemanGaming and TigerWriter during their front page Twitch Partner Spotlight. My two larger projects involved providing CohhCarnage with an opportunity to host the world premiere for Camelot Unchained (video) and creating/developing SourKoolaidShow\u0027s Roast for Twitch. Both were ideas originated from the knowledge I\u0027ve gained by researching and helping communities grow on Twitch. Recently, after attending PAX South, a bunch of Streamers convinced me to begin working on my own channel in an effort to provide content to a community I\u0027ve already established.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is a goal and a passion of mine, to provide entertaining and honest broadcasting of not just games, but music, and community oriented content for everyone to enjoy. I\u0027m also HUGE on charities. Just recently I participated in the St. Jude\u0027s 2015 campaign to raise money to battle cancer, and earned a whopping $600 dollars in one day. I have a very vibrant community called the Arctix Circle and everyone is welcome to join, so long as you\u0027re respectful and good to one another. I enjoy taking the knowledge I\u0027ve learned from years of online exposure, trials and tribulations and helping new and aspiring streamers become successful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me and my efforts. I can dedicate even more time to not only providing my wonderful viewers with content, but also helping people grow their streams and helping streamers develop new content in an effort to become successful. I look forward to getting to know each and every one of you more personally as I attempt to spend more time with Twitch, the community, and future/existing talented broadcasters. Patreon\u0027s support system will give me the platform and ability to spend more time doing those things I love so that I can help provide more content to you the viewer. Love all of ya!"
