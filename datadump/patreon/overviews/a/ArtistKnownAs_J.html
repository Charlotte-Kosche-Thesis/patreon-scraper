    "summary": "Another aspiring artist/ visionary hoping to make a living doing what I love: art. My short term goals are to attend Artist Alley\u0027s at Comic-Cons and be able to support myself through my talents.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a completely self-taught artist. I used to dream of creating a comic book when I was younger, but decided that was simply a fairly tale dream and I needed to focus on more \"real world\" job applications. So for about the last ten years I\u0027ve been a painter(for houses), a pipe fitter, and now working full-time as an all around handy man doing a little bit of everything. But this is not my dream job. I won\u0027t go into my whole life\u0027s story, but there has been plenty of trial and tribulation as I sought to change or improve my life but never to any avail. A few years ago a car accident changed my entire life\u0027s perspective and now, more than ever, I seek to pick up my old talents and chase a dream I once thought unachievable.\u003cbr\u003eAround March of 2016, I made a goal to purchase a drawing monitor and some decent drawing software. As I\u0027m sure any aspiring artist knows, these tools are not cheap. It literally took me a year to acquire the extra funds to purchase these things. But in March 2017, my XP-Pen monitor arrived in the mail, and my journey officially began.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been a little over a year since then. My artwork has improved and I don\u0027t intend on stopping. What little spare time I get is spent working on new pieces and focusing on becoming better.\u003cbr\u003eWith your help and support by becoming a patron, I\u0027ll be able to focus more of my time on my art and expanding on who I am as a creator and visionary. With a lot of effort and a little luck, we can help bring this dream to life."
