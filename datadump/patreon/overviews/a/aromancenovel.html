    "summary": "We are A Romance Novel. Not a provacative page-turner - but an evocative onslaught of live funk, fusion, jazz, R\u0026amp;B. Every Sunday night at world famous Wally\u2019s Jazz Caf\u00e9 in the South End of Boston, 6 of Boston\u2019s finest musicians play their hearts out from 10pm til the lights come on. The music doesn\u2019t stop - but the bills don\u2019t either. These fine Berklee College of Music student have student loans, housing costs, and many other living expenses that are put on hold while bearing our souls at Wally\u2019s. We need your help to keep these musicians alive, happy, and able to continue doing what we love. Every dollar goes not into my pocket, but back into improving the lives of these amazing band members, and creating an other-worldly music experience for YOU, our devoted fans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eYour contributions will go towards\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Paying the band a decent wage (50$ per Sunday right now, need to increase to 100$ ASAP)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Purchase of video/recording equipment to document the magic each Sunday night, and create an archive for everyone to listen back and experience the magic of Sunday night, any night of the week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Funding our debut album. We are in the process of writing original music, and itching to put it on wax and deliver it right to YOUR ears. This process takes a lot of funding, and we can\u2019t do it without your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Eventually, we would like to book a tour and come play in different cities outside of Boston. We\u2019ve met so many amazing fans from all over the world - India, Argentina, Columbia, Germany, France, to name a few! With your contributions, we could possibly visit you in YOUR town!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoyed what you\u2019ve heard on Sunday nights, your contributions will see ROI (return on investment) very soon, and in a big way.
