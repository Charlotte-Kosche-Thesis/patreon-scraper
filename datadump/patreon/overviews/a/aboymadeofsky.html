    "summary": "My name is Jonathan. I\u0027m an anthropologist based at the University of Cambridge, where I study the relationship between people and their environment. I\u0027m also a environmentalist, a druid, a witch, and a writer - I\u0027m fascinated by all things magical, mythical, and green. I write books and articles, make films, teach about human nature, and volunteer my time and expertise to all sorts of charities and government consultations. My goal is to figure out how to encourage people to care for the world we live in; and explore how enchantment can help us do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese days, most academics spend a lot of their time applying for funding in order to do research. There\u0027s not a lot of funding about, so a lot of junior scholars end up doing other things in order to support themselves - from copywriting, to retail work. Me among them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery donation I receive will help me to spend more time on research, writing, and campaigning about making our world better for all living things. I\u0027m deeply grateful to anyone who feels moved to contribute - and I\u0027ve got plenty of rewards on offer too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks and blessings to you and yours! /|\\"
