We create mods for the BFME game series to try and keep the game fresh and alive.

Let\u0027s not beat around the bush: what we do takes time, and life isn\u0027t cheap. We\u0027ve invested and continue to invest a lot of time into keeping these games supplied with new content, and receiving monetary support makes this investment easier to justify. We have a lot of passion for what we do, but sadly, passion doesn\u0027t put food on the table!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can\u0027t charge people money for what we create, nor do we want to. We want everyone to have free access to our mods and projects, but we also want people to be able to support us if they so choose.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do We Do With The Money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving a bit of extra support will mean we can afford to spend that extra hour a day on finishing additions to new versions or stream and interact with our audience, basically. If we get enough pledges a month, we will also be able to make the decision to spend it on software licenses for the team and commissioning things like voice acting\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do You Get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u0027t want to exclude anybody from getting cool rewards based on their ability to spend, or make things about AotR exclusive in any way. Due to real life time constraints, it\u0027s also difficult for us to provide extra content when we are already squeezing hours from our schedules to work on AotR. Therefore we\u0027ve decided to not have a reward system - the reward is supporting us and knowing that you help us out as we continue to work on Age of the Ring and other projects.\u00a0"
