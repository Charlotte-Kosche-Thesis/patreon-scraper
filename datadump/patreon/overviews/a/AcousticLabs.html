It\u0027s support that has really nourished and sustained me creatively, and to anyone that has ever reached out, spread the word, bought a tab or music, or watched a video, I have heartfelt thanks for all of you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can reach me anytime with questions or business opportunities (or just to say hello!) at AcousticLabs.info@gmail.com",
