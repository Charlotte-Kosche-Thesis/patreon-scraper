     "about": "Founded by original hosts Chiaki and Mitsugi in July, 2009, the Anime Addicts Anonymous Podcast was born from a decision to put together something awesome from their collective anime knowledge. They wanted to make a community where people could share their love of anime and Japanese culture while learning in a friendly and generally awesome environment.\u003cbr\u003eWhat came to pass in the years to come was just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHosts have come and gone over the life of the show but the mission of making our listeners\u2019 anime addictions worse remains strong. Every episode is broken into three parts: Housekeeping, Main Topic, and Reviews/Impressions. During housekeeping we read and thank our five-star reviews, welcome new forum members, announce trivia winners, and answer mailbags. During the main topic we discuss anything and everything related to Japan and anime. From studio highlights to current events we try to provide you with interesting and engaging information. For our reviews, we give in-depth discussion-based analysis on current anime. Impressions are a unique way for us to highlight what you should be watching before it\u2019s finished.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014 we brought out live show to \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/AAAPodcastOfficial\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e so make sure you subscribe there and chat with the hosts live every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, isn\u2019t it time you made your addiction worse? We\u2019re happy to have you!\u003cbr\u003e",
