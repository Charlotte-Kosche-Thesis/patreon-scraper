Unfortunately, ad revenue from YouTube is too volatile to depend on and in order to pay the bills I have to seek other employment, taking away precious time to create awesome videos for you. I am looking for your support to continue making YouTube content especially for you. Your pledge will go towards the cost of living, recording equipment and the games you want to see me play. Becoming a patron is completely voluntary and, regardless of pledges, I will still continue to create videos for as long as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to see the Adlingtont Channel grow, please check out the list of reward levels below and become a patron today. Thank you for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore rewards will be coming soon once I finalise some details. If you are an existing patron and are eligible for a new reward, you will automatically be included for the reward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cem\u003eNote: Non-Physical rewards will be given to you upon your first month of patronage (when you are charged at the end of the month).
