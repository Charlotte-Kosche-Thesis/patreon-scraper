All of the songs reflect a longing to be free and/or actually freeing ourselves from expectations, destructive relationships, places we don\u0027t belong, and anything else that makes us feel trapped. The songs were inspired by my 30,000 mile solo-cross country quest, after quitting my nine-to-five job as a nonprofit professional for a dishwashing job at Yellowstone National Park.

You can also choose a monthly limit, so that if I release more than one piece in a month, you\u0027ll only be charged what you\u0027re comfortable with. The greater your pledge level, the more gifts you will receive. \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027ll also get a free video when you sign up!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support!"

     "about": "Amber Ikeman tells the story of a modern-day Western pioneer. With soulful vocals, raw lyrics, and passionate delivery, her contemporary folk music and stories invite audiences to explore life beyond convention and expectations. In the summer of 2014, Amber quit her nine-to-five job as a nonprofit professional, left her Florida hometown, and began a solo cross-country road trip to start a new life, taking her 30,000 miles and counting. Her experiences, from washing dishes in Yellowstone National Park to climbing mountains give a living backdrop to her songs of struggle, self-discovery and strength. She released her debut album, \u201cFree,\u201d in 2015, recorded with producer Chris Cunningham. Amber is currently based in Bozeman, Montana and is also touring nationally.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://amberikeman.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMore...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"1000px\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"1000px\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u0026lt;/section\u0026gt;\u0026lt;section\u0026gt;\u003ch4\u003eArchives\u003c/h4\u003e\u0026lt;select\u0026gt; \t\t\t \t\t\t\u0026lt;option\u0026gt;Select Month\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \t\t\t\t\u0026lt;option\u0026gt; November 2015  (1)\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \t\u0026lt;option\u0026gt; October 2015  (1)\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \t\u0026lt;option\u0026gt; August 2015  (1)\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \t\u0026lt;option\u0026gt; July 2015  (1)\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \t\u0026lt;option\u0026gt; March 2015  (1)\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \t\u0026lt;option\u0026gt; January 2015  (1)\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \t\u0026lt;option\u0026gt; December 2014  (1)\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \t\u0026lt;option\u0026gt; November 2014  (1)\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \t\u0026lt;option\u0026gt; October 2014  (1)\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \t\u0026lt;option\u0026gt; September 2014  (1)\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \t\u0026lt;option\u0026gt; August 2014  (3)\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \t\u0026lt;option\u0026gt; July 2014  (3)\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;  \t\t\u0026lt;/select\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/section\u0026gt;",
