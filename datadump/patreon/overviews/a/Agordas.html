    "summary": "Hey guys! Thank you for stopping by and ceck out this page! For those who don\u0027t know who I am, let me introduce myself. I\u0027m Agordas a multi-instrumentlist and metal vocalist. I run a YouTube channel where I make metal covers of movie-, tv- and videogame themes, but also of famous pop- and metal songs. I do everything by my own, from the recordings to the mixing and mastering and also the filming and video editing. My tiny appartment serves me therefor as my studio and my primary filming place. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMusic is my life and I love to make those covers for you guys! I\u0027m endless grateful for your amazing feedback so far! But I would like to create more covers, more often than that and with your help and support it could be possible! With your support, you directly help me to keep this channel alive and continue with creating new songs and videos! If I even could make a living with it, I could invest all my time into it! I could move into a bigger apartement with a seperate studio room to produce songs and videos more efficient and faster! Also I would invest into better equipment to get a really awesome production and an improvement of my videos! I could deliver more content and you could watch new videos or listen to new songs more often! It\u0027s a win-win situation!^^\u00a0 And for every pledge you are willing to make, even if it\u0027s just 1$, you will receive a reward in return!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou get extra content such as my songs in lossless WAV format, early video access, backing tracks, jam tracks, guitar tabs and many more (see sidebar on the right).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e How does it work? / How often do I get charged? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eYou choose the amount you would like to contribute. Everytime I release a new music video this amount will be charged and you get access to the rewards at the level of your amount and all other rewards below the level of your amount. Every first of a month the final amount will be charged by Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the moment I only manage to create one video each month, so you will be charged once every first of a month! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut you can also set a monthly cap for your contributions, so you\u2019ll never go over the amount you set regardless of how many videos I might upload in future! (My goal is 4, but that\u0027s utopian for now) You will never be charged for news, vlogs!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI would be so grateful to have you on board and join me on this journey!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBig thanks! \\m/\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Agordas\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPS:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eYou want seperate Backing Tracks, Jam Tracks or Guitar Tabs of my previous cover songs?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eNo problem!

That\u0027s OK, I\u0027m still happy you wanna help me out to keep this project alive!
