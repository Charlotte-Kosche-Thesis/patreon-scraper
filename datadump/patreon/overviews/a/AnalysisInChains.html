We wanted to understand how much of what was going on was a disruptive technology and how much was a speculative hype bubble, so we read all the news, researched different tokens, joined cryptocurrency communities, and even made our own token for the podcast: the Nutshell!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we started we have posted two episodes per week, talking about news, developments, and our own adventures in the Cryptoverse on Monday, and then on Wednesday posting either an interview with someone significant in the crypto world, or an in-depth look at a specific coin project and how it works.\u00a0 We started a community on slack where our members discuss episodes and developments in the crypto world, and we launched monthly meetups to form a community in-person for people wanting to learn more. We did not start out as experts by any stretch of the imagination, but as we learn and create each episode we will become blockchain experts and as you follow along with us, so will you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere\u0027s a big need in the cryptocurrency world for understanding\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0because it\u0027s a new frontier industry. People don\u0027t want to miss out on this blockchain revolution, but it\u0027s complex to understand and there\u0027s a lot of misinformation out there. Sifting through it all takes a fair bit of time, as does recording, editing, and promoting it.\u00a0 We will continue to provide you with our best efforts to make sense of the Cryptoverse, and if you find it useful, we ask that you share the load with us by becoming a patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you would like to be part what we are doing at Analysis in Chains, consider becoming a patron. \u003c/strong\u003eAll of our patrons are eligible to receive Nutshells, the official crypto token of the Analysis in Chains podcast!\u00a0 You\u0027ll need a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.waveswallet.io\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWaves wallet\u003c/a\u003e to receive them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks everyone and Keep on Hashing!"
