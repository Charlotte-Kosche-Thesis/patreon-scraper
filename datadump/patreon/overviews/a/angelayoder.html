    "summary": "My background in theater has given me so much joy with multiple, creative outlets to express myself. I\u0027ve built props and sets, painted scenery, and sewn costumes. My absolute favorite is working collaboratively with a team of creative people. In my art life I make all kinds of things using all kinds of mediums; watercolor, oil, cut and paste paper, fabric, oilcloth, metal, and mural painting. I have worked on a large scale and then zoom down in to make the tiniest pumpkins and small dioramas. Even though I change the size of my work regularly, one constant theme in my work has always been \"Home\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy should you pledge to me? That\u0027s a great question! Maybe because you relate to the chapter I am currently in in my life, turning 50 in 2016. Yikes! And I still haven\u0027t made Art my full-time job yet. Maybe you understand my struggle of needing to make stable money working for someone else vs. having time and energy to my creative life. Maybe you, too, had well-meaning voices tell you, \"You can\u0027t make a living with art\", and believed them. Maybe you got a degree different than what you dreamed of having because of the voices (I have a biology degree). Maybe you are looking to contribute a few dollars a month somewhere. Maybe my work inspires you and you just can\u0027t help yourself! :) One of the most beautiful things I learned writing grants is that there is so much power in many people giving smaller gifts that can quickly add up to a very large amount. What ever you feel you can afford and contribute, please know it will make a difference for me and my family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI need this support only temporarily. Once my website and online store are set up how I want, the work will begin to sell and generate sustainable, constant income. I\u0027ll make connections in the art world and the inertia of that will continue. Then I can change my Patreon goals to more creative research projects that I hope you will continue to be interested in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur world is in a huge paradigm shift where more and more creative people are being awesome and being themselves. I let fear run me for far too long and I\u0027m not settling for that anymore! I need a little help to be brave enough to step out into that void. Your financial support would be a virtual helping hand; one I can hold as I leap into my dream. Do you see yourself being willing to do that for me?\u00a0I send much love and gratitude to you as you consider joining my inner circle. I don\u0027t know what it will look like yet, but it is going to be a great adventure! Thank you for taking time to checking out my page\u003cbr\u003e"
