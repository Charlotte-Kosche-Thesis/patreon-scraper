The support has been fantastic, which is what keeps the channel going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the way, I\u0027m Alex, but you\u0027ll all know me as AV. If you\u0027ve been watching for a while you may know that I\u0027m always looking to kick this channel up a notch in its quality and its content diversity. Due to the issues I\u0027ve been having with demonetization on YouTube (mainly random demonetization of content as inoffensive as a case review), trying to support the channel purely from the YouTube ad revenue is nowhere near possible, and currently it\u0027s stunting its growth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately since the demonetization issues have occurred, the channel is getting around 10% of the viewership it was previously getting on a regular basis. So, as new as this channel is, I\u0027m starting this Patreon page, so anyone who likes the content being made, and wants to see more of it, and would like to play a staple part in the journey of this channel can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease check out the video to get a more personal take on this channel and its direction. It\u0027s quite a large explanation, so if reading is more your speed, then you can read all about it below...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW PATREON WORKS\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is simply a utility that allows anyone to financially contribute towards a project such as this one. The way this Patreon campaign is setup is so you can contribute as little or as mauch as you want per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would recommend anyone who is interested in becoming a Patron of AV Techy to start off at a small amount, such as $1 or $2 per month. This way it shouldn\u0027t effect your monthly outgoing expenses too much, and if you feel you want to contribute more at a later date, then that would be fantastic!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREWARDS...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn terms of rewards, there\u0027s nothing that I have planned specifically for Patreon supporters, I\u0027m barely getting the YouTube videos out on a weekly basis, so splitting myself between two different platforms would be counter intuitive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if I get to certain point where I can, I will certainly want to give back to my supporters in the future with events such as giveaways, but please don\u0027t sign up waiting for a chance to win a prize as I can\u0027t guarantee anything at this stage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving said that, I think it might be a nice idea to put early video images and previews on the Patreon feed, just as a little something to give back to my Patrons as a regular thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT WILL THE MONEY BE USED FOR?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment, with the current financial backing of my 9-5 job, this channel is operating at a gradual loss. But that\u0027s not really an issue since I\u0027m not financially dependent on this channel, after all that\u0027s why I have a job. So, this Patreon campaign is not to financially support me, but it\u0027s goal is to hopefully reduce the losses of the channel, so more money can go into interesting components to review.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the support of Patrons, I\u0027ll be able to purchase more current and new products, or components just as they release. Of course we\u0027ll be some way off purchasing Graphics Cards for reviews (that\u0027s not a target by the way), but we\u0027ll be looking into more interesting cases, perhaps looking into an mITX motherboard for mITX case reviews, and perhaps we\u0027ll move into the realms of other PC components further down the line\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE BOTTOM LINE\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want people to support the channel, simply because they want to support the channel. I will be extremely grateful to anyone looking at the content I\u0027m making and wants to see more of it, but with more current components such as coverage of the latest releases, as well as some more interesting components along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope I have given you all the information you want in order work out if becoming a Patron of AV Techy is right for you. I will do my best to make the best content I can regardless, but any help along the way will be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for considering to support this channel, and please check out the video to get a more personal take on this!\u003c/div\u003e"
