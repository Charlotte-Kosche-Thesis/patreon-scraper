    "summary": "Hey everyone! My name is Arran Swiftide (Ok, it\u0027s not. But lets look over that for a second, ok? Fine.) and I am an aspiring wanna-be author and part time shark. I am mostly active on FurAffinity (because DA is a little bitch about copyright stuff and sexual matters and there aren\u0027t really any platforms to really upload texts without any direct connection to Fandoms or stuff) but that doesn\u0027t mean I only do furry stuff. I really like my little hairless humies (And Orcs, Elves, Dragons...you get the gist)! And that\u0027s where you can find me:\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/user/lifeguardarran/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFurAffinity-Link!\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e(If you want to, you can also message me over patreon to commission stuff, or send me a carrier pigeon, added benefit of a nice little meal for me, I\u0027m not picky.)\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I write? Just about every thing. I write smut and downright porn, fetish fuel, fandom fuel, funny stuff, and everything in between. My main motivation in writing lies in getting the ideas of people on paper (digital paper, that is) and trying to forge the worlds and stories that exist only in their minds, so they can show them to the world.\u003cbr\u003eOf course, sharks need to eat, because paper and ink aren\u0027t tasty and digital paper and ink even less so. That\u0027s why I take commissions! And that\u0027s why I have this little patreon, where, for a little bit of money, you can get nice rewards like:\u003cbr\u003e-Getting a discount for EVERY commission you do as long as you patronize me (pls just patron me, don\u0027t patronize me)\u003cbr\u003e-And for all of you LOTR fans who like padding and eeeeeextra long novels you can pay me to have that pesky little 5000 word soft limit upped to 8k, so you don\u0027t have to think too hard about your great scenarios, but let me do the work for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you in advance and I hope you all have a very nice day!\u003cbr\u003e"
