It\u0027s a website that allows your favorite artists to get paid doing what they love with your help. Pretty magical if you ask me. \u003cbr\u003eAnd today I\u0027m here to ask for your support. Patreon will give me the boost I need, help me fill in some gaps of time I never know what to do with, but most of all, get the wheels turning for my dream to become a manga artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be working on big protects, like calendars and posters and eventually a mini manga.

In that sense, I pretty much work two jobs all while supporting the people I love and looking after my health. I started drawing really young, got seriously into it when I was about 9 years old and made the decision that I wanted to be a mangaka when I was 14. I\u0027m a manga artist in training and my goal is to move to Japan and pursue my career there. Right now Patreon is the playfield to show off my characters and stories, and hopefully, my manga.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Progression gif. )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig08.deviantart.net/0430/f/2016/336/3/e/subject_i___january_by_asorra_tatsumi-daqd3pv.gif\" style=\"width: 477px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e:Why Patreon:\u003c/h1\u003eWhy? Because this is what I want to do. This is all I\u0027ve ever dreamed of doing. Art isn\u0027t just a hobby. It\u0027s not something to just pass the time with. And I\u0027m not giving it up just to get a better paying job, like so many have told me before. This is my life, it\u0027s my way to cope, to feel alive. And I want my art to be able to support me and prove the people who thought this wasn\u0027t possible wrong. This is how I define myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I want to ask you to consider joining me along the way. There will be fun times and some rough times.
