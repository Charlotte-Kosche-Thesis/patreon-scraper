From 2007 to 2011 I produced\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.metamorcity.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Metamor City Podcast\u003c/a\u003e, a Parsec Award-winning audio fiction series that captured the imaginations of tens of thousands of listeners across six continents. People raved about Metamor City for its vividly-imagined world of high magic and high technology, a wide cast of compelling characters, and first-rate production values.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn May 2015 I started a new podcast project,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://chrislester.org/the-raven-and-the-writing-desk/\"\u003eThe Raven and the Writing Desk\u003c/a\u003e. In this weekly show I share the fiction that I\u0027ve been working on, either a short story or a piece of a longer work. I also keep you up-to-date on my creative progress, sharing Weekly Writing Reports and responding listener feedback. The show has been running uninterrupted for more than two and a half years now, and \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0can play a part in keeping it going! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron of my campaign, you\u0027ll be helping me stay focused on my art. When writing and podcasting helps me pay the bills, it means I can spend more time on writing and podcasting, instead of picking up overtime at work or taking a second job. Your support also makes it possible for me to make appearances at conventions, where I can meet with fans and introduce new people to my work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut that\u0027s not all! In addition to helping me keep the podcast coming, as a patron you can get special bonus features: copies of my e-books, behind-the-scenes author commentaries, previews of any new cover art and interior illustrations that I commission, even limited-edition autographed copies of the books you helped me create. As you help me bring my stories to market, you\u0027ll get access to that finished content before anyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for joining me on this journey. I\u0027ve got worlds full of stories left to tell -- and with your help, I\u0027ll get to keep telling them!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hi there! I\u0027m Chris Lester, and I tell stories. I\u0027ve been doing it for as long as I can remember; whether the audience was a playmate, a classroom, a parent, or a room full of strangers, I\u0027ve always had a soft spot for a tale well told.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up on stories of places that never were, of science fiction and fantasy, heroes and gods. I was captivated by ideas of transformation and transcendence, of people who passed out of the world of the ordinary and into a world where the impossible could happen. While it was the spectacle and wonder of these stories that gripped me first, as I grew older I came to appreciate them for another reason: by taking us out of our mundane context, these authors could tackle ideas and quandaries that would otherwise be too close for the reader\u0027s comfort. Authors like Tolkien and Heinlein and Card may have written stories filled with impossible things, but the stories were ABOUT ideas and problems at the heart of human experience. They were stories about people -- and whether those people were hobbits or Martians or nine-year-old military masterminds, there was Truth to be found in these stories that could be of value to us today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s my hope that my own stories inspire you to think about these deeper issues, as well -- and give you a rollicking good time in the process.",
