I was\nentranced.\u003cbr\u003e\nI have also long had a\ncreative bent. It has largely gone unexplored owing to many factors:\nwork, family, other interests. Now I find I have more time on my\nhands I wish to open up this facet of my life more.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat better way to do\nso than to combine two of my great loves into one endeavour?\u003cbr\u003e\nI am writing novels set\nin 12th century Europe; chiefly Flanders, Provence and\nGenoa.\u003cbr\u003e\nYour pledges will\nassist me in taking you into a world which has been lost to time; a\nworld, however, which is not all that different to our own once you\nscratch the surface. You will meet musicians and clerics (both good\nand bad). You will come face to face with prejudice but you will also\nsee the best in people. You will meet people struggling for their\nrights against those who would keep them downtrodden.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn short, you will\nexperience a rich and complex world.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf I can bring that\nworld to life and, at the same time, entertain you then I will have\nachieved my purpose. Please help me in doing so."
