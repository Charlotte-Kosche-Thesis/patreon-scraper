    "summary": "Hello! Thanks for visiting my Patreon page. I\u0027m A.M. Halling, but you can call me Al. (I know, I know, but I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ve never met Paul Simon.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll Good Clean Fun\u003c/em\u003e is my attempt at writing a novel - sort of like \u003cem\u003eFifty Shades of Grey\u003c/em\u003e but for wet clothing fans. (Yes, getting turned on by wearing wet clothes - or seeing others in wet clothes - is a thing. It\u0027s called \"wetlook\".\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetlook\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLook it up if you don\u0027t believe me.\u003c/a\u003e) The story revolves around a guy called Tom, who is turned on by wetlook, and his girlfriend Emma, who doesn\u0027t really get it but is happy to indulge him. For now, anyway. But is that enough to keep Tom happy? If another girl was to come along who really got the whole wetlook thing and would willingly get wet in her clothes for her own enjoyment as well as Tom\u0027s, would that turn his head? Who knows? Let\u0027s find out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I thought I could write the novel, publish it and then wait for it to take the world by storm and make me as rich as E.L. James, but then I thought it would be more fun to do it a different way. The Patreon way. Which means that if you sign up, each time a new chapter gets published you pay $1 for the right to read it. A bit like buying a book, but in installments. (At the moment I\u0027ve no idea how often the chapters will be published, which is why I\u0027ve decided to charge per chapter rather than a monthly fee. That way you only pay when there\u0027s something new for you to read. Right now it seems highly unlikely that there\u0027ll be more than one chapter per month, but we\u0027ll see how it goes and adjust the pricing accordingly if needs be.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it doesn\u0027t have to stop there. If you sign up for the \"Behind The Scenes\" reward level, you pay $5 to read each chapter as it\u0027s published, but you get free access to other things, like behind the scenes blog posts, updates on where the story\u0027s going, an exclusive downloadable PDF or ebook of the story (updated with each chapter as it gets published) and even the chance to influence the story through exclusive opinion polls. How cool is that? That\u0027s more than E.L. James ever did for you. ;-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSounds pretty good so far, right? But if you go for the top reward level, you pay $10 for each chapter but as well as all the $5 rewards, you get extra exclusive posts between chapters, exploring some of the characters\u0027 fantasies. Naturally these posts might get a bit more explicit than the regular chapters, but they\u0027ll always be based around wetlook. Just a bit raunchier! And because you\u0027re paying $10 for each regular chapter, you get the extra content at no extra cost!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I get enough subscribers to start bringing in some serious money, I have lots of other plans on ways to bring the story to life, either with illustrations, photos or even video clips... but that\u0027s all in the future. Let\u0027s get on with the story first!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first chapter is available for free as a taster. I hope you enjoy it enough to sign up for more. If you want any more information,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:allgoodcleanfun@outlook.com\"\u003edrop me an email\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027ll be happy to help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAl\u003cbr\u003e"
