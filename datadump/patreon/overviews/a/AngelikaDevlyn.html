What exactly does this mean? I write both fantasy and contemporary erotic fiction, all of which have a tendency to lean towards dominance and submission in some way or other. Kinky characters are often in either in Daddy/daughter or Master/slave relationships, however, lately I have also been toying with the idea of a kinky psychological thriller. Talking of toys -- living dolls, statues and other kinkiness are also ones to look out for. In fact, with your guidance and support I may even try other new kinks. The more help I get, the more time I\u0027ll have to listen to your needs and requests. Of course you\u0027ll all have a say, but the most supportive of you will get more control. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://angelikadevlyn.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/20170614_165325.jpg\" style=\"width: 265px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, what can you expect if you support me?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll write entertaining stories and poems of varying lengths; from series to standalone novels, to short stories, poetry and flash fiction.
