    "summary": "Hi Everybody,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdrian here and I just wanted to give you a warm welcome to my page. If it\u0027s your first time here then it is NICE TO MEET YOU!!!!!. If you are returning then I am happy you came back. As you may know or just finding out, I am an Independent Musician /Game \u0026amp; Media Composer. The not so fancy way of saying it is that I create works of musical arts at home in my studio (bedroom) :D.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to find the best way to get my music out there obviously because I don\u0027t create it for self listening in my bedroom but I wanted to give people a chance to help me out with creating these pieces so I created this Patreon. This is for those who\u0027d like to make a contribution to my time consuming and costly hobby of sort and in return getting something a little more personal than just one of my songs. You get the moral delight that you\u0027ve helped a starving artist eat for another day (I do have a day job plz don\u0027t think Im bummy lol) You\u0027d also help me afford sounds, samples, and hardware updates for the ever demanding growth of a studio. Doesn\u0027t that sound like (insert your religious figure here I don\u0027t want to assume) himself brought you here? :) If you don\u0027t want to make contributions but still want to listen it\u0027s no big deal Im just happy to piqued your interest. \u00a0I have currently a couple ways you can check me out. For listening pleasures \u003ca href=\"http://www.soundcloud.com/enigmos\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.soundcloud.com/enigmos\u003c/a\u003e for electronic and \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-64542266\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/user-64542266\u003c/a\u003e for my compositional pieces.\u00a0It will have everything unless I state exclusitivity. For those who want to buy a download,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://enigmos.bandcamp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eenigmos.bandcamp.com\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://ifnoti.bandcamp.com/releases\"\u003ehttps://ifnoti.bandcamp.com/releases\u003c/a\u003e is up with some of my older material for free downloads (ooooh free goodies!). Some of the songs there will \u00a0be \"pay what you want\" unless Im really feeling it and ask you for a dollar. Now you ask me \" but if everything is open for everyone already why should I subscribe here?\" Well of course you\u0027ll get special treatment and videos of how I create some of these songs. As well as the perfect randomness I am inspired to film. But most of all you\u0027ll be helping a brotha out (sadly starbucks isnt cheap).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell It\u0027s been fun getting to know you and If you so wish surround yourself in the sounds of AMHM Productions. If you so happened to subscribe to any tier level Thank You Thank You Thank You! Love, Peace, and may the universe be with you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
