    "summary": "Hola Amigos!\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out my Patreon page, thank you especially to those of you kind enough to donate money to me and help me to survive as a professional musician in 2018 when the music business has become the wild west and shit is a bit more challenging thanks to technology, streaming services, an over abundance in music releases thanks to home recording technology and a million other reasons why being a career musician is akin to being a really cool homeless person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eIf you\u0027re not already a Patron I would love to sell you on this idea, its a good one trust me! I make music videos, tutorials and more for \u003cstrong\u003eFull Psycho TV\u003c/strong\u003e my internet channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L56P_lS8w-I\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have fun around here and we try to always strive towards better health and happiness. I like to help contribute in any way possible, even if its just giving you something dumb to laugh at for a bit. But also I myself have mastered the skill of manufacturing a joyful life for myself and I of course want to share that with all of you, my favorite people of all!\u003cbr\u003eSo theres all these different amounts of money you can give, the good news (if you\u0027re cheap) is I only average one video per month due to how much work it is. So you\u0027ll be paying the per video rate as if it were a per month subscription.\u003cbr\u003eA very special thing to note is all $10 donation people will join \u003cstrong\u003eThe Demo\u0027s Club \u003c/strong\u003ewhere you get to hear demo\u0027s I\u0027ve just recorded. A\u003cstrong\u003e very special exclusive Patreon Demo\u0027s album\u003c/strong\u003e has just started being released, one song at a time for all the people of Demo\u0027s Club. You are the only people who get to hear this in the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you not convinced yet?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also\u00a0urge all my Patrons to interact with me, hit me with some comments or messages and help me to know what you like to see the best. If you want anything in particular do not hesitate to ask and I also am down to do collaborations with all ya\u0027ll so lets do cool shit!\u003cbr\u003eLove you and thank you,\u003cbr\u003eAnnie Hardy"

I wish people didn\u0027t think music grew on trees and shit, its still mad expensive to record an album, even an EP! That doesn\u0027t even factor in living and eating food and shit. Have you seen me lately? I\u0027m wasting away. Why you ask? Because Napster. Spotify. Internet. Devil. Whatever name you want to give the entity thats made music free now is what we can call it.\u003cbr\u003eSign up to be on \u003cstrong\u003eTeam Full Psycho\u003c/strong\u003e and be able to see cool shit I release before anyone else, sometimes \u003cstrong\u003eonly\u003c/strong\u003e you get to see it.\u003cbr\u003eAlso you get to peep demo\u0027s I record. Which is a tite rarity as well. I\u0027m not going to give the hard sale, I\u0027ve got the goods, drop a couple bucks down my chonies and I\u0027ll hook you up.\u003cbr\u003eDespite my neg vibes here in my about me section (I low key resent having to do this, just being honest!) and my general resistance, I am usually a pretty happy, high vibrational individual who has mastered the art of existing and creating in an almost non-stop\u003cstrong\u003e flow state\u003c/strong\u003e. I have had a life not unlike a horror film, rife with tragedy and trauma. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eYet somehow I am still the happiest person that I know.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThat is some fucked up shit ya\u0027ll. So it is my intention to\u003cstrong\u003e share with my Patrons some of the secrets to my success\u003c/strong\u003e on that front. You too can decide to be happy at any moment.. \u003cstrong\u003eJoin the team\u003c/strong\u003e and lets get it going.\u003c/h4\u003e",
