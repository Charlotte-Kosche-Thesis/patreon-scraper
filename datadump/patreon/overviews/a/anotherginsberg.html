    "summary": "Right now the main things keeping me from focusing on my writing and performing are time and finances, which are directly linked. I\u0027m starting this patreon to help with finances so I can free up more time to create new work, compile older works, and travel to cities all over and share my stories and narratives with a plethora of audiences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel that the work I\u0027m creating is both completely my own and helpful for others to hear. Without people talking about gender identity I never would have thought about my own and would not have found comfort in mine. Without hearing people deconstruct their past and work through their trauma I would not have done so with mine. At it\u0027s core I hope that my work shines a light that we are all working forward with finding ourselves and finding comfort and safety in the bodies and spaces we inhabit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting does not \"cure\" me of my problems, but is merely a space where I can chart things out and understand myself better, and therefore my problems will be identifiable and easier (on good days) to live with. Performing takes what I\u0027ve made of my work and gives it over to the audience, gives them autonomy of their own narratives by letting them have the scaffolding of my own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading this and for becoming a patron if you so choose!"
