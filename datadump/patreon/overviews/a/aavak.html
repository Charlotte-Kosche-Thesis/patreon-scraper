I\u0027m\nAavak, a Welsh gamer\u00a0with a fondness for tea, animals and story-telling,\u00a0and for the last four years I\u0027ve been creating Let\u0027s Play\nvideos and live-streams, on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/Aavak\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/aavak/\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen\nI started this grand adventure, it was a small hobby that I used to\nfill a social-gap in my life, having recently moved from Wales to\nScotland to pursue a Natural \u0026amp; Artificial Intelligence degree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBack\nthen, I could never have imagined that my channel would grow beyond a\nfew hundred viewers, much less become large enough to feasibly be a\nsource of income, and develop\u00a0into a career! But after two years, I\neventually found myself at a crossroads, where I had to choose\nbetween continuing to put effort into my YouTube channel and the\ngrowing community that had sprung up around it, and finishing my\nstudies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously,\nI chose YouTube, and have been a full time creator ever since!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://i.imgur.com/eYF3ttJ.png/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/251812196084875274/412023031540482048/Break_2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs\nexciting as the YouTube industry is, it can be very volatile.\nWhile YouTube ad revenue has seen a\ndecline over the last few years, recent events (\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(191, 191, 191);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003esuch as the amusingly\nnamed \u0027Adpocalypse\u0027 of 2017\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e) have really highlighted just how fragile this\ndeveloping ecosystem can be. And how quickly the fortunes of creators\ncan change, no matter how much effort they put into their work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile\nthere are never any guarantees, Patreon would offer me a more\npredictable monthly income; a baseline that would insulate me from\nthe more volatile aspects of the industry. This would allow me\u00a0to take more\nrisks on niche content and experiment with different styles of\nvideos, as well as branching out into new genres. Not to mention\nbeing able to dedicate more time to events, such as community\ngame-nights and social hang outs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally,\nas my channel has grown I am ever aware that it is as much a product\nof good fortune as it is the effort I put into my work. Your support would allow me to pay that fortune forward by investing in\nother creators and professionals, such as video editors and artists\n(\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003elike the wonderful\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.kayandp.com\"\u003e@kayandp\u003c/a\u003e who I commissioned to create all of the\nart on this page!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e) which would free me from some of the behind the\nscenes work involved in making videos, allowing me to focus on creating even\nmore content for you to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://i.imgur.com/r4gNtNp.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://i.imgur.com/r4gNtNp.png/\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/251812196084875274/412023044891213824/Break_3.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally,\nI want to take a moment to say thank you for checking out this page, and if you\u0027ve read this far... well done! I could\nnever have imagined four years ago that one day I would be working\nfor myself, making a living doing something I love.
