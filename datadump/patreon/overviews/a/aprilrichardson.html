    "summary": "Hi! My name is April Richardson, and I am a stand-up comedian. I\u0027ve been doing stand-up for ten years now, and have been lucky enough to have other entertainment jobs to supplement my income during that time: writing on a television show, co-hosting a television show, appearing as a panelist or talking head on television shows... you get it. I also created the popular Go Bayside podcast back in 2013 -- I critically deconstructed every episode of Saved by the Bell along with a hilarious guest, and they continue to be available to you on iTunes until the end of time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat podcast is part of the reason I am on Patreon now: I fully admit that I have zero business acumen. Go Bayside became far more popular than I could have ever dreamed possible, and I didn\u0027t even realize I could have sold ads or merch or anything like that. I was never on a podcast network and I continue to pay for the hosting myself. This isn\u0027t some kind of sob story -- I\u0027m so glad I made that \u0027cast! This sounds earnest as shit, but: Money is the last reason I make things. I make things because it\u0027s fun to do so. However, I\u0027m not in Fugazi. I can\u0027t continue to do things for free or for $5, because I do have bills to pay, you know? So, that is why I am feeling very weird right now typing this Patreon intro, which is basically saying thus: If you like the stuff I make, would you like to pay a little bit for it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current podcast is called Sordid Details, and I record it with my best friend of the past 24+ years, Millie De Chirico. We record it in my apartment (not in a studio), with equipment I purchased myself, and I then edit it myself and upload it to my own hosting site. If you enjoy listening to it, perhaps you\u0027d like to kick in a monthly donation? We are currently trying to think of fun rewards for those of you who choose to do so. Keep checking back!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I absolutely understand if you\u0027d rather not, as money is tight for everyone right now. If you\u0027d like to support me by coming out to see me live, my tour dates are always updated on my site, \u003ca href=\"http://aprilrichardson.com\"\u003ehttp://aprilrichardson.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading!"
