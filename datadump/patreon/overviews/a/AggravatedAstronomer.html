It has been suggested that I\u0027m not terrible at this, and people would like to see more, and so here I am!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/AggravatedAstronomer\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo first things first, thank you to everyone who decided to encourage me to make more stuff :) This is an experiment for me and I still find the idea of people paying money for the stuff I make slightly embarrassing. For the past 15 years or so I have made gaming videos\u2014mostly atmospheric montages, fan trailers and playthroughs\u2014as a hobby in my free time. I am particularly fond of making videos to powerful film scores.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFree time is more limited these days, but Patreon will let me dedicate more time to it and reach a happy equilibrium. I am a chaotic person and my content creation comes in bursts, so with that in mind I will be following the \u0027per creation\u0027 model. Happy gaming!\u003cbr\u003e"
