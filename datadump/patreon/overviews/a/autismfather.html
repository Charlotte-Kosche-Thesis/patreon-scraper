Why did I start this server? In 2012/2013, I saw parent after parent after parent posting on social media \u003cem\u003e\"Do you have a child with autism that loves Minecraft? Would they be willing to play with my child?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese parents were all reaching out because they were tired of seeing their children being bullied on the servers that they tried. Their children were breaking their keyboards, crying and feeling terrible. They felt powerless to help. So, \u003cstrong\u003eAutcraft\u003c/strong\u003e was my way of helping.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then\u003ca href=\"http://www.autcraft.com/media\"\u003e Autcraft has been in the news\u003c/a\u003e, television, radio, magazines and more,\u00a0all around the world and now has a whitelist that is over 9,000 names from over 150 different countries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2016, a researcher visited \u003cstrong\u003eAutcraft\u003c/strong\u003e to learn about what we do, how we help and what the players do to make the community their own. Her\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://kateringland.com/would-you-be-mine-appropriating-minecraft-as-an-assistive-technology-for-youth-with-autism/\"\u003eresearch paper\u003c/a\u003e was awarded the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sigaccess.org/2016/11/2016-best-paper/\"\u003e2016 Best Paper award at SIGACCESS\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have made it my mission to help as many children with autism as I can which means ensuring that \u003cstrong\u003eAutcraft\u003c/strong\u003e remains a free server for those who need it. It is my belief that those who need a safe place like \u003cstrong\u003eAutcraft\u003c/strong\u003e most are also the ones least likely to be able to afford a membership fee.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I turn to you and ask that you help me help so many autistic children around the world by making a pledge in any amount that you are able.

I did have a job at first as well as run \u003cstrong\u003eAutcraft\u003c/strong\u003e but the whitelist grew so fast and the demands that were placed upon me were too much to juggle both the server and a job at the same time. So \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is literally my income right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e How does Autcraft keep the players safe?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e First is the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.autcraft.com/whitelist\"\u003ewhitelist\u003c/a\u003e. Each and every application is thoroughly researched to ensure that the username doesn\u0027t have a history of past bad behaviour. It takes a long time to go through them this way but it ensures that bad people don\u0027t get on to the server. If a bad person does make it on despite this, there are always people available or watching the server to prevent any bad behaviours the moment anyone tries something. We have Admins, SrHelpers and JrHelpers, all ranks given to players who show respect, responsibility and and helpfulness towards everyone. On top of this we have several plugins, including some custom made ones, that do their best to prevent griefing, swearing and other issues that could come up. Anything the plugins can\u0027t catch, there will be someone watching.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e How many players are there?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e There is just over 9,000 names on the whitelist and on average we get around 1,000 unique players signing in each month as some come and go. Some players even return several years later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e Are all of the players autistic? Do you have to be autistic to join?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e The server is specifically for autistics but we highly encourage family to join as well. We have many player\u0027s siblings, parents and even grandparents join. Also, if a player has a special friend that they like to play with then that friend is welcome to join as well. We\u0027d never want to separate a child from their friend.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e Which version of Minecraft is this for?
