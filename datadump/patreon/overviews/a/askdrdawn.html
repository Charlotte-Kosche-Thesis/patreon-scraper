    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"http://askdrdawn.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAsk Doctor Dawn\u003c/a\u003e is a wide-ranging podcast about your health and the science of medicine. Most are recorded radio show broadcasts where I talk about science news and answer emails and live callers\u0027 questions about their health issues.\u00a0 A typical program might begin \nby a covering cutting edge science topic like how Zika virus causes \nbrain damage, then switch to a conversation with a caller with a \nquestion about a medical problem, then veer to a discussion of how health\n care policy influences public health and finish with a discussion of an\n email question about reducing the consequences of pesticide exposure. I\n discovered early on that I had a knack for making seemingly complex \nbiological systems interactions easy to grasp through the use of vivid \nvisual metaphors and I love hearing from my audience that I\u0027ve helped \nthem out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a practicing Board-Certified Family Practice doctor with a strong passion for education and a philosophy that supports each patient\u0027s right to self-determination, complete information and access to ALL the available options, including \"alternative medicine\" options such as acupuncture and herbs.\u00a0 I believe that scientific literacy and a basic understanding of statistics are necessary for a person to make a truly informed medical decision.\u00a0 I know that most people are plenty smart enough to understand the concepts of science but are hampered by the complex terminology that hides the meaning and a lack of information about their actual options. I also saw that people were systematically being shortchanged in time, information and most especially complete disclosure of their options.\u00a0 Most people are pressured to just \"go along\" with the therapy de jour for their health issue. People need permission talk back and insist on answers to their questions about risks and outcomes. These factors drove me to step outside the box and begin communicating these ideas via a radio program which eventually morphed into a national NPR podcast in 2004.\u00a0 We maintain an extensive archive of previous programs at askdrdawn.com, which you are invited to explore. In 2016, our local NPR radio station, the base for our podcast production, closed down. We are continuing the podcast using our own resources and covering the costs of production ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
