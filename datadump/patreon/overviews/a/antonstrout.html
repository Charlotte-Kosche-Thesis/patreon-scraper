We work hard to bring you the best science fiction and fantasy one damned episode at a time, and we created this Patreon so that you, our listeners, can be involved in its making!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAuthor-host\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://antonstrout.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnton Strout\u003c/a\u003e got the idea for O\u0026amp;FP after spending a lot of time casually chatting with fellow authors and creative types from around the nerdiverse in various bars and coffee shops at conventions. He thought, why not bring these types of conversations to fans at home? Thus the show was born, and over the course of our 100+ episodes, Anton has welcomed New York Times bestselling authors and fan favorites to chat about their books, the art and craft of writing, and the ins and outs of author life. There are no artificial, stilted interviews here. Just a couple authors chatting about the pursuit of their nerdy little passions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ve had guests like Patrick Rothfuss, Charlaine Harris, Laurell K. Hamilton, Jim Butcher, Kevin J. Anderson, Jonathan Maberry, Marjorie Liu, and many, many more. We\u2019ve recorded shows at Gen Con, Book Expo of America, New York Comic Con, and San Diego Comic Con. And we\u2019ve shared hours of writing advice from the best in the business. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRunning a podcast involves an investment of equipment, bandwidth, time, and work. As much fun as the show is, it takes hours per week to produce. And this is where you guys come in!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave you ever wanted to be part of something awesome? This is your chance. Look at our backer levels. You can be a part of the show, give us input about who you\u2019d like to be our guests, hear announcements before anyone else, and be able to submit your questions for our guests. If all our listeners contributed the price of a mere gumball per episode, we would be in awesome shape! Increase that backing to the price of a single crappy cup of chain-store coffee per month, and the possibilities are endless. And we\u2019re pretty sure we\u2019re worth more than a crappy cup of coffee. So keep listening and spread the word! Help us keep the Once and Future-y goodness coming!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more info about the show and hear some of our past episodes, please go to \u003ca href=\"http://www.theonceandfuturepodcast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.theonceandfuturepodcast.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
