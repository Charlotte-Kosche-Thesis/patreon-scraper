(\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for being here\u003c/strong\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\nSpecifically you love art made out of DIRT.\u003cbr\u003e\nPottery, Ceramics, HIGH FIRED MUD! (over \u003cem\u003e2,000\u003c/em\u003e degrees!)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI love working with clay, and I turn that love into all sorts of \u003cstrong\u003eART\u003c/strong\u003e that you can drink out of, eat out of, let your plant babies live in, let your flowers bathe in and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo here I am, in the age old tradition of artists and patrons, asking YOU (Patron) to help ME (artist) keep making the good stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd learning to make the good stuff better.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eA little backstory\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Anais Lux. I am a community-taught studio potter living, working and teaching in Knoxville, TN. I work out of a big pottery studio where dozens of artists make pots, trade ideas, \u0026amp; drink coffee. I am a teacher there! I teach wheel throwing to beginner and intermediate students. I do not have any college training in pottery, and learned most of what I know from community classes, working as a studio assistant, watching videos and experimenting. Also, asking my studio friends a million questions (thank you for your help and patience guys).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe plan is to bring you all the goods in my pottery knapsack: original artwork videos \u0026amp; photos, MONTHLY raffles, behind the scenes pottery studio biz, art around town \u0026amp; more.\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m going to tell you about my successes, my failures, my hopes and dreams. \u003cbr\u003eIT\u2019S GONNA GET REAL.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmanda Palmer is the great genius of community-sponsored art folks, so to quote her Patreon,\u003cbr\u003e\u201ci\u2019ve been trying to find a succinct way of explaining what it is. this patreon is for people who want to help sustain my ability and freedom to MAKE WHAT I WANT, WHEN I WANT \u2013 liberated from commercial interests \u2013 by paying me a set amount of money every time i create something.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon liberates the artist from having to make what sells. Instead, the artist (me) can experiment, go big, learn learn learn and get interesting.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHOW IT WORKS:\u003cbr\u003e\n1. You give Patreon your credit card # or PayPal\u003cbr\u003e\n2. You pick a \u201ctier\u201d of support ($2, $5, $10, etc.)\u003cbr\u003e\n3. Each tier entitles you to certain content and rewards for supporting\u003cbr\u003e\n4. At the end of each month you are charged the stable amount that you chose ($1, $2, $5, $8)\u003cbr\u003e\n5. YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED IN SUPPORTING THE ARTS!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo join me and support my Patreon, my art, if you are interested, if you want to learn, experiment, and if you love \u003cstrong\u003eCLAY ALL DAY\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
