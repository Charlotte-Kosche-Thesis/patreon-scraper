I have been fortunate that my family loves to travel and I have been able to go to some interesting places so far. I would like to be able contribute more and have a say in where I get to visit and what I do when I get there. Perfect example of this is my upcoming trip to Iceland. There is no way I would have been able to convince my parents to take me to Iceland and pay for everything like flight and accommodations, it\u2019s just too expensive and they don\u2019t have the same interest in Iceland as I do. The way I was able to convince them was by making enough money to cover most of the flight costs. By doing this they were willing to cover all of the other costs even though they cost much more than the flight. I was able to make the money to do that with the advertising job I did for Minto Homes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.minto.com/ottawa/Orleans-new-homes/Avalon/Explore-your-neighbourhood~2147.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClick this link to see one of my Minto Homes videos\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end I\u0027m not just looking for financial support \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(99, 36, 35);\"\u003eI would like to surround myself with the people who believe in me and truly want to help grow my channel\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, my brand, and create a community.

This Software has improved the production quality of my videos significantly since I started using it. The problem with this software is that it is a per year licence and can be very expensive. Fortunately I was approached by a guy from Adobe named Andrew, who saw one of my videos and gave me his employee price of $181.75. Without Andrews help I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford this amazing software. I am about two months away from having to pay for another year licence, and would love to have your help.\u003cbr\u003e",

With this goal I would like to be able to replace my scratched lens with a new one. I can still film with the scratched lens but in some lighting conditions there is a green lens flair created by the scratch. I plan on giving away my scratched lens to someone through my channel who could get some use out of it as is still usable, just I find that it bothers me when I\u2019m trying to get the perfect shot.\u003cbr\u003ehttps://youtu.be/bPPL_2CR9gY\u003cbr\u003e",

I have been filming more and more on my Iphone in 4K and would like to be able to standardise all of the cameras I use to this resolution. 4K provides a much nicer image and will give me more ability to do more interesting post production effects in future videos. Also the Canon 5D Mark IV is a full frame camera and will let me get more out of the lenses I already have. It would be amazing to be able to achieve this goal before going to Iceland because I would love to shoot my Iceland trip in full 4K.\u003cbr\u003e",
