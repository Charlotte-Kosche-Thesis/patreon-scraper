As an artist, it\u0027s a struggle to spend many hours of your day creating with minimal income. With your generosity I can focus more of my time to my craft without feeling so much stress. I have been drawing most of my life but found a renewed passion in comics my freshman year of college. I only made it a year and a half through college due to debilitating anxiety. Sounds lame but it was a real physical and emotional battle for me. I have some of the greatest fans out there and to you all, thank you so much! If you want to become more involved with my work, please feel free to select a package that sounds appropriate for you! Thanks so much again!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest,\u003cbr\u003eAustin"
