this is sort of an audio blog type of thing where I give opinions on news items that weren\u0027t big enough to make whole videos out of, go over what kind of stuff I\u0027ve been playing, and whatever else I feel like blabbing about.\u00a0 People in the ten dollar tier will gain early access to non-topical videos whenever possible, and lastly twenty big ones will get your name and/or website on the Wall of Patrons, which is displayed at the end of a video in my monthly Patreon shoutout.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most important thing to remember though is that if you\u0027re thinking of donating to the channel, your primary motivation needs to be \u003cem\u003esupporting the channel\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0 I\u0027ll admit, I don\u0027t offer as much as a lot of other Youtubers, and it bums me out.\u00a0 But believe me when I say that it\u0027s because I have such limited time to make videos and I\u0027m already spreading myself so thin that I can\u0027t afford to give a lot of time to rewards.\u00a0 I do blogs and ArloCasts when I can, but they\u0027re somewhat irregular.\u00a0 Youtube\u0027s insistence upon once-a-week uploading means there aren\u0027t often videos I can share early without falling behind.\u00a0 And while I wish I could verbally shout out each top patron, I\u0027ve got to resort to text.\u00a0 I wish things were different, and maybe when I can go full time I\u0027ll be able to do more, but right now I\u0027ve got to prioritize the content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eAll Because of You\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m being dead serious when I say that Patreon is the only reason I\u0027m still doing this.\u00a0 If all this time I\u0027d been relying purely on ad revenue from Youtube I don\u0027t think I would have been able to justify spending as much time on the channel as I have, and less content would have meant fewer viewers, which would have meant less growth and less ad revenue, and ultimately I can\u0027t be certain that I would still be doing much of anything with it.\u00a0 Support from colossally amazing people like you is what keeps ArloStuff going, and hopefully it\u0027s what\u0027s going to turn it into something so much more.\u00a0 So if you find it in yourself to pledge even as little as one dollar a month, you\u0027ve got my eternal gratitude.\u00a0 I seriously can\u0027t thank you enough, or properly communicate how much it means to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut enough of all that mushy stuff!\u00a0 Let\u0027s have some fun!\u003cbr\u003e"
