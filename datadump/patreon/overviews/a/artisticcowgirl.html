    "summary": "First off I want to thank everyone who has been with me through this journey of my life. To all of you who have been there from the beginning. From family and friends to total stranger who have become family and friends. Thank you once again. And thank you to all who have come to my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Let me introduce myself and let you know a little more about me. First of my name is Mone\u0027ica, but most everyone that knows me calls me Moe. So now you all know me, just call me Moe. \u003cbr\u003eI live in a very small town in Oklahoma, population around 450. Sp when I say small, I mean small.\u003cbr\u003eAbout two years ago I started watching on youtube a lady named Cinnamon Cooney (The Art Sherpa). If you haven\u0027t checked her out, you are for sure missing something special. Well Cinnamon does painting classes on youtube. And I had watched several of her videos and a thought came to me that I wanted to do this, I wanted to paint. So I told my husband Uel about it and so he helped me get some supplies I needed, and from the very first painting I did, I fell in love with creating art. So now I feel I have grown and I am starting to expand my art journey by hosting paint parties. \u003cbr\u003eAlong with painting I have also started creating bracelets. I make all kinds of different bracelets. From stretched bracelets, wrap bracelets and I am even expanding more with loomed bracelets and more.\u00a0 I have even started my own bracelet group on facebook and it is growing daily.\u003cbr\u003eI do all of this along with making digital scrap kits, that I love doing also.\u00a0 However, creating all this and keeping up with it all can sometimes put a strain on my budget. But I can not explain in words how much doing it means to me. But expanding and growing is hard sometimes when the funds just isn\u0027t there. And I will continue to grow and expand, with your help!\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read my story, and thank you for just coming to my page.\u003cbr\u003eIf you feel you can help, I would so appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003eThank you again.\u003cbr\u003eMoneica (The Artistic Cowgirl)\u003cbr\u003e"
