    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eChase the perfection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am AeridicCore, community modeler and 3D character designer to the SFM-Ponies. I create 3D My Little Pony assets for Source Filmmaker for everyone to use. Some while ago, I decided to start a Patreon campaign to raise some funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-\u00a0Why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor the last year I\u0027ve been suffering a huge amount of commissions. The list is so immense I can hardly find time to work on stuff that I personally want to do (like modeling some canon characters, not only MLP, or even watch some tutorials to advance even further). On the other hand, I cannot stop taking these - I moved in July and modeling has been my only source of income. Patreon will allow me to create a fund buffer while I create content for public use, thus saving me time and effort I put into private commissions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Why not distribute stuff for free? Why is all of this so costly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThing is not with me being greedy, it\u0027s about modeling being my full time occupation. Each day I wake up, take my seat in front of monitor and make a better thing. I put effort in stuff I do and I provide support to those that use my stuff (unless they ask really stupid questions like \"how do I install it, where\u0027s the download button, what is SFM even??????\" and so on). Besides, most of the stuff I release \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0free. But I get really low feedback on that. What I want to do with Patreon is to establish a micro-community around a certain set of resources. It\u0027s a sort of experiment. Since these were paid for, they get certain value, thus there is more motivation for buyers to make the product better. With your help I\u0027ll be refining patron materials till they\u0027re perfect, and that will lead to the betterment of my free releases too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Oh, so you want feedback? Sure I can give you that, just give me the models.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I\u0027d love to, there\u0027s also a situation with people financially profiting from free resources. I don\u0027t mind them - on the contrary, if the stuff they make is good, they advertise my models big time. Advertising leads to more commissioners and there\u0027s the dead point - I can\u0027t handle more. I\u0027m starting to get depressed from sheer amount of stuff I owe. Think of Patreon as a support program. You can donate a sum \u003cem\u003eONCE \u003c/em\u003eand get a set of stuff available by the moment you pledged. By becoming my patron, you unburden me, encourage more free stuff to be made AND get a set of goodies available nowhere else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- Well, I think all of this costs a bit too much...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not forcing you to buy anything. All of this is one time purchase - so you pay once and get access to ALL (!) existing stuff and updates for your tier for the whole month! But keep in mind that more stuff is accumulating with time, so you might wanna pledge again. Really, some games cost even more than that, and they\u0027re not nearly as entertaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e- But really, how about you release all of this for fr..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHow about you skidaddle the fuck out of here?\u003cbr\u003e"
