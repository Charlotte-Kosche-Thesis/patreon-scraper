I swear if I have to put another heart over a nipple I think I\u0027ll ... I\u0027ll ... post it on Patreon so I don\u0027t have to! Look there\u0027s going to be different points of access based on your pledge but there is value at every level!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMERCHANDISE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver want a super dope poster of your favorite model or perhaps you\u0027re looking for the perfectly framed photo that really pulls the room together? Maybe your analog heart craves a wall calendar or, or maybe you want to have the coolest shower curtain in the city? All this and more will be yours for just a few sheckles.\u003cbr\u003eSeriously, you know how many times I\u0027ve said, \"what I wouldn\u0027t give to have the coolest shower curtain in the city\"? ok, probably zero but shit, someone must have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTIPS, TRICKS AND INSIGHTS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I don\u0027t think I\u0027m that hard on the eyes, I\u0027m not under any belief that you\u0027re here to see my face however, there are some of you that are interested in the magic behind the lens, presets in photoshop, how to work with beautiful women without ending up on the #metoo hit list ... all useful things that I\u0027m happy to share. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1:1 WORKSHOPS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a very select few, I\u0027ll spend time with you to help you develop your portfolio, build your social following and even book gigs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eHi and welcome to my Patreon!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho knew that they would ask such deep and introspective questions like \"Who are you?\" I mean, that\u0027s a tough one ... I need to tell you things about myself that are relevant to you knowing who you\u0027re following and potentially giving money to view his work ...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will take some time for me to share the more private bits but I\u0027ll stick with the facts that are important to why I\u0027m here and what I\u0027m providing as content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a professional photographer with over 20 years behind the camera, I don\u0027t rely on it as my sole source of income (I mean, I like expensive things and a photographer\u0027s earnings save a few lucky skilled individuals just isn\u0027t going to cut it) but I love being a photographer and I love creating beautiful images with beautiful people (beautiful in that they look amazing but more importantly are wonderfully beautiful humans).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have long been trapped by the commercial digital world, governed by censorship and trolls, I have posted my more \"natural\" works on other platforms only to see them stolen by others and displayed as their own and in some cases sold without my knowledge or endorsement with no actionable recourse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately I have had many of my followers on Instagram (\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/adgopro1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@adgopro1\u003c/a\u003e) ask where they can find my uncesored works and I didn\u0027t have an answer for them. A friend of mine recently joined Patreon and has had a great experience thus far and encouraged me to give it a-go ... so here I am.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have no delusions of grandure, I\u0027m not trying to make a living from this ... I just want to fund my work so I\u0027m not losing money every time I shoot. Locations, travel, stylists, models, food, etc all adds up and it would be nice to take something that I love and not be broke (remember the expensive things I mentioned before? Daddy has his Nike addiction!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo know that you\u0027ll be supporting my habit while hopefully enjoying all the images that I have created with some of the most beautiful people in the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love feedback, especially criticisim (as long as it comes from an honest and helpful place, ain\u0027t got no time for haters) as I don\u0027t think I\u0027m all that and always want to get better at what I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this ridiculously long intro ... imagine if I actually started diving into \"Who I Am?\" OMG we\u0027d be here forever!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove ya,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdam"

I have long struggled with the best way to release my content in a way where I am able to maintain artistic integrity while also making enough money to support my photography habit ;)\u003cbr\u003eAs for the rest of me, my bio line reads: Marketing Executive, Alternate on the 1994 US Men\u0027s Olympic Volleyball Team (developmental team), Spent two years working as a sous chef at a french restaurant, started my own app development company (failed, tried again, failed, tried again and succeeded).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTurn ons: people who are kind and considerate to everyone, realness, humor, self-deprication, conversation, music (all music, yes even country), closeness and tacos\u003cbr\u003eTurn offs:\u00a0\u00a0politics, opportunists, social whores, fakeness, small talk, exclusionists, elitests, pretty much anyone who thinks they\u0027re better than anyone else, no tacos\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t take myself seriously (at all) and I just want a place that can support my model habit ... these shoots don\u0027t pay for themselves and it would be nice to breakeven. I\u0027m open to your ideas and happy to work to create content that you crave. I appreciate everyone that engages with my and my work ... I understand if you don\u0027t want to contribute or pay to see what I\u0027ve created just respect that the reason why I\u0027m asking for pay is so that I can keep doing what I love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you and I love you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdam",
