    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe Short Version\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am making a podcast called The Future Is Beautiful. On this show we explore the weave between politics, spirituality, creativity and sustainability. I interview different people each week whose work and lives are creating a more beautiful future for all of us. The guests alternate each week between a male and a female - and we do the interviews in person for real quality of conversation. I want to do this all with no advertising, and at the same time make it a sustainable project that the team behind it can focus on, and so I am asking for you the community to support it. If enough of you give the equivalent of a banana or a glass of wine per week then boom - we will be there. We will be disrupting the model and showing that you can create something in the world today that isn\u0027t about advertising and targets but just about people. This show is for you, and it\u0027s for our future generations. Let\u0027s create a beautiful future together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(IF YOU PREFER TO GIVE DIRECTLY IN \u00a3, YOU CAN FROM OUR\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://WWW.THEFUTUREISBEAUTIFUL.CO/COMMUNITY\"\u003eCOMMUNITY PAGE\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Long Version\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting my page. My name is Amisha Ghadiali. For the past ten years I have been exploring how we can live in our truth and create a future that is beautiful: moving out of separation and into a space of connectedness with each other and nature. I don\u0027t have the answer yet, but I do have a lot of questions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work has exposed me to very different \"worlds\" and I have met many incredible people whose contribution and presence is inspiring. I have found that we often get immersed in our smaller communities but this is the time where we need to weave together different disciplines, industries and understandings.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollowing on from my book, The Future Is Beautiful, I am starting a podcast.\u00a0The series will create a bridge between politics, sustainability, creativity and spirituality - bringing together these communities to inspire action, awaken hearts, and raise consciousness to guide us to a brighter future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have chosen this format as there is so much value in long, deep, slow conversations in a world that is so fast paced. I want to invite you into these intimate moments with well known and unsung heroes who are breaking convention and creating something beautiful, as we discuss their vision and personal journey. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is why I need you.\u003c/strong\u003e I don\u2019t want this podcast to be full of annoying adverts. Most of my favourite podcasts have long intros or breaks selling stuff we don\u0027t need. Let\u0027s move beyond this, where it isn\u0027t about products, but about people, and about us building a true community - a space of common unity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want this\u00a0to be supported by those of you listening who can afford to. That way it\u0027s a wonderful resource that we are creating together that is out there and free for anyone to tune into.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAs well as being able to pay myself a little for my time, there are other costs such as a sound editor, and somebody to work with me on writing the blog posts and newsletters. I have already invested in some basic equipment and wish for some support in setting up the tech for the podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI am nervous about asking for money in this way (it\u2019s not very British!) but some friends assure me that you will want to be part of this and that this is the way of the future. Cut out advertising, cut out media with targets and agenda, and create something that is authentic, and made just for you, just for us, because we deserve to know about the concepts, projects and people that will expand our possibilities and enrich our lives. These things don\u0027t always get so much media space. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly the amount of meetings that I have been in about how to make sustainability sexy, and what celebrity endorsements would mean that people might care about the future would make you scream. We do care, we just don\u0027t always have access to the good stuff because it\u0027s hard to find in mainstream media. And it\u0027s hard to stay inspired amongst the dominant world story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that each one of us have ideas and experiences to share that can lead us to a beautiful future, and that what each one of us does counts. These conversations I hope will move us into living from more of our wholeness and truth, and inspiring others to do the same.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first goal is the equivalent of 10 of you buying me a glass of wine every week (I get offered many of these each week which I turn down), or 150 of you buying me a fair-trade organic banana every week. When I break it down like this, it doesn\u0027t seem like such a big ask.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe actual cost of making this podcast is the equivalent of 244 of you buying me a cup of coffee every time you listen to an episode. That seems possible as we already have a community of listeners much bigger than this. That literally just covers a little bit of my time, and allows me to pay my amazing team for their work (Gavin Kendrick on sound editing and Lucy White doing all the writing for how we share each episode).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI recorded the first interview with author Charles Eisenstein which I look forward to sharing with you. He said \u003cem\u003e\u201cI did this podcast with Amisha and I really enjoyed her style as an interviewer; the softness, openness and curiosity, and I would be very happy if she continues doing more of them and brings that out in her voice into the world.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI will be alternating every week between a female and male guest. And my aim is to bring a diverse selection of voices from all over the world. (This list doesn\u2019t illustrate that, but I promise I will over time especially as different series will be recorded in different parts of the world). Some of the guests that are already live with the first series are Sally Kempton, Bruce Parry, Samantha Roddick, Hareesh Wallis, Annegret Affolderbach, Satish Kumar and Zerbanoo Gifford. A number of other incredible people have agreed to be on the show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe interviews are all in person so the guests and myself take time to tune into each other, and open up the depth of connection and conversation. And the show is weekly, although we will have seasons and take some breaks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love for you to be part of the creation of this, not just an audience, but a community - suggesting guests, asking questions, sharing your story, and of course supporting on here if you can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know giving money to somebody is a big deal. You can trust me, I am hard working and committed. I started this project seven years ago and have never earned a penny from it, it\u0027s been a true labour of love. With this podcast, and the stage of life I am in, I want to make this more official and make this something that me and my team are paid to create and can give the attention to that it deserves.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s create a beautiful future, together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You,\u003cbr\u003eAmisha\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cWhat keeps us trapped by the mistakes of the past? Often it is the inability to imagine the world being truly different, a lack of example or inspiration to follow, or simply not believing that we can make a difference. The Future Is Beautiful has a cure for each of these ills.\u201d Andrew Simms, New Economics Foundation\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca\u003ewww.thefutureisbeautiuful.co\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
