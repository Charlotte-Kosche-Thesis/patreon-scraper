    "summary": "Hello!  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Alessandro. I\u2019ve been called many things throughout my lifetime, chief among them writer, philosopher warrior, and martial arts instructor. I discovered my passion for martial arts and writing around the same year, 1980, and since then, I\u0027ve never looked back from my pursuit of knowledge. Since 1989 I\u0027ve ventured to teach others to walk their own path to discovery and I\u0027m delighted that Patreon can help me continue that extension of myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first book, Full Circle: Life Lessons Learned on the Martial Path was a great personal triumph. My views on life, philosophy, the martial arts, and the universe were finally published after decades of oral storytelling. In the words of one of my reviews, \u201cIt is written in the same vein as The Book for Five rings and the Art of War.\u201d  While my book is not so much a manual for war strategy or swordsmanship, it is a narrative that can apply to anyone\u2019s daily life. You don\u2019t have to be a martial artist to gain insight from its reading. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is always my goal to share my passions to others and continue to create content that will inspire and motivate others whether or not they are actively training in martial arts. For the initiated martial artist, I will be producing text-based and visual content geared towards the beginning students all the way up to the decades long practitioners. I pride myself on never producing empty or filler content, so you can rest assured you\u2019ll find some good stuff here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my background?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the founder of Full Circle Martial Arts and I hold four black belts or the equivalent in various systems, both traditional and not. I come from four generations of published writers. I have been published both on and offline, with featured pieces showcased on various blogs and magazines. I have had my own works published in book format.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of writing will I be creating?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have two major projects I\u0027m currently working on. One is my untitled follow up book to Full Circle: Life Lessons Learned on the Martial Path. The second is a self help book with a science fiction setting called,  \"The Happiest Planet in the Galaxy\". I always have smaller projects in the works as well, both fiction and non-fiction. I hope to debut excerpts and chapters to patrons as I continue completion.  I\u2019m particularly looking forward to an instructional book on the intricacies of joint locking.  This will include detailed pictures and illustrations.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of videos will I be making?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos revolve around self defense and functional, efficient martial arts usage. They\u2019re also designed to introduce people to new martial arts systems and ideas. They will include technical instruction, advice, strategy, and martial wisdom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I be doing with patronage funds?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI primarily plan to offer dojo tuition scholarships to students in need of instruction who are unable to afford lessons.  These students will primarily be children between the ages of 5-18. However, some will also be adults who are trying to get back on their feet. I do my best to serve underrepresented populations in the martial arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you passions other than those already listed?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a huge sci-fi geek. Star Wars borders on religion for me. I\u0027m an avid movie buff who loves all good cinema regardless of genre. I love to read, cook (especially bake), travel, and upkeep my home. I love new discovery of passions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
