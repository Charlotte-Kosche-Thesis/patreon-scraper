It mingles the magic and intrigue of urban fantasy favorites such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Supernatural, and American Gods with the small-town heart and emotional depth of writers such as Alice Hoffman and Richard Russo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eWhy I Write, \u0026amp; How You Can Help:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStories are the lifeblood of cultures: they carry our values, our hopes, our dreams, our fears, and our spirit from generation to generation. \u00a0I have been a voracious reader ever since kindergarten, and as soon as I was able, I began crafting stories of my own. \u00a0At first, I borrowed characters I loved from cartoons and movies, but soon enough, characters and worlds began to spring from my imagination... and once I started, I couldn\u0027t stop. \u00a0When I entered college in 2000, I began the project which would become my greatest joy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince life has never conformed to one particular genre, neither do the Novels of Aviario ... which makes them difficult to market through conventional publishing. \u00a0My first novel was a straight-up thriller, the second was an urban fantasy with a dash of mystery and a touch of horror, and the third is a coming-of-age tale with the same magic as the second. \u00a0This is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want my readers to enjoy my books as much as I enjoy creating them, and by being a Patron, you will be able to have a direct connection with me as Aviario and the world around it grow. \u00a0I\u0027ll reach out on my Patrons-only feed for your opinions: which characters do you want to see more? \u00a0Which concepts and plots have really hooked you? \u00a0 Together, we can help build a world worth disappearing into for hours at a time: me, in creation, and you in blissful inhabitance. \u00a0I\u0027ve made Aviario my second home ... let me invite you to stay, too."
