    "summary": "Hi there. My name is Gregory Austin McConnell - my friends call me Austin, and YouTube calls me\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/austinmcconnell\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eaustinmcconnell\u003c/a\u003e. I run a channel over on that platform, and I use it to tell stories.

And I made\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXxPGUW_7OA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etwo obscure comic book characters\u003c/a\u003e so popular that Ron Howard and company\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/RealRonHoward/status/919270625696538625/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edecided to put them in the next Star Wars film\u003c/a\u003e. I don\u0027t understand why any of this is happening, but my mom assures me she is very proud of these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround 300,000 people have subscribed to my channel, and some of them have asked to support me in what I do. So, here we are. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this Patreon thing, and why are you pestering me about it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, look - I\u0027ll state upfront: if money is tight for you, be smart and use it in some other way than this. Don\u0027t put yourself in financial risk for some obscure YouTuber. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT - if you like the stuff I make and want to help me make more, this is the way to do it. Patreon lets you send regular financial support to creators (like me) each month. You help me put food on the table for my family, and I do my best to keep churning out content you might enjoy. You can opt out at any time, so if I stop tickling your fancy, you no longer have to pay. Win-win, right?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eOkay, I want to help. How does this work?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreat! So click \"Become a Patron\" (or whatever the big button is on this page), and you\u0027ll be able to choose how much to send per month. There are different Patron levels (with different perks), so just pick whichever you\u0027d prefer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLevels? Interesting.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah - I think so, too. There are 4 different support levels, depending on your personal preference, and financial willingness. Again, please don\u0027t put yourself into poverty. That\u0027s dumb. Just pick a level that makes sense for you, and we\u0027ll both win. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge $1 per month, and you\u0027ll get access to an exclusive blog on this site where I\u0027ll post lots of behind-the-scenes stuff. For just $12 a year (the cost of a single movie ticket) you\u0027ll get a fun look into how I do what I do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge $5 per month, and you\u0027ll get your name added to the credits of my videos, which is pretty cool. I\u0027ll also shoot you a transcript of each (scripted) video, and you\u0027ll get to submit requests for video topics (the best of which I will pick and do, making sure you get a shout-out.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge $10 per month, and you\u0027ll get access to a Live Show once a month where I\u0027ll take questions, give updates as to what I\u0027m working on, and probably make a fool of myself. Plus, you\u0027ll get (scripted) videos a day earlier than everyone else. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re feeling particularly generous, you can pledge $50 a month. But, yeah, that\u0027s dumb. Please don\u0027t select this if you really can\u0027t afford it. That means \u003cem\u003eyou too\u003c/em\u003e, Mom. At this level, you\u0027ll get your name in the credits before everyone else, access to the audio tracks of my scripted stuff early, a chance to be seen/heard in a few videos... oh, and free tickets to live events (like film premieres or festivals).\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSo, where does this money go? \u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, it goes toward continuing and improving the YouTube channel. I love making videos, but they take time. Writing, shooting, editing, uploading, advertising, etc. is a bunch of work, and it\u0027s hard to do by myself in a timely manner. In order to get a video out about every 2 weeks (my current rate), I\u0027ll often work 100+ hours on it. Since I have a full-time job in addition to YouTube, this time is usually subtracted from my sleep. I would really like to change that. Your support would help me finally hire an assistant editor to get videos out quicker, and I\u0027ll be able to actually improve the quality and quantity of my online stuff, overall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond, consider it as support for my larger-scale projects. I\u0027ve got a lot of irons in the fire, including a feature film and an animated web series. I\u0027m really excited about tackling them in 2018, and you\u0027ll be helping out a lot with that. I essentially have a list of projects I\u0027m determined to complete, and the order in which they are completed will depend a lot on how much public support/interest there is. You can get an idea of some of these projects under the \"goals\" section.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThird, you\u0027ll be helping me support my family. My wife would not agree to a photo, so this is our dog. He thanks you for your generosity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59e2939bace8641af3889ca2/t/5a231c69419202b1df02b04f/1512250508520/thedog.jpg\" style=\"width: 270px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
