I will not post less content on my other Social Media or treat you any different \u0026lt;3 . This is just a place where those who wished to help me out a little extra can do so (and receive some \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eExclusive\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u00a0Perks\u003c/span\u003e as a \u003cstrong\u003eHUGE\u003c/strong\u003e thank you)\u003cbr\u003eSo now that that is out of the way... HI my name is Allie and I\u0027m a Georgia Based cosplayer! Cosplay has been a passion of mine since forever and i love sharing it with others. I stick with the ideals of positivity through creativity and it boggles me I\u0027ve gotten this far in the craft with all of you! I\u0027m hoping to be able to expand my reach with others and make some some of my best costumes to date!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SUPPORT ON PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCosplay is a very expensive hobby and though i am great at budgeting and all that jazz, some projects just require a little more love that i am unable to currently provide without that help. I have created a Patreon to give those who have messaged me a safe and fair way to support me and my work as they see fit and i think that is beyond awesome! Just imagining that a pair of contact lenses can be $25, a Sheet of Worbla can be $72 (and needing several sheets), a Wig can be $15-$55, not to mention fabric, thread, paint, primers, sealers, wires, metal, fasteners, makeup, AND ETC can kinda out into scope how much money that kind of detail requires and is executed through love! Even $1 is so helpful you have no idea. I just want to thank you for taking the time to swing by and be here with me :3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly i just ask that if you do receive Patron Only content that you agree and honor my desire for it to stay exclusive and not to be scanned or posted elsewhere on the internet. This is not fair to me as a creator who works very hard to provide EXTRA \u00a0content as well as regular content or other backers. Resulting in doing so will result in a ban from all social media (I\u0027m sorrrryyyy)\u003c/div\u003e"
