I have encountered a snag. Since I have no physical stores to sell my merchandise and almost no money to advertise what I do, or purchase a stand at conventions, I need your help. Your contributions will help spread awareness of revolutionary literature. I have a YouTube presense where I amuse many people as well and I am not making enough in ad revenue for this either. If you help me enough I can make my channel less annoying by removing ads and I can make amazing content whether written, audio, or video. Thank You!"

     "about": "I am known by many from the year 2008 as Adathorrules on YouTube and many other sites. On Blogger people know me as The Ultimate RPG Gamer. Further I have a fanfiction.net and Wattpad account with the username Adathorrules. For years I went from reviewing games I loved as a child to making YouTube videos of whatever I wanted. Now I am an author not just on Fanfiction.net and Wattpad but also I am a fiction writer who has never been permanently employed and wants to influence change on the world through my contributions to it. Maybe you aren\u0027t made of money this is fine a dollar isn\u0027t much but on a recurring basis from you and many others like you it will make all the difference. With your help I can afford to give you firsthand peeks at what various expos are loke and interviews with cosplayers. Who knows maybe I\u0027ll even meet you someday. Besides regular content I already do I can also use it to publish more fanfictions and even some novels to be bought for a decent price. I swear against using professional vanity services as much as possible save for what is needed to keep the content alive. This is because I want my content to be as genuine as possible and offer the reader a unique experience. Having other people edit my work would take away from that. As such \u00a0all funds for books would go towards ISBN packs and copyright fees and of course the costs of shipping and making rewards for philanthropy. If I still have a surplus of funds and have no where to use them I do support other artists by purchasing commissions at conventions or meetups and if I could I would help anyone who wishes to express themselves artistically to get what they need to do so. So by supporting me you are supporting many other people as well that I have the privilege of meeting. TLDR: Support me and I will pay it forward when I can.",
