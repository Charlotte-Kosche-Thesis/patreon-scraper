     "about": "Hello \u0026amp; welcome to my Patreon page! The name\u0027s Jess! I\u0027m a small independent artist and creator. I absolutely LOVE creating things! A majority of what I love to create is self taught. I usually dive into a project not knowing the outcome but with an idea as to what I would like my project to look like through the process of creating it. I\u0027m an artist that really doesn\u0027t settle for just one medium; I\u0027m a sculptor, painter, drawer, crafter of all sorts, a sewer, welder, designer, photographer \u0026amp; all around builder of interesting things such as props for Halloween! I LOVE HALLOWEEN!!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy favorite part of creating is when I show my creations to others and how they react to my pieces. People react with. \"You made that?!\" or, \"How on earth did you make that!?\" or, \"That looks like something you would get at a collectors shop!\" and they go on. It fills my heart with happiness knowing that people enjoy what I create and sometimes my things like my very huge Halloween displays I create; breaks up peoples crazy lives even if its for only a moment when they drive by. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027m taking my growth as an artist into my own hands by creating my heart out for the world to see on Youtube, Patreon and other social media platforms. In hopes that people around the world will see what I create and enjoy what they see \u0026amp; maybe my pieces, whatever they may be; creates some happiness in someones life. Art makes me happy; it\u2019s my life \u0026amp; my way of living. \u0026lt;3 \u003cbr\u003e",
