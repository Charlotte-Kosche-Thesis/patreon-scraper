Back then I didn\u0027t have much of an outlet to express my love of creating and wearing said cosplays of\u00a0my favourite characters from comic books, games and movies as I wasn\u0027t very aware of the cosplay scene in general, let alone the one right on my doorstep. \u00a0The past couple of years I began attending conventions around the UK, such as London MCM, as well as many smaller local events in Scotland. \u00a0They were so much fun and through these events I\u0027ve made so many amazing and talented friends within the cosplay community worldwide. \u00a0This has only strengthened my love and passion for the art.\u003cbr\u003eWithin the past year I have been extremely lucky to have been invited to guest at certain comic and gaming events. \u00a0I\u0027m so incredibly grateful (and ridiculously flattered) that anyone would think my costumes - and myself, were deserving of such a wonderful opportunity. \u00a0This has given me a push to seriously up my game in the cosplay department and strive to improve my skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePerformance\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been into the performing arts since I was kid, I loved the theatre, singing and most of all dancing!  I attended all sorts of dance classes as well as competing and placing at national level as part of my old cheerleading sqaud.  When I was 18 years old I went along to a few burlesque classes with a friend, just for a bit of fun, and I absolutely fell in love with it.  Everything from the glitzy costumes and the total confidence boost it gave me to see that \u003cem\u003eanyone\u003c/em\u003e could actually do something like this and look awesome while doing so!  The classes stopped running after a while and I struggled to find any others so nothing much came from it for the next few years and it was kind of forgotten about during my years at college, until last year. New opportunities arose for me to get myself up on stage and I jumped at the chance!  Since then I have been performing at burlesque, and now also drag shows, and I couldn\u0027t be more thrilled to be back pursuing something I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/g9aV58Z.jpg\" style=\"width: 308px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cem\u003eCredit: BLM Photography\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy should anyone consider supporting Asylumstar?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re probably wondering why you should even consider pledging to me, what\u0027s in it for you?\u003cbr\u003eWell, as a lot of you may know costuming, alongside prop making and the likes can get expensive - currently I\u0027m saving for a mortgage to buy my own home so a lot of my extra cash that would otherwise be spent on cosplay builds now had to be saved for the the future!
