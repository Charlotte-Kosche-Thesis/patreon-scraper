Once I get a good collection of pieces painted ( around 100 ) I\u0027d like to start researching ways to get an actual \"Book of Gosh\" printed and into the world for all to see. The idea of creating a book that represents a lost culture from another dimension is extremely exciting to me. I imagine myself as a child, picking up this book for the first time and flipping through the pages, wondering what it\u0027s all about. Hopefully inspiring creativity and imagination. \u003cbr\u003e\nI have a note hanging next to a mirror in my home that says \"Make frequent trips to your childhood kingdom\".  This is a constant reminder for me to check in with myself and make sure I\u0027m creating amazing things that would make a child\u0027s eyes light up and make their head fill with wonder. \u003cbr\u003e\nThe drive to create is what keeps me going. The more support I have from patrons like you, the more I can create and focus on putting these amazing things into the world. The more you can support, the more you become a part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I\u0027m a visionary artist located in Western Massachusetts. My primary goal of this Patreon project is to support my ongoing artistic vision of \"Pages From The Book of Gosh\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe intention is to create various drawings and paintings that appear to have once been within certain books and temples of another civilization from another dimension. They will often contain strange symbols and writing along with various types of creatures, plant life, and other living and nonliving things that may have been documented for historical purposes, anatomical description, ritual ceremony, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe pages will vary in size and medium but the theme will remain the same overall. I do my best to give the viewer some pieces of a story that they can use to fuel their own ideas of what the pages may actually be holding within the strange symbols and beautiful art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I am a very imaginative artist, there will occasionally be other pieces of art that are not directly related to the Book of Gosh work. I think you\u0027ll find they will still be fairly similar in style and subject matter and you may like those pieces even more than the Gosh works. If a certain piece calls out to you that is different from the others and you\u0027re a patron that has the option to claim it (depending on the tier you pledged for), please feel free to do so. As an artist, sometimes I have to stray slightly from one direction to get a new view perspective on the primary goal. But ultimately, the intention is creating strange and beautiful works that represent my \"Gosh\" culture.\u003cbr\u003e",
