    "summary": "Hi there! I am Alisa180, an aspiring writer, female geek, and nerd extraordinaire. I write reactions to various things, mainly video games and animation (though webcomics slip in every now and then), alongside \u0027meta\u0027 posts that speculate and analyze aspects of the stories. \u00a0My stuff is primarily posted on Tumblr, though I am looking into other platforms. Here are some examples of my work:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://alisa180.tumblr.com/post/119549437714/in-the-pokemon-fandom-every-once-in-a-while-you\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePokemon Economics Post\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://alisa180.tumblr.com/tagged/upd8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHomestuck Upd8 Posts\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://alisa180.tumblr.com/post/116183745919/steven-universe-story-for-steven\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSteven Universe Reaction Post\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe primary purpose of this Patreon is to help justify the time I put into these projects. Eventually, it will be put to helping me branch out, most notably into video games. But another thing is I\u0027ve always dreamed of making money from my writing in some way or another. Even just a little bit would be wonderful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporters will be able to help direct my future projects, as shown by the rewards sidebar. The current highest tier will get the right to suggest a series for me to do, one of which I\u0027ll do per month in a raffle held during the monthly hangout.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Projects:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://alisa180.tumblr.com/tagged/upd8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHomestuck Upd8 Reactions\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e(occur at the speed of HS upd8s)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://alisa180.tumblr.com/tagged/gravity-falls-reaction\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eGravity Falls Watch and Reaction\u003c/a\u003e (Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Will be updated as other projects are added/removed)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, I often do random meta and theory posts on a whim, usually concerning what I\u0027m currently reacting to, but other things sneak in from time to time. You never know when inspiration may strike!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporter\u0027s Choice Rules:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. No hentai or porn, of course. But also nothing with gratuitous violence, and ESPECIALLY *No Horror.* It\u0027s not a matter of disliking it, not at all. One of my recent obsessions was a horror-franchise (Five Night\u0027s at Freddy\u0027s). It\u0027s a matter of straight-up trauma. I could only do FNaF through extremely careful exposure to the lore on my part, and even then I\u0027ve still lost a couple nights sleep over it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI feel I must emphasize this: Consider the Nightmare Fuel in the works you recommend. This mainly applies to live action and video games, as I seem to have a higher tolerance for that kind of stuff when it\u0027s animated. Even if it\u0027s not a straight-up horror game, there\u0027s sometimes elements that invoke the same feeling. I\u0027m mainly thinking of the Flood from Halo here, which gave me nightmares for weeks. If the game has a \u0027zombie-like\u0027 enemy, you probably shouldn\u0027t suggest it. For the sake of this creator\u0027s sanity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(In other words, for video games, no Five Night\u0027s at Freddy\u0027s, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Condemned: Criminal Origins, or anything along those lines).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. These are my laptop specs: Lenovo U430 Intel Core i5-4200U CPU @ 1.60GHz (4CPUs) ~2.3GHz, Windows 8.1 64-bit I can run FFXIV on this, but not at the best frame rate. Keep this in mind when suggesting games. I\u0027m limited to whatever I can play on my laptop for now, but I hope to eventually invest the supporter money into more/better equipment for potential video game reaction series. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. It must be relatively short. 12-13 episodes max for a series, and 10-15 hours for a video game. No limit on movies.\u003cbr\u003e"
