    "summary": "So, I\u0027m Ash, they/them/their if you please, agender, queer, writer. \u00a0I have a bachelor\u0027s degree in English, with a focus in creative writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt some point in college, I decided that I shouldn\u0027t just talk and complain about the lack of queer representation in media, but should help do something about it. \u00a0I then looked back at most of my creative writing works, and realized that I had basically been doing so anyway, just not really publishing them anywhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you will find here is the result of that, works of fiction - mostly short stories - with queer characters and themes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope, however, is not just to produce queer fiction, but to also, one day, open a queer bookstore, and that\u0027s really why I\u0027m here. \u00a0Starting any sort of business costs money, the type of money I just don\u0027t have. \u00a0So, every dollar pledged will go towards the end goal of opening my bookstore - Turn the Page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis could include things such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSchool - I currently plan to attend a local community college and complete a program in small business. \u00a0There are also training programs specific to opening and operating a bookstore I wish to attend.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFees - for the American Booksellers Association, for example\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe store itself - getting enough together to rent a space and put in orders for inventory is nothing short of daunting.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eWhat do you get out of it?\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell right off, stories. \u00a0Every backer will have access to the full text of each story I post.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will also be able to keep up with any progress I make towards opening TtP. \u00a0I will be slower at first, but should pay out as time goes by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHigher pledges will open up some behind the scenes stuff, character biographies, and potentially even rough drafts of chapters for some novels I hope to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also plan to have something in the store to thank every backer. \u00a0My current idea is to get a Pride flag, and have it embroidered with each backer\u0027s name to hang in the shop. \u00a0You don\u0027t have to stay until the very end for this, any person who pledges any amount at any time will qualify. \u00a0This idea can, of course, change, and could even be something you all vote on when the time comes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s basically it for now. \u00a0The end game is long, but I hope you join me for the ride there....and holy snap that was cheesy, but I stand by it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your time."
