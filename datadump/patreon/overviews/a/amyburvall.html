I consider myself a professional \u003cstrong\u003edot-connector\u003c/strong\u003e, frequent \u003cstrong\u003efl\u00e2neuse\u003c/strong\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://xwing212.wixsite.com/intentionthebook\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eauthor\u003c/a\u003e, international \u003cstrong\u003espeaker \u003c/strong\u003eand itinerant \u003cstrong\u003eartist\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m pretty darn prolific, and cannot find a category that really suits me, as I produce \u003cstrong\u003edigital and analog art, poetry, video, animation, photography, blog posts, music videos, remixes of all kinds, educational materials and courses, experience design and, well - ideas!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never sign my artwork, but most who are familiar with it can spot it a mile away for its distinct minimalist style and (often) \u003cstrong\u003ehot pink and black\u003c/strong\u003e colour palette.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a big fan of \u003cstrong\u003eremix culture\u003c/strong\u003e,\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eDadaism\u003c/strong\u003e, and irreverent art. If you are already following me on all the social media channels you know that I share freely and frequently and often produce content in \"themes\". I made it a personal challenge to see if I could do most of my creative work with my mobile phone (because I\u0027m a huge fan of mobile devices in the classroom if leveraged properly).\u003cbr\u003e(\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/amyburvall/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echeck out my Instagram\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a \u003cstrong\u003ebajillion new ideas a day\u003c/strong\u003e, and some could really be great if I just had the time and financial security to pursue them. A lot of folks have asked me to turn my projects into more \u003cstrong\u003etangible things\u003c/strong\u003e, like coffee table books, card decks, or other products. I have plans for a few books (most interactive), a couple video series (one animated one about Creativity), several online course experiences, a podcast, a card deck, an adult party game book and more! My\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://amysmooc.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog, AmusED\u003c/a\u003e has about 15 posts in the backburner (I blog mostly about visual thinking, media, education, and creativity).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will allow me to house my creative work in one consistent place, and I plan to taper down all my other postings on various platforms. I\u0027m a big believer in sharing work, because I\u0027m convinced that\u003cstrong\u003e if even only one person is affected in a good way, it\u0027s worth it\u003c/strong\u003e. People have often told me that my work \"makes their day\" or moves them deeply, sometimes if only to appreciate the beauty in the mundane or the wow in whimsy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will allow me to \u003cstrong\u003einteract more intimately with those who appreciate my work\u003c/strong\u003e and wish for me to keep creating and flourish. If you are not familiar, I\u0027ve set my page up to have \u003cstrong\u003emonthly commitments\u003c/strong\u003e (so you won\u0027t get charged for each item I make, which would be A LOT). For the price of a fancy coffee, a Friday beer, or a movie ticket each month you could really make a difference in my ability to \u003cstrong\u003emake good stuff\u003c/strong\u003e. I am a freelancer at the moment (after 25 years in the classroom), and am devoting my time to creating and helping others be more creative.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for my Patrons?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t wait to share special things with my patrons and get feedback (which is creative fuel, did you know?). I\u0027ve got a lot of \u003cstrong\u003ecool rewards\u003c/strong\u003e for your support at the varying tiers. Supporting me also means making the world a more \u003cstrong\u003ewhimsical, beautiful, fun place\u003c/strong\u003e (because I never post derogatory or hurtful things online). I do, however, try to create things that make people think...either by learning something new or looking at the world in a different way.\u003cbr\u003eHope you join me in this journey and let\u0027s see what we can create!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow me @amyburvall on all the things :)\u003cbr\u003e"
