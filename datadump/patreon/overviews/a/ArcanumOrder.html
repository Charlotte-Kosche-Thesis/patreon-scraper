I\u0027m Arin. I am currently based in the L.A. area.\u00a0I\u0027m a self taught artist and animator, vlogger, and cosplayer. I\u0027ve been \"cosplaying\" since I was 11 years old where my first costumes were made from cardboard and bed sheets. I didn\u0027t start \"officially cosplaying\" until my first convention in 2011.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eI\u0027ve been drawing for as far as I can remember. I started \"animating\" traditionally when I was a young child. It began with storyboards made from printer paper that would stack up like text books in my bedroom. I didn\u0027t transition to digital animation until around the time I began cosplaying, where I self-taught myself with just MS Paint and Windows Movie maker. I began filming videos when I was eight on my parents\u0027 VHS tape recorder, which is a massive and weighty device to those who are unfamiliar. My brother and I would make videos about Pokemon in our basement in the home I grew up in a suburb of Cincinnati. In high school I began a web series on YouTube with one of my best friends known as \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003eHappy Critical Day!\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e, which is now continued as \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci style=\"color: rgb(63, 49, 81);\"\u003eHappy Critical Day! Reconstruction\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e. My first vlog was at my very first convention, and I\u0027ve been hooked ever since.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GygLdjb.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eI\u0027ve always been artsy, and for a long time I knew my long term career was going to be somewhere in the film, animation, and entertainment industry. I aspire to pursue a career in film, which is one of the main reasons why I continued to run my YouTube channel. However, with YouTube constantly changing their policies with the newest \"demonetization\", I am at risk for losing revenue for vulgar language that has inexplicably become a staple of my content. While Adsense does give out some revenue, I wish to expand more independently by using Patreon for not only more stability, but to also give back to the community. One of my goals was to be able to do what I love, while also\u00a0ultimately\u00a0making people happy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eComing out with regular content, especially with the costs of travel, conventions, and cosplay really adds up and isn\u0027t a stranger to being defined as expensive. The support I get on here will aid me in producing more regular content by attending more conventions to see you guys, affording better equipment, cosplays, photos, and more, while also still giving back and being true to my supporters. It\u0027s a win-win, right? I am hoping someday that this Patreon will help me reach my final goal in my career, and I can\u0027t do it without you.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
