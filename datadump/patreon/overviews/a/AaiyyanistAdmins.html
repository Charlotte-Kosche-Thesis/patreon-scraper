    "summary": "Thank you so much for helping us financially. \u00a0We are a group dedicated to help our fellow Aaiyyanists worldwide, including the Aaiyyan World Foundation and other Aaiyyanists. We help them by hosting their sites, producing books and translating Dravidian Aaiyyani into English. The majority of Aaiyyanists do not speak English as a first language, so we are using this site to promote the Aaiyyanist faith to the wider community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Aaiyyanists live in the spiritual plane not the material one so all the work of Aaiyyanists are free. However, we do have expenses such as promoting our faith, producing books, podcasts and other educational material; as well as running servers and general administrative costs that go with any organisation. Every small amount of financial aid will help us to achieve our goals on spreading our faith and will also help you to become One with all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany Aaiyyanists worldwide are Dravidians and speak our languages: Dravidian Aaiyyani, Tamil, Telegu etc... This Patreon page is for Aaiyyanists who speak English or other languages and wish to receive teachings in Aaiyyanism in these languages. Every small amount can help pay for the minor costs of dedicated translators, email support and other volunteers who help the Aaiyyanist cause worldwide and who spread our message of love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is also one additional reason for setting up this Patreon page. We want this site to be a means of embracing many non-Aaiyyanist born souls. We want to spread the message of Dravidian Murugan-Aaiyyanism throughout the world and we feel the best way to do that is by engaging and nurturing Patrons such as yourself. We basically want to build up a community of like-minded souls and Patreon offers us the means to do that by filtering out people who are dedicated to the spiritual path. The Aaiyyan World Foundation gets many emails per day, but many of them are not serious, thus it was decided that a dedicated Patreon page would be the best method of rewarding people who were Aaiyyanists in a previous life and are returning to us in this one. We feel that only people who want to be dedicated Aaiyyanists would become our Patrons and others who were not serious would move onto other paths.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will also reward our Patrons by providing them with high resolution images of Lokas and Talas that have been produced by High Aaiyyani (Master) Level Aaiyyanists. If you understand the fundamentals of Aaiyyanism then you know how valuable these are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note: Existing Dravidian Aaiyyanists can help by aiding their own Schools and Groups. This is for new people who are interested in the Aaiyyanist path, and want to help us create new educational material translated into English and other modern languages.\u003cbr\u003e"
