I started taking it seriously after getting a tablet in August 2009 and making digital art. Since then I\u0027ve worked hard honing my craft and developing my technical skills, constantly trying to catch up with my vision and taste in an effort to express myself as genuinely as possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the course of my working life I\u0027ve moved houses, done landscaping, loaded up peoples vehicles, and pushed shopping carts in the Arizona summer, unloaded trucks and stocked shelves at Target, I was even a school bus driver for a year. I\u0027ve also made a few concerted efforts at freelancing, my first when I was still in school doing fantasy characters for a table top roleplaying game. I\u0027ve done work for a few online trading card games, some storyboarding for a game trailer, and some book and album covers. Nothing fancy or very high profile, but I learned a lot about myself and my art doing all these jobs. Things like how to effectively price your work and value your time, how to give yourself enough breathing room so you don\u0027t burn yourself out, but mainly that I\u0027d rather be making my own work instead of someone else\u0027s. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my short time on this earth I\u0027ve been through a lot and have come to learn some valuable lessons in overcoming hardship and growing up. Not at all to say I\u0027ve got it all figured out, but I\u0027d like to take a very serious step in communicating these ideas of love, self transformation, getting over yourself, overcoming your fears and improving the world around you with my art. The only person you can truly change is yourself. If my work can serve as a small impetus in you changing yourself for the better then I\u0027ve done my job. I\u0027ve decided to stop banging my head against the commercial illustration wall and start making work that I feel needs to be made. It seems so obvious now that this is what I should have been doing all along, but I got sucked into the idea that there were only certain ways to make a living doing art and I had to fit into that template. But now with platforms like this, independent creators can be supported doing what they love. That\u0027s the main point of this Patreon, to support my work so that I can create what I want without any restraints or boundaries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to transition not completely, but mostly over to oil painting from digital painting. This platform would help as supplemental income on top of selling paintings and so that I can finally stop working these soul sucking day jobs and make work that I can get behind and feel passionate about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour role will be in helping contribute as I set off in this new direction. You\u0027ll be charged per project/painting and that money will go to efforts of self study, workshops, time to make the work, learning materials and art materials, and what I can turn into useful learning material for you like tutorials work in progress shots. I\u0027d like to try and do some painting giveaways and things of that nature for you as well because that would be fun. \u003cbr\u003eSo if you like what you see and want some more, please consider pledging! Thanks for reading :)\u003cbr\u003e"
