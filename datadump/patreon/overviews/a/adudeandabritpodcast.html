    "summary": "Welcome to \u003cem\u003eA Dude and a Brit\u003c/em\u003e. \"We say smart shit...and dumb shit...but mostly smart shit.\" We are Freddie Jergons and TJ, and we are completely new to the podcasting world so be patient. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHO\u003cbr\u003eFreddie (Dude)- I\u0027m a teacher, in a D.C. area high school, and am not trying to lose my fucking job, so we will stay anonymous for now. I\u0027m an atheist, a secular activist, and I love classic movies, Nordic crime novels, Belgium beer and craft beer. I\u0027m fascinated with psychology and neuroscience. I really want to know WHY people think what they think, and more importantly, why THEY think they think what they think (hope that makes sense!). So, needless to say, I\u0027ve recently gotten into Street Epistemology and the rampant use of logical fallacies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTJ- D.C. based educator. Originally from the U.K. and now living the American Dream (sic). Has a passion for math, movies, and fine whiskey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTJ and I taught mathematics together for 2 years in an urban school district. He\u0027s the Brit. I\u0027m the Dude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been listening to podcasts for 3 years...The Scathing Atheists, Cognitive Dissonance, Skeptics Guide to the Universe, Atheism 101, Waiting 4 Wrath, Cellar Door Skeptics, The Thinking Atheist to name a few. I was scared as shit to start my own. I have a speech impediment and a lisp. It sucks when you lisp the letters S and L, and your fucking last name contains the letters S and L. By the way if you don\u0027t like profanity...fuck off. I love to curse. And saying fuck, shit, goddamn, tits and motherfucker is easier and more fun. My new psychologist just finished my psychoeducational evaluation. Can\u0027t wait to get the results. I\u0027m been diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety, depression, OCD, and ADHD, but no doctor actually said, \u201cDude let\u0027s have you evaluated.\u201d I told my former psychiatrist that I had trouble focusing at school. Fucking bam...30 secs later I\u0027m leaving with a script for fucking Adderall. By the way, I tend to digress and can\u0027t stay with a conversation for shit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo back to the WHY section of this introduction. I finally said,\u201dFuck it,\u201d and asked my friend TJ if he wanted to start a podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInto my 40s I\u0027ve finally decided to face my fears, challenge myself, and take on tasks that have previously scared the shit out of me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see and read shit everyday that sends me into a rage. As an educator, trying to correct this misinformation is very important to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSide note- please always call us out when we are incorrect. Check your facts before you do so, though. Bring facts, not your emotions or opinions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT\u003cbr\u003eDisclaimer- we are both atheists, but this will not be an atheist podcast. Of course, we will have fun at the expense of the delusional and silly-hat-wearing kiddie fuckers, but we wanted to branch out a bit and bring to the show more of ourselves. We are both passionate about beer, education, history, mathematics, social issues, movies, and I love some random ass fucking stories. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few weekly segments- Dude\u2019s weekly ASS Burner- this is devoted to a person, each week, who just burns my ass and brings me to full rampage mode. The first ASS Burner? A colleague of mine who sponsors the student organization Fellowship of Christian Athletes. More on this shithead on the pilot show. Another segment- TJ\u2019s \u003cem\u003eBritish Word of the Week\u003c/em\u003e- have you tried to read \u003cem\u003eA Clockwork Orange\u003c/em\u003e? Fucking impossible to understand. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019ll also play a game called \u003cem\u003eMatch that Crazy Belief\u003c/em\u003e- TJ will match a crazy religious belief or practice with its religion. And each week we\u2019ll discuss a couple news stories, examine a common logical fallacy, learn about a \u003cem\u003eForgotten Freethinker in History\u003c/em\u003e and TJ will enlighten us with \u003cem\u003eWhat the Fuck is Wrong with the US\u003c/em\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
