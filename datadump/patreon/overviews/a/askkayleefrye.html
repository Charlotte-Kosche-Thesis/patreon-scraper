    "summary": "I started cosplaying Kaylee from Firefly in 2012 at the suggestion of friends and strangers alike. I loved it. By 2015 at 3 years and 17 conventions later, I amassed a ton of Firefly knowledge and thought I might as well try my hand at running a panel. I\u2019d been to countless panels, but there was so much information that I still wanted to hear about. As they say, if you want something done, do it yourself. So I did. I presented \u201cThe Expanding Firefly \u2018Verse\u201d at Wizard World Chicago Comic Con in 2015. \u003cimg height=\"351\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PK2OBnXoDRO4WNOywZIIlWIb5WaSxS1PyLvws-rBEU43UPErg5APE_ihQQYRnuqEAKf8zE_QiAlE6yJaBOzwdsF0T5XdUBbg4eXDjNifv_Am_zx8rx5XB4XKR-P_N4I8st28vMXl\" style=\"\" width=\"624\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve taken refined versions of that panel to Madison Comic Con and Rhode Island Comic Con and I hope to take it to more events in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started this Patreon intending to support the costumes I make, which is why I set a goal at the beginning of the year to make  12 new costumes in 2017. And then life happened and I didn\u2019t make a single one. But I did keep working on material for conventions. I developed five new panels (with another in the works) and submitted them to conventions around the country.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally, being a panelist was a way for me to make my (cosplay) hobby slightly less expensive but it\u2019s more than that now. Going to conventions costs money. And while several cosplayers tell you their funds will not go towards conventions, I\u2019d like to do the opposite. I need funds to help me travel to events by bus, car, train, or plane. I need funds to buy food when I\u2019m at conventions all day. Right now, I only attend events in cities where I live or have someone to stay with, but I\u2019d like to have funds to stay at hotels for conventions that may require it. I\u2019d love to ask conventions to help me out with stipends as an invited guest but until that happens I am asking you, the people who support my work, to consider supporting more than just my cosplay. I\u2019m creating \u201cComic Con-tent,\u201d which includes my cosplay as well as the panels I create and the articles I write. \u003cimg height=\"268\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KwLW7jwGHOYtzvjkRS0zH2lQUpbW9a2A-WA_iJuxRPaPbMTYMhFyIUxFrk2yec30FbTlKLRyncj70Qkm6aoYfEmrZV81D1z1xjIXGDhOpCSTTsngWQQiTHypxI2BRzTulDAAt-3p\" style=\"\" width=\"624\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, patrons will get so many livestreams\u2026 plus tons of other behind the scenes action. Pledging just $1 a month gets you exclusive content, including being the first to know where I\u2019m headed next. $5+ patrons will have access to unboxings and panels on instagram live as they happen, plus the ability to watch livestreams of me working on presentations, photos for etsy, and my website. $10+ patrons can watch panel livestreams at their leisure and as often as they like alongside access to time-lapses of the other livestreams. At $25, patrons get beta access whenever I add a new feature to my website plus monthly 1-on-1 cosplay help via google hangout. For $50, I will present any panel to you and your friends live via google-hangout, once a month for every month you support me at that level. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons are charged monthly at the level they choose and can cancel or change levels at any time. Con season usually runs March through October but I work  on panel materials and submissions year-round, so you\u2019ll still get access to awesome content even in months where I don\u2019t attend a convention. Once you pledge, you\u2019ll immediately have access to every patron-only post I have ever made. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love all of my followers so those who are unable to support me financially will maintain access to the content I create, while my patrons simply get to see more behind the scenes action. I\u2019m always open to adding new perks as interest allows. Thanks for checking out my patreon and I hope we get to hangout at a convention soon!"
