I\u2019m already working on that 6th album and if I raise no money at all that album will still happen. This is for exclusive extra music. I may release it to the public at a later date, but I promise you that Patreon backers will get first grab for a minimum of 6 months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
