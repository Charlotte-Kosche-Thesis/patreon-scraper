They are currently available \nin print and (at least Kindle) e-book. I\u0027m currently working on putting \ntogether a companion art book for \"\u003cem\u003eFamily Tails\u003c/em\u003e\", and hope to have that published soon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have two other full length novels and more short stories on here, though those may not be fully edited. One of the novels, \"\u003cem\u003eThe Sacrifice for Peace, vol. 1, The Gathering\u003c/em\u003e\"\n (no connection to the card game), is the first volume of a trilogy, and\n the first full length novel I have ever written. The other full length \nnovel, \"\u003cem\u003eDaggers of Darkness - Into the Black\u003c/em\u003e\", is the first of a\n nine part series that I have in the works. Although the original \nversion of the story was written as an \"adult\" story, I will be \nrewriting it so that it will be in line with the style of my other \nstories (PG-13, more-or-less). I have more stories planned, and will \npresent them here on this site as I can get them written. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have lots of artwork, most are related to my stories--character portraits and scenes. I \u003cstrong\u003edo not\u003c/strong\u003e\n draw porn of any kind, and almost all of my artwork is done in pencil \n(I do have a few rare colored ones). I typically list what I used to \ndraw each piece when I post the picture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust a little bit about myself:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n was born and raised in the Midwest, USA. I served my country honorably \nin the U.S. Navy and have been to many places in the world. My hobbies \ninclude cooking, listening to music (mostly Celtic, \u002750\u0027s-\u002770\u0027s \nRock-n-Roll, Classical, light jazz, and world music. I have fair skill \nat leather working, enjoy hiking and backpacking, canoeing, cycling, and\n walking. I\u0027m in my 50\u0027s, single, unattached, and \"straight\", I live \nalone, and trying to get my tail moved to Alaska.",
