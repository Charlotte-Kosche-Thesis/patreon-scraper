    "summary": "Hello guyz, I am Anuel - novice writter and author of \"Forgining his own destiny\" - novel that you can read on \u003ca href=\"http://royalroadl.com/fiction/5290\"\u003ehttp://royalroadl.com/fiction/5290\u003c/a\u003e - it is a comedy in (dark) fantasy world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all I would like to say, that my work is free for everyone and I am releasing chapters as soon as it is only possible - you \"get\" (pretty much) nothing for donating, no matter how much you would pledge. So the question is - \"Why the hell should i spend a penny?!\" - great question. There is no \"WHY\", more like \"Why not?\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I am doing and you want me to focus more on the story then please - consider helping me out. In exchange for your generosity I humbly pledge to do everything I can to improve my story (and grammar - for as I am not a native English speaker - mistakes shall be made)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, i should try releasing at least 2 chapter per week - each chapter is around 10pages long /3k words. But those who read the story knows that I usually write more chapters weekly and they are usually longer. If i would have to take a break (because of any reason) - I would inform about it on novel site"
