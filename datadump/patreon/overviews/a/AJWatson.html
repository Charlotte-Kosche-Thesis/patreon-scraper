    "summary": "I love writing and creating worlds, and I want to share that with everyone. Apart from a trilogy already published I have several more books in the pipeline. I\u0027m not content leaving it at that however. I want to see my worlds and characters come alive in artwork. I want to explore character history in greater detail than I can add into a story. I want to populate cities and design spaceships that I can explore in future pieces. This is where Patreon\u0027s monthly support comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe funds you provide will go back into creating more visual content, and free me up to spend more time writing. I can envision no greater life than one spent creating things that I love, and sharing it with people that adore it. You will receive exclusive access to everything I create here. After a couple of months some content will filter onto my website www.ajwatson.com.au where you can share your expertise of my works with the world. There will however remain certain items permanently exclusive to only my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also write non-fiction for fitness, weight loss and coaching. I feel that for these types of books to work, the author must first utilise the skills and have success with them before publishing. I have done this as an active martial arts coach and competitor, as well as having lost 80kg through my own personal grind. I want to share this with everyone and I crave your feedback into what information you desire most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce you become my patron, I\u0027ll seek your input to shape my future novels and non-fiction alike. I\u0027ll share insights into my process. You\u0027ll receive \"DVD style extras\" for my books. I\u0027ll share my favourite fan-fiction and images you create based on my works. I want to connect to a rich community of my fans and enjoy every aspect of my passion with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m fortunate to have fans like you, and I see no reason to do this without connecting to you all. You know what you love and I want to deliver that. Your support means everything to me. I can\u0027t wait to share this journey with you."
