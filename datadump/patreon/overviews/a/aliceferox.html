You know I am a schizophrenic transgender queer woman who makes occult and queer photography mostly surrounding my emotional journey hearing voices and managing dysphoria almost exclusively in the form of portraits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve come to Patreon because my ability to find work is challenging due to my permanent disability. Patreon is a great tool to empower me to continue doing what I love without constrains. But that is not the only reason I\u0027ve come to Patreon. I also want to expand my work of the macabre \u0026amp; queer to more people beyond myself and a select few friends. I want to create a greater diversity in my work both technically and socially. The technical part of my work is more limited due financial barrier and the social aspect of my work is more due to my social shortcomings. My hope is Patreon can help me with both.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisit me on my website: \u003ca href=\"http://aliceferox.com/\"\u003ehttp://aliceferox.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSocial Media\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/aliceferox\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/Sissorelle\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://aliceferox.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/aliceferox/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/aliceferox/\"\u003ePinterest\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://aliceferox.deviantart.com/\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProducts\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://society6.com/SissorelleFerox\"\u003ePurchase My Work\u003c/a\u003e via Society6\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "My work is gender twisted, macabre spiced, occultish, magical photography taking the form of prints \u0026amp; digital images using layering techniques with unconventional digital or physical materials. My work is a reflection of myself, a schizophrenic transgender woman, and the emotional day to day. Through this photographic manipulation I produce an encounter that reflects a recognition of an increasingly mitigated physical experience of my world. My work combines reality of my transition that explores the rawest experience in the physical and intangible realms of my reality and beyond.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe figure is the forte and crown of my manipulations; I unabashedly use it as an anchor to examine topics ranging from what defines my gender, unconsciousness in its rawest form, haunting voices, and self-thought. Through my work there is a consistent spice of obsessive self-dissection and examination. This dissection of the self has also evolved into an examination of other individuals. A library of people has accumulated and has begun to excite me in new ways and influence the grand architecture of my practice.",
