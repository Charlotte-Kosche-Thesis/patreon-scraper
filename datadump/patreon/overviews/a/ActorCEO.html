I\u2019m no guru. I\u2019m an actor in New York City and I want to thank you for joining me on this journey. Our goal is to understand how an acting career is like running a business through weekly interviews with industry professionals, and using the insights we learn to create our own success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAs any filmmaker, producer, or creator will tell you, it takes a ton of work and often a fair amount of money to make your dreams come to life. There is no difference with this podcast. I spend money out of my own pocket to host the website, host the audio, handle the weekly email updates, and construct all the branding to make this podcast work. Generally that comes out to about $40 bucks a month, or just under $500 a year of my own money. That\u2019s what keeps weekly content, emails, interviews, social media, and website operations running week in and week out. And everyone get\u2019s incredibly valuable information from it. And now I\u2019m looking to bring you, my devoted listeners, into the fold by providing a Patreon account where you can support this podcast just the same as you support a friend\u0027s web series, a Kickstarter for another actor\u2019s film, or your casting site or Backstage subscriptions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, if every listener gave just $1 a month, not only would we fully fund the podcast content, I could be doing LIVE video interviews with incredible actors and industry pros, because I could go to them, with the gear that would produce the interviews you see in Actors on Acting, Backstage, or Behind the Camera. Seriously! I live in NYC and this is possible. And that would be \u003cstrong\u003eyour\u003c/strong\u003e contribution. \u003cstrong\u003eYou\u003c/strong\u003e would be making that content and more people would see it, more guest would want to be on it, and more actors would learn from it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo if you take learning about the business and improving your acting career long term as seriously as you do an acting workshop or your union dues, then please join me in creating a powerful tool for actors all over the world. As I have said on the show countless times, the industry paradigm is shifting and the creators (us!) have more control than ever. We can build not only the \u003cem\u003eentertainment\u003c/em\u003e we want to see but also the \u003cem\u003eeducation\u003c/em\u003e we want see. That is the power of your passion plus modern technology. \u003cstrong\u003eSo take 15 seconds and donate here at Patreon.com/actorceo. Where for as little as $2 a month you can empower not only your own acting career, but the career of those following you for years to come.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
