I\u0027ve been writing for well over a decade - it seems like I\u0027ve been doing it for as long as I can remember.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is what I do. It\u0027s what I am passionate about. I want, more than anything in this world to tell you a story that will burn into your mind and keep you on the edge of your seat. If I can bring you a moment of joy, then I\u0027ve done my job. This Patreon page was created so that I could continue to do just that!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2011, I left my home and everything that I owned in Kentucky and moved to California - things here have been fantastic. When I moved here, I started a commission business, and I\u0027ve been running that steadily... but I want more now. I want to create my own content. I want to share my dreams made tangible by way of story with the world! You can help me do that - you can help me live my dream. That dollar that you were going to spend on a soda to sip while reading this biography? Do you mind if I have it, instead! I promise I will make it worth your while!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny amount of \u003cstrong\u003emonthly\u003c/strong\u003e donation that you make will grant you access to my \u003cstrong\u003emonthly\u003c/strong\u003e content. I promise to upload one the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne excerpt from a novel\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0that I have a current copywrite on and am in the process of editing for publication! (Either a Fantasy called Cerulean Darkness or a Zombie Apocalypse novel entitled Limbo will make quite a few appearances, but you will see fresh and old things that I\u0027ve done as well!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI will also put up at least \u003cstrong\u003eone blog post per week on my blog, located\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://authoramandamccormick.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e These blogs posts give writing advice, writing tips, writing tricks, writing prompts, and just general discussion.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen goals are met, I will also post \u003cstrong\u003eone vlog a week\u003c/strong\u003e, either reading some of my creative writing content or talking about writing tips, tricks, and strategy.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eYour support honestly means the world to me - you are making it possible for me to continue doing what I love, what I dream of, and what I truly feel I was put on this earth to do.
