    "summary": "ASL Rose,  a deaf-owned and operated publishing company, is working on a new line of children\u0027s books including \"Have You Ever Seen\" (HYES) ASL Rhyming Parameter series, written especially for\u00a0children from preschool age to high school \u00a0that feature cartoon characters speaking in ASL and includes Deaf culture and history. \u00a0They will not only be fully illustrated but will have animated videos to go with them, too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Have You Ever Seen\" ASL Rhyming Parameter\u00a0series are focused on one feature of ASL Linguistics but in a whimsical and clever perspective where children and even adults can understand, follow and play in ASL. \u00a0The feature of ASL linguistics is Cherology (or ASL Phonology).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCherology (or ASL Phonology) is the study of cheremes (or ASL phonemes). It contains five parameters: 1. handshape, 2. location, 3. movement, 4. palm orientation and 5. non-maual makers (facial grammar rules).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe four HYES ASL Rhyming Parameter series are based on cherology parameters: handshape,\u00a0location, movement and palm orientation. The non-manual makers (facial grammar rules) book may come and follow in near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example from one of HYES ASL Rhyming Parameter series (Handshape), it is written to teach the 20 most common handshapes accompanied by graphics depicting signs associated with the handshape. Instead of emphasizing the first letter of a word to associate an English word (i.e. A is for apple) ASL literature emphasizes handshapes to correlate a letter to a sign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach page in the book begins by asking the question, \"Have you ever seen\u2026?\" and is followed by a cartoon character doing an action that are both based on the same handshape. \u00a0For example, from a page in the book which illustrates a horse as an artist with a sentence, \u201cHave you ever seen a horse painting?\u201d The handshape used for both the horse and the painting movement are the same, producing an ASL visual rhyme\u00a0based on the linguistics of ASL but focused on cherology  (or ASL Phonology) - one of those parameters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe similar idea for other three HYES ASL Rhyming Parameter series are associated with their parameters. \u00a0More examples of question-statements with those three parameters are \"Have you ever seen a lion wearing a crown?\" (focus on head location), \"Have you ever seen a train studying so hard?\" (focus on a small zigzag movement), and \"Have you seen a bird catching a ball?\" (focus on frontal palm orientation). All question-statements are meant to be nonsensical, light-hearted \u00a0and hilarious, suitable for young readers. See those four front covers of the series above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe HYES ASL Rhyming Parameter book series - four of them in total - are the cornerstone of ASL Rose. \u00a0We are aiming to have them published first, including\u00a0multimedia materials. \u00a0We also plan to publish other books such as classic fairy tales with a Deaf Culture twist, \u00a0historical and biographical stories focusing on Deaf heroes and heroines, and original stories featuring Deaf characters - each with accompanying animated videos (both signed and narrated in ASL with voice carry-over for the hearing).\u00a0\u00a0The main reason we are producing those books/multimedia materials for Deaf learners is to  have appropriate resources/ASL-written English curriculum materials available to use in their learning settings such as schools. Plus, the hearing learners would enjoy reading and learning about ASL and the Deaf culture/history, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal is to raise enough funds to cover the costs of publishing the children\u0027s books as physical copies and also the costs of hiring more artists \u0026amp; animators \u0026amp; editors to illustrate books and produce animated videos complete with sound effects.\u003cbr\u003eASL Rose is a small company and while those books will be offered as digital downloads from our Shopify store in near future, we are seeking funds to cover the costs of publishing books as physical copies you can hold in your hands along with multimedia materials. \u00a0We also seek funds to hire and pay researchers, writers, artists \u0026amp; animators, sound editors, video editors, and production staff. (Knowledge and familiarity of American Sign Language and Deaf culture/history is required.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Patrons you will get to see behind-the-scene videos of the books in process of being illustrated and animated. \u00a0When you pledge $30 dollar or more you will receive PDF version of the book as soon as it is completed, and $50 for physical copies of a complete HYES ASL Rhyming Parameter book series with video DVD set (as well as future other books/multimedia materials). \u00a0Your support will help us continue making the best books and animated videos in time to come!\u003cbr\u003e"
