    "summary": "I would not have conceived of the story concept for Jamylah and the Giants were it not for viewing Jim Vieira\u0027s seminal work. \u00a0Jim\u0027s discovery of these fascinating giants, though nearly obliterated earthly history, captivates:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/9-4sI34aIZ0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/9-4sI34aIZ0\u003c/a\u003e. \u00a0As their late nineteenth century revelation doesn\u0027t align with our own fragmented origins, they were swiftly, by the Smithsonian it is alleged; relegated to the marginalized, esoteric realm of near mythology. \u00a0Were it not for a chance conversation (or predestined) over a Thai meal in December of 2014 with my brother\u0027s girlfriend, I too might have discarded the topic altogether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt turns out one such nine foot tall humanoid skeleton resided beneath an intricately woven boulder dome on her grandparents farmland in Ohio. \u00a0She had visited it as a child and as for the identifying characteristics we confirmed simultaneously; it had double rows of teeth. \u00a0It would likely still be there today, were it not for it\u0027s removal by none other than \"government officials\" who left not a trace, as they scooped it up and drove off, never to be heard from again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my derivative story eight year old Jamylah, bumps her head triggering an out of body experience; leading headlong into the introduction of The Giants and their mysterious plight. \u00a0Through their conscription of Jamylah, a interdenominational partnership forms and so many preconceptions about life, the afterlife, earth, it\u0027s past and future take Jamylah and the reader on a giant, earthly and intergalactic journey of discovery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecifically, I think of Maurice Sendak\u0027s legendary Where The Wilde Things Are as the type of imagery and story layout; only from a birds eye, three dimensional perspective providing an immersive effect to capture the child\u0027s imagination. \u00a0The range will be thirty six to approximately forty eight pages in length.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe you\u0027ll enjoy seeing this creation come to life, and I thoroughly believe the story will prove well worth telling."
