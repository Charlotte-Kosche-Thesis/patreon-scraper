    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWELCOMING\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst I want to thank you for being here. My name is Francisco Esteban and the fact that you could be anywhere in this vast internet but somehow find yourself on here is quite amazing to me. I appreciate that. Now if for some reason you haven\u0027t seen my main video at the top please do. It will give you a pretty good idea of my work and what I`m trying to do here. If you would like to see more of my artwork I would also recommend looking at my Instagram\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/beingfe\"\u003e@BeingFE\u003c/a\u003e. Without further ado let\u0027s get right into it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA QUICK MANIFESTO\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eI. With your help I intend to become the first full time artist, that I know of, who mostly just gives away his art. \u003cbr\u003eII. You are the most important piece of this new endeavor. I will never forget that and will do my best everyday to remind you of that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIII, The community I want to create, even though it is mostly\u00a0around my art, ideally will be a space for genuine interaction, mutual inspiration and knowledge sharing.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE TRUTH\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I think the best thing I should do is explain in more detail what I am about and what I believe in as an artist. Simultaneously, I will give you all the information you need to see what this whole endeavor is about so you can decide if you want to be a part of it or not. No hard feelings if you don\u0027t. I totally get that this may not be for everyone.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eHowever if you do join please keep in mind that I will always do my best to be as transparent and keep the conversation as brutally honest as possible. This will be an ongoing thing with me and I would expect the same from you. If you think something on here can be done better... Say it. If you think an artwork is lacking substance... Express it. And if you think I\u0027m not keeping my end of the deal... Post it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA BACKSTORY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a self taught artist who\u0027s been working on my craft for over 15 years now. When I started I had no interest in selling any of my work. I became extremely obsessed with educating myself and ultimately developing a new way of painting based on my own rules, finding my own style and pushing art forward. Which is part of the reason why I still own over 300 of my artworks. Don\u0027t get me wrong though I\u0027ve sold my fair share of work in my times. My journey as an artist has been nothing short of brutally amazing. I started by doing the solo artist thing. Soon after though I started being represented by a gallery for which I eventually started putting art shows together. Working with all kinds of artists for each exhibit. Painters, sculptors, photographers, musicians, even dancers. However after learning that the owner wasn\u0027t really taking care of the same hard working artists who were helping him be successful I decided to leave and start my own artist collective. For a good amount of years we were putting on our own shows in different spaces. Some were gallery shows while others were random pop up shows or collaborations with other groups. But mostly we were operating fully independent. Curating our own shows and trying to change the art scene a bit. We were acquiring our own sponsors for events and all sorts of projects. Eventually I decided to move on from that as well since I found myself mostly organizing and making these events happen and not working on my art as much. It was a hard decision but in the end it was definitely the best one. So once again I found myself doing the solo thing. However this time my main focus was to find a new way of independently existing as an artist online. Which is why you find yourself reading this. Patreon has given me unparalleled platform to pursue this new mindset.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter all those ups and downs you may ask why would I go back to the beginning? Well that\u0027s the question of the ages. And the answer is exactly why Im here now. What I\u0027ve come to realize and want more than anything in this world is very simple. In the times we live nowadays if done correctly one can achieve success on his own terms. Along with social media, other platforms like e-commerce and very many ways of networking, communicating, creating, etc... There is no better time for one to do what one believes is the reason why one was put in this planet. I\u0027ve come a long way. It hasn\u0027t been easy. But things are clearer now more than ever. Create freely. Then find and reach out to the people who really appreciate your talents for what they are. Fully engage and truly interact with them. Finally to complete the circle of creating... Reward them. And I can\u0027t think of any other better place to do it than here on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003eFor a long time I\u0027ve been interested in creating something around my art that is a lot more meaningful than just a place to offer my artworks. Therefore with Patreon\u0027s help that\u0027s exactly what Im about to do. It consists of several elements so let me explain this to you real quick.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eONE: ReDistribution\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I have mentioned before a lot of things in this world are changing. I always wanted to really shake things up when it came to how and who would have a chance to own my art. The idea of almost anyone having a chance to own one of my pieces not depending on wether they can afford it or not is really exciting to me. And ever since my first giveaway on Instagram went to a young inspiring 14 year old kid in Australia I knew there was something special there. So by supporting me with either $1 a month or $5 a month option you could get the next artwork. The only thing the winners would be responsible for would be shipping cost. Which of course would depend on what the artwork is and where its going. International shipping will be pricier but I can always work with whoever wins to try and figure out how to keep the cost at the lowest. Even though there will be original paintings and drawings there will also be a good amount of prints and photos so that the amount of people getting artwork every month is higher.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI do apologize for the limited available ties but the ART LOTTERY concept is so unique and\u00a0bold I feel this concept will be really interesting to most of you. The ultimate goal is to be giving away thousands of dollars in art right here on Patreon to you guys. This however will only be possible if we can increase the number of Patrons significantly within the next months. So I will really appreciate any sharing you guys could do to support me in your social media profiles or any other means that you guys can think of.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTWO: Community\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIdeally I want create and cultivate a community of people not just only around my art but also around the whole idea of changing things up and challenging the status quo. I want people who can really get behind this concept, help me shape it and bring it to fruition. If we can show the world that an artist can truly live of people`s genuine support and in return is able to just give all his art away... Well that\u0027s something not only unheard of and a giant leap for artists in general. But beautifully defiant. On top of that I also want to be able to freely discuss and have conversations about all kinds of art related things like exhibits, trends, history, current events, styles, etc... So wether it\u0027s Damien\u0027s Hirst Diamond skull which if sold at the asking price of $100 million\u00a0would have been the highest price ever paid for a single work by a living artist or how Franz Kline patented a color of his own invention, which he called International Klein Blue, I would be posting a plethora of random art things for us to engage about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHREE: Interaction\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to focus on redefining the relationship an artist has with the people who support him.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThrough out all my years exhibiting artwork it didn\u0027t matter if it was a solo show, group show with a huge event involved, mural painting or smaller art festivals I always found a lack of opportunity to connect with people about my art. Just because the circumstances were just not really conducive for it. Normally at a show you would interact with people during the opening, the closing and perhaps another in between night for a \"Meet the Artist Night\" but still the time to have one on one conversations is always very limited. Even the ones who would stop by and we would talk for a decent amount of time about some of my pieces or those who actually bought a piece eventually those connections would also fade. With Patreon and some of the tools they have available like Live Q \u0026amp; A\u0027s, Polls or even Live Feed I really think I\u0027ll be able to change things a lot. Allowing me develop more in depth relationships and bringing you guys really into the fold of things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be posting quite frequent. Anything ranging from progress shots, behind the scenes footage or a random monologue I decide to record it will all go out. You can expect to be part of the process i am going through. Wether you\u0027re giving me one dollar or five dollars a month. You are all the most important part of this whole idea. So I will be engaging with you a lot and encouraging all of you to do the same. Your opinion matters to me and I want to hear it. Wether it\u0027s a general feedback on things or a more elaborate opinion about a specific piece I need all of it.\u00a0So please be in touch and no matter what happens stay brutally honest with your feedback.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever ultimately you will decide how involved you want to get.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFOURTH: Inspiration\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not just looking forward to interacting with my Patrons and bringing you the best Art that I can but also the best documentation of my creative process. The idea is to have you all be an integrate part of my new journey and simultaneously share some\u00a0knowledge and experience that I have about art. I want it to be a place where we can inspire each other, exchange ideas and learn together.\u003cbr\u003eAnd wether you\u0027re an artist yourself, someone following a passion or hesitant about following a passion or just a passionate person I hope that some of this will inspire you. Even if it comes through seeing some of my struggles or failures that comes along with pursuing your passion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY ART Universalismo Details \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me as an artist, more specifically as a painter, I always had one goal in mind... To come up with a new and different way of looking at the world. Which would in turn translate to showing people a new and different way of looking at the world. That is what a lot of the greats did and has always been my purpose in life. It\u0027s been a long long road. Full of successes and failures. A lot of times I questioned myself where this journey was taking me. However I am here now and I can confidently tell you that I have finally arrived at such a place. I have finally found this elusive yet unique perspective. And this is just the beginning.\u003cbr\u003eI assume that the obvious question you would have is \"what is it\"? What\u0027s so unique and different about how you\u0027re painting? And well that\u0027s one of the most important things I hope to share with you on here as we embark on this journey together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy are you here and why would you give me your hard earned money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is probably the most important and hardest question for me to answer on here. But I will say that if you\u0027re still reading I really appreciate you taking the time to consider being part of this new and unconventional approach to redefining the relationship of an artist and their patrons. If\u00a0you get what Im trying to accomplish on here and how this could really be a game changer I really do hope you will join me. Let\u0027s show the fine art world that things can change and that power should never be taken for granted because you never know when it may shift to the people. Wether you support me with a dollar or five dollars a month it is a significant commitment. Either way know that I\u0027ll be forever grateful for the support and contribution to this journey. If you\u0027re still not sure or have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact me anytime. Here\u0027s an email link. Thanks again and take care.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTruly Yours, \u003cbr\u003eFrancisco Esteban\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. - The last thing I want to say is that there is a lot of talented people in this world. Right here on Patreon alone. So if you decide that what I\u0027m offering is not the right fit for you I truly encourage you to take a look around and see what other artists have to offer on the Patron Network.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
