    "summary": "Hey y\u0027all, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnde here!\u00a0\u00a0I am a non binary black queer femme. I am Nigerian and an immigrant/third culture kid trying to navigate my identities in America/Nigeria. I am an artist. My pronouns are they/them/theirs.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the co owner and creator of Custom Naija, an online pop up shop selling West African print fabrics \u0026amp; accessories bought in Nigeria. My sister and I started this business because we found that a\u00a0lot of the \"African\" products and accessories available online ae made by or profit non African/ non black individuals and we wanted to make affordable products for our community while sharing our culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hand-make a variety of herbal self-care goodies + delightful sweets for the \u0259thereal BY CUSTOM NAIJA line. I am passionate about natural healing, herbs, and the connection between mental, physical and spiritual health, and I know that what we put in and on our bodies affect our wellbeing. The products I make are mostly vegan/all-natural, no harsh chemicals or additives. Purchase some of my affordable self care products to make your day feel a little more \u0259thereal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*ethereal\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0259\u02c8THir\u0113\u0259l/\u003cbr\u003eadjective\u003cbr\u003e1.\u003cbr\u003eextremely delicate and light in a way that seems too perfect for this world\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a visual artist and a poet. I have struggled for a long time with imposter syndrome, and questioned the legitimacy of my art, in a capitalist framework where we are told that we must be formally taught or produce substantial income from art for it to be considered worthwhile.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy art is my story as a queer, black, gender chameleon, immigrant, poly individual, and I want to share it with others who may relate, learn from, validate and love it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe it is my calling as a qtpoc to build and support my community and to spread love through art and herbs. As my patron, you will gain access to art and poetry not shared anywhere else, discount codes for etsy purchases, free samples on new products pre-release, CUSTOM products made just for you, and more!\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will go towards supplies used to make jewelry and accessories, herbs and other materials for body products, packing supplies for etsy shipments, printing costs of prints, product labels, business cards, domain for website, and cost of vending opportunities.\u003cbr\u003eBecause the wax print fabrics and most of the materials used to create the self care products are purchased in Lagos, Nigeria, supporting my work means supporting other black owned businesses - particularly Nigerian market women. I am very passionate about helping Nigerian women who are hustling to make a living back home. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to read about me and/or give/promote this work. \u003cbr\u003eI am grateful for patrons who support myself and other black queer/trans artists!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exx peace \u0026amp; coconut oil xx\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnde\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEtsy: etsy.com/shop/customnaija\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou can connect with Custom Naija on facebook, instagram, tumblr and twitter.\u003cbr\u003eSubscribe to our channel on youtube @ customnaija\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
