I love creating fantastic art and games that inspire us to break free from the confines of our everyday mind. It is the creative people of the past that inspired real change in our world and I am here to teach you everything I know, so we can all become the innovators we want to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gaiagamestudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GaiaArtFront2.jpg\" style=\"width: 468px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe real goal is to take all the time and energy I spend on clients and their projects, and shift that to spending it on projects we create together. It all starts with \u003cstrong\u003eart, but with purpose\u003c/strong\u003e. We are \u003cstrong\u003ecreating for specific games, projects and goals\u003c/strong\u003e, which is inherently more useful then technical skill alone. \u003cstrong\u003eLearn to create your own assets\u003c/strong\u003e by watching me harmonize illustration, graphic design and promotion for a single project. Or maybe, you want to \u003cstrong\u003edive into pixel art\u003c/strong\u003e and will follow along with the current digital game project. Perhaps you already have a board game designed and want to hear of my strategy for shipping......maybe you want some \u003cstrong\u003emarketing insights and promotional tips\u003c/strong\u003e....then request an article or a few podcasts about it.
