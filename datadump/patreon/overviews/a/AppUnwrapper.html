    "summary": "Hi there! Let me tell you why I\u0027ve started a Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing iOS game reviews, previews and walkthroughs for my website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.appunwrapper.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAppUnwrapper.com\u003c/a\u003e, since 2011. Since then, I\u0027ve had more than 25 million views and helped many a lost player escape rooms they might otherwise be trapped in forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn case you don\u0027t know, my site leans heavily towards adventure and puzzle games, because those are the games I enjoy the most. I try to write as many quality walkthroughs (\u003ca href=\"http://www.appunwrapper.com/2015/05/20/til-mornings-light-walkthrough-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003elike this one\u003c/a\u003e) and reviews (\u003ca href=\"http://www.appunwrapper.com/2015/04/17/implosion-never-lose-hope-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003elike this one\u003c/a\u003e) as I possibly can (I\u0027m only one human!). I enjoy doing this, and I want to continue doing this for a long time. I\u0027m honored that so many people think of my site first when looking for a walkthrough, and the positive feedback keeps me going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this work is very time-consuming. A single walkthrough could take several days to write, since I strive for quality and add photos and/or video (\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/2ZKt98nK-Gk\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003elike this one\u003c/a\u003e) as necessary. Unfortunately, I can\u0027t devote as much time as I have been without making some money. I do not take payment from developers for reviews because I want them to be unbiased so you, the reader, can trust me.\u00a0I do have ads on my site, but they\u0027re very unpredictable and unreliable. I also don\u0027t like bothering my readers with tons of ads, as I know how annoying they can be. I would love to be able to remove some, if not all, of those ads and offer a more enjoyable experience. I would also love to be able to hire someone to give my site a makeover so it loads faster and runs smoother. I want to continue to provide you, the readers, more of the high-quality walkthroughs and reviews you\u0027re used to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money you pledge will allow me to do all this, as well as enable me to buy more games (hence more walkthroughs and reviews) and also devote more time to writing them. If you find my walkthroughs helpful, please consider supporting me so you can see even more, including more requests. Any amount helps -- even a dollar -- and would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for listening and supporting\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.appunwrapper.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAppUnwrapper.com\u003c/a\u003e. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: A few people have brought it to my attention that they would like a way to make a one-time donation, not monthly. I\u0027ve considered using PayPal for this, but they\u0027re very clear about their donation button being only for non-profits and I don\u0027t want to violate their policies. However, if you want to make a one-time donation, you can simply cancel your monthly donations after your first payment. Patreon charges patrons at the end of every month and lets you pull out at any time. You can read more about It in their FAQ here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://support.patreon.com\"\u003ehttp://support.patreon.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
