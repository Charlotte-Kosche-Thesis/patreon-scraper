They review actual cases to identify the problems within the justice system and determine the cures.  In their quest for the truth, they seek to reverse the breakdown in public trust, alleviate the hostility on both sides, and reduce the number of senseless deaths. Both are former police officers and private investigators with more than 88 years combined investigative experience. Anyone who has been wronged by law enforcement or knows someone who has; including all minorities and ethnic groups and anyone seeking to expose the truth and effect change.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatrons will only be charged an amount they decide once per month, $1, $2, $3, $5, or $10 or however much you want to donate*** \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of our content is freely accessible on our YouTube Channel\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSVf62rE09WDfpyxbO1q41w/featured\"\u003eArchangels of Justice\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e, Your donation goes only to keeping us operational as well as growing the show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube has altered their advertising structure and independent channels have been hit the hardest. YouTube is now pulling ads and demonetizing videos deemed to be \"high risk.\" This includes channels that cover topics like corruption, police misconduct, political crimes, etc. The algorithms do not know the difference between videos that are reporting the news and videos that are deemed \"fake news\". Some channels like, \"The Jimmy Dore Show\", \"Secular Talk\" and more, have seen an up to 90% drop in their revenue. Like these channels, we do not want to sanitize our content. Now more than ever we need your support to keep these videos and podcast coming. We are not compromised by corporate money or beholden to our advertisers. We are 100% independent, progressive media bringing you the crimes and cases the main stream media will ignore by digging deeper and figuring out the real truth. This is not about being right but getting it right and justice for these forgotten victims. Please help us keep the show going!"
