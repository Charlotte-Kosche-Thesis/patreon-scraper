Patreon is a\nplatform that allows my readers to support the work that I do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ve been blogging weekly for the past four\nyears. But this past summer, I began writing full-time after having\ntaught school in Asia for three years. I did this because I sensed a hunger\namong many of my readers for more. More than what they see in Christianity,\ntoday. More than what they feel in their relationships. Even more than what\nthey are experiencing with God. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the last year alone, visitors to the blog read more than 150,000 articles.\nPeople are responding to what I\u2019ve been writing, saying I put into words what they\u2019re\nfeeling. That this blog is a place where someone isn\u2019t afraid to talk about the\ndeep, unspoken questions they wrestle with. I praise God I can be a part of His\nwork in this way, and in order to devote myself more fully to even better helping\nmy readers (doing deeper research, developing book projects, and following-up\nwith readers) I decided to make this my full-time work.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFurthermore, in order to better serve in\nwriting and ministry, I plan to begin Bible College in January of 2018.\nUnfortunately, neither Bible college nor writing cover our family\u2019s expenses,\nat this point.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you are impacted by the work that I do, if\nyou enjoy it and want to support it, I highly encourage you to do so through\nthis Patreon platform. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can see the different rewards I want to give\nout to those who are supporting my work. What I love about Patreon is it allows\nme to actually give you stuff for the support that you\u0027re giving me. I really\ndon\u0027t love just raw kind of charity for what I do; I would rather be able to\ngive you something in return. So, you can see all the different rewards there on\nthe right-hand side of the screen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=246811\u0026amp;rid=432666\"\u003eBecome a Patron today!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering becoming a patron\nof \u003ca href=\"http://asherwitmer.com/\"\u003easherwitmer.com\u003c/a\u003e.
