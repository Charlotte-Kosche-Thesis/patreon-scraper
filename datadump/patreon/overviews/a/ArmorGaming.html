    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello there\u003c/strong\u003e. Thank you SO much for making your way to the Patreon page! It means the world to me that you would even just consider donating to help our channel continue to grow. I say \"our\" channel, because, without all of your amazing and continuous support, there would be no ArmorGaming. I am incredibly fortunate to have a community of people who believe in me. Thank you. All of you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have HUGE \u003c/strong\u003eplans for future of the channel and I would like all of you to be apart of those plans.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon campaign was started in order to grow and expand the community immensely.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSome plans include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLive Streaming \u003cstrong\u003emore often;\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e3+ times a week\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlaying \u003cstrong\u003edifferent games\u003c/strong\u003e... EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUploading at least 2 videos per day so you can\u003cstrong\u003e always have something to watch.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHaving life streams with \u003cstrong\u003eLIVE CALLS\u003c/strong\u003e so all of you can literally be apart of my videos!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStreams or videos of myself playing games with people apart of the community\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(How cool is that. You\u0027ve watched my videos. Now you get to be in them!)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAaaaand of course, I\u0027m open to SUGGESTIONS FROM ALL OF YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re curious about where your donations would go:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShelter \u003c/strong\u003e- You\u0027ll be happy to know that because of you I will have a roof over my head.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFood \u003c/strong\u003e- A boy\u0027s gotta eat. But DON\u0027T WORRY! \u00a0I\u0027m extremely low maintenance. Chicken breast and brown rice is all I eat. And I only purchase chicken when it\u0027s on sale! But yeah, I need energy to produce all these videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEquipment \u003c/strong\u003e- It goes without saying that quite a bit of equipment is useful for running \u00a0a channel: desktop, laptop, mic, keyboard, etc. Now to be honest,I do already have most of the bare essentials. As the channel does continue to grow though, I would love to get better equipment in order to increase the quality of the content I am producing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClasses \u003c/strong\u003e- I used to pay for a service that taught youtubers how to grow their channels, but I couldn\u0027t continue the service due to monetary constraints. Hopefully I could start that back up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuggested Games\u003c/strong\u003e - Although I would like to only play free games on the channel, I think it\u0027s more important to play what YOU ALL want me to play, whether it be a brand new game that was just released or a free online game. I certainly think that won\u0027t be cheap. I want to be able to provide everyone with the content they want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you want to help our channel grow, there\u0027s something in it for you...some \u003cstrong\u003eREALLY COOL REWARDS! \u003c/strong\u003eI did my best to come up with rewards that will bring us closer than we already are. I really want to emphasize that this channel is more than just a channel... it\u0027s a \u003cstrong\u003ecommunity\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make an important point about donations. \u003cbr\u003eDONATE ONLY IF you believe in the channel or if you believe in me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDON\u0027T DONATE just to receive the reward, \u003cem\u003eI mean you can...
