At [A1] we want to be both. I want everyone at anytime to feel like they can contact me or anyone else in the community for anything at all, even if it is not game related.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe never require you to play anything at anytime!\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all believe that gaming should be a form of stress relief and enjoyment. Many of us have busy lives and can\u0027t game everyday or we lose interest in gaming for a few weeks at a time. We ALL understand this. I personally want you to never feel obligated to play with us or donate to us ever. Join us on your time in your own way.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnti Bigotry, Anti Stress, Anti Drama\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what we STRIVE to bring you as a member of [A1]. Our main goal is to provide a place you feel comfortable playing in with people you actually enjoy talking to. We poke fun at each other but never out of malice. We are constantly growing but I don\u0027t want anyone to feel like they are less important then anyone else. Never be afraid to message me or anyone else with ANY concerns that you may have. We\u0027ll always be here and we\u0027ll always understand. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatron \u0027Rewards\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe [A1] Community will never be \u0027pay to win\u0027 in anyway. While donating does grant you a few extra abilities such as voting on weekly bonuses it will never grant you in-game items, currency, or an edge over other players. Weekly bonuses are given to all players.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeyond the Money\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d really like to keep this thing growing and we can always use members that go that extra mile to help us continue to grow.
