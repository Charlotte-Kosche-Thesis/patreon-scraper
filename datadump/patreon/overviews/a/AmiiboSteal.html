    "summary": "When creating AmiiboSteal, our sole purpose was to inform amiibo enthusiasts of availability and news in everything amiibo. AmiiboSteal is now over a year old and we\u0027ve been able to fulfill our main goal and now we want to expand onto further projects for our community and it\u0027s members.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to expand our content on all platforms and provide more content to you all. Content is very important to us, for it takes most of our time and effort. From the moment we wake till the moment we sleep, we\u0027re constant trying to create and find news for the community. For about a year now, we\u0027ve been asked the question, do you all have a YouTube Channel? We unfortunately don\u0027t. Not because we don\u0027t have the time, but because we lack the proper equipment to do so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting us on Patreon, would not only create an income for us to provide you all with higher quality content but also expand our horizons. Everything we do is straight out of pocket, which we don\u0027t have a problem doing, but it would be great to get help! We\u0027d like to do weekly streams, playing games and hanging out with the community as a whole, create YouTube videos covering any amiibo related news, unboxings, and having our own content and images. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d like to also give back to our wonderful community. Giving back is so important to us, because without the support of our faithful followers, we would not be here today. We\u0027d like to give everyone the opportunity to engage and enter in whatever we\u0027re working on and we believe this could help tremendously. We choose Patreon because we want to be transparent with you all on where this money is going to and involve you all with fun activities we can all do together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re currently covering all amiibo related news, by doing a weekly podcast called \"The TouchBase Podcast\". We\u0027re also informing you all on our social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and our website AmiiboSteal.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a community, we\u0027d love to expand our name as a whole, and expand in everything we choose to do. All donations will be going to purchasing equipment, our website maintenance and hosting, and providing our community with amazing giveaways. \u00a0Any contribution is greatly appreciated and crucial to our growth, and we can\u0027t thank you all enough!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You -\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eJosue Ponce (Founder of AmiiboSteal)\u003cbr\u003e"
