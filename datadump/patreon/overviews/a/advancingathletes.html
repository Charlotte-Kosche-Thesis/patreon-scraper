    "summary": "Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to visit our Patreon page. We are a group of women athletes whose lives have been changed for the better by sport, and who mentor others to discover the same positive growth and empowerment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of us have competed at professional, Olympic, or elite levels, but we know from personal experience how beneficial it is to be active in any sport at any level, whether competitive or non-competitive. Physical activity benefits health and emotional well being. Participation in sport also helps forge healthy social relationships, teaches important transferrable life skills, and develops character traits that support success beyond sport in virtually any career path.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough mentorship, we help as many girls and women as possible to experience this empowerment and positive growth. It\u0027s not always an easy path to navigate on your own. There is a lot of trial and error. But the thing is, many other women have done the same thing, made the same mistakes. We are here to help others learn from our mistakes, to facilitate more positive challenge and growth and less trial and error. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat we offer (i.e. what your donations support):\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne-on-one mentorship\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOnline Q\u0026amp;A with NAA Mentors\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNAA Podcast featuring female role models in sport\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNAA Women\u0027s Clinics\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonations of any size make a huge difference to us. Not only does your financial support enable us to cover necessary costs (e.g. web hosting, state filing fees, etc), but your patronage also demonstrates to potential sponsors that people believe in and value what we do. The more patrons we have, the stronger our case when we approach potential corporate partners.
