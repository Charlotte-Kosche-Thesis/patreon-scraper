My mainpoint of interest in regards to writing, is centered on the Alternate History genre as well as speculative history, and this has included several large-scale projects as well as a a couple of short stories. I do have interest in a fair number of other ideas, including (real-world) historical fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, and others. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome time ago, I came up with a fun idea: why not write some short stories and scenarios, to keep my creative juices flowing? I figured that not only would it be fun, but it might actually even help me improve my writing skills in general. Not to mention having some real income would be great not only for this hobby, but also for real-life expenses, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what exactly do you get for being my patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, \u003cem\u003eeverybody\u003c/em\u003e who becomes a patron, regardless of how much you give, gets \u003cem\u003eexclusive\u003c/em\u003e early access to finished content; you also get to submit ideas for me to consider using for future works-I will consider every idea submitted, and you \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e get full credit for any ideas I do use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you\u0027re willing to give $5 or more a month, you \u003cem\u003ealso \u003c/em\u003eget exclusive sneak previews for future content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd with $10 or more per month, I will even be glad to collaborate with you on one or more short stories, alternate history scenarios, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn any case, thank you for visiting my page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Steve L. \u003cbr\u003e"
