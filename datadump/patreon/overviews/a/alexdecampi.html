It\u0027s a lot. I cope, but there\u0027s never enough money or time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the year I break out of comics (and out of debt), and I want you to help me with that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is to support / encourage me to finish my first prose novel, \u003cem\u003eFacsimile\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027ll be serialising chapters to backers as I go, as well as sending you other electronic, readable goodies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFacsimile\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is a story I\u0027ve been working on so long that at this point it feels more like an exorcism than a writing project. I\u0027ve filled moleskines with notes for it. I feel like I know these characters better than I know myself. But the pressure of financial survival means that I\u0027m forced to dart from project to project, nailing those invoices, and the spec work often takes a back seat. Your help, encouragement, and financial contributions enable me to spend more time on this, my passion project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is \u003cem\u003eFacsimile\u003c/em\u003e about? The concise version: a girl, a robot, and an actor, and their struggles with identity and survival. The handwavey version: it\u0027s about fandom, the uniting and destroying power of social media, fame, identity, depression, and the weird things that a life in the creative arts does to your head. Parts of it are explicit. Parts of it will probably creep you out. This is deliberate. But it\u0027s also an incredibly sentimental book, and it\u0027ll end up being a thriller, because apparently everything I write turns into a thriller without even my conscious say-so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChapters should be published monthly. The first 23,000 words are already written and out to backers. New backers will get the link to the book from the beginning, so fret not if you come in late to this. The book is going to be a behemoth, a big, sprawling epic that if it comes in under 140,000 I will be very surprised.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to talk to me on social media, I\u0027m on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://alexdecampi.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/alexdecampi\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alexdecampi/\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alexdecampi\"\u003efacebook\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t want to give me money every month,\u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/A0731GLS\"\u003e you can throw me some change on ko-fi\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
