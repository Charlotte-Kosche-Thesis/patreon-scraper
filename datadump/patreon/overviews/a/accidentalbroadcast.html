To \"location scout\" for a feature film I\u0027ve wanted to make for WAY. TOO. LONG. I thought it would be a good idea to connect a camera to my helmet and give myself audio/video notes to come back to later for said film (Jungle Boys)..\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn taking the bike out for a little \"test\" run for audio, I decided to shoot a \"motovlog\" just for fun but halfway through the ride, I crashed my bike, hurt my body, and put my ego in check. I decided to edit and upload it anyways.. Who cares? It was a silly video, and I didn\u0027t think anyone would even watch it. But you did. A motovlogger at the time (Svengalie R.I.P.) decided to share my channel to his subscribers, and the rest is history. Over 350 video\u0027s later, I have met some amazing humans and love this community to death.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill, my soul stirs to see my dreams become a reality. \"Will it ever happen\" is a line my inner voice knows all to well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247,150,70);\"\u003eEnter \"Jungle Boys\".\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJungle Boys\u003c/strong\u003e is a simple story (think Stand By Me). A coming of age film based on my life growing in Maui, Hawaii and the struggles I went through battling my own demons, major island fever, loss of friendship, loss of love, and constant struggle for my single mother trying to raise a wild \"jungle boy\". A 1978 Yamaha 2 stroke motorcycle is what changed my life forever, taught me responsibility, and pride of ownership. I don\u0027t know what would have happened did I not trade my Nintendo Entertainment System for this bike once-upon-a-time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting this patron based page, you will help me to bring this dream closer to reality. We will start out with a series of long form moto-vlogs whereby I will share my entire life with you in the most transparent of ways. You will find out how, and why I even grew up in Hawaii, you will hear about key story points that will make it to the film. (you know, all that life changing stuff and all).

It\u0027s a 2 disk set, one DVD is a tour of Hawaii\u0027s Big Island and the other is a Relaxation DVD with peaceful stationary scenes that will soothe the soul and whisk you away to paradise almost immediately. I hope this shows that I can create something from start to finish that is ready for all to enjoy. I shot all scenes, took all photos, designed all media, etc.. Fun Fact : Tim, the other main character in \"Jungle Boys\" is also on the DVD cover taking that dive for the turtle : ) You will also receive all other mentioned rewards! You will also be included in the FEEDBACK steam whereby I will give you early scene reads, etc and await your feedback on shaping this film.",

But I have had some awesome supporters that have contributed at this level or higher over the years by way of anonymous donation and this is for them. If you want to be a producer in this film, listed in the opening credits, here are two available spots. If you pledge at this level, I will put all of these monthly pledges aside for the budget of the film. If you want to talk more about how to be further involved with \"Jungle Boys\" on a business level, you\u0027ll have my number and we can discuss all details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS: of course you get all of the above + I\u0027ll probably be sending you stuff from Maui on a constant basis.
