The fact that someone cared enough to share the link and that you cared enough to click it, means SO MUCH to me.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout myself:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI do graphic design, such as: brand and team logos, album cover art, t-shirts, and sticker design. I also draw cartoon illustrations, and portraits.\u00a0The main thing that I do more than anything else, is just be a cool dude. No, I\u0027m kidding. I make beats. Like, if Alternative-Rock had a baby with Techno but Hip-Hop was the stepdaddy and raised it. I\u0027ve been collecting gear, and building my skillset for a while now. I\u0027ve been making more money from my creativity in the past year, and I thought to myself, \"Hey Self. You should start one of those Patreon things all of your successful artist friends have.\" And now look where we are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that you know who I am, here\u0027s what I\u0027d like to do. I\u0027d like to be able to dedicate more-and-more time to my craft, to keep getting better and excelling in-and-out of my comfort zone. I\u0027m incredibly uncomfortable on video (even though I\u0027m super outgoing IRL), and I\u0027d like to get used to having a camera on when I work, so that I can one day, perhaps, have the skills of an ACTOOOOR. I want you to join me on this journey of transformation, from just a dude making beats in his bedroom, to one day taking you guys on a behind-the-scenes tour of the Grammy Awards when I\u0027m nominated. ;)"
