I have been creating cosplays for 6 years and been on YouTube for 5. I used to run a gaming channel then in January 2017 decided to start an ASMR channel which has been the best thing I ever done. In my free time I study Korean language and Japanese. I am starting university in October to studying Teaching English As A Foreign Language, Linguistics and Japanese!\u003cbr\u003e\uc548\ub155\ud558\uc138\uc694! \ub9cc\ub098\uc11c \ubc18\uac11\uc2b5\ub2c8\uae4c. \uc81c \uc774\ub984\uc740 Afox ASMR\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2a4\ubb34\ud55c \uc0b4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\ub3c4\uc640 \uc8fc\uc138\uc694!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 220, 219);\"\u003e\ud83d\udc9f\nWhy have I chose patreon? \uc774 \uac8c \ubb50 \uc608\uc694?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn celebration of (almost) hitting \u003cstrong\u003e10K subscribers on YouTube and 2K followers\u003c/strong\u003e on Instagram, I wanted to create a place where I could create more videos and cosplays and just genuinely be a lot more active with everyone who has supported me so far. Patreon allows someone to support their favourite content creators through making a small monthly donation in return for additional rewards to what they already offer on day to day from their original creation space.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon donations I can put more money and time into crafting more content for everyone to \u003cem\u003ehopefully\u003c/em\u003e enjoy! The money will go towards stuff like \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(219, 238, 243);\"\u003ewigs, colour contact lenses, outfits and props\u003c/span\u003e. Along with the investment towards cosplay content I will be using the money to upgrade my ASMR channel though purchasing a \u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(219, 238, 243);\"\u003ehigher quality microphone, a tripod for more angles and loooots of different props for backgrounds to suit the theme of the video.\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor every \u00a310 I get I will put \u003cem\u003e\u00a32\u003c/em\u003e into saving towards university accommodation. I want to do this because I have chose a more expensive accommodation (even though I literally shouldn\u0027t as it\u0027s way out of my budget) because I can have a quieter building to film ASMR in. The cheapest accommodation has 12 people per floor which is crazy. The place I\u0027ll be staying has 6 people across 3 floors so I\u0027ll only be sharing the floor with 1 other person making it ideal for filming.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(127, 127, 127);\"\u003e\u274c RULES\u00a0\u274c\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eBlocked immediately for the following: (without refund)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- DO NOT repost my content.\u003cbr\u003e- DO NOT use a fake address as I will be unable to ship rewards to you.\u003cbr\u003e- DO NOT request for stuff outside of my reward plan.

I attend gaming and anime conventions such as Comic Con and EGX every year! I get to meet up with other cosplayers and my followers and have a lot of fun. I am also a \u003cstrong\u003eYoutuber\u003c/strong\u003e, previously creating gaming content which I still irregularly feature on my current channel, but now I focus on ASMR which is what my YouTube is focused on now! (\u003cem\u003eI also mix up my channel with Korean language (asmr) videos too, as I absolutely love the language and want to share it and my learning journey with the world\u003c/em\u003e) I really love helping people relax and sleep at night or unwind after a stressful day at work or school so being an \u003cstrong\u003eASMRtist\u003c/strong\u003e is a lot of fun for me. My favourite part about being a cosplayer and YouTuber is being able to communicate with other people across the world, to be able to inspire, encourage and support other cosplayers as well as make them laugh and feel happy!
