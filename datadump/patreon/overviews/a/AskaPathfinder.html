    "summary": "G\u0027day guys\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name\u0027s Michael. I am a professional Game Master(GM) specializing in Pathfinder Tabletop RPG, I work with adults and kids, hosting a large number of public and private games all year round. I am very passionate about Pathfinder and other TTRPGs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn June of 2016, I started the Ask a Pathfinder facebook page, with the intention of sharing my experiences, ideas and help other passionate and like minded gamers bring the most out of their game. The response has been great and in a short amount of time thousands were reading, contributing and engaging with me about our shared passion. At present I offered free personalized advice and coaching for those who ask, but I want to see how far I can take Ask a Pathfinder. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help and\u00a0Patreon it\u0027s my goal to expand what is now just a series of noticeboard articles and discussions into video media and establish a Pathfinder Help community, where gamers who need advice can go to get help from myself and those who, like myself, want to help others improve their skills. With regular support I will be able to establish and maintain the following planned expansions to Ask a Pathfinder Dungeon Master.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe already have an active community, a discord server hangout @\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/n9NHZzr\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/n9NHZzr\u003c/a\u003e. This is already up, running and free so swing by and meet other players and GMs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m hoping to soon become an active presence on Twitch and Youtube with Q\u0026amp;As, How-to videos, live games and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for my written articles, they will still be published regularly along with a few fun scenarios for you to get a quick RP fix. With enough support I\u0027m hoping to publish some of my own Pathfinder compatible content in the future as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll be able to turn AskaPathfinder into something really fun and entertaining.\u00a0Thank you so much for taking the time to view my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep your dice rolling \u0026amp; Your ideas brainworm free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Michael Kesavan\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
