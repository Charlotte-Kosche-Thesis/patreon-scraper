    "summary": "\u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ears PARADOXICA\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0is a monthly historical sci-fi podcast\u003c/strong\u003e. The story details the efforts of 21st-century physicist Dr. Sally Grissom, who discovers the secret to time travel when she finds herself unexpectedly transported to the site of a top-secret military experiment in 1943. Together with a team of contemporary scientists and with the support of the mysterious Office of Developed Anomalous Resources (ODAR), Sally develops her technology and fights to make sure it\u0027s used for good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show is the brainchild of writer Daniel Manning and audio producer Mischa Stanton. It began as a small audio piece in the style of a Cold War-era numbers station, broadcast (without permission) on college radio in the dead of night in 2011, and... Basically they\u0027ve been really cagey about it ever since. Slowly the cast and crew have expanded to 6 writers, 10 main and recurring cast members, and a gripping half-hour of sci-fi action and drama every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePeople who listen to us, love us. \u003c/strong\u003eThe one thing we hear the most is that once you start listening to our show, you can\u0027t put it down until you\u0027ve heard the whole thing. Each month our fans clamber for more. One fan told us:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I check out several podcasts a month, and most of them don\u0027t hold me past the first episode. Ars Paradoxica did. In fact, I listened to almost all the available episodes in one day. At work. Driving home. Driving to the game store. Driving home. You get the picture. \u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s that good... \u003c/strong\u003eThe story and characters are tremendous. Keep it up. I want more.\"\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe show is a labor of love for the creators, cast and crew.\u003c/strong\u003e This story has been cooking for a long time, among a ton of people who loved it so much they wouldn\u0027t let it go. And the only way it\u0027s turned from a late-night audio project to which we never thought anyone would listen, into an ongoing serial drama with a stable of writers and an immensely talented cast, is because every single person working on it is bursting to tell this story of time travel, government conspiracies, and the instability of the human condition.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat means finding time to write and re-write scripts, record dialogue with the cast, edit that dialogue together, and mix in sound effects. That means money spent acquiring recording equipment, hosting the podcast on Squarespace, and accessing sound libraries. That means a lot of working artists working for free to express a story they feel so passionately needs to be told.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe need your help. \u003c/strong\u003eWe want to give you an exceptional show. That means taking what we have and opening it up to new voices, new stories, and new heights. But we can\u0027t get there for free. With your help not only will you insure that the story of \u003cem\u003ears PARADOXICA \u003c/em\u003econtinues to get made, but you\u0027ll also be investing in its future. We want to keep making more episodes. We want to produce shorter, more frequent mini-sodes. We want to be able to add more music to the show. We want to bring in more writers, more actors, more creative people helping us create this thing we love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis show is free, and will remain free. But anything you can do to help us, either by donating to the show\u0027s continued future or simply by spreading the word, would help immensely. When we started we never thought anyone would want to listen to our story; that so many hundreds of fans do means the world to all of us. Thanks for listening!\u003cbr\u003e"
