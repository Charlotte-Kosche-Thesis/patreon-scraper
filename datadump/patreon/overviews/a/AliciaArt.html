    "summary": "Daily painting has changed my life and the life of those who surround me. \u00a0Everything I paint I share with my students in my art studio. My students are not only the ones with whom I share my enthusiasm for painting but also with those kids in hospitals, public schools and shelters where I go when we get extra materials, and I have sponsors, and patrons. Thanks to Harbour Island Art Walk, and On Point Center for being sponsors in 2017 as well as thanks to my private anounimous patrons. The Market at Citrus Park Mall 2018 is also a great place where I paint with kids and adults. On the other hand I have always payed for all the materials and expenses of those kids who wanted to paint. I give special discounts and free of charge art classes as well. With Patrons\u0027 support I would be able to do \u00a0volunteer work more often. Furthermore, I could share all my new Artwork as well as offer fun tutorials weekly. I have published a bilingual English-Spanish book illustrated and written by me. This book When Clotilde dreams...is only one of the dozens of drafts that I have ready to be self-published and shared with children. Painting and sharing my time with children \u00a0teaching them what I know about Art and Spanish is my passion. It is so fun to live surrounded by kids from all backgrounds and cultures."
