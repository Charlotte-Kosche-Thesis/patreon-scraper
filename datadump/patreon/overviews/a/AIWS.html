Some of my works can be found\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.aiws.lt\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, and as my patron you will receive exclusive access to my creative process. I also write a blog about neurodiversity and being autistic \u003ca href=\"http://www.aiws.lt/blog\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLonger version\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cbr\u003eFor as long as I can remember, creating art has been the only thing I truly understand. As a autistic, disabled, transgender artist, I often struggle to make sense of a world that makes no sense at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy, for example, are some species prioritized over others? Why do so many people believe that there are only two genders? Why are some people not allowed to travel as freely as people who are born in \"right\" places? Why is a person\u0027s worth determined by how productive they are? The list goes on and on...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI explore these confusing and oppressive phenomena in my art. Colours, \nlines, pens, and paper allow me to express feelings and thoughts in a way I could not\n with\n words alone. I\u0027ve written, illustrated, and self-published two books called \u003ca href=\"http://www.aiws.lt/as.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Girl Who Didn\u0027t Know How To Be\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.aiws.lt/rat.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Rat\u0027s Tale\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, as well as several \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.aiws.lt/zine.html\"\u003ezines\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003esuch as \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeuroAtypical \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I so easy to replace?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0027ve had exhibitions in the UK, Germany, and Sweden and given talks in the UK, Germany, Czech Republic, and Lithuania. I also write a \u003ca href=\"http://www.aiws.lt/blog\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e in which I challenge harmful ideas and call out ableist behaviour as well as \ndiscuss how society disables me, rather than the other way around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could not have created and shared so much of this work without the support of my generous friends, family, my patrons, and other people who believed in what I am doing.
