To write in it an honor as much as an obligation. As we protect the secrets of pen and parchment, so we protect the secrets of our history. They are passed from mother to daughter, and we are charged with recording the measure of our lives. So it was told to me by my mother, even as she taught me the letters. Someday, perhaps, I will tell my own daughter this, and she will learn to record the measure of her life, to inscribe, with reverence, the Truth of things.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo begins the story of Neala, a young woman raised in the temple at Tara among the Sisters of the Sight. On the eve of Beltaine, in her eighteenth year, her father\u0027s heritage takes her from the Sisters to the\u00a0D\u00e1l Cuinn, the Wolfsblood. There she takes her place as the\u00a0Mac T\u00edre Radharc, the Wolfsight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs she learns to navigate her new place among her father\u0027s people, training to hear and answer the moon\u0027s call, it quickly becomes apparent that it is not only her father, the high king Cormac mac Airt,\u00a0who may have plans for her future. Warring factions inside and outside the\u00a0D\u00e1l Cuinn threaten the existence of the pack she is coming to accept as her own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHer only allies are her cousin\u00a0M\u00e1ed\u00f3c, the first to show her welcome among the\u00a0D\u00e1l Cuinn, and Duana, the woman who has been tasked with teaching her the ways of the\u00a0D\u00e1l Cuinn and who was once the\u00a0Mac T\u00edre Radharc herself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeala\u0027s life, her father\u0027s honor, and her pack\u0027s future weigh on her shoulders heavily, a burden too heavy for one alone, but who should she trust to help when everyone around her seems to have their own schemes?"
