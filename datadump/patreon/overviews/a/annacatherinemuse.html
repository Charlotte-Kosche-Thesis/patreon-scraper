    "summary": "Hello Beautiful Souls, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Anna Catherine and I am a bit of an artistic and curious wanderer. Born in New Mexico where my mother ventured away from the security of her home and work in New York City to pursue her love for Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and the desire to paint open, and wild skies. We eventually found ourselves back in the city neither of us have ever been able to stay far away from. I was always obsessed with the written word, and curious about art. At five I was interested in books that showed more than pictures, and art that my mother recommended to me while I painted watercolors. On ordinary days I would dress up to trudge through the local library. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always found that I never quite fit in with my fellow gymnasts,  ballerinas, and classmates. I found High School traumatizing and spent most of my time in art class where I would draw my own brand of animated illustrations.I kept a map of Paris above my bed for years in hope for a chance to visit the city in which I always dreamt about. I wanted to read books in foreign countries, and meet people who spoke other languages. I desired desperately to see as much art as possible and to discover new possibilities. I despised working in retail but I worked hard until my lupus progressively got worse and I couldn\u0027t work at all. It was paralyzing as from the time I was a child I wanted to stand on my own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt should not have surprised me that one day I would find myself modeling for photographers, and posing for artists in New York and later in Europe where I successfully have lived my dream. Staying up late researching anyone ever mentioned to me as incredible or unique from artists, sculptors, writers, poets, and photographers. Thankfully I have a mother who is very supportive and educated in all these breathtaking individuals that inhabited my world for as long as I could remember. Modeling brought me into a world unknown to me, one that I was confused and insecure about at the beginning. A world where I felt no longer like an alien. This was liberation, not only artistically but physically. I could manage my lupus and work to feed my soul instead of being haunted by fluorescent lights. When I started working with artists privately I had the most amazing moments of clarity, of feeling I found my purpose. I stopped photographing people and places. I dedicated all my time to the one art of modeling until after several mistakes at love I picked up a camera again and fell in love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have suffered a lot of sexual harassment in the industry from the time I was eighteen to now. Most often I didn\u2019t speak out about it because I knew it was pointless. After coming forward about a crime when I was younger, where the police did nothing I became complacent about the way women have to work and edit themselves in the world. I have been conditioned to believe that my body and mind are not always my own. That things happen. The many of which I would rather not relive. I have a true passion for art, and my photography also for the success and safety of women everywhere, all over the world. I want to focus this energy through modeling, and doing my own photography. I have a desire to work with women in fashion and art who haven\u2019t  allowed themselves to be free of fear to be themselves and create the art they want to create. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping to use Patreon as an avenue to help with my photography, the cost of film, renting studios working with artists who can\u2019t afford very much but want an opportunity to create something beautiful in this crazy, wild world. Essentially I hope to share my art with you, to create a more diverse conversation about how to better the art world. As an artist myself I do not make a lot of money, and in order to do so I have to work sixty hours a week to cover my expenses which in the end leaves me with little time to take the jobs I really want to take. I would like to ease some of the pressure off myself to take every job I am offered and to have more room to explore what is out there that I can help make from a dream into a reality. How to take my own dreams and turn them into magic. I find the idea of this all rather romantic as though I can conduct my own online salon as women did in 1800\u2019s Paris."
