    "summary": "The up and coming manga series Children of God, is a story about a race of semi-reptilian, telepathic aliens called the Preh\u0027tholans, who are the descendants of their revered Lord and creator, Tartrah, a god-like being with powers beyond the imagining of his children. He is seemingly omniscient, and for eons has protected his progeny from those who would do them harm, allowing them to proliferate and establish a civilization that is well-regimented and peaceful, in which each being is read \u00a0and placed into a caste determined by their specific aptitude, and a tier dependent upon their level of telepathic ability.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur story begins on planet Orlith, where their massive city ship was forced aground following an unfortunate accident in space. It is a barren, inhospitable world where natural resources are next to non-existent, and a ravaging race of hostile insectoid creatures are none-too-thrilled about the presence of the unwelcome Preh\u0027tholans. As Lord Tartrah had always kept them safe from enemy species such as this, they did not give the Orlithians much thought as they set up their city and made with the tricky business of repairing their ship, but it is soon discovered that these terrifying creatures possess abilities much akin to their own, and it is a great shock to them when their brethren begin to fall like flies.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarehv was born of one of the few broods to be hatched during their stay on this hellish world, and is raised in the dark caverns beneath the wreckage of the ship to find life on the surface to be a living nightmare. In spite of his natural inclination toward peacefulness and his assigned role as a conflict mediator, he develops the ability to use his telepathic powers as well as his claws and fangs to fight their enemies and drive them back, but he is largely alone in this endeavor. It does not take long for the horrific acts of violence he is forced to commit in defense of himself and his brothers to begin to tear at his mind, as a lurking darkness within him that has plagued him since his early childhood little by little begins to consume him, presenting in him a danger to his people far greater than that posed by the native inhabitants.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is a story of personal struggle, rebellion, and a light that flickers desperately in oppressive darkness, of love and sorrow, full of characters you will surely fall in love with.\u00a0"
