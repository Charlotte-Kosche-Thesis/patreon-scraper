My name is Frank and I am a non-binary trans person from Wales, UK and I write and make imagery about \u003cstrong\u003equeerness, magic, the spaces between things and general weirdness\u003c/strong\u003e - and it\u0027s often darkly humorous. I\u0027m a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.frankduffy.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eprofessional illustrator and graphic designer\u003c/a\u003e who\u0027s in the second year of an MA in Illustration: Authorial Practice at Falmouth School of Art. I\u0027m using this space on Patreon to create, explore and share the more personal, strange and experimental work I make - writing and imagery - sign up to join me on the journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a kind of crowdfunder, but instead of funding for one specific thing, \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u0027re supporting art that you want to see created\u00a0- from as little as $1 a month\u003c/strong\u003e. Currently\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/all-about-this-15585813\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI\u0027m working on an illustrated book of short stories\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u0027ll be sharing words and images from those, but also unrelated imagery and fiction and thoughts. I\u0027m aiming to post once a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support means I can focus on creating queer art. I make some money as a freelance illustrator and designer but it\u0027s very variable, often stressful and always precarious. I lost two big clients when I came out as trans. You becoming my Patron allows me a regular income and that makes a huge difference to me and I\u0027m really very grateful. There are some pretty cool perks too - check out the rewards - and of course, \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u0027ll be a really big part of making sure that diverse voices get heard\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much :D\u003cbr\u003e"
