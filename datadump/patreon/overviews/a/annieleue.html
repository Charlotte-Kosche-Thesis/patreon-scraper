    "summary": "I believe my role as a designer in the world in 2017 is to create pieces of communication that \u003cstrong\u003emotivate, inspire, delight, and effect change\u003c/strong\u003e on a large scale. The format varies from humor writing to politically-motivated pseudo-performance art, depending on the topic at hand. I\u0027m just full of surprises. But as a graduate student, I lack the funding to fully achieve my goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy current project \u003c/strong\u003eis an artists\u0027 book tackling the issue of gun control in America. My plan is to compile every piece of gun control legislation, both passed and failed, since 1991 in chronological order. The failed legislation will be differentiated from passed legislation through paper color: failed legislation on grey paper, passed on white. Peppered in by date throughout the book will be all of the mass shootings that have occurred within the same time period (for a sense of scale, there have been over 1,500 since 2013 alone). The book will act as an interactive data visualization, showing every bit of congress\u0027s inefficacy to make any lasting changes to this country\u0027s gun violence epidemic. The data gathering alone is more than a one-woman job, so payments through here will allow me to hire some help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOngoing projects \u003c/strong\u003einclude Anxiety Tarot, a set of tarot cards designed and written by me with the express goal of opening up the conversation around mental illness in a low-pressure, casual environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny support is greatly appreciated!\u003cbr\u003e"
