    "summary": "HEY HEY HEY!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am - this is the beginning of a whole new way of releasing music for me - and I\u0027m really excited to have you guys be a part of the experience. If you\u0027ve come all the way here to check out my stuff, I wanna already thank you for your support, no matter how big or small, because it\u0027s you that will make all this possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know your time is precious, so I\u0027ll briefly give you an idea of what it is that I\u0027ll be releasing, and then for those of you who aren\u0027t already familiar with Patreon itself, and want to find out more about how it works,\u00a0just keep on reading all the way \u0027till the end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo -\u00a0I\u0027m a musician, therefore making music is my priority, but I\u0027ve recently come to discover the power of creating content on \u003cstrong\u003eYouTube\u003c/strong\u003e, so I will be making little movies to go with each song I release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRBaQ9VbyadwLx-AsJhw02g\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EKvt1idqXxY/maxresdefault.jpg\" style=\"width: 629px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure, some might call them music videos, and as much as I can see how you might think that, I feel like there\u0027s a difference at least in the way I\u0027ll be approaching these films - in the sense that they won\u0027t just be promotional videos for the song, but the two elements will actually be an integral part of one another, and will come to life as one single entity, if that makes any sense..\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s harder to explain it than what it actually is, so hopefully you (and me too!) will get a hang of it once I start releasing them, and everything will become crystal-clear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne very important thing to remember is that everything I\u0027ll be creating will always be \u003cstrong\u003eFREE\u003c/strong\u003e for you and everyone to watch - so you shouldn\u0027t look at your pledge as a way of \u003cem\u003epaying\u003c/em\u003e for the content, but actually as a way to contribute and be an integral part of the creation of something that (hopefully) will bring people some happiness and inspiration, through the power of music and film.\u003cbr\u003e(I know, it does sound a little corny, but that\u0027s the best I could think how to describe what\u0027s going on.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of the paid paid content I\u0027ll be releasing here, and the Patreon-only exclusive stuff, I\u0027ll also be putting out more frequent \"musical movies\" (I\u0027m thinking of them as some kind of M-Vlog at the moment, if that\u0027s even a thing) on my YouTube channel, as well as some covers of some of my (and why not, your) favourite songs - I\u0027m aiming at doing a cover every two weeks, and one of the other videos every week.... It might take a little while to settle into this pretty hectic schedule, but hopefully we\u0027ll be able to get there with time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why your support could really make an incredible difference to how often I\u0027m able to release new work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings us to...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://sarahburrini.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/patreonlogo.png\" style=\"width: 469px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, you probably at least have an idea of how this works, but if not - lemme give you a quick reminder:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn itself, it\u0027s somewhat like \u003cem\u003eKickstarter\u003c/em\u003e, and all those other crowdfunding platforms, but there\u0027s one fundamental difference - and that is that, instead of pledging a one-off sum\u00a0to help reach a huge amount for a single project, you guys (the fans, or in this case, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003epatrons\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e) have the opportunity to contribute however much or little you feel comfortable with (seriously, it can be even $1) on an ongoing basis, so that creators like myself can continue to put out the work that you love and enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlso, doing things this way, allows us to create a strong community, where your input and ideas are extremely valuable - you can give me suggestions on what you\u0027d like to see and hear, and as long as it\u0027s within my means, I\u0027ll be very happy to make it happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s not forget also that your support, as well as being wildly appreciated, won\u0027t be for nothing: depending on how much you choose to kindly give, there\u0027s a whole range of rewards for you, as a gesture of my gratitude - you can find out all about those in the column here on the right \u00a0\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, as you might\u0027ve noticed in this other column here on the left, I\u0027ve set out a series of goals that I hope to achieve along the way with your support, and reaching every one of them will only mean that I\u0027ll be able to provide you guys with increasingly professional, and all-round awesome content!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vUI5d-BIp4E/V5fdfIKHypI/AAAAAAABpCs/Q5Dk_3eWFJc1C5vHeoNQAFPH_c8PGyh-gCLcB/s1600/7-400.png\" style=\"width: 108px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eNow - you may or may have not noticed that both the goals and the rewards are - in both number and value - in multiples of SEVEN.. (I was even going to give this page a name that had something to do with it, but then I just decided to go with my name).\u00a0This is because I\u0027ve always had some kind of fascination/fixation with the number - it\u0027s had a magical and extremely symbolic role throughout history - and I thought it would be a quirk that would add an extra \"layer\" to the whole thing, and make it a little more interesting.. I might even make a movie about \u003cstrong\u003e#7\u003c/strong\u003e further down the line, if it\u0027s something you\u0027d wanna see - let me know what you think, either here or on my social media, and if you think it\u0027s a good idea, then we can see to doing something about it..\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I mentioned earlier, your support could be either monthly, or per creation... I decided to go with the \"\u003cstrong\u003eper creation\u003c/strong\u003e\" option, so this way, you would only get charged whenever I actually release something! If for some reason I wasn\u0027t able to put anything out one month, then nothing would come out of your account.\u003cbr\u003eAlso, you can set a \u003cstrong\u003emonthly\u00a0cap\u003c/strong\u003e on how much you\u0027re willing to spend - so if instead for some reason I found myself in a whirlwind of inspiration, and decided to put out a whole bunch of songs one month, then you would only pay up to what you\u0027ve decided.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is, in a nutshell, how Patreon works - I really can\u0027t wait to get the ball rolling, and hope you\u0027ll have as much of a great time watching what I\u0027ll be creating, as much as I\u0027ll have making it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil the next time,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/MqnKaCo9n3g/hqdefault.jpg\" style=\"width: 564px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLUV\u003cbr\u003eA.M. x\u003c/div\u003e"
