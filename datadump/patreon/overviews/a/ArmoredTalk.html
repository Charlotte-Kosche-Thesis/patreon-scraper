I may cover other games on occasion, but I will stay away from politics, religion, and all those hot button topics that are substantive in real life. Why? Because I want Armored Talk to be an entertainment site. This is meant to be a break from the everyday world for my visitors.

I\u0027ll use any support I get to make Armored Talk better and reach out to YouTube and other platforms. This will allow me to better connect with players and grow the content offered by Armored Talk\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e What you get\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides a warm fuzzy feeling? You will know you are supporting Armored Talk (enabling it to grow and flourish)!

But I am back now with a vengeance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope Armored Talk will help people gain an interest in game playing through my passion. The main focus will be Armored Warfare and in real life modern vehicles (hey, \u003cdel\u003eyou\u003c/del\u003e I have to learn about what I am driving!) but there may be a few surprises sprinkled in here and there. I don\u2019t know if it will require another blog or not, but I may subject you to some board game news. As my favorite quote may indicate, games are at my core and in my soul.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFavorite quote:\u00a0We do not quit playing because we grow old, we grow old because we quit playing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat else. Oh yeah, what I do/did for a living. While I have degrees in mathematics and history, my career took a different turn. After a brief stint in teaching, I moved into Information Technology. Yes, that is a big field with many different specializations, but I did most of them. Among other things, I have been a technology director, programmer, systems analyst, web designer, security officer (the tech kind, not the guard dog kind although they are similar at times), and consultant. But now I am all yours. Ok, I still do freelance work when I \u003cdel\u003ewant to\u003c/del\u003e can get it, as well as serve on my local library board.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me in my adventures to bring happiness to the masses through games and a positive attitude.\u003cbr\u003e",
