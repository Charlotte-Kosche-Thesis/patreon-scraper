    "summary": "Writing about movies (and television, and everything else) is easy; writing about why I write about those things is a little harder. After I was recently shown the door at a long time job, a number of people were nice enough to say nice things about me as a way to encourage me to keep writing. Was that a good idea? Let\u0027s find out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs someone who\u0027s written a lot for free - and a lot more for practically nothing - over the years, the only way I could set this up was totally arse-backwards: all the reviews here are free and if you want to throw some money my way I\u0027ll be extremely grateful. And you\u0027ll be directly funding more of this kind of thing, as while reviewer movie screenings are free, traveling 70-80 kilometers to get to them is most definitely not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, if you do decide to sign up, you\u0027ll get exclusive access to the darkest secret of my writing career: for over twenty years I wrote at least one, often two and sometimes three regular \"humour\" columns for Geelong street paper \u003cem\u003eForte\u003c/em\u003e under the name \"Tony Montana\". Despite being popular enough that I received actual through-the-post letters (mostly legal threats from the town council), these columns were never collected, reprinted or put online. Until now! I\u0027d like to say I\u0027m only going to use the least embarrassing ones but they\u0027re all embarrassing, especially the thousand-word rants about the price of vodka in 2006.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI tend not to take entertainment (and my opinions about it) too seriously, so hopefully at least some of what\u0027ll be appearing here will strike some of you as funny. At a time when even the popular arts are often expected to tackle the kind of serious social issues that used to be the domain of politics, my views remain resolutely lowbrow and simplistic. Which is fortunate, as so are most of the movies I see (often even the award-winning ones). Let\u0027s get criticisin\u0027!\u003cbr\u003e"
