I\u0027m Ariane Arsenault, the owner of\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.lafilledelamer.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLa Fille de la Mer, Savonnerie Artisanale\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e which means \"\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaughter of the Sea, Handmade Soaps\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\". After 15 years in the soapmaking business, I have specialized in both Cold Processed and Melt \u0026amp; Pour soaps as well as other cosmetics. I am also known for my\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/AudreeSoluna\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoutube soapmaking channel\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e where many soapmakers go for inspiration and to learn tips and tricks. I was published in the collective \u201cNaturally Saponified, An International Gallery of Artisan Soaps\u201d and I am an occasional contributor with Modern Soapmaking and Lovin Soap. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very active on social media and soaping forums. Besides soapmaking, I am the mother of three beautiful children, I live in the Magdalen Islands, I love gardening, being outdoors and I would love to travel to see the world a little more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years now, I have been receiving emails from many people who look up to me and want some help to learn to make soap or start a soapmaking business. I didn\u0027t really know what to do with this, because I didn\u0027t offer these kind of services or counselling! Ideas have been rambling in my head and I realized Patreon would be a great place to create content and help those who have been seeking coaching, consulting and how-to\u0027s in the soapmaking area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is where I will ask you to JOIN PATREON!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI really wish to help others and I\u00a0believe\u00a0you should learn how to make soap properly!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I would love to do this for free, but as I have bills to pay and mouths to feed, \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is YOUR opportunity to give back to creators\u003c/strong\u003e like me, who spoil you with amazing content, by doing what we do best! With your support, I will be able to offer you tools to start your soapmaking journey, whether it is just a hobby you wish to learn or if you want to turn this into a real job! I will also be giving intermediate and advance tutorials to fit everyone\u0027s needs as soon as I reach my goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/strong\u003e Patreon is a way to join your favorite creator\u0027s community and pay them for making the stuff you love. Instead of \u003cem\u003eliterally\u003c/em\u003e throwing money at your screen (trust me, that doesn\u2019t work), you can now pay a few bucks \u003cem\u003eper month\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to help your favorite creators.  For example, if you pay $1 per month (I\u0027m not kidding! I\u0027m really serious and grateful if you do!), then your card gets charged a total of $1 that month.  This means the creator gets paid regularly (every month), and you become a bonafide, real-life patron of the arts.  And imagine your favorite creators \u003cem\u003emaking a living\u003c/em\u003e doing what they do best\u2026 because of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging monthly, you are helping me create new content for you and everyone else to enjoy! I will be able to keep making free videos on my Youtube channel, but you will be able to have a VIP access to all my new learning material. You can manage, change or quit your pledge at any time, and I will be grateful for whatever you could give. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eB\u003cstrong\u003ee a patron today, you\u0027ll be glad you did!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
