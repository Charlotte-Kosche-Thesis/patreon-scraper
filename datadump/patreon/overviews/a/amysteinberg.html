I sing, act, teach, write, play and live the life of an artist. My whole existence is about creating abundantly and teaching others to live and move in their creativity. It\u0027s who I am, and my family and fans have supported this life of mine for awhile now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FWcxKehDrxk\" width=\"420\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou come to my shows, purchase my art, download my music. You have Kickstarted 2 cds for me, GoFunded (and continue to...) my original musical about teen struggles,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eBreaking the Moon\u003c/em\u003e, which was a success at the New York for the New York Musical Festival and continues to be performed all over the country. You are the reason I do what I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd now, I\u0027m asking for a different kind of support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis PATREON website is a new kind of opportunity for artists like me. It is a way for my fans and friends to help me as I continue along this wild journey of making music and art. The idea here is that you become a PATRON of my ART!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u00a0offer a contribution monthly, however big or small, supporting me as an artist and you will receive blessings for your giving. I\u0027m still learning about how this works, but I\u0027m excited about trying it out with you! Thank you for considering joining my journey in a consistent, faithful way. I kind of figure, if all my fans contributed $3-5 a month (the cost of a coffee), I could easily pay my bills and live in a way what would free me up to finish a bunch of things I\u0027ve worked on forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is so much for me to work on. I\u0027m finishing up 2 novels, starting work on a new music collection, working on getting Breaking the Moon into colleges and high schools, developing an idea for an art show, and more and more and more. I want to be able to create on a daily basis without living in any kind of financial fear.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI teach part time, which I love very much, however, I\u0027m slowly starting to teach less because it is an attention-splitter. I would love to subsidize my income with your patronage to help me focus completely on being a creator.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering helping me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
