Thanks for your continued support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHO ARE YOU?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Arvan Eleron, a writer and gamer, and I\u0027ve been streaming on Twitch TV at \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/arvaneleron\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.twitch.tv/arvaneleron\u003c/a\u003e since 2012, learning what makes Twitch the coolest thing online: community and connection.\u00a0 Over the past three years I\u0027ve streamed over fifty full games, from action adventure titles like Assassin\u0027s Creed to RPGs (my favorite) like Pillars of Eternity.\u00a0 I\u0027ve also conducted a host of interviews on my channel with developers from a whole variety of companies, from Shadowrun Returns\u0027 Harebrained Schemes to Pillars of Eternity\u0027s Obsidian.\u00a0 But most important, we\u0027ve built a community of nearly three thousand smart, fun and caring people--the Arvanauts--who make the experience of gaming an incredible joy. I\u0027m working towards partnership on Twitch, and so many people have asked that I thought the time had come to take the channel to the next level with this Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCOOL.\u00a0 WHY SHOULD I SUPPORT YOU, AND HOW DO I DO IT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause community matters, and I think we\u0027ve created one of the very best ones on Twitch.\u00a0 From the moderators to the regular viewers to the new folks who come in every day, we treat every Arvanaut with respect and compassion, and the family atmosphere is one of the things we value most.\u00a0 Everyone is a valuable part of what we do.\u00a0 Of course, streams on my channel are entertaining and fun--but they\u0027re also designed to make you think, and through our discussions with some of the biggest gaming developers and authors in the field we strive to do just that.\u00a0 But creating a place for all of that costs time and money--for equipment, games, and other enhancements to the streaming and viewing experience--and I want to demonstrate the support the channel has to the powers that be at Twitch as we move towards partnership.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where this Patreon comes in.\u00a0 Most important of all is simply your presence in the channel as one of the Arvanauts.\u00a0 But if you\u0027re able and willing to do more, whether it\u0027s $1 or $10 a month, you\u0027ll help support the channel\u0027s upkeep and development and demonstrate the support the channel enjoys...and you\u0027ll get some cool goodies as well.\u00a0 Check out the pledges below, the milestone goals to the left, and tune in to every broadcast at \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/arvaneleron.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.twitch.tv/arvaneleron.\u003c/a\u003e  And thanks so much for the support! \u003cbr\u003e"
