I work as an antispeciesist feminist in academia and activism trying really hard to dismantle power relationships between white, masculinist, ableist people and the humans they oppress on the one hand, as well as the domination of humans over animals on the other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I am working working on contributions to some awesome vegan feminist work as well as two projects I created:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Editing a volume for/by vegan educators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Rewriting my PhD Thesis for publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter having finished my PhD on \u0027Antispeciesist Theory and Action: Dismantling the (Hu)man\u0027 and scraping by on teaching under 0-hour contracts, I now embark on an adventure towards independence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my work I write and speak about how to recognise unjust power relations, how to resist the oppressor and especially how not to be transphobic, racist, homophobic, ableist or otherwise oppressive ourselves. Antispeciesism is always part of any talk (or series of talks) I give.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also produce content that exposes problems within the animal liberation movement, so as to make it more accessible and safe for people who aren\u0027t hypermasculine white guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing draws on my activism and vice versa. I learned a lot from the animals I have lived with in the past decade and my relationships to them and fellow humans have changed a lot through the theory I have been exposed to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am happy to give talks and workshops or contribute to publications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for your support.\u003cbr\u003e"

Her main goal is to disrupt and dismantle kyriarchy (which translates into the reign of the master), be it hidden in patriarchy, racism, ableism, speciesism or any other form of oppression.\u003cbr\u003eDuring graduate school Agnes taught in the fields of Media and Communication Studies as well as International Relations and found space for anti-oppression work in most subjects she offered. Both her activist and scholarly/teaching work explore the process of animalisation and dehumanisation, and by extension what it means to be human, or rather human-enough in white, able, masculinist capitalism.\u003cbr\u003eWhen she is not busy reading or writing, giving talks and workshops, she is either organising with the \u003ca href=\"http://antispeciesistcollective.wordpress.com/\"\u003eAnti-Speciesist Collective\u003c/a\u003e or accompanying the animals she lives with to the forest.\u003cbr\u003e",
