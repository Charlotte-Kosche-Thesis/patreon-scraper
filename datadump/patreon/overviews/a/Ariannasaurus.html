    "summary": "Hello there and welcome! I go by the name Ariana (or just Ari, if you\u0027d like) and I\u0027m a novice artist who\u0027s attempted various media pretty much since childhood. Even though I like doing various artsy things whenever I have the time, I am currently focused on polymer clay art and my Etsy shop,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/WildTreasury?ref=seller-platform-mcnav\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWild Treasury\u003c/a\u003e, which features hand sculpted jewelry and accessories mostly inspired by the Warcraft universe. This inspiration is mostly drawn from ingame landscapes as well as from real nature, all combined with a personal twist for a final result as unique as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a regular 9-6 day job and usually work on my art during most evenings and the weekend. I am 100% self-taught and always eager to expand my horizons, but of course I still have LOTS to learn- and that\u0027s where this Patreon comes in. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me here, you will be helping me grow and succeed as a clay artist while gaining access to my WIP\u0027s, sketches, polls, discounts and more. Funds are used to purchase supplies and tools, which can get quite costly at times. Any pledge amount is deeply appreciated and I\u0027ll be forever grateful.\u00a0You can also cancel your pledge at any time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, you don\u0027t need to become a patron to see my art, as finished projects will always be shared on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Ariannasaurus\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/wildtreasury\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ariannasaurus.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.wildtreasury.net\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.
