I\u0027ve started playing Hearthstone even before the release of the game, after receiving the beta key from one of my YouTube viewers. Since then I\u0027ve learned how to consistently climb the constructed ladder (multiple top 50 finishes) and got the infinite arena cycle rolling - earning the vast majority of my cards and gold through that game mode. I consider myself a coach first and a player second. Coaching and helping people keeps me much more engaged and I\u0027m passionate about sharing my knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eI started coaching Hearthstone in 2014\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Before that, I\u0027ve had some experience coaching StarCraft 2 and an immense amount of hours spent reading and researching the methods and psychology behind improvement. I love teaching and giving advice that helps people to become better at the games they play and compete in. I\u0027ve spent countless hours answering people\u0027s questions and clearing up important concepts for them individually, but I found that most people had similar issues which could be addressed by writing a comprehensive guide - that\u0027s how my e-book came about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m putting my time and energy into\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003ecreating YouTube videos and one-on-one coaching with Hearthstone players.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eWith your support I would be able to start doing it full time and create more resources as well as give more of my attention to people who want to improve.
