    "summary": "Hey, so I\u0027m a twenty-year-old, disabled, community college student who is studying Sociology. My pronouns are they/them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing\u00a0since the second grade. I grew up reading historical fiction and nonfiction books; however, more recently, I have grown interested in science-fiction and fantasy. My works have diversity in orientation, gender, class, religion, size/body, ethnicity/race, and disability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have completed one high fantasy, short story called\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eDown Dirty \u003c/strong\u003eand one teen fiction, romance flash story called\u003cstrong\u003e Standing with You\u003c/strong\u003e. I am currently writing an action-adventure, simulated-reality series, called\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eNetworked \u003c/strong\u003ethat is currently under hiatus. Furthermore, I am writing a four-part, urban fantasy, new adult series called \u003cstrong\u003eThe Chronicles of Plagos City\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0about the magical and political events that unfold a sovereign, city-state.\u00a0I am also developing a post-apocalypse, sci-fi series that takes place five-hundred years after the decline of western society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides writing, I also choreograph contemporary dance pieces, freestyle hip-hop dance pieces,\u00a0 and edit graphic media (websites, pictures, videos). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I using Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTL;DR:\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s difficult for me to get traditional jobs because of my disability, location, and situation. I am entirely dependent on my family, but my family is in the same financial rut that we have always been in for years. I need money. I want to share my talents (writing, dancing, design, editing) with people who are interested. I would like to be compensated for my talents.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExtended Version\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up, academics have always been something I understood. I wasn\u0027t necessarily good at it, but it was something I was used to and I understood. Writing, English classes, and foreign language classes (mostly Japanese language classes but also Spanish) were the only things I was exceptional at. It was a big thing for me because I loved reading, writing, and learning about different languages and cultures. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I mentioned earlier, I wrote stories in elementary school, and that followed over in middle, high, and until now. The pages were first handwritten--it was common for me to write five pages of stories on the front and back of the paper, but then, as I grew to know about computers, I started typing my stories. I published some works on old, and now deleted, accounts on Fanfiction sites. I have a blog up on \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://afroenby.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWordpress\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (click the bolded word for the link) where I uploaded some of my writing and another on \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ameblo.jp/tyleashin/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmeblog\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (click the bolded word) for pieces in Japanese. During my senior year in high school, I transferred to Texas, and I was in a journalism class where I could write editorials and news pieces for my school\u0027s newspaper organization; currently, I\u0027m in the process of transferring that over to my Wordpress blog. I discovered about Patreon from the Twitter community, and I realized that its function was something that is useful for me. I can create content, and other people can pay me however much they want or can, and for that, I can reward them with even more content. Or, for people who can\u0027t pay, they can just follow me, and they can get content that I post just to post. I think that would be an exceptional way for me to get paid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn to answering the question, as I stated earlier, I only knew academics best, and I also have social communication problems. Besides having debilitating anxiety, I also struggle with blending myself into social culture. Most of the time, I\u0027m off to myself and observing the public. I have volume issues where I speak incredibly low, and forcing myself to speak louder drains my energy. This travels over to when I\u0027m interviewed for retail and fast-food jobs (something very basic and simple; they just want you to arrive on time and get along with the employees and customers, right? They\u0027re obviously not looking for that with me). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI freelance on Upwork, Rat Race Rebellion, and IAPWE for writing projects. Since those consist of mostly proposals, I wanted to navigate here where I can post freely about what I want and get recognized/paid for the content that I feel liberated into writing. Patreon and freelance jobs are convenient and beneficial for me because I struggle so much with social communication and social anxiety. For those jobs, it\u0027s my work, my writing, that gets viewed, and I can work for them and get paid. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Patreon, I can post content of my choosing, and I can get feedback and financial support from an audience. This is crucial for me. So, thank you for supporting me. I hope that my content does make you feel something. I hope to move people and entertain them. This is crucial to my survival in this capitalist world, and it\u0027s also my gift to the world--writing!\u003cbr\u003e"
