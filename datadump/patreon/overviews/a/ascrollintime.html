I love the connection that comics have in popular and general culture. I love witnessing the effect they have on society, and how cultures treat them so differently. \u003cbr\u003eI want to discuss this. I want to explore and understand the significant impacts and ways comics have influenced American and Japanese societies. And I want to take you all with me... Please help me realize this dream of vocalizing my inner passions for comic academia and understanding the impact they have shown, as well as asking questions along the way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA bit about me: \u003cbr\u003eI was introduced to Japanese anime at a young age. Before I knew what \u0027anime\u0027 was, I knew it was different from other cartoons, and I was hooked, as was a whole generation. Later, I learned the America\u0027s own comic past which had a very different result. \u003cbr\u003eI want to explore these differences across cultures and share what I find.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, I would love to use this blog as a stepping stone to learning enough on the subject to warrant writing a book or two. I have so many ideas in mind! I would greatly appreciate your help in achieving this goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
