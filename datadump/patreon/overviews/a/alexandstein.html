    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Alex Stein and I\u0027m a mentally ill, queer programmer who does a variety of things ranging from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://alex-makes-of-the-art.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eart and photography\u003c/a\u003e, to\u00a0programming, to\u00a0music. I\u0027m also interested in a number of topics like\u00a0science and technology, writing, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://alex-grows-pomegranates.tumblr.com/\"\u003eurban gardening\u003c/a\u003e\u2013 which is currently my main focus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past year or so I have gotten deeply into gardening and botanical practices and I have been thinking about how I could use this to benefit the community around me and make it more accessible, particularly in the context of a city like Seattle and the greater Pacific Northwest area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of this has entailed anything from growing seed for fun collected from supermarket fruits to taking note of potential local resources that could be used for other people looking to begin gardening themselves, and logging my own processes I\u0027ve used to get started. I also help run the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/rainbowrootsseattle/\"\u003eRainbow Roots Seattle\u003c/a\u003e Facebook group, which is an LGBTQ+ group focused on gardening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would also like to help establish populations of unusual or uncommon plant species and cultivars to the area, or at least test out their viability in the PNW area so that others can grow them as well, which range anywhere from purely ornamental succulent-types, to things that have culinary uses like a current project of mine, the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertensia_maritima\"\u003eOyster Leaf\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s also fun to be able to say that you have papaya plants laying around the house that you can say that you raised from fruits found in the Fred Meyer produce aisle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/aadf19a07a1e239825920358bacd07a5/tumblr_p6ywepctO61wfk407o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides general support for living, funds with be used to make it easier to purchase supplies like soil, potting, seeds, lighting, etc. so that they don\u0027t eat into the other funds quite as much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also currently in the grind of getting myself established post-graduation and am currently employed in food service, so I\u0027m setting this up in case anyone wants to help with financial support while I get my bearings and help me go through with my endeavors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for any support! Goals will be updated once I think of some. Feel free to suggest some! Particularly related to plants since I\u0027m open to ideas as to how to give back."
