    "summary": "Hello!! My name is Robin and I do a weekly podcast called \u003cstrong\u003ePod Your Own Adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here there\u0027s a good chance you know what this podcast is about. If you don\u0027t, here\u0027s the elevator pitch. Each episode a guest and I read through a different multiple-path gamebook. I do the reading, the guests make the choices, and we both provide jokes and insight. It\u0027s a lot of fun to record, and I have received confirmation from more than one person that it\u0027s fun to listen to as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is the bit where I\u0027d like your help. I\u0027ve got a fairly sizeable collection of books, but the amount I can read gets smaller with each episode that comes out. I\u0027d like to buy better recording equipment, and I\u0027d like to record more episodes face to face instead of over Skype.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had a lot of great guests on so far. People like \u003cstrong\u003eDamian Sommer\u003c/strong\u003e - co-creator of The Yawhg, \u003cstrong\u003eRyan North\u003c/strong\u003e - writer of Dinosaur Comics and the Adventure Time comic books, and \u003cstrong\u003eJon Blyth\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- writer and part of the Regular Features podcast. Your support means I\u0027ll be able to travel more frequently and record with more people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve turned to Patreon because, considering the alternatives, I feel this is the most honest option. Patreon allows you to pledge your support with each episode that comes out. Simply choose a value, and when an episode is released every Tuesday the website automatically sends that money through to me. I\u0027m just one guy, and some of the things I\u0027d like to do with this show are going to take more than a little time to prepare. Like live shows! It\u0027s only with your support that I\u0027ll be able to put these together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support, thank you! You\u0027ll be able to vote on upcoming books for us to read through on the show. Not only that, but I\u0027ll be starting a Democracy Adventure. At the end of future updates I will be reading out a passage from a book, and if you pledge weekly then you can vote on where the story goes. You\u0027ll also get priority access to all future live shows, I\u0027ll let you know one week in advance before the event goes live to everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to donate more, fantastic! For five dollars a week, I will do a dramatic reading for you. Send me a message and every couple of weeks I\u0027ll be happy to read whatever you want out. Fan-fiction, voice-overs, marriage proposals. I\u0027ll do most of it! (within reason - I reserve the right to turn down some stuff).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0027t worry about the show.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m not going to put it behind a paywall or create premium content that only patrons can see. I\u0027m going to keep doing what I\u0027ve always been doing, but with your help I\u0027ll be able to do more!\u003cbr\u003e"
