No matter what I did, there was always going to be someone better than me. But as I grew up, I began to understand that the definition of best is completely open to interpretation. There are as many different definitions of the best as there are individuals on this Earth. So I began to realize that the only way to truly be the best at something is to be the only one doing it. So for me, that just meant that\u00a0\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"\u003eI have never existed before now, soI want to make music that has never existed before now. I can\u0027t express how insanely stoked I am to have a venue like Patreon to be able to share it with you. I love individuals, and I\u0027ve learned during the course of my life that the best way to inspire someone to be an individual is to show them it\u0027s possible to be an individual. And in a world where it can seem impossible to be an individual, I want to show people that the only definition of the best they should ever be worried about is their own. If you feel any truth in these words, I could really use your support. You have my word that I will work as hard as I possibly can to being you guys the best music I can dream up. My success will be proof that individuality can exist in this world. Steve Jobs once said, \"The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones that do.\" So with that said, I would like to cordially invite you to be a part of my insanity. If it\u0027s crazy to think in ways no one has before, then I\u0027m going to go crazy, and bring as many people with me as I can. \u00a0\u003c/span\u003e"
