    "summary": "Modeling is my hobby and acting is my dream, but most modeling gigs around here are with people who, like me, want to create art but can\u0027t afford to pay, and acting gigs require auditions that have me traveling out to Seattle, or even Oregon! All of the expenses for time and travel come out of my pockets, which aren\u0027t very deep since all of my income goes toward supporting my 3 daughters. (Yes, I actually have 3 kids and I know I don\u0027t look like it.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where Patreon comes in... In exchange for your monthly subscription, I will be able to subsidize the costs of doing shoots and creating content, so I can work with photographers and videographers that would otherwise not be able to afford working with me. This way I\u0027m able to build my portfolio so I can work on getting into bigger productions that are actually paying, and will boost my career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI absolutely love creating art and entertaining people, and want to continue doing it, so your help is greatly appreciated! :D\u003cbr\u003e"

My passion for acting has been with me since I was a kid, and with your help I guarantee I can\u00a0make it to the big leagues!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI survived a car accident that should have killed me when I was 16, but only left me with a frustrating case of TBI (car flipped 7 times). I divorced a mentally abusive husband after 7.5yrs, and in the last 6 years I\u0027ve (mostly) overcome my fear of driving, built my confidence from the ground up, and have made a name for myself! If\u00a0you type Anastazia Nichole into Google, I flood the first couple of pages! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a YouTube channel (Annah Minx) with 15,000+ subscribers, FB page with 12,000+ followers, and the locals consider me \"famous\" already. (I believe I still have a long way to go before I can humbly agree!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI post behind the scenes photos and videos from acting and brand ambassador gigs, as well as YouTube videos before they\u0027re seen by my fans (still working out the kinks in that). Directors don\u0027t like their work being released before it\u0027s done, but I do my best to post updates on what I\u0027ve been up to. $25 patrons get risky selfies of me in my Annah Minx studio and other random places.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main goal is to raise enough donations a month to cover most travel costs for auditions around the Seattle area or farther out, like LA! I work brand ambassador gigs, small paid modeling/acting gigs, and am an IT assistant to cover what I can financially, but my kids come first, so there\u0027s never much left to fund my personal goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to accomplishing what I was born to do, and I thank you with all of my heart for believing in me and helping me get there!\u003cbr\u003e",
