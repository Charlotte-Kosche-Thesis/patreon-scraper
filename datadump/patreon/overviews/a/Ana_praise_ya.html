    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi! Thank you for coming! and for checking out this new(er) platform and structure for being a patron of \u0027The Arts... and Letters\u0027 as I like to call it.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003c/strong\u003eSince it started in 2013, Patreon has been hosting a forum essentially, and providing a new way for creators to connect with people directly interested in their work, allowing artists to present their work in flexible, usually self-curated, ways to a broader audience. In my mind, the focus for this kind of endeavor is on how to build community around a simple system of exchange, how to facilitate the connection/conversation/interaction between artist-creator and inspired appreciators to be more direct. This innovative opportunity allows for lovers of art and people in community to give something to artists that inspire them in and to get something back, in an on-going collaborative model. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eThere are many ways and levels to be engaged\u003c/strong\u003e with artists and creators. #1. On the basic content posts community members can comment and \u003cstrong\u003etalk with the creator and with each other\u003c/strong\u003e. There are also \u0027rewards\u0027 or \u0027gifts\u0027 you get when you choose to be part of collectively funding the work and \u0027becoming a patron\u0027.\u00a0You can sign up to be a patron at\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e$1/month to get access to all content, and beyond that level,\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0you get \u0027goodies.\u0027 \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I want to offer my authentic work AND things that are exciting for you, so please let me know what aspects you appreciate most and what great ideas you may have as well! I would like to offer you an opportunity to take a peak into my creative world and get something for it!\u00a0I will try to give you some of my \u0027backstory\u0027 but it will be as I go along, rather than an all upfront explanation of how I moved into different modes of creative pursuit and why I do it/what I want out of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eThe intro video above\u003c/strong\u003e - I didn\u0027t make it how \u0027they\u0027 said. I am quite the contrarian after all!\u00a0 : )\u0026gt; But it\u0027s actually a case of being a \u0027\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003erebel WITH a cause\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u0027 Doing things differently, is one of my favorite way to operate. It\u0027s because I love to look from (and experience) a new perspective and move past or outside the \u0027status quo\u0027.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 All my art is multi-media.\u003c/strong\u003e In my process of creating I cross over and through many mediums even if some of my pieces do end up being purely charcoal on paper. In my poetry and prose some difficult issues are present, but sometimes they move towards an ecstatic lightness. I do love a strong contrast! My process with \u0027music\u0027, or the language of sound, which is very sacred for me, is fairly personal in a lot of ways, but I will likely share from that arena here as well. You might also see artsy videos and photos from live music events. The fathoming is the theme-thread that weaves it all together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Just like the rest of my art and creations this place-page will mold and evolve as I move through #theprocess and play with its iterations. ~\u003cstrong\u003eWhere you\u0027re attention goes, so you are shown... and there is what grows. What I have already found here is a healthy dose of mutual inspiration, fascination, and content with depth for rumination.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e I don\u0027t apologize for my authentic me\u003c/strong\u003e which is ever-changing. Instead I pay attention for opportunities to say, \"Thank you!\"... Thank you for seeing me, for listening, thank you for your interaction, your feedback. So... thank you to the sooo many people who have inspired, influenced and supported me thus far to explore, imagine, dream, create, and elevate the process of flow. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you to Patreon for existing, for pioneering, for place-making in a way that is unique in it\u0027s interactive opportunities. Specifically thank you to Michael Garfield and The Janitor from youtube\u00a0 who directly inspired me to come and try this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eSo, enjoy! Watch the video if you didn\u0027t already.\u003c/strong\u003e Check out my posts and goals on the left with arrow buttons, and share-the-love gifts along the right, and Thank you soo much! I look forward to sharing: the process, love for integrative experience, and fun conversations! \u003cstrong\u003eMuch Love, Peace, and Prosperity\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere was it born?: My leaving the \u0027mainstream\u0027 more radically?
