    "summary": "My name is Alyssa and I strive to cover unsolved true crime cases that need more attention. My hope is that one day by putting these cases out there and getting them more coverage, someone somewhere may see one of these videos and may realize that they have information to share about the case with law enforcement. We can do so much good in this world, and this is just my little way of attempting to do some good and to give back to others. In addition to covering unsolved cases I also provide additional true crime content including historical mysteries, coverage of some solved cases that we can learn something from, and reviews of true crime books, documentaries, podcasts, channels, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a mom, I have to take away time from my family to keep my channel going so that I can continue to try to get these important cases out there. That makes it hard for me to justify taking that time away from my family when I can\u0027t provide anything back to my family as a result. That\u0027s why I\u0027m starting this Patreon page. I don\u0027t expect people to support my channel financially, but if anyway wants to because they find this content just as important as I do, then I truly do appreciate it. It will allow me to be able to continue doing what I\u0027m doing, while also giving back something to my family, no matter how small that something may be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone helping to support my channel through Patreon contributions is helping to keep my content on YouTube and more importantly is helping me to get these cases the attention that they deserve!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t only want to be able to give back to my own family though. So as a part of my decision to open up this Patreon page, I will be donating 5% of every contribution to a worthy organization. The organizations I will be choosing from will be groups that help look for missing people, organizations that provide resources for loved ones of missing or murdered people, groups that bring awareness to things such as human trafficking and other important issues, etc. This way we can also all give back to others who work hard as well to help the people effected by the cases I talk about. As a part of this effort, I will hold polls for patrons only to help me decide which organization we donate to every month!"
