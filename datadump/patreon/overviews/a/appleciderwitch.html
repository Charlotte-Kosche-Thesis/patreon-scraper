I started this Patreon to help me do more writing in my spare time around my day job. Isn\u0027t that the story of a lot of us creatives? That you have a main job to fund the side-hustle and you have side-hustles on that, even.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing and I feel full to bursting of ideas for essays but it\u0027s difficult for me to go through the grinder of pitching articles on a regular schedule that meshes with my non-creative day job. I\u0027d love to have people who love my work see more of it, even if they can\u0027t afford to support me financially. Everything I post, save for specific tier rewards, would be made publicly available on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@veryapplecider\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e page\u00a0(or maybe eventually on my portfolio site) - you get all the extras and attention.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy favorite things to write about are feminist takes on pop culture and media criticism, with a specific focus on television, film and especially video games. I also write fanfic, though that\u0027s not the purview of this Patreon, but maybe you\u0027ll get glimpses of things I\u0027m working on in that arena anyways.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eNOTE: All payments are per essay.
