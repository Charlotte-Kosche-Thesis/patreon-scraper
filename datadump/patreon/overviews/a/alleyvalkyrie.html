I make art and clothing under the name\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.practicalrabbit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePractical Rabbit\u003c/a\u003e, I used to write for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.wildhunt.org/author/alley\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Wild Hunt\u003c/a\u003e and currently write for\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.godsandradicals.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGods\u0026amp;Radicals\u003c/a\u003e as well as putting forth a lot of writing on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/alleyvalkyrie\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e and my own blogs, and I have been fighting and advocating for the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/81480374\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erights of the homeless\u003c/a\u003e on and off for most of my adult life. Prior to all that, I also spent my earlier years as a painter and photographer, and for over a decade now I\u0027ve been sitting on a huge pile of unfinished works and projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past thirteen years I\u0027ve been supporting myself with Practical Rabbit while also struggling with a myriad of health-related challenges and disability issues, and as much as I love the work I\u0027ve been creating, for many years now I\u0027ve been falling deeper and deeper into debt and poverty. It was never my plan to be printing t-shirts for a living, and while I\u0027m grateful that I\u0027ve been able to keep a roof over my head, long-term my business is unsustainable for a variety of reasons and I\u0027ve only stuck with it\u00a0for lack of better options.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago, after I started writing for The Wild Hunt, I realized that I actually might have other options. The longer that I write, the more I realize that I need to be writing more and would love to be writing full-time one day, or at least as close to full-time as is possible for me. But in my current situation, I barely had the time to finish my current once-a-month obligation, let alone time for any additional writing. I have at least a dozen unfinished essays and stories sitting in a folder, as well as at least a dozen more in my head that I\u0027m afraid of losing track of, but I don\u0027t have the time to put them to paper.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago started working with clay and porcelain for the first time in fifteen years, and quickly realized that\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/finisterrapottery\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewhat I was creating\u003c/a\u003e has the potential to grow into a business that has a much greater chance of being stable and sustainable for me than relying on Practical Rabbit does. My aim is to offer one-of-a-kind pieces to the community at a reduced cost compared to what similar pieces are priced at.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also recently relocated to France for several reasons, primarily for the sake of my health and an improved quality-of-life. I\u0027m currently a university student (for the first time in my life!) in a French-language intensive at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.cirefe.fr\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUniversit\u00e9 Rennes 2,\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027m trying to re-establish my art and pottery practices over here after selling pretty much everything I owned in order to relocate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me on Patreon, you\u0027ll be buying my time back for me so that I can create. You will be a part of helping my shift from a screenprinter and occasional writer to a potter and a more frequent storyteller and artist, you will enable me to build a more steady income that will improve my quality of living and allow me to write and create even more, and you will also be freeing my time up so that I can devote more time towards working with folks in various capacities. You\u0027ll also be helping me re-settle and re-establish myself in France, where I am trying to secure permanent residency long-term.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have some long-term projects that you\u0027ll be helping me complete, some which have been on hold for years. These include a volume of poetry and accompanying stories, a personal website featuring my visual art and painting in addition to my writing, a blog I plan on starting, and large chunks of unfinished personal writing that I hope to form into a memoir one day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for your support, and I look forward to creating for you \u00a0:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Currently, I\u0027m dealing with an average $200/month gap between the amount of income I am able to bring in monthly and the basic things i need to pay for in order to survive. This deficit has many repercussions, both financial and psychological, but more than anything else the constant stress and scrambling around this deficit keeps me from being able to devote time towards writing, fighting, or creating while at the same time I fall further and further into debt every month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$200 a month takes me out of immediate \u0027survival mode\u0027 and puts me in the red, so to speak. When my basic needs are met, if I no longer have to spend countless hours scrambling for and shuffling money around in order to keep things from being turned off, my ability to do All Of The Things will greatly increase.",

Working Sundays means that I also lose Mondays and Tuesdays in terms of productivity. At $500 worth of pledges, I can take most if not all Sundays off and devote them to writing and related projects.",

However, in large part due to the money already pledged, and also because of that whole bit where I moved to another country where my rent is much more reasonable, I\u0027ve re-set this goal to serve other purposes in line with my bigger goals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $800, I\u0027ll be able to start using more of my own funds to directly help others who are more vulnerable than I am. While I always have done this to a smaller extent, once I hit this goal I can start to dedicate between 5% and 10% per month (after fees) to either directly helping folks donating to (select) local organizations who do similar work. Every month I will post an update to my patron feed letting people how how and where the money was spent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
