    "summary": "Hi friends,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started on Twitter. A few of my followers asked why I didn\u0027t have a podcast to answer science questions. With more than a little snark, I posted this tweet:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003eHow interested would you guys be in a weekly, short podcast where I answer a reader question about science, faith, and living?\u003cbr\u003e\u2014 Mike McHargue (@mikemchargue) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemchargue/status/553659026052243456\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJanuary 9, 2015\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nJust like that, a show was born. We hit 3,500 subscribers and cracked the top 20 on iTunes \u003cem\u003eall before the first episode launched.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Today, Ask Science Mike averages 6,500 downloads per day\u2013and that figure will be obsolete by the time this is posted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t expect a podcast about science and faith to be so popular. My other show,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://theliturgists.com/podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Liturgists Podcast\u003c/a\u003e is growing quickly as well, but it has famous guests and a famous co-host (\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/michaelgungor\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMichael Gungor\u003c/a\u003e). Ask Science Mike is just me and you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why it works. It\u0027s your show. You ask the questions, and you set the direction of the program. And you made the show popular because people are ready to have honest, authentic, shame-free conversations about God, faith, evolution, sex, and how to leave this world better than we found it. You want to talk about ecology and shalom, resurrection and entropy, and you\u0027re tired of a societal narrative that science and faith are at odds with each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsk Science Mike is successful because it doesn\u0027t accept the dichotomy of science vs faith\u2013and neither do you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I need your help. The success of this program has shown me how many people are looking for conversations like these. It\u0027s also shown me how expensive it is to produce and distribute quality content. Each episode of Ask Science Mike takes a lot of man-hours from a small team, and racks up some sizable costs for web hosting and other infrastructure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve looked at advertising options, but I\u0027d rather give that influence to the people that matter most to this program: the listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI chose Patreon for my campaign because it makes it easy for you to particiapte at any level your comfortable with, without any commitment. You can change or cancel your donation at any time. Every bit helps. Even $1 a month can make a serious difference with the number of listeners the show has now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo matter what, the show will still be available to you at no cost. Please don\u0027t feel pressured or guilty if you can\u0027t participate, or don\u0027t want to. Rating the show on iTunes is another way you can help if money is tight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for leading me on this journey. If open, honest conversations about science and faith matter to you, I hope you\u0027ll consider donating to keep it going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrace, peace, and decreasing entropy,\u003cbr\u003eScience Mike"
