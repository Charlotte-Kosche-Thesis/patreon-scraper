    "summary": "Hello. My name is AC (or Aycee if you prefer) and I love making art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon is to help support personal projects and pieces of art I\u0027d love to share with the world, but otherwise would not have the time or funds to do so. Bills can stack up and projects and illustrations I really want to create get pushed to the side. I am hoping this patreon will help me be able to set aside some time to draw more of what I love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I draw?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really like drawing colorful, animated, bright pieces. Some of my favorite themes include: Food, Animals, Plants, Candy/Pop Gore, and Gentle Surrealism. If you want an idea of my style these websites should show a pretty decent idea of what I like to do: twitter.com/ayceeart \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile a lot of my art is furry fandom oriented I also sometimes like to draw and paint other topics. This Patreon will be for me to experiment with ideas and themes that may not appear 100% of the time in my work. Regardless, everything will be SFW.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do Payments work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePayments will be set to per-finished-piece which means if I don\u0027t have something fully complete to post you wont be charged. At most I plan on posting 4 finished images a month (once a week) but realistically it will be more like 1-2 paid posts a month.\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e This patreon is for spare-time work and not meant to replace a full-time job. This means that there may be posting hiatuses if I have a large project I am dedicated to at the time. \u003cem\u003eIf I don\u0027t finish any art you wont be charged, even if there are WIP shots etc posted for that month.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is to help support drawing art that isn\u0027t a commission or project for other clients. Unfortunately I usually have a hard time doing any more personal work because I have bills that require attention first and foremost. Any support here means the world to me and helps me get the ideas I have in my head out there!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for stopping by, I hope your enjoy your stay!\u003cbr\u003e"
