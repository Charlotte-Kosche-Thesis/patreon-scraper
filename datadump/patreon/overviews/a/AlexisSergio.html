    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eI\u2019m Alexis Sergio\u00a0and I\u0027m writing articles and comics that are all about breaking down border walls, punching traditional values in the face, and being really, really gay. As a queer, Latinx, trans, non-binary, lady type living in modern era Texas making art is about the only safe job for my life but also maybe the worst idea for making a living.

Still, I output tons of articles and I am always working on designing stories for comics (and sometimes even other fun geeky stuff). I have lots of stories ready to go but I need money to pay artists to make these stories and also just being able to fund the time required for my own article writing would be nice. So with funding from Patreon,I\u2019ll get money that will let me make articles that you all want to read and also help me fund artists to make really badass comics that save the crumbling republic. I am making comics all about trans people, people of color, women, queer people. Making LGBT+ content is so important to me and writing articles addressing our issues is too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Fund Me? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, outside of the charity of me single-handedly(which lots of help) saving comics, there are plenty of reasons. Maybe you got white guilt, cis guilt, straight guilt?Really, if you\u0027re guilty about something I am more than happy to let you get rid of that guilt via a donation to my Patreon. In all seriousness, you\u2019ll get access to exclusive content from me because I\u0027ve got plenty to say that just doesn\u2019t fit the sites that want me to do work for them.  I\u2019m looking at doing exclusive articles that, perhaps, are in part voted on by you all or I can move away from an article series if you, as a group, aren\u0027t enjoying them. I\u2019ll post some previews of comics that the money you all are donating helps to keep alive. I can also do backstory discussions and fun things with my comic series. I\u2019m pretty open to having a good time with you all. What you can expect is nearly daily content some exclusive and some public.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are you waiting for? you can give me a dollar or even more money if you like. I don\u2019t expect to hit my goal, cuz it\u2019s huge, but every dollar really does count and will help sooo much. Thank you for taking the time to read my bad jokes and maybe you\u2019ll get to be a part of creating the diverse books we need\u00a0in these dark times. I promise as much of the money as possible will be going towards people who share my values and are the kind of artists that need support more than ever in these times. Seriously, I love you all thank you so much for the gift of you time and consideration. If you don\u2019t have money but want to support sharing this on social media, writing articles, other stuff to help promote my work all really helps. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Art is by\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/QuireInk\"\u003eValerie St Gelais\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/yhBk0Evm.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/yhBk0Evm.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1wAN8fVQAESDeb.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Projects\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWish\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(Co-Written by Frankie B with Art by Valerie St Gelais)- A genderfluid Latinx super hero stumbles their way through life and being a superhero. \u00a0(\u003ca href=\"http://transcendents.xyz/wish/\"\u003eIssue #1\u003c/a\u003e released now)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLipstick\u003c/strong\u003e: A pair of lesbians of color kill angels and bigots, getting bounties as a bonus.
