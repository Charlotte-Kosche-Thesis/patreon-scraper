How\u0027s it going? Thanks for visiting!\nUm...so, I am your host, \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/about/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKhatzumoto\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eMy zits have been photoshopped out of that picture.\u003c/strong\u003e Let me tell you a little about myself and hopefully some of it matters (lol!)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the age of 21, all post-pubescent and supposedly past my mental/linguistic prime, I started learning Japanese. Within 18 months, I had learned enough to read technical material, conduct business correspondence and even job interviews in Japanese. I didn\u0027t take any Japanese classes and I hadn\u0027t been to Japan.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhatever. Enough bragging. Anyway!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2006, I created the website All Japanese All The Time (AJATT) to help other geeks and nerds and cool people and anime fans like you learn Japanese by themselves outside of the school-industrial complex, without taking classes, by having fun and doing things you enjoy -- watching movies, playing video games, reading comic books\u2014you know: fun stuff! Stuff that you feel guilty about doing because you should be doing \u201cserious things\u201d.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRunning the AJATT website takes time, money and energy. All of which I am very glad to spend, \n\u003cstrong\u003elabour of love, blah blah blah.\u003c/strong\u003e Hahahaha. No, but seriously, \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=747359\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy goal through Patreon\u003c/a\u003e is elevenfold:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eKeep my cats living the lifestyle to which they have become accustomed (pet food, hookers and blow...these are very demanding cats).\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eProduce more amazing blog content, the original driver and engine of AJATT\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExpand AJATT content into more media than just text\u003c/strong\u003e -- \u003cstrong\u003emore manga (comics), audio, podcasts and possibly even video; this requires equipment and people, \u003c/strong\u003eboth of which require money, because equipment likes to be paid for being made and people like to be compensated for their time -- talking, recording, transcribing, editing, so...\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eSpecifically, one of my goals is to get a few Japanese friends together, sit around a dinner table and make a regular podcast that\u0027s just us/them being stupid, because that kind of thing is super fun to listen to, fun to make, and also (key word) as educational as all get out because it\u0027s natural and real, unlike that sterile textbook content that passes for Japanese education.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eInvent and develop more interesting tools, software and otherwise, including (possibly) some mobile apps\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eGet rid of all third party advertising. It\u0027s ugly; it takes up space, and it\u0027s not even relevant...you get all these weirda$$ pitches for American car insurance on a Japanese language learning site. Nobody wants that. Do you want that? No. No, you don\u0027t.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eCreate and release more incredible courses where you can learn awesome stuff in awesome ways.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTurn the hundreds of AJATT blog articles into \u003cstrong\u003eactual books, \u003c/strong\u003eincluding of the dead tree kind (\u003cstrong\u003elet\u0027s murder some trees, wub-a-lub-a-dub-duuuuuub\u003c/strong\u003e!!!!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eContinue to cover running costs at AJATT -- server space, bandwidth, books and media we review, physical space we use for projects, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFocus on content and ideas that have deep, quirky, intrinsic and long-term profundity and intellectual value, not just stuff that sells fast and well. For example, I\u0027m not ashamed of the 2016 election Trump Japanese content we produced -- it was funny as heck -- but...obsessive focus on politics and current events has never been AJATT style; facts are real but news is fake and a distraction from reality -- I firmly believe it\u0027s better to be above such things. The right side is no side at all.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo more weird and wonderful experiments, because that\u0027s always where magic happens, out on the fringes. \u003c/strong\u003eThere\u0027s a time for being Prussian and factory-like and efficient but there\u0027s also a time for being whimsical. Whimsy actually creates the future, efficiency just keeps it running.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-BfjHbHj60\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMaybe work on that novel that I\u0027ve been working on. You know -- the novel I keep talking about? That novel? I\u0027ve already got a big, uh, big stack of papers here. It\u0027s a nice little story. I\u0027ve got a compelling protagonist and obstacles for him to overcome. You remember the novel, right? It\u0027s a nice little narrative. Some friends become enemies and enemies become friends. And, at the end of the novel, the main character is richer from the experience. You remember, right? That novel?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eOK, prolly -- no, definitely -- not work on a novel. Novel is jokesies. But everything else is for realsies.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUp until now, I\u0027ve accomplished all of that by selling products on the AJATT website, as well as doing tons (tons!) of translation and consulting work. This is good, except it isn\u0027t. It\u0027s highly flawed. Let me \u0027splain.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirstly, all the translation and consulting work is all proprietary and protected by non-disclosure agreements, so I can\u0027t share any of it with you or anyone else \n\u003cem\u003eever\u003c/em\u003e (I mean, I could, but there are serious legal and social consequences for breaking NDAs, plus it\u0027s a jerk move); it also takes huge amounts of time and energy away from AJATT.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSecondly, selling products on AJATT forces us (me and the people who help me) to focus on projects that have the best chance of maximizing short-term profitability -- whatever we do has to make money now, not in one, two or ten years. To add insult to injury, if you know anything about how selling product works, you\u0027ll know that we have to spend about 80% of our time and energy \n\u003cem\u003emarketing\u003c/em\u003e the product and only 20% of our time actually \u003cem\u003emaking\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eimproving\u003c/em\u003e it. That\u0027s literally how product development works.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=747359\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"248\" src=\"http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/aboutpage/khatz-and-mago.png\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\" width=\"327\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSo\u003cstrong\u003e I have become a sort of click-baity hypocrite\u003c/strong\u003e, courting excitement and controversy and talking about how awesome something is while not necessarily having the time or resources to make it as awesome as it could be, sort of like a person who writes about freedom and yet literally owns his wife\u0027s sister *cough* Thomas Jefferson *cough*. The need to market puts us in a permanent state of compromise. Now, some compromise is good, necessary and even helpful -- if we had infinite time and resources to do everything, we\u0027d literally never get anything done -- but too much compromise is too much. My hope is that \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=747359\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyour support through Patreon\u003c/a\u003e can bring some balance back to the Force, as it were.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMaybe \n\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a spoiled, selfish attention whore\u003c/strong\u003e (you\u0027re all: \"maybe?\"), but I\u0027m also a maker at heart. Not a marketer. Not even an interesting person. Just a maker. That\u0027s why the AJATT website has oodles of free content; it\u0027s why \u003ca href=\"http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/what-is-surusu/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe ground-breaking spaced repetition system Surusu\u003c/a\u003e remains free.

Meanwhile, network TV has produced...mostly crap, and even when it doesn\u0027t produce crap, it cancels it or fires the best writers or puts pressure on it that warps the creative direction and energy into something awful. Think: \"Prison Break\" after season 1. Think: NBC cancelling \"Star Trek\" and leaving fans in the dark for 20 years.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s not because network TV executives are evil or stupid -- they are neither -- it\u0027s because they have to maximize ratings = viewership = advertising revenue right here, right now, today. It\u0027s a structural problem, not a moral problem: their business model doesn\u0027t really allow them to make art, to focus on depth, to make anything of long-term value -- in fact, it punishes that kind of behaviour.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that, my child, is why \"Arrested Development\" is gone but \"The Big Bang Theory\" lives on\u003c/strong\u003e.
