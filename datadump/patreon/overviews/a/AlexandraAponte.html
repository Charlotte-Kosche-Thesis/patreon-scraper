You sign up to become a patron of a special artist or musician and you receive rewards from that artist personally with a subscription. Don\u0027t worry, you can choose what reward tier you want based off what you desire from the creator. We work TOGETHER to bring dreams and goals to life! yay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I ?\u003c/strong\u003e A person! A person with goals and dreams just like you! I am a creative type that wants to share my work, inspire and give purpose to something bigger than me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy dream is\u003c/strong\u003e to become a mixed/multimedia mastermind. Basically I want to explore and have fun with all art forms/projects such as, music, audio recording, fine art and even a little film. I want to inspire others to pursue their dreams and to never stop working towards them.\u00a0How awesome would it be if you could help me learn and even create a mini animated series!! I could have characters in it named after us! With the right software and materials, we could do it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support Alex\u2019s journey?\u003c/strong\u003e Because you can be apart of it. We can become friends and even collaborate! The investment comes back to you in rewards! You get to see what I create specially for patreon and how I do it, original artwork, prints, handmade birthday cards and mp3 attachments. Soon we will be able to hang out! I want to create memories and share experiences with a supportive community that can jumpstart each other\u2019s goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd finally, THANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e. With every single contribution you help a child. That child is me. With your donation you can feed Alex hope. You can help her grow as an artist and as an entertainer. And probably a meal too. Muchas gracias sweet babies! \u003cbr\u003e"
