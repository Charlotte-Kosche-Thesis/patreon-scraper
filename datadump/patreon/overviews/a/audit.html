    "summary": "Feb. 1 Update: I have been suspended without reason by Twitter but will be making a new journalism website to continue my work and this project. I would like to thank everyone again who has supported me so far, it means the world to me, I really do put a lot of effort into this. Thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJan. 28 Update. I want to remind people that the goal of this is to raise money so that I can pay for travel expenses (gas, food, lodging, vehicle - ideally 20k per year in spending, which means I\u0027m traveling almost every day) to purchase equipment (laptop, camera, signal amplifier/wireless boost, microphone - about $2-3k for decent gear with the camera being the big expense) and take photos and videos (live and recorded) of important and sometimes dangerous events (like protests/riots/etc.). It is not money so I can sit at home tweeting, as others have claimed. The money that remains will be used as salary - about 38k if I meet the goal, which is still below the poverty line (the US median GDP is 55k~. If you make less than 55k annually, you are below the poverty line.) Basically, ignore haters. They\u0027re making things up because they know that you, my friends, are helping me defeat the fake and dishonest news media and their biased, unreliable, poor coverage of people and events. I appreciate all of your contributions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently struggling to pay my bills and deep in debt - It is January 26th - I haven\u0027t eaten at all today. I can barely afford food; I have medical and dental bills that I cannot pay. I want to work, however, I am only offered bad \u0027jobs\u0027 where I wind up I losing money. I would like to travel, do livestreams and cover news events, but I cannot afford to do that either. It is incredibly frustrating knowing that the average New York Times \"journalist\" gets paid $150,000 per year to start (and proceeds to write articles which are not only wholly untrue but entirely boring.) Knowing that Chelsea Handler gets $12.5 million dollars per year to make vagina jokes and pretend to leave the United States. Knowing that Keith Olbermann gets paid $10 million dollars per year to pretend that the US flag is a safety blanket, and that he is some sort of adult Linus who yells about Donald Trump and his cabinet being the crazy ones. Knowing that Chris Cuomo gets $2.5 million per year, not because he\u0027s some sort of genius news anchor, but because he\u0027s part of an elite Beltway caste. I am regularly accused of being a beggar for wanting to fix the 13+ cavities in my mouth (and other problems which require a thorough and intensive body of dental work. I am omitting the details of said dental work intentionally for those who are eating and reading at the same time). I haven\u0027t been able to afford a dentist visit - I\u0027ve been once this decade, and they told me that bill alone would cost $4,000. I have insomnia, anxiety and depression, largely as a result of being poor. I wake up cold, with chills, half-asleep. I rely on caffeine to stay awake. Enough is enough - my goal is to reach $5,000 per month by March 1st. This is my last chance. Perhaps someone will help. One of my millionaire \u0027friends\u0027. Or you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePlease help. Thank you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
