    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eI am eager to explore the versatility I hope to cultivate in my body of work. Art has always been a major part in my life in all forms, I use my body, hands and eyes to create the beauty you see. I started modeling when I was 7 and took an 11 year hiatus, I returned to it in 2011. I have been on the runway and published in indie magazines among countless other things. Being an artist is perhaps the oldest set of art skills I have, since I started really young, not quite sure the age. Mostly it is surrealism with a hint of fashion illustrations and figure art. I love to draw people in by creating stuff that they can enjoy at all ages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith\n the support from fans/followers I\u0027d be more able to set aside money towards my outlets, from artistry with paying for paint and canvas, modeling for funds with makeup, clothing and such. At this time I do\u00a0 have a part time job, but most my money is going towards attempting to move out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your pledge, you will gain access to exclusive content \nonly available here on Patreon.  Depending on your pledge level, perks \nwill include things like personalized postcards \u0026amp; doodles mailed to \nyou, digital photo sets, daily selfies, \nand more in the future...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Your pledge will help me towards goals to further my creative journey. \n Although I work part-time, being a freelance artist is never the most \nprosperous career choice. Any help from patrons will help \nimmensely to keep all my portfolio\u0027s nice and fresh, with new material monthly. Any and all money received from \nthis page will be used for all my artistic journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
