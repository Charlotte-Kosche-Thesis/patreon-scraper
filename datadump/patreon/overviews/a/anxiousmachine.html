    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Anxious Machine is about:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnxious Machine is a podcast exploring\nhow humans struggle with all the things that we\u2019ve invented. Take a\nmoment, right now, to look around the room you\u2019re sitting in: your living room,\nyour bedroom, your office, a coffee shop, your office at work. Wherever you\nare, take note of the sheer number of objects in the room that were fashioned\nby humans. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I write this, almost everything in my view is\na product of human design: there\u2019s the computer in my lap, of course, and the\ncellphone in my pocket, but there\u2019s also the room itself, with floor, walls,\nwindows, and ceiling. The room is lit by two lamps, plugged into outlets that\nlead to electrical lines, which themselves snake off to a power generator, the\nlocation of which I don\u2019t even know. Finally, there\u2019s the furniture, the couch\non which I sit, two chairs, and a table scattered with books, a pair of reading\nglasses, and a pouch holding the nebulizer my son needs to alleviate asthma\nattacks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of these objects are mundane, but some are\ntransformative, even life-saving. When we use the word \u201ctechnology,\u201d we often\nuse it only to refer to the most recent forms of technology, especially\nanything related to computers. But the broadest definition of technology\nincludes \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e tool\ncreated by humans, from hand axes to writing, from stone tablets to tablet\ncomputers. Our species has been using tools for our entire history. And as\nwe\u2019ve used it to change the world around us, it has, in turn, changed us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Anxious Machine matters:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere\u0027s no shortage of podcasts about\ntechnology, but few actually tell the stories of real people affected by it.
