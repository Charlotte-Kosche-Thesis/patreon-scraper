    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003e**UPDATE**\u003c/h2\u003eThis Patreon is under hiatus and has been for some time. I tried to reboot the show but didn\u0027t meet the 200-250$ per episode goal. It got close, I think peaked around $185 or so, but when it still hadn\u0027t crossed the threshold after a few episodes, I could no longer dedicate the time necessary to create more. I am keeping the Patreon up and open in case there\u0027s ever a random surge of interest, but for the time being, I\u0027ll make an episode if I have the time and inspiration for my new site, NumotGaming.com and will only start using this again if it ever becomes relevant. Thanks for understanding and HUGE thanks to everyone who supported the show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is AJTV?\u003c/h2\u003eIt\u0027s a Magic: the Gathering show I used to do sporadically. Due to popular demand, I\u0027m looking to resurrect it with your help!\u00a0In each episode, I go over pro-level matches, breaking down the decisions within for educational and entertainment purposes. High level strategy with a dose of humor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally inspired by the Starcraft 2 show, the Day[9] Daily, I use real game footage from live event coverage to talk about key strategic or tactical elements employed by the pros.\u00a0The best way to improve at Magic is to learn from better players: this is the basis of AJTV; I want to teach using lessons from the best (and tell random stories/jokes).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003ePatreon is a great tool for consumers and creators to interact more directly. Basically, I make videos and you give me some money for it. By using Patreon [and sponsorships] rather than have AJTV be hosted content, I sacrifice some stability and risk missing out on some money, but we both get a lot in return.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor starters, I release content on my own schedule rather than rushing out incomplete products or having to delay potentially time-sensitive strategy guides due to arbitrary deadlines. Monetizing AJTV in this way gives me way more control over the show in terms of things like length (never have to pad or cut) and content (I can tell a story or something without fear).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also look forward to not having a suit tell me to cover certain formats/tournaments/players. This way, I can choose to do videos on the best matches happening on which I have the most to say rather than be a glorified commercial. Patreon also lets me interact more closely with the viewership via the board/feed/whatever-they-call-it, so I can stay in tune with what people like and want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy support the show?\u003c/h2\u003eAJTV has been called the best content in Magic enough times that I\u0027m willing to write it here despite it sounding like hyperbolic egotism. The truth is they can be pretty helpful and/or entertaining, and I love making them. If you want me to be able to have them be the best they can be and produce them regularly, then I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going from being paid to do them to not being paid to do them. Turns out, food and shelter aren\u0027t free, and instead of spending my time producing awesome content, I have to spend it making money to live. So the more money I can make creating content, the less time I\u0027ll have to divert to other forms of income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can also assure that my content is not going to be locked behind paywalls [ever again, if I have any say on the matter] so that everyone can enjoy it, whether they can afford/choose to support the show or not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your support, in addition to getting more \u0026amp; better AJTVs, you will also receive some nice little perks based on how much you donate. If things go well, I\u0027ll be adding more goals and rewards soon, including things like special episodes and maybe even AJTV swag.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow does Patreon work?\u003c/h2\u003eBasically, you agree to pay me X amount for every episode of AJTV I publish. You can cap how many times a month you\u0027re willing to pay so you know you won\u0027t spend more than you expect. I don\u0027t see myself being able to make more than a few a month for the time being anyway. Then, every time I publish an episode, I get X dollars from you. It\u0027s a way for you to tip me for my content, and for me to know how much I\u0027m expected to make when working on something.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nInstead of, say, spending 12 dollars on a movie theater ticket, you can give me a fraction of that so I can make videos for you. And instead of seeing ~10 cents on the dollar like musical artists traditionally do, Patreon cuts out a lot of the middle-men so that creators will see closer to 90 cents on the dollar. This means that you can give relatively small amounts and it still makes a substantial impact on the show\u0027s bottom line.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll you have to do is click the orange-ish, red-ish (I\u0027m bad with colors) button at the top of the left-hand sidebar widget thing (and web-design) that says \"Become a Patron\" and decide how much to give, set a cap how many times a month, pick your perk level if applicable, and \u00a0put in your payment information. And just like that, you\u0027re an official Patron of AJTV and I thank you for it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
