I can\u2019t be completely free until everyone is. None of us can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Certified Professional Coach, I\u0027m learning to help those of us with privilege look at \u003cstrong\u003esocial justice/social consciousness as a personal development issue\u003c/strong\u003e. Because it starts on an individual level and radiates outward from there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe big question I\u0027m asking then is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can we each change our inner state to change our collective outer state?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd within that I\u0027m exploring:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat new awareness can we develop around our privilege?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat stops us from de-centering ourselves/those with our privilege?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhere do we need to own our roles and/or ancestry as oppressors?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat keeps us from listening to and validating others\u0027 experiences?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhere do fear, powerlessness, and self-pity come into play?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow do we use them to oppress and distance us from ourselves?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat new relationships can we form with fear?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow can we generate an internal sense of power?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow can we stop being victims?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSocial justice issues have been covered and continue to be covered by a variety of people, not least of all marginalized ones. Through their eyes, we can see a bigger picture, and to help us do so, I\u0027m amplifying their voices here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we\u0027ll go a step further. There\u0027s a difference between understanding, for example,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://robindiangelo.com/2014site/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/White-Fragility-Published.-1.pdf\"\u003ewhite fragility\u003c/a\u003e*\u00a0and doing the inner work of sorting through our own fragility. That\u0027s where this project comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThrough personal story\u00a0and exposition, coaching questions and conversation, I\u2019m exploring both individual and collective freedom as intentional outcomes of personal development.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m looking at freedom through the lens of the privileged, the oppressor even\u2014the white, educated, able-bodied, straight, class-privileged, size-privileged, English speaking person that I am on this Earth. I\u0027m also detaching from my identities as best I can and looking at it as a coach--fearless, nonjudgmental, intuitive, passionate.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is a new realm for me, and I\u2019m writing not as an expert but as a student who\u0027s curious, unknowing, determined, imperfect. As Dr. Adrienne Keene, the Cherokee author of the website \u003ca href=\"http://nativeappropriations.com/\"\u003e Native Appropriations\u003c/a\u003e, writes, I\u0027m \u201cconsenting to learn in public.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m doing so because my highest value is something we all crave: freedom. And because\u00a0something much bigger than me is calling. I\u0027m just a conduit for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e****\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor many months I\u0027ve suspected and shared that my next book will be about fear. What I haven\u0027t shared is that this book, thus far, also wants to have a social justice bent. What comes out on this page may evolve into that book.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for joining and growing alongside me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e****\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eHave suggestions or criticisms?
