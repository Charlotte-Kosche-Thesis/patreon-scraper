In order to do that I\u0027m travelling with Yuki to many beautiful places in Germany to shoot photos and videos of Yuki exploring the country and I show the viewers what Germany has to offer, especially for a dog, in a way that\u0027s fun and entertaining. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m ready to take the next step with my content, but I can\u0027t do it without your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs much as I enjoy sharing Yuki\u0027s stories and discoveries with you, the biggest challenge in maintaining this channel comes down to time and money. I\u0027ve invested thousands of my own personal resources in equipment and travel. Right now, I\u0027m a full-time student\u00a0and I work hard in order to afford what I do, but this takes away from planning, shooting and editing time. The stories I want to tell, the concepts I want to explore, the ideas I want to share are becoming much larger than a single day\u0027s work. Unfortunately, my income is heavily reliant on regular uploads.\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a \u003cstrong\u003ePatron\u003c/strong\u003e, you are contributing directly to the production of higher quality content on my YouTube Channel and you are giving me the time and resources to create more videos for you.\u00a0Your backing will allow me to explore the more cinematic,\u00a0entertaining, informative and Akita-based content I want to create and share. With your help, I can continue to travel with Yuki and tell the stories of a Japanese Akita living in Germany!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHigher quality content isn\u0027t the only reward.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eThere are various rewards you can unlock with your monthly pledge, including \u003cstrong\u003eaccess to Patrons-only behind the scenes and deleted scenes content of Akita Yuki\u003c/strong\u003e as well as information about all plans for upcoming YouTube episodes of Yuki!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly appreciate every single dollar from your generous support.\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to learn more about me and Yuki.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBest regards!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYuki\u0027s Owner\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
