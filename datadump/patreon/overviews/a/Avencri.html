I have two comics \u0027\u003ca href=\"http://theeye.katbox.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Eye of Ramalach\u003c/a\u003e\u0027 and \u0027\u003ca href=\"http://tinaofthesouth.katbox.net\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTina of the South\u003c/a\u003e\u0027. The Eye of Ramalach is my free comic and will \u003cstrong\u003eremain 100% free\u003c/strong\u003e. I plan to update it twice a month.\u00a0But Tina of the South is a comic I only can afford to do if people pay me per-page.

That will save me a lot of time and I would be very happy if we got that far. And if we make even more than that, I will start doing small comic arcs of about 6 pages in length, just to expand upon the world that these two comics belong to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23287792/Art/pat_tina.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for reading this and checking out my comics.

I started my comic \u0027The Eye of the Ramalach\u0027 in 2006 and have been enjoying it a lot ever since. Then I made my comic \u0027Tina of the South\u0027 in 2009 to further expand on the universe I have been building all this time. I hope you enjoy them too.\u003cbr\u003e",
