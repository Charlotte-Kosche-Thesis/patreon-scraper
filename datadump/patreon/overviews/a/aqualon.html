This novel is set in one of many incarnations of this world, which is created and destroyed by a great clockwork that exists behind reality, and can be most broadly defined as being a fantasy novel. There are actually highly advanced technocratic societies in this world, but because they exist, for the most part, only on the fringes of the geopolitical complex of the world, their influence on the motifs of the setting only become unveiled whenever the narrative shifts towards their territories.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a bit of a jack-of-all-trades creatively, dabbling in musical composition, digital art and design, web development and programming, creative writing, and tabletop RPGs. As such, I am taking whatever venue I can to paint as complete and gripping a picture of my world as I possibly can, in the hope to bring my vision to you, the readers.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo do so, I am publishing new chapters from the novel, which I am currently editing with the help of a close friend, on a weekly basis, and constantly write new compelling articles about the lands, people, customs, technologies, magic, and all other aspects of Aqualon. I am also slowly adding stats and implementation guides for my setting in Fate Core, a marvelous role playing system that is ideally suited to be adapted for any kind of setting.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.gates-of-aqualon.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.gates-of-aqualon.com/images/GoToWorldDark.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/9r3MSTv\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://gates-of-aqualon.com/images/discordbanner.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAbout Me\u003c/h3\u003e\nMy name is Koray Birenheide, and I am a 26 year old man living in a small town in Germany called Gelnhausen. It is located some way off of Frankfurt am Main, where I visit the Goethe University to study Japanology. I have always been fascinated with Japanese culture and language, though you shouldn\u0027t assume that \n\u003cem\u003eAqualon, Rise of the Broken\u003c/em\u003e, the book I am writing is set in a Japenese setting. There are cultures of that ilk involved, but I draw on many different cultures, as I believe a large world should be just as diverse as our real world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut back to me: I love martial arts and I play several instruments (poorly), among them mainly the piano and the guitar. I also enjoy pen and paper role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons and Fate Core and draw a lot of experience and inspiration for writing from that particular avenue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started writing creatively at the age of seven and wrote my first poem, and have been in love with writing ever since. I started out mainly with poetry but occasionally threw short stories into the mix. In time I would get into composing musical pieces, and in 2009 a rather lengthy \u0027career\u0027 as a digital composer of orchestral and vocaloid pieces began for me. I write \u0027career\u0027 in quotes, because I never made a lot of money off of it. Mostly of course because I published my music for free, and only sold albums on conventions, but also because there was never any way to make money off of it without selling albums online, which always went a little against my desire to make the music available to everyone. At the time Patreon did not exist, and due to illness and depression about a year ago I had a break down that prevented me from composing for quite some time, and I have had trouble getting back into it ever since. Having creativity be your life, but being unable to live of it can be hard on the soul at times.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSynopsis of the Novel\u003c/h3\u003e\nA dark wind is blowing over the Middle Lands.\nThe Council of Five is broken, and all accross the world old powers are \nrising up out of legend, lured by the threat of a strange yellow glimmer\n that corrupts the hearts of men and greedily grasps for the great \nclockwork that runs behind all things.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAtlas Muundir, once the avatar of the world\u0027s waters, is cast out, \nbroken, and forced to fight for a world he no longer feels part of, \nthrust on by new friends and old obligations.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMeanwhile, all around Aqualon old warriors, young prodigies, and ancient\n orders rouse, sensing the scent of war around them. They come from \namongst the broken, legends, and forgotten gods; and mages, technocrats \nand Null suddenly find age old enmities forgotten, when the very nature \nof their existence is at risk.\nIt is easy to fight with your life on the line when you know your soul \nwill be saved. But what would you do if it was the other way around?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe History of this Story\u003c/h3\u003e\nI conceived the idea of Aqualon when I was around eleven years old and started writing my first book. Getting up to about page 190ish, I decided to make a break and start anew, from a different setting and with a different, but in some aspects parallel, plot. Both these attempts were still written in German, and progress was slow. Still, in my mind more and more ideas about Aqualon became certain to my. For me, the two books were set on different worlds. In fact the first one was set in a post-apocalyptic earth, renamed Aqualon, but somehow, both worlds were also the same to me. At the time I don\u0027t think I was set on whether it was a sort of parallel universe or the way it is now, an endless string of worlds, destroyed and recreated ad infinitum, but in the end, the latter was what I arrived at.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nA few years back, I decided to make a second clean break, this time writing the new book in English. I also put a lot more thought into the kind of writing techniques that are not about the text itself, but about how writing more becomes easier and less stressful, because I really wanted to see it through this time.\nI had the manuscript finished in less than two years time, numbering at about 500 pages, and though I have sat on that manuscript for quite some time now and even started the second book, I had not taken heart to correct and edit it to a satisfactory point, until now.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith the idea and motivation to publish the book as a web novel, going through it chapter by chapter is far more doable for me, as I can work towards small goals and be immediately rewarded by being able to publish the result and get feedback.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
