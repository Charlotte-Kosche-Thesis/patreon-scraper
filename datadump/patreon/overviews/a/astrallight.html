    "summary": "Hi, and thanks for finding your way to my Patreon page! This is a place for people to support the creation and development of my online writing on the subjects of astrology and magic. I have been supplying free, detailed, high quality information on these subjects since the year 2000, am the author of a book outlining a new and practical approach to both areas of my focus (\u003cem\u003eThe 26 Keys\u003c/em\u003e), and last year produced detailed examinations of Chiron and Uranus for the online community. I have a lot more to say, and all of it will remain freely available to everyone who cares to read it, but donations I receive from Patrons here will reward me and enable me to expand the quantity and range of services I can offer for my time. There is little to no risk for you. You pledge to tip me for each new article I post each month, perhaps as little as 1$, and you can cap your total contribution at any amount you wish. You can also withdraw or change your patronage at any time.\u00a0 In return for your generous assistance you will gain access to an exclusive group of my Patrons with whom I will share private\u00a0 discussions and perhaps later be in the position to offer further rewards to. \u003cbr\u003eMy goals are only estimates at this time, but I feel they are realistic. I should mention that it is probably only feasible for me to write two articles a month, as I treat my subjects with some depth, and that the goal relating to a second book being published reflects an amount that I would need to reach in order to begin saving up enough money so that I could eventually work without pay for a few months while I write it. Money raised here will certainly encourage further work to appear at my blog and will also go towards writing a second and possibly third book expanding on the material provided in my first. Thank you for reading and as this site is newly created keep an eye on it for changes and further announcements in the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my online journal including a full archive of my online publishing at \u003ca href=\"https://astralvisions.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://astralvisions.wordpress.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can buy my book \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe 26 Keys \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003efrom Amazon at\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://tinyurl.com/jqzvxep\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://b54.in/26keys\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-26-Keys-Magic-Astral/dp/1463617674\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eor from your regional Amazon distributor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can connect with me via my Facebook page here\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/The-26-Keys-228850840482473/?ref=hl\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://doiop.com/26-Keys\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e http://doiop.com/26-Keys\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your interest in astrology and magic and your support for me! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "The focus of my life work is the restoration of the ancient understanding and practical use of magic and astrology. They were once indistinguishable, and thus even today share a common understanding - \u0027as above, so below\u0027. But the relationship between these two things is far deeper than that, and this is what I write about. In the process, though, people interested in how astrology affects them learn things from me they don\u0027t usually consider, while those interested in magic find practical ways to empower their training and rituals. \u003cbr\u003eThe course of instructions I give in my book The 26 Keys form the keystone of a new approach which has arisen from my experience with both astrology and magic. This approach allows anyone with any background to gain first hand practical experience of their own astrology, which is a very different experience to having an astrologer interpret it for you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
