I release original material under the name Autumn Long (it\u0027s a long story). This allows me to make it clear to people when I\u0027m doing covers gigs or an originals gig. I\u0027ve been making music for over 20 years, both playing live and recording. With Patreon and you, I hope to grow what I\u0027ve achieved to date.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhats Patreon then?\u003c/strong\u003e When I first looked at Patreon and what it does for artist of all types, it really got me thinking about how much more I could create and share with more people. It\u0027s a simple idea. You like an artist, what they create. You decide to become a Patron of them, with as as little as \u20ac1 per month, you are paying them for what the create, allowing them to grow what they do. Please note you can cancel at any time and are not bound by any contract or to continue being a Patron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eMy vision\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a simple one, I\u0027d like to be able to release some top quality one off runs of Vinyl, CD\u0027 and Merchandise. To be able to continue making videos of not only Original songs, but covers, songs from Films, Games or anything else that you guys would like to see me do.\u003cbr\u003eUltimately if I ever reached the lofty goal of over 4,000 Patrons, I\u0027d love to take what I do on the road with live gigs in the areas that have patroned (is that even a word?) the most.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Rewards\u003c/strong\u003e, whats in it for you guys? Every Patron will get access to all of my videos that I post, which includes a free download of the MP3 of the song in the video. At the moment I have \u00a03 tiers of rewards. The 1st tier is as stated above and opens at \u20ac1 per creation (you can set this to \u20ac1 per month) Tier 2 \u20ac2 per creation, offers all of what you get at below tier, plus behind the scenes vids, extra info on what the songs is about (or means to me if it\u0027s a cover), how I play it. Tier 3 \u20ac5 per creation, offers all of what you get from the below tiers, plus a digital copy of \"Drown the Truth\" my last Autumn Long album. You will also get a digital copy of any new original releases. You also get access to any \"Patron only\" live streams.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll rewards are bound to change and more than likely grow. I will be looking for feedback from you guys as to what you\u0027d like with regards rewards and also what you\u0027d like to see me create. (Please note Rewards will never decrease. Any changes will be notified to you in advance. This will allow you to change tier or even stop at any time)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you again, \u003c/strong\u003eby even listening, watching and sharing what I do you are helping. To all of you who become Patrons of my work, I\u0027m extremely thankful, I look forward to chatting with you all, over the coming months and years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust keep doing what you do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePadraig \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
