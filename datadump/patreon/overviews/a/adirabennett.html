It\u0027s me, 21-year-old artist/writer/student/scientista Adira Bennett, and I am so glad you made it to this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI joined Patreon in March of 2017. In doing so, I hope to: 1, form a community for interaction with my most loyal fans, 2, share my creative processes in addition to finished products, and 3, worry less about money so I can worry more about doing what I love \u2014 creating. I appreciate Patreon because, unlike freelancing, it gives me the chance to pursue all three of these goals. But above all, I appreciate \u003cem\u003eyou,\u003c/em\u003e and let me tell you why:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a young adult living in a world where the costs of college tuition, health care, and rent are sky-high and the job market for students is terrible. I am currently financially dependent on family, working as a nanny, and preparing to return to college full-time in the fall. I want to move toward financial independence, I want my passion-driven production of creative pieces to be valued in the world \u2014 these are my dreams. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e are making my dreams possible. You are rebelling against The Man by saying, \"Hey, I value young artists and writers! I believe that creation is work and that people should be able to support themselves through their work! I believe that painters, accountants, illustrators, teachers, writers, and dental hygienists \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e deserve a shot at sustainable income because they are \u003cem\u003eall \u003c/em\u003edoing valuable stuff!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour faith in me and your investment in my creativity is an honor I seek to uphold by making and sharing the most authentic creative works I possibly can."
