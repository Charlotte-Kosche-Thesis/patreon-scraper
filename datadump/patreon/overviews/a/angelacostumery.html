    "summary": "Hello everyone, and welcome to my Patreon! My name is Angela, I\u0027m a self taught seamstress and designer currently living in NY. I primarily create historical costumes, and tend to favor elaborate or challenging projects. The more ruffles the better, at least in my eyes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been sewing for a little over five years now, and sharing my process online for just as long. So you might be familiar with my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://angelacostumery.com\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/angelaclaytoncostumery\"\u003eyoutube videos\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/angelacostumery/\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://doxiequeen1.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/striped-edwardian-11-of-14.jpg?w=1200\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy most \"popular\" content, by far, are the videos I make. Which consist of tutorials, making of videos, or vlogs showing my process. I really like making videos, but over\u00a0the past few years I\u0027ve become painfully aware that it isn\u0027t the best, or most profitable way for me to spend my time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRecently youtubes algorithm, and adsense rates have really declined. And it\u0027s made wonder whether I should continue make videos at all. Or if I can, considering how much money they lose.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eBut, \u003c/em\u003eit is something I enjoy doing. And it is something I would like to continue doing, and I think there are people out there who would like to see me continue, too.\u00a0Which is why I\u0027ve created a patreon! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve held off on doing this for a long time, since I wanted to make sure I could commit to regularly scheduled content and perks. And right now, I feel confident that I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe perks will include lot\u0027s of exclusive casual content posted on a more regular basis than you\u0027ll see on my youtube channel. Along with early access to videos, credits in videos, prints, swatch cards...and maybe some small patterns and livestreams in the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://doxiequeen1.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/untitled-3.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI recently came up with a new series for my channel, which lends itself well to more frequent uploads, \u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003egives me the opportunity to film lots of bonus content for anyone kind enough to support me here!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis series is called \"Sewing through the Decades\" and consists of me following original vintage patterns, and sharing the whole (sometimes frustrating) process with all of you. I\u0027m really excited about this series, since it fulfills a lot of my most common video requests (vintage inspired projects, and more wearable pieces), as well as my own interests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Ay1Jd-D7VY\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of what happens on patreon, each month I\u0027ll follow *at least* one pattern from a different decade of the 20th century.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, if this is profitable, I\u00a0would love to speed that timeline up and\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003etake on lots of bonus projects, which aren\u0027t necessarily a good representation of the decade they come from, but would be so much fun to make!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://doxiequeen1.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/img_2302.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMost of the patterns I have bought are casual, or workwear in style, since those were the most affordable to buy and this has been mostly self funded. But if this is successful, I could expand this series and follow evening dress patterns, or wedding dresses, or coats, or pajamas! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr take it into a different century, and sew my way through the 1800s...or through a vintage catalog. Or one of Norah Waugh\u0027s books (imagine making a corset from every period, every month)!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(All in addition to other types of content, like vlogs, costume spotlights, \u00a0and tutorials)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://doxiequeen1.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/untitled-5.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m really excited about this, and where this could go, but expanding this would require making enough to cover material costs, and enough beyond that to justify the hours that go into constructing them (and filming the process).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn fact that is the case for pretty much all the video content on my channel. I really need another form of revenue to continue justifying the time it takes to film and edit the videos I put out. I\u0027m hoping patreon can provide that...but if it doesn\u0027t then at least I can say I tried!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for reading, and contributing if you choose to do so! I really appreciate it :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
