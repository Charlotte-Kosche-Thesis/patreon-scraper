Thanks for visiting my Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile everyone starts a page for different projects, we all have one thing in common - the desire to create. I want to write and create content that will shift how people engage with themselves and with one another. Doing this will address the need I feel to harness my creative energy and develop resources for engagement, encounter, and activation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in! I acknowledge that this is work I cannot (and should not) engage in alone so I need your support sharing, resourcing, and otherwise building out my vision.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWords are important because they have the ability to challenge us, affirm us, and remind us that we are not alone.
