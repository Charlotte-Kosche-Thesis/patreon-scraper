We do this because we want you to have the truth, no matter how harsh it might end up sounding. What we are looking to do is to cushion some of the Altered Confusion costs. We\u0027ve been doing this since 2007 and hope to do it for a long time to come. We just need a little help to allow us to cover convention costs that we present panels and have fan tables at. We also want to be able to maintain and improve the equipment we use for our show, interviews, and everything else we might be doing with the website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking some time out, and let\u0027s help each other make people aware of indie projects that deserve the attention of all, and maybe, just maybe we can start to push a change to what we\u0027re seeing from today\u0027s AAA games.\u003cbr\u003e"
