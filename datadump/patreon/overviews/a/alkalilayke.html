    "summary": "Calling all creators, cosplay professionals, cosplay casuals and crafters of the world! This page is for YOU if you want to learn about the whys/hows/whos/whats of cosplay!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! My name is Alkali Layke and I\u0027ve been costuming for almost 13 years, but came out of the \"Cosplay Closet\" in 2014! Honestly, I didn\u0027t even know I was stuck in the closet....because I had no idea that CosPLAY exsisted! What?! How could I not know?! Well, I\u0027m from a small city in Idaho without many conventions, and the conventions that we do have aren\u0027t well publicized. I was in a cosplay black hole. I didin\u0027t even know what I was missing! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little more backstory: I\u0027m a professional hair and makeup artist by trade. One day, I heard that a comic con (Oh my God a real one? Like the one in San Deigo??!!) was coming to Boise. I was one of the earliest to hear about it and quickly emailed the coordinator and asked if he had a makeup artist for their celebrity guests. Guess who got a call back?! Lucky me landed the job and I received a free booth (in return for my celebrity makeup services) to promote my SPFX makeup business. It all felt like I was in the right place at the right time. Also, having the opportunity to do makeup for John Rhys Davies and Big Robbie Archer didn\u0027t hurt! Amazing memories!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Next up was a lesson in bravery, I decided I\u0027d try the scary \"cosplay thing\". EEEEEEP! I created my first cosplay for the event and showed up...totally terrified...in my Steampunk Poison Ivy look. To my amazement, everyone liked it! My one-of-a-kind custom created cosplay received more attention than my makeup booth! People actually thought that I was there as a professional cosplayer! That weekend was monumental for me in personal growth. Have you ever had one of those moments? I suddenly was drawn to something \u003cstrong\u003eSO INTENSELY\u003c/strong\u003e that I couldn\u0027t walk away. Alkali Layke was officially born....OR.....a crafty monster was created. That\u0027s up for you do decide! Bonus points if you get the X-Men Reference. (Something something about a secret military facility....hmmmmm)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow is this page different from other Cosplay Patreon Accounts?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHIS page is primarily tutorial based, meaning that I don\u0027t want to miss out on reaching my FEMALE SUPPORTERS who want to be able to create cosplay magic! Oh don\u0027t worry...there\u0027s still the same fun filled \"fan service type stuffs\" for my male supporters as well. Hell, it\u0027s there for my female supporters too! Cuz...who doesn\u0027t like to look at girls? Sorry dudes, but girls are just pretty--Even girls prefer to look at girls. Not that dudes can\u0027t be pretty...wait...I\u0027m confused....did I digress....I do that...this page is primarily tutorial based. With some FABULOUS printy print PRINTS!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAND\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;SUPER IMPORTANT MESSAGE COMING UP\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Skillz are SkILLz! The lessons and SkILLz learned here are applicable to \u003cstrong\u003eANY\u003c/strong\u003e type of cosplay. I\u0027ll be creating both male/female looks, but don\u0027t get discouraged if you see me create more female looks. Regardless of the cosplay I\u0027m creating you\u0027ll learn to make SMOOTH armor, tight seams, and make your work cohesive. Let me teach you the things! \u003cstrong\u003eAll of the things!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContent will still be provide on my various forms of social media....but this will be in-depth coverage. Shhhhh.......the secret stuffs! Mmmmmwhahahaha!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
