I\u0027m Anon42, and as you can probably tell, I make erotic games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a long history with programming and game design. What kid doesn\u0027t want to make games, after all? Through my lifelong love and study of gaming I\u0027ve grown a pretty solid foundation on design; what makes a game fun, and how to achieve that holy matrimony between art, programming, and design that leads to a truly satisfying gaming experience. Now I\u0027ve decided to combine that with another passion all of us can agree on: porn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Team\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eAnon42 \u003c/b\u003eis myself, and he is me.

After getting started with standalone hentai animations, I felt the need to expand into something more interesting; thus the birth of Crisis Point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/cJgrSc/VIiIEqH.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Crisis Point, you play as headstrong military soldier Alicia (pictured above). In a futuristic world where mankind has gained the knowledge necessary to facilitate space travel, a mysterious, silent virus infects the entirety of the human race. This virus quietly attacks the Y-chromosome in developing infants, causing all children to be born female. Scientists immediately began their efforts to eradicate this unusual infection, knowing that it would mean the slow but inevitable demise of mankind, with no way for future generations to reproduce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter nearly a decade of research, with no solution in sight, it was determined that the cure was unlikely to be found on Earth. Humanity united, pooling together their resources into a massive expedition to search the stars. Teams of scientists and soldiers were sent to various places throughout the galaxy, humankind\u0027s last hope resting on their shoulders.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlicia\u0027s journey begins when communications are abruptly cut off with one of these parties. With reason to believe that a possible cure had been found, she is sent on a small cruiser to this planet to investigate and recover any information she can find, as well as rescue anyone who may still be alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/evpZfx/6tTXJym.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Gameplay\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrisis Point is a heavily Metroidvania-inspired game. The gameplay revolves around exploration and finding new abilities, ranging from an explosive blaster shot to an aerial jump. Powering yourself up will enable you to access new areas and hidden powerups, but with new environments comes new threats, and throughout the adventure you\u0027ll get to see a huge variety of sexual content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur content includes:\u003cbr\u003e-5 unique areas, each with 3 unique enemies and a boss, making for a total of 15 regular enemies and 5 boss fights\u003cbr\u003e-A minimum of 30 unique sprite sex scenes, 2 per enemy, with a high likelihood of even more throughout the storyline\u003cbr\u003e-A minimum of 15 high-resolution CG sequences, one per enemy\u003cbr\u003e-The ability to view those scenes naturally during gameplay, or to unlock them for easy view in the in-game gallery (currently not implemented, but due to be added in the near future)\u003cbr\u003e-Two separate endings based on the amount of sex you have throughout the game, each with minor variations based on your choices and accomplishments throughout the story\u003cbr\u003e-Many unique upgrades, from subweapons that offer utility in combat, mobility upgrades that let Alicia get around easier, to a bunch of blaster upgrades that alter the way your main weapon acts in combat\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/b7Tufx/mNfZdvv.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you donate?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore explaining the benefits of donating to the development of Crisis Point, let me clarify \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e donations will work.\u003cbr\u003eInitially, Crisis Point started out using donations on a Per Update basis. However, after a few months of updates, I had always pulled off exactly one update a month, no more no less. I decided it would make the most sense to continue with that, and I switched the campaign over to a per-month basis under the promise of delivering one game update every month. As development continued, it became substantially more difficult to release content every month while still polishing the game - more recently, with feedback from my patrons, we have transitioned over to a bi-monthly release schedule, to allow us more time to polish both new and old content alike.\u003cbr\u003eWhat this means for you, the patrons, is simple: On the 1st of every month, the amount you choose to donate will be sent to me. As soon as your donation goes through, you\u0027ll have immediate access to any posts I\u0027ve ever made in your chosen tier for the rest of that month! This means that even if you pledge during a month where there is no release, you\u0027ll still get access to last month\u0027s release. If you pledge in the middle of the month, your pledge should be processed soon after, giving you instant access. However, this also means that pledging near the end of a month may lead to you being charged twice (once when you pledge, and then again on the 1st), so keep that in mind!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, you may be asking what I would do with your pledge. Right now, because of the generosity of my patrons, I earn enough through Patreon to live without any other income. However, I\u0027m still just one person; developing a game on your own is exceedingly difficult and time consuming. At this stage, after spending what I need to survive, a large amount of the money left over goes straight back into the game. I have a team of talented people working with me, and the more I can pay them, the more they can work, which not only means more projects and higher quality work, but more frequent updates as well! The more work I can commission from others, the more time I can focus on the aspects of game design I excel at, leading to better, more polished experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, those aren\u0027t the only reasons to donate! Donors will receive exclusive opportunities and information, such as:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlayable updates every other month during development\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatron-exclusive input to determine the direction current and future projects will take\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNotifications of and links to development livestreams\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much to all you fantastic people for showing interest in my work.
