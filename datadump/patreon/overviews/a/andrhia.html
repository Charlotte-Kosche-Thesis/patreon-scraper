    "summary": "Hi! I\u2019m Andrea Phillips, an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://andreaphillips.com\"\u003eauthor and game designer\u003c/a\u003e. I like to make stories\u2014but they don\u2019t all take the form of something you can read or watch from beginning to end. If you\u2019re fancy, you could say I like to experiment with narrative structure and form, with an eye toward creating story archaeology.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut for the rest of us? Let\u2019s just say I like to make bits and pieces from other worlds. Things like, oh,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.deusexmachinatio.com/short-fiction/2011/12/2/circular-logic.html\"\u003ea time traveler\u2019s diary in a Google Calendar\u003c/a\u003e. Or the story of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.deusexmachinatio.com/blog/2015/2/14/the-mckinnon-account\"\u003eyour first day at a new job\u003c/a\u003e. Or the correspondence around\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/2loUlmr\"\u003esome wedding planning gone wrong\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut here\u2019s the problem: a lot of the things I\u2019d love to play with can\u2019t really be sold as short fiction; they can\u2019t be password-locked, can\u2019t be word-counted, can\u2019t be flattened. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI still want to make all of those things, you guys. But it\u2019s hard to justify doing the kinds of work my heart sings for when you know it isn\u2019t going to pay the bills. Because the grocery store doesn\u2019t care how fulfilling I\u2019m finding my creative work when it\u0027s time to pay at the checkout. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u2026And that\u2019s where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSOME EXPECTATION-SETTING\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you are long-time fans of my work and may have some expectations around what kinds of thing I might make. So in the interest of keeping things joyful and harmonious I thought I should make a bunch of things clear up front about what I\u0027ll be doing\u2014or more precisely, what I won\u0027t be doing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, none of the actual things I make will be patron-locked. Please don\u2019t expect exclusivity in the artifacts that I make! That\u0027s part of the problem I\u0027m trying to solve. But rewards like kitten* pics and process videos WILL be locked to various Patreon tiers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSecond, this is not going to be a collection of puzzles or interactive games, though some of the artifacts may have interactive elements. I\u2019m not making alternate reality games! And none of the things I make will take you long to get through. Low commitment is the keyworld. Probably a few minutes for most things; certainly less than an hour.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally, not everything I make will be NEW and INNOVATIVE. One of the things I\u2019m most interested in, creatively, is iteration. So yes, I made a story in a Google Calendar once before. But can I make a better one? A more interesting one? What kinds of stories can you tell in the shape of a survey? How far can you push a simple email autoresponder?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey, why don\u2019t we find out together? :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWAIT WHY IS THERE AN ASTERISK BY \"KITTEN\"\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, the thing about Tabitha is. Um. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eShe\u2019s an unusual breed. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou\u2019ll see.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027M NOT SURE...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey, that\u0027s OK, not all of us have so many dollars to spare. If you\u0027re not ready to commit but you still want to hear about it when I make new stuff,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://eepurl.com/jSPvH\"\u003ejoin my mailing list\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027ll let you know. \u0026lt;3 (Just... not as soon as my patrons!) And thanks for your time and attention!"
